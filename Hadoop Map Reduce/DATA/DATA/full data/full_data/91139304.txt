automobile around from the garage and seated herself at the wheel it was her habit to refresh her mind and improve her health by a daily drive between the hours of two and four in the afternoon  the world knows little of its greatest women and it is possible that mrs porters name is not familiar to you if this is the case i am pained but not surprised it happens only too often that the uplifter of the public mind is baulked by a disinclination on the part of the public mind to meet him or her halfway the uplifter does his share he produces the uplifting book but the public instead of standing still to be uplifted wanders off to browse on coloured supplements and magazine stories  if you are ignorant of lora delane porters books that is your affair perhaps you are more to be pitied than censured nature probably gave you the wrong shape of forehead mrs porter herself would have put it down to some atavistic tendency or prenatal influence she put most things down to that she blamed nearly all the defects of the modern world from weak intellects to ingrowing toenails on longdead ladies and gentlemen who safe in the family vault imagined that they had established their alibi she subpoenaed grandfathers and even greatgrandfathers to give evidence to show that the reason twentiethcentury willie squinted or had to spend his winters in arizona was their own shocking health way back in the days beyond recall  mrs porters mind worked backward and forward she had one eye on the past the other on the future if she was strong on heredity she was stronger on the future of the race most of her published works dealt with this subject a careful perusal of them would have enabled the rising generation to select its ideal wife or husband with perfect ease and in the event of heaven blessing the union her little volume entitled the hygienic care of the baby which was all about germs and how to avoid them would have insured the continuance of the direct succession  unfortunately the rising generation did not seem disposed to a careful perusal of anything except the baseball scores and the beauty hints in the sunday papers and mrs porters public was small in fact her only real disciple as she sometimes told herself in her rare moods of discouragement was her niece ruth bannister daughter of john bannister the millionaire it was not so long ago she reflected with pride that she had induced ruth to refuse to marry basil milbanka considerable feat he being a young man of remarkable personal attractions and a great match in every way mrs porters objection to him was that his father had died believing to the last that he was a teapot  there is nothing evil or degrading in believing oneself a teapot but it argues a certain inaccuracy of the thought processes and mrs porter had used all her influence with ruth to make her reject basil it was her success that first showed her how great that influence was she had come now to look on ruths destiny as something for which she was personally responsiblea fact which was noted and resented by others in particular ruths brother bailey who regarded his aunt with a dislike and suspicion akin to that which a stray dog feels towards the boy who saunters towards him with a tin can in his hand  to bailey his strongminded relative was a perpetual menace a sort of perambulating yellow peril and the fact that she often alluded to him as a worm consolidated his distaste for her                                       mrs porter released the clutch and set out on her drive she rarely had a settled route for these outings of hers preferring to zigzag about new york livening up the great city at random she always drove herself and having like a good suffragist a contempt for male prohibitions took an honest pleasure in exceeding a manmade speed limit  one hesitates to apply the term joyrider to so eminent a leader of contemporary thought as the authoress of the dawn of better things principles of selection and what of tomorrow but candour compels the admission that she was a somewhat reckless driver perhaps it was due to some atavistic tendency one of her ancestors may have been a roman charioteer or a coachracing maniac of the regency days at any rate after a hard mornings work on her new book she felt that her mind needed cooling and found that the rush of air against her face effected this satisfactorily the greater the rush the quicker the cooling however as the alert inhabitants of manhattan island a hardy race trained from infancy to dodge taxicabs and ambulance wagons had always removed themselves from her path with their usual agility she had never yet had an accident  but then she had never yet met george pennicut and george pawn of fate was even now waiting round the corner to upset her record  george man of all work to kirk winfield one of the youngest and least efficient of new yorks artist colony was english he had been in america some little time but not long enough to accustom his rather unreceptive mind to the fact that whereas in his native land vehicles kept to the left in the country of his adoption they kept to the right and it was still his boneheaded practice when stepping off the sidewalk to keep a wary lookout in precisely the wrong direction  the only problem with regard to such a man is who will get him first fate had decided that it should be lora delane porter  today mrs porter having circled the park in rapid time turned her car down central park west she was feeling much refreshed by the pleasant air she was conscious of a glow of benevolence toward her species not excluding even the young couple she had almost reduced to mincemeat in the neighbourhood of ninetyseventh street they had annoyed her extremely at the time of their meeting by occupying till the last possible moment a part of the road which she wanted herself  on reaching sixtyfirst street she found her way blocked by a lumbering delivery wagon she followed it slowly for a while then growing tired of being merely a unit in a procession tugged at the steeringwheel and turned to the right  george pennicut his anxious eyes raking the middle distanceas usual in the wrong directionhad just stepped off the kerb he received the automobile in the small of the back uttered a yell of surprise and dismay performed a few improvised texas tommy steps and fell in a heap  in a situation which might have stimulated another to fervid speech george pennicut contented himself with saying goo he was a man of few words  mrs porter stopped the car from all points of the compass citizens began to assemble many swallowing their chewinggum in their excitement one a devout believer in the inscrutable ways of providence told a friend as he ran that only two minutes before he had almost robbed himself of this spectacle by going into a movingpicture palace  mrs porter was annoyed she had never run over anything before except a few chickens and she regarded the incident as a blot on her escutcheon she was incensed with this idiot who had flung himself before her car not reflecting in her heat that he probably had a prenatal tendency to this sort of thing inherited from some ancestor who had played last across in front of hansom cabs in the streets of london  she bent over george and passed experienced hands over his portly form for this remarkable woman was as competent at first aid as at anything else the citizens gathered silently round in a circle  it was your fault she said to her victim severely i accept no liability whatever i did not run into you you ran into me i have a jolly good mind to have you arrested for attempted suicide  this aspect of the affair had not struck mr pennicut presented to him in these simple words it checked the recriminatory speech which his mind having recovered to some extent from the first shock of the meeting he had intended to deliver he swallowed his words awed he felt dazed and helpless mrs porter had that effect upon men  some more citizens arrived  no bones broken reported mrs porter concluding her examination you are exceedingly fortunate you have a few bruises and one knee is slightly wrenched nothing to signify more frightened than hurt where do you live  there said george meekly  where  them studios  no 90  yes maam georges voice was that of a crushed worm  are you an artist  no maam im mr winfields man  whose  mr winfields maam  is he in  yes maam  ill fetch him and if the policeman comes along and wants to know why youre lying there mind you tell him the truth that you ran into me  yes maam  very well dont forget  no maam  she crossed the street and rang the bell over which was a card hearing the name of kirk winfield mr pennicut watched her in silence  mrs porter pressed the button a second time somebody came at a leisurely pace down the passage whistling cheerfully the door opened  it did not often happen to lora delane porter to feel insignificant least of all in the presence of the opposite sex she had welldefined views upon man yet in the interval which elapsed between the opening of the door and her first words a certain sensation of smallness overcame her  the man who had opened the door was not judged by any standard of regularity of features handsome he had a rather boyish face pleasant eyes set wide apart and a friendly mouth he was rather an outsize in young men and as he stood there he seemed to fill the doorway  it was this sense of bigness that he conveyed his cleanness his magnificent fitness that for the moment overcame mrs porter physical fitness was her gospel she stared at him in silent appreciation  to the young man however her forceful gaze did not convey this quality she seemed to him to be looking as if she had caught him in the act of endeavouring to snatch her purse he had been thrown a little off his balance by the encounter  resource in moments of crisis is largely a matter of preparedness and a man who having opened his door in the expectation of seeing a gingerhaired bowlegged grinning george pennicut is confronted by a masterful woman with eyes like gimlets may be excused for not guessing that her piercing stare is an expression of admiration and respect  mrs porter broke the silence it was ever her way to come swiftly to the matter in hand  mr kirk winfield  yes  have you in your employment a redhaired congenital idiot who ambles about new york in an absentminded way as if he were on a desert island the man i refer to is a short stout englishman cleanshaven dressed in black  that sounds like george pennicut  i have no doubt that that is his name i did not inquire it did not interest me my name is mrs lora delane porter this man of yours has just run into my automobile  i beg your pardon  i cannot put it more lucidly i was driving along the street when this weakminded person flung himself in front of my car he is out there now kindly come and help him in  is he hurt  more frightened than hurt i have examined him his left knee appears to be slightly wrenched  kirk winfield passed a hand over his left forehead and followed her like george he found mrs porter a trifle overwhelming  out in the street george pennicut now the centre of quite a substantial section of the four million was causing a granitefaced policeman to think that the age of miracles had returned by informing him that the accident had been his fault and no others he greeted the reliefparty with a wan grin  just broke my leg sir he announced to kirk  you have done nothing of the sort said mrs porter you have wrenched your knee very slightly have you explained to the policeman that it was entirely your fault  yes maam  thats right always speak the truth  yes maam  mr winfield will help you indoors  thank you maam  she turned to kirk  now mr winfield  kirk bent over the victim gripped him and lifted him like a baby  hes got his observed one interested spectator  i should worry agreed another all broken up  nothing of the kind said mrs porter severely the man is hardly hurt at all be more accurate in your remarks  she eyed the speaker sternly he wilted  yes maam he mumbled sheepishly  the policeman with that lionlike courage which makes the new york constabulary what it is endeavoured to assert himself at this point  hey he boomed  mrs porter turned her gaze upon him her cold steely gaze  i beg your pardon  this wont do maam ive me report to make how did this happen  you have already been informed the man ran into my automobile  but  i shall not charge him  she turned and followed kirk  but say the policemans voice was now almost plaintive  mrs porter ignored him and disappeared into the house the policeman having gulped several times in a disconsolate way relieved his feelings by dispersing the crowd with welldirected prods of his locust stick a small boy who lingered squeezing the automobiles hooter in a sort of trance he kicked the boy vanished the crowd melted the policeman walked slowly toward ninth avenue peace reigned in the street  put him to bed said mrs porter as kirk laid his burden on a couch in the studio you seem exceedingly muscular mr winfield i noticed that you carried him without an effort he is a stout man too grossly out of condition like ninetynine per cent of men today  im not so young as i was maam protested george when i was in the harmy i was a fine figure of a man  the more shame to you that you have allowed yourself to deteriorate commented mrs porter beer  a grateful smile irradiated georges face  thank you maam its very kind of you maam i dont mind if i do  the man appears a perfect imbecile said mrs porter turning abruptly to kirk i ask him if he attributes his physical decay to beer and he babbles  i think he thought you were offering him a drink suggested kirk as a matter of fact a little brandy wouldnt hurt him after the shock he has had  on no account the worst thing possible  this isnt your lucky day george said kirk well i guess ill phone to the doctor  quite unnecessary  i beg your pardon  entirely unnecessary i have made an examination there is practically nothing the matter with the man put him to bed and let him sponge his knee with warm water  are you a doctor mrs porter  i have studied first aid  well i think if you dont mind i should like to have your opinion confirmed  this was rank mutiny mrs porter stared haughtily at kirk he met her gaze with determination  as you please she snapped  thank you said kirk i dont want to take any risks with george i couldnt afford to lose him there arent any more like him theyve mislaid the pattern  he went to the telephone  mrs porter watched him narrowly she was more than ever impressed by the perfection of his physique she appraised his voice as he spoke to the doctor it gave evidence of excellent lungs he was a wonderfully perfect physical specimen  an idea concerning this young man came into her mind startling as all great ideas are at birth the older it grew the more she approved of it she decided to put a few questions to him she had a habit of questioning people and it never occurred to her that they might resent it if it had occurred to her she would have done it just the same she was like that  mr winfield  yes  i should like to ask you a few questions  this woman delighted kirk  please do he said  mrs porter scanned him closely  you are an extraordinarily healthy man to all appearances have you ever suffered from bad health  measles  immaterial  very unpleasant though  nothing else  mumps  unimportant  not to me i looked like a watermelon  nothing besides no serious illnesses  none  what is your age  twentyfive  are your parents living  no  were they healthy  fit as fiddles  and your grandparents  perfect bearcats i remember my grandfather at the age of about a hundred or something like that spanking me for breaking his pipe i thought it was a steamhammer he was a wonderfully muscular old gentleman  excellent  by the way said kirk casually my life is insured  very sensible there has been no serious illness in your family at all then as far as you know  i could hunt up the records if you like but i dont think so  consumption no cancer no as far as you are aware nothing very satisfactory  im glad youre pleased  are you married  good lord no  at your age you should be with your magnificent physique and remarkable record of health it is your duty to the future of the race to marry  im not sure ive been worrying much about the future of the race  no man does it is the crying evil of the day mens selfish absorption in the present their utter lack of a sense of duty with regard to the future have you read my dawn of better things  im afraid i read very few novels  it is not a novel it is a treatise on the need for implanting a sense of personal duty to the future of the race in the modern young man  it sounds a crackerjack i must get it  i will send you a copy at the same time i will send you my principles of selection and what of tomorrow they will make you think  i bet they will thank you very much  and now said mrs porter switching the conversation to the gaping george you had better put this man to bed  george pennicuts opinion of mrs porter to which he was destined to adhere on closer acquaintance may be recorded  a hawful woman sir he whispered as kirk bore him off  nonsense george said kirk one of the most entertaining ladies i have ever met already i love her like a son but how she escaped from bloomingdale beats me theres been carelessness somewhere  the bedrooms attached to the studio opened off the gallery that ran the length of the east wall looking over the edge of the gallery before coming downstairs kirk perceived his visitor engaged in a tour of the studio at that moment she was examining his masterpiece ariadne in naxos he had called it that because that was what it had turned into  at the beginning he had had no definite opinion as to its identity it was rather a habit with his pictures to start out in a vague spirit of adventure and receive their label on completion he had an airy and a dashing way in his dealings with the goddess art  nevertheless he had sufficient of the artist soul to resent the fact that mrs porter was standing a great deal too close to the masterpiece to get its full value  you want to stand back a little he suggested over the rail  mrs porter looked up  oh there you are she said  yes here i am agreed kirk affably  is this yours  it is  you painted it  i did  it is poor it shows a certain feeling for colour but the drawing is weak said mrs porter for this wonderful woman was as competent at art criticism as at automobile driving and first aid where did you study  in paris if you could call it studying im afraid i was not the model pupil  kindly come down you are giving me a crick in the neck  kirk descended he found mrs porter still regarding the masterpiece with an unfavourable eye  yes she said the drawing is decidedly weak  i shouldnt wonder assented kirk the dealers to whom ive tried to sell it have not said that in so many words but theyve all begged me with tears in their eyes to take the darned thing away so i guess youre right  do you depend for a living on the sale of your pictures  thank heaven no im the only artist in captivity with a private income  a large income  tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough twill serve all told about five thousand iron men per annum  iron men  bones  bones  i should have said dollars  you should i detest slang  sorry said kirk  mrs porter resumed her tour of the studio she was interrupted by the arrival of the doctor a cheerful little old man with the bearing of one sure of his welcome he was an old friend of kirks  well whats the trouble i couldnt come sooner i was visiting a case i work  there is no trouble said mrs porter the doctor spun round startled in the dimness of the studio he had not perceived her mr winfields servant has injured his knee very superficially there is practically nothing wrong with him i have made a thorough examination  the doctor looked from one to the other  is the case in other hands he asked  you bet it isnt said kirk mrs porter just looked in for a family chat and a glimpse of my pictures youll find george in bed first floor on the left upstairs and a very remarkable sight he is he is wearing red hair with purple pyjamas why go abroad when you have not yet seen the wonders of your native land                                       that night lora delane porter wrote in the diary which with that magnificent freedom from human weakness that marked every aspect of her life she kept all the year round instead of only during the first week in january  this is what she wrote  worked steadily on my book it progresses in the afternoon an annoying occurrence an imbecile with red hair placed himself in front of my automobile fortunately without serious injury to the machinethough the sudden application of the brake cannot be good for the tyres out of evil however came good for i have made the acquaintance of his employer a mr winfield an artist mr winfield is a man of remarkable physique i questioned him narrowly and he appears thoroughly sound as to his mental attainments i cannot speak so highly but all men are fools and mr winfield is not more so than most i have decided that he shall marry my dear ruth they will make a magnificent pair     chapter ii  ruth states her intentions   at about the time when lora delane porter was crossexamining kirk winfield bailey bannister left his club hurriedly  inside the club a sad rabbitfaced young gentleman who had been unburdening his soul to bailey was seeking further consolation in an amber drink with a cherry at the bottom of it for this young man was one of natures cherrychasers it was the only thing he did really well his name was grayling his height five feet three his socks pink and his income enormous  so much for grayling he is of absolutely no importance either to the world or to this narrative except in so far that the painful story he has been unfolding to bailey bannister has so wrought upon that exquisite as to send him galloping up fifth avenue at five miles an hour in search of his sister ruth  let us now examine bailey he is a faultlessly dressed young man of about twentyseven who takes it as a compliment when people think him older his mouth at present gaping with agitation and the unwonted exercise is as a rule primly closed his eyes peering through goldrimmed glasses protrude slightly giving him something of the dumb pathos of a codfish  his hair is pale and scanty his nose sharp and narrow he is a junior partner in the firm of bannister  son and it is his unalterable conviction that if his father would only give him a chance he could show wall street some high finance that would astonish it  the afternoon was warm the sun beat down on the avenue bailey had not gone two blocks before it occurred to him that swifter and more comfortable progress could be made in a taxicab than on his admirably trousered legs no more significant proof of the magnitude of his agitation could be brought forward than the fact that he had so far forgotten himself as to walk at all he hailed a cab and gave the address of a house on the upper avenue  he leaned back against the cushions trying to achieve a coolness of mind and body but the heat of the day kept him unpleasantly soluble and dismay that perspiration of the soul refused to be absorbed by the pockethandkerchief of philosophy  bailey bannister was a young man who considered the minding of other peoples business a duty not to be shirked life is a rocky road for such his motto was let me do it he fussed about the affairs of bannister  son he fussed about the welfare of his friends at the club especially he fussed about his only sister ruth  he looked on himself as a sort of guardian to ruth their mother had died when they were children and old mr bannister was indifferently equipped with the paternal instinct he was absorbed body and soul in the business of the firm he lived practically a hermit life in the great house on fifth avenue and if it had not been for bailey so bailey considered ruth would have been allowed to do just whatever she pleased there were those who said that this was precisely what she did despite brother bailey  it is a hard world for a conscientious young man of twentyseven  bailey paid the cab and went into the house it was deliciously cool in the hall and for a moment peace descended on him but the distant sound of a piano in the upper regions ejected it again by reminding him of his mission he bounded up the stairs and knocked at the door of his sisters private den  the piano stopped as he entered and the girl on the musicstool glanced over her shoulder  well bailey she said you look warm  i am warm said bailey in an aggrieved tone he sat down solemnly  i want to speak to you ruth  ruth shut the piano and caused the musicstool to revolve till she faced him  well she said  ruth bannister was an extraordinarily beautiful girl a daughter of the gods divinely tall and most divinely fair from her mother she had inherited the dark eyes and ivory complexion which went so well with her mass of dark hair from her father a chin of peculiar determination and perfect teeth her body was strong and supple she radiated health  to her friends ruth was a source of perplexity it was difficult to understand her in the set in which she moved girls married young yet season followed season and ruth remained single and this so obviously of her own free will that the usual explanation of such a state of things broke down as soon as it was tested  in shoals during her first two seasons and lately with less unanimity men of every condition from a princesomewhat battered but still a princeto the bannisters english butlera good man but at the moment under the influence of tawny port had laid their hearts at her feet one and all they had been compelled to pick them up and take them elsewhere she was generally kind on these occasions but always very firm the determined chin gave no hope that she might yield to importunity the eyes that backed up the message of the chin were pleasant but inflexible  generally it was with a feeling akin to relief that the rejected when time had begun to heal the wound contemplated their position there was something about this girl they decided which no fellow could understand she frightened them she made them feel that their hands were large and red and their minds weak and empty she was waiting for something what it was they did not know but it was plain that they were not it and off they went to live happily ever after with girls who ate candy and read bestsellers and ruth went on her way cool and watchful and mysterious waiting  the room which ruth had taken for her own gave like all rooms when intelligently considered a clue to the character of its owner it was the only room in the house furnished with any taste or simplicity the furniture was exceedingly expensive but did not look so the keynote of the colourscheme was green and white all round the walls were books except for a few prints there were no pictures and the only photograph visible stood in a silver frame on a little table  it was the portrait of a woman of about fifty squarejawed tightlipped who stared almost threateningly out of the frame exceedingly handsome but to the ordinary male too formidable to be attractive on this was written in a bold hand bristling with emphatic downstrokes and wholly free from feminine flourish to my dear ruth from her aunt lora and below the signature in what printers call quotes a line that was evidently an extract from somebodys published works bear the torch and do not falter  bailey inspected this photograph with disfavour it always irritated him the information conveyed to him by amused friends that his aunt lora had once described ruth as a jewel in a dustbin seemed to him to carry an offensive innuendo directed at himself and the rest of the dwellers in the bannister home also she had called him a worm also again his actual encounters with the lady though few had been memorably unpleasant furthermore he considered that she had far too great an influence on ruth and lastly that infernal sentence about the torch which he found perfectly meaningless had a habit of running in his head like a catchphrase causing him the keenest annoyance  he pursed his lips disapprovingly and averted his eyes  dont sniff at aunt lora bailey said ruth ive had to speak to you about that before whats the matter what has sent you flying up here  i have had a shock said bailey i have been very greatly disturbed i have just been speaking to clarence grayling  he eyed her accusingly through his goldrimmed glasses she remained tranquil  and what had clarence to say  a great many things  i gather he told you i had refused him  if it were only that  ruth rapped the piano sharply  bailey she said wake up either get to the point or go or read a book or do some tatting or talk about something else you know perfectly well that i absolutely refuse to endure your impressive manner i believe when people ask you the time you look pained and important and make a mystery of it whats troubling you i should have thought clarence would have kept quiet about insulting me but apparently he has no sense of shame  bailey gaped bailey was shocked and alarmed  insulting you what do you mean clarence is a gentleman he is incapable of insulting a woman  is he he told me i was a suitable wife for a wretched dwarf with the miserably inadequate intelligence which nature gave him reduced to practically a minus quantity by alcohol at least he implied it he asked me to marry him  i have just left him at the club he is very upset  i should imagine so a soft smile played over ruths face i spoke to clarence i explained things to him i lit up clarences little mind like a searchlight  bailey rose tremulous with just wrath  you spoke to him in a way that i can only call outrageous and improper anderoutrageous  he paced the room with agitated strides ruth watched him calmly  if the overflowing emotion of a giant soul in torment makes you knock over a table or smash a chair she said i shall send the bill for repairs to you you had far better sit down and talk quietly what is worrying you bailey  is it nothing demanded her brother that my sister should have spoken to a man as you spoke to clarence grayling  with an impassioned gesture he sent a flowervase crashing to the floor  i told you so said ruth pick up the bits and dont let the water spoil the carpet use your handkerchief i should say that that would cost you about six dollars dear why will you let yourself be so temperamental now let me try and think what it was i said to clarence as far as i can remember it was the mere a b c of eugenics  bailey on his knees picking up broken glass raised a flushed and accusing face  ah eugenics you admit it  i think went on ruth placidly i asked him what sort of children he thought we were likely to have if we married  a nice girl ought not to think about such things  i dont think about anything else much a woman cant do a great deal even nowadays but she can have a conscience and feel that she owes something to the future of the race she can feel that it is her duty to bring fine children into the world as aunt lora says she can carry the torch and not falter  bailey shied like a startled horse at the hated phrase he pointed furiously at the photograph of the great thinker  youre talking like thatthat damned woman  bailey precious you mustnt use such wicked wicked words  bailey rose pink and wrathful  if youre going to break another vase said ruth you will really have to go  ever since thatthat cried bailey ever since aunt lora  ruth smiled indulgently  thats more like my little man she said he knows as well as i do how wrong it is to swear  be quiet ever since aunt lora got hold of you i say you have become a sort of gramophone spouting her opinions  but what sensible opinions  its got to stop aunt lora my god who is she just look at her record she disgraces the family by marrying a grubby newspaper fellow called porter he has the sense to die i will say that for him she thrusts herself into public notice by a series of books and speeches on subjects of which a decent woman ought to know nothing and now she gets hold of you fills you up with her disgusting nonsense makes a sort of disciple of you gives you absurd ideas poisons your mind anderer  bailey this is positive eloquence  its got to stop its bad enough in her but every one knows she is crazy and makes allowances but in a young girl like you  he choked  in a young girl like me prompted ruth in a low tragic voice  itits not right itits not proper he drew a long breath its all wrong its got to stop  hes perfectly wonderful murmured ruth he just opens his mouth and the words come out but i knew he was somebody directly i saw him by his forehead like a dome bailey mopped the dome  perhaps you dont know it he said but youre getting yourself talked about you go about saying perfectly impossible things to people you wont marry you have refused nearly every friend i have  ruth shuddered  your friends are awful bailey they are all turned out on a pattern like a flock of sheep they bleat they have all got little narrow faces without chins or big fat faces without foreheads ugh  none of them good enough for you is that it  not nearly  emotion rendered baileyfor himalmost vulgar  i guess you hate yourself he snapped  no sir beamed ruth i think im perfectly beautiful  bailey grunted ruth came to him and gave him a sisterly kiss she was very fond of bailey though she declined to reverence him  cheer up bailey boy she said dont you worry yourself theres a method in my madness ill find him sooner or later and then youll be glad i waited  him what do you mean  why him of course the ideal young man thats whoor is it whomim waiting for bailey shall i tell you something youre so scarlet alreadypoor boy you ought not to rush around in this hot weatherthat it wont make you blush its this im ambitious i mean to marry the finest man in the world and have the greatest little old baby you ever dreamed of by the way now i remember i told clarence that  bailey uttered a strangled exclamation  it has made you blush you turned purple well now you know i mean my baby to be the most splendid baby that was ever born hes going to be strong and straight and clever and handsome andoh everything else you can think of thats why im waiting for the ideal young man if i dont find him i shall die an old maid but i shall find him we may pass each other on fifth avenue we may sit next each other at a theatre wherever it is i shall just reach right out and grab him and whisk him away and if hes married already hell have to get a divorce and i shant care who he is he may be any one i dont mind if hes a ribbon clerk or a prizefighter or a policeman or a cabdriver so long as hes the right man  bailey plied the handkerchief on his streaming forehead the heat of the day and the horror of this conversation were reducing his weight at the rate of ounces a minute in his most jaundiced mood he had never imagined these frightful sentiments to be lurking in ruths mind  you cant mean that he cried  i mean every word of it said ruth i hope for your sake he wont turn out to be a waiter or a prizefighter but it wont make any difference to me  youre crazy  well just now you said aunt lora was if she is i am  i knew it i said she had been putting these ghastly ideas into your head id like to strangle that woman  dont you try have you ever felt aunt loras biceps its like a mans she does dumbbells every morning  ive a good mind to speak to father somebodys got to make you stop this insanity  just as you please but you know how father hates to be worried about things that dont concern business  bailey did his father of whom he stood in the greatest awe was very little interested in any subject except the financial affairs of the firm of bannister  son it required greater courage than bailey possessed to place this matter before him he had an uneasy feeling that ruth knew it  i would if it were necessary he said but i dont believe youre serious  stick to that idea as long as ever you can bailey dear said ruth it will comfort you     chapter iii  the mates meet   kirk winfield was an amiable if rather weak young man with whom life for twentyfive years had dealt kindly he had perfect health an income more than sufficient for his needs a profession which interested without monopolizing him a thoroughly contented disposition and the happy knack of surrounding himself with friends  that he had to contribute to the support of the majority of these friends might have seemed a drawback to some men kirk did not object to it in the least he had enough money to meet their needs and being a sociable person who enjoyed mixing with all sorts and conditions of men he found the liberty hall regime pleasant  he liked to be a magnet attracting new yorks bohemian population if he had his preferences among the impecunious crowd who used the studio as a chapel of ease strolling in when it pleased them drinking his whisky smoking his cigarettes borrowing his money and on occasion his spare bedrooms and his pyjamas he never showed it he was fully as pleasant to percy shanklyn the elegant perpetually resting english actor whom he disliked as far as he was capable of disliking any one as he was to hank jardine the prospector and hanks prizefighter friend steve dingle both of whom he liked enormously  it seemed to him sometimes that he had drifted into the absolutely ideal life he lived entirely in the present the passage of time left him untouched day followed day week followed week and nothing seemed to change he was never unhappy never ill never bored  he would get up in the morning with the comfortable knowledge that the day held no definite duties george pennicut would produce one of his excellent breakfasts the next milestone would be the arrival of steve dingle five brisk rounds with steve a cold bath and a rubdown took him pleasantly on to lunch after which it amused him to play at painting  there was always something to do when he wearied of that until almost before the day had properly begun up came george with one of his celebrated dinners and then began the incursion of his friends one by one they would drop in making themselves very much at home to help their host through till bedtime and another day would slip into the past  it never occurred to kirk that he was wasting his life he had no ambitions ambition is born of woman and no woman that he had ever met had ever stirred him deeply he had never been in love and he had come to imagine that he was incapable of anything except a mild liking for women he considered himself immune and was secretly glad of it he enjoyed his goasyouplease existence too much to want to have it upset he belonged in fact to the type which when the moment arrives falls in love very suddenly very violently and for all time  nothing could have convinced him of this he was like a child lighting matches in a powdermagazine when the idea of marriage crossed his mind he thrust it from him with a kind of shuddering horror he could not picture to himself a woman who could compensate him for the loss of his freedom and still less of his friends  his friends were mens men he could not see them fitting into a scheme of life that involved the perpetual presence of a hostess hank jardine for instance to kirk the great point about hank was that he had been everywhere seen everything and was when properly stimulated with tobacco and drink a fountain of reminiscence but he could not talk unless he had his coat off and his feet up on the back of a chair no hostess could be expected to relish that  hank was a bachelors friend he did not belong in a married household the abstract wife could not be reconciled to him and kirk loving hank like a brother firmly dismissed the abstract wife  he came to look upon himself as a confirmed bachelor he had thought out the question of marriage in all its aspects and decided against it he was the strong man who knew his own mind and could not be shaken  yet on the afternoon of the day following mrs lora delane porters entry into his life kirk sat in the studio feeling for the first time in recent years a vague discontent he was uneasy almost afraid the slight dislocation in the smoothworking machinery of his existence caused by the compulsory retirement of george pennicut had made him thoroughly uncomfortable with discomfort had come introspection and with introspection this uneasiness that was almost fear  a man living alone without money troubles to worry him sinks inevitably into a routine fatted ease is good for no one it sucks the soul out of a man kirk as he sat smoking in the cool dusk of the studio was wondering almost in a panic whether all was well with himself  this mild domestic calamity had upset him so infernally it could not be right that so slight a change in his habits should have such an effect upon him george had been so little hurtthe doctor gave him a couple of days before complete recoverythat it had not seemed worth while to kirk to engage a substitute it was simpler to go out for his meals and make his own bed and it was the realization that this alteration in his habits had horribly disturbed and unsettled him that was making kirk subject himself now to an examination of quite unusual severity  he hated softness physically he kept himself always in perfect condition had he become spiritually flabby certainly this unexpected call on his energies would appear to have found him unprepared it spoiled his whole day knowing when he got out of bed in the morning that he must hunt about and find his food instead of sitting still and having it brought to him it frightened him to think how set he had become  fortyeight hours ago he would have scorned the suggestion that he coddled himself he would have produced as evidence to the contrary his cold baths his exercises his bouts with steve dingle today he felt less confidence for all his baths and boxing the fact remained that he had become at the age of twentysix such a slave to habit that a very trifling deviation from settled routine had been enough to poison life for him  bachelors have these black moments and it is then that the abstract wife comes into her own to kirk brooding in the dusk the figure of the abstract wife seemed to grow less formidable the fact that she might not get on with hank jardine of less importance  the revolutionary thought that life was rather a bore and would become more and more of a bore as the years went on unless he had some one to share it with crept into his mind and stayed there  he shivered these were unpleasant thoughts and in his hour of clear vision he knew whence they came they were entirely due to the knowledge that instead of sitting comfortably at home he would be compelled in a few short hours to go out and get dinner at some restaurant to such a pass had he come in the twentysixth year of his life  once the gods have marked a bachelor down they give him few chances of escape it was when kirks mood was at its blackest and the figure of the abstract wife had ceased to be a menace and become a shining angel of salvation that lora delane porter with ruth bannister at her side rang the studio bell  kirk went to the door he hoped it was a tradesman he feared it was a friend in his present state of mind he had no use for friends when he found himself confronting mrs porter he became momentarily incapable of speech it had not entered his mind that she would pay him a second visit possibly it was joy that rendered him dumb  good afternoon mr winfield said mrs porter i have come to inquire after the man pennicut ruth this is mr winfield mr winfield my niece miss bannister  and kirk perceived for the first time that his visitor was not alone in the shadow behind her a girl was standing he stood aside to let mrs porter pass and ruth came into the light  if there are degrees in speechlessness kirks aphasia became doubled and trebled at the sight of her it seemed to him that he went all to pieces as if he had received a violent blow curious physical changes were taking place in him his legs which only that morning he had looked upon as eminently muscular he now discovered to be composed of some curiously unstable jelly  he also perceiveda fact which he had never before suspectedthat he had heartdisease his lungs too were in poor condition he found it practically impossible to breathe the violent trembling fit which assailed him he attributed to general organic weakness  he gaped at ruth  ruth outwardly remained unaffected by the meeting but inwardly she was feeling precisely the same sensation of smallness which had come to mrs porter on her first meeting with kirk if this sensation had been novel to mrs porter it was even stranger to ruth  to think humbly of herself was an experience that seldom happened to her she was perfectly aware that her beauty was remarkable even in a city of beautiful women and it was rarely that she permitted her knowledge of that fact to escape her her beauty to her was a natural phenomenon impossible to overlook the realization of it did not obtrude itself into her mind it simply existed subconsciously  yet for an instant it ceased to exist she was staggered by a sense of inferiority  it lasted but a pinpoint of time this riotous upheaval of her nature she recovered herself so swiftly that kirk busy with his own emotions had no suspicion of it  a moment later he too was himself again he was conscious of feeling curiously uplifted and thrilled as if the world had suddenly become charged with ozone and electricity and for some reason he felt capable of great feats of muscle and energy but the aphasia had left him and he addressed himself with a clear brain to the task of entertaining his visitors  george is better today he reported  he never was bad said mrs porter succinctly  he doesnt think so  possibly not he is hopelessly weakminded  ruth laughed kirk thrilled at the sound  poor george she observed  dont waste your sympathy my dear said mrs porter that he is injured at all is his own fault for years he has allowed himself to become gross and flabby with the result that the collision did damage which it would not have done to a man in hard condition you mr winfield she added turning abruptly to kirk would scarcely have felt it but then you went on mrs porter are in good condition cold baths  i beg your pardon  do you take cold baths  i do  do you do swedish exercises  i go through a series of evolutions every morning with the utmost loathing i started them as a boy and they have become a habit like dramdrinking i would leave them off if i could but i cant  do nothing of the kind they are invaluable  but undignified  let me feel your biceps mr winfield said mrs porter she nodded approvingly like iron she poised a finger and ran a meditative glance over his form kirk eyed her apprehensively the finger darted forward and struck home in the region of the third waistcoat button wonderful she exclaimed ruth  yes aunt  prod mr winfield where my finger is pointing he is extraordinarily muscular  i say really protested kirk he was a modest young man and this exploration of his more intimate anatomy by the fingertips of the girl he loved was not to be contemplated  just as you please said mrs porter if i were a man of your physique i should be proud of it  wouldnt you like to go up and see george asked kirk it was hard on george but it was imperative that this woman be removed somehow  very well i have brought him a little book to read which will do him good it is called elementary rules for the preservation of the body  he has learned one of them all right since yesterday said kirk not to walk about in front of automobiles  the rules i refer to are mainly concerned with diet and wholesome exercise explained mrs porter careful attention to them may yet save him his case is not hopeless ruth let mr winfield show you his pictures they are poor in many respects but not entirely without merit  ruth meanwhile had been sitting on the couch listening to the conversation without really hearing it she was in a dreamy contented mood she found herself curiously soothed by the atmosphere of the studio with its shaded lights and its atmosphere of peace that was the keynote of the place peace  from outside came the rumble of an elevated train subdued and softened like faintly heard thunder somebody passed the window whistling a barrier seemed to separate her from these noises of the city new york was very far away  i believe i could be wonderfully happy in a place like this she thought  she became suddenly aware in the midst of her meditations of eyes watching her intently she looked up and met kirks  she could read the message in them as clearly as if he had spoken it and she was conscious of a little thrill of annoyance at the thought of all the tiresome formalities which must be gone through before he could speak it they seemed absurd  it was all so simple he wanted her she wanted him she had known it from the moment of their meeting the man had found his woman the woman her man nature had settled the whole affair in an instant and now civilization propriety etiquette whatever one cared to call it must needs step in with the rules and regulations and precedents  the goal was there clear in sight but it must be reached by the winding road appointed she being a woman and by virtue of her sex primeval scorned the road and would have ignored it but she knew men and especially at that moment as their eyes met she knew kirk and she understood that to him the road was a thing that could not be ignored the mere idea of doing so would seem grotesque and impossible probably even shocking to him men were odd formal creatures slaves to precedent  he must have time it was the prerogative of the male time to reveal himself to her to strut before her to go through the solemn comedy of proving to her by the exhibition of his virtues and the careful suppression of his defects what had been clear to her from the first instant that here was her mate the man nature had set apart for her  he would begin by putting on a new suit of clothes and having his hair cut  she smiled it was silly and tiresome but it was funny  will you show me your pictures mr winfield she asked  if youd really care to see them im afraid theyre pretty bad  exhibit a modesty thought ruth  the journey had begun     chapter iv  troubled waters   it is not easy in this world to take any definite step without annoying somebody and kirk in embarking on his wooing of ruth bannister failed signally to do so lora delane porter beamed graciously upon him like a pleased providence but the rest of his circle of acquaintances were ill at ease  the statement does not include hank jardine for hank was out of new york but the othersshanklyn the actor wren the newspaperman bryce johnson willis appleton and the restsensed impending change in the air and were uneasy like cattle before a thunderstorm the fact that the visits of mrs porter and ruth to inquire after george now of daily occurrence took place in the afternoon while they kirks dependents seldom or never appeared in the studio till drawn there by the scent of the evening meal it being understood that during the daytime kirk liked to work undisturbed kept them ignorant of the new development  all they knew was that during the last two weeks a subtle change had taken place in kirk he was less genial more prone to irritability than of old he had developed fits of absentmindedness and was frequently to be found staring pensively at nothing to slap him on the back at such moments as wren ventured to do on one occasion wren belonging to the jovial school of thought which holds that nature gave us hands in order to slap backs was to bring forth a new and unexpected kirk a kirk who scowled and snarled and was hardly to be appeased with apology stranger still this new kirk could be summoned into existence by precisely the type of story at which but a few weeks back he would have been the first to laugh  percy shanklyn whose conversation consisted of equal parts of autobiography and of stories of the type alluded to was the one to discover this his latest which he had counted on to set the table in a roar produced from kirk criticism so adverse and so crisply delivered that he refrained from telling his latest but one and spent the rest of the evening wondering like his fellow visitors what had happened to kirk and whether he was sickening for something  not one of them had the faintest suspicion that these symptoms indicated that kirk for the first time in his easygoing life was in love they had never contemplated such a prospect it was not till his conscientious and laborious courtship had been in progress for over two weeks and was nearing the stage when he felt that the possibility of revealing his state of mind to ruth was not so remote as it had been that a chance visit of percy shanklyn to the studio during the afternoon solved the mystery  one calls it a chance visit because percy had not been meaning to borrow twenty dollars from kirk that day at all the man slated for the loan was one burrows a kindly member of the lambs club but fate and a telegram from a manager removed burrows to chicago while percy was actually circling preparatory to the swoop and the only other man in new york who seemed to percy good for the necessary sum at that precise moment was kirk  he flew to kirk and found him with ruth kirks utter absence of any enthusiasm at the sight of him the reluctance with which he made the introduction the glumness with which he bore his share of the threecornered conversationall these things convinced percy that this was no ordinary visitor  many years of living by his wits had developed in percy highly sensitive powers of observation brief as his visit was he came away as certain that kirk was in love with this girl and the girl was in love with kirk as he had ever been of anything in his life  as he walked slowly downtown he was thinking hard the subject occupying his mind was the problem of how this thing was to be stopped  percy shanklyn was a sleek suave unpleasant youth who had been imported by a theatrical manager two years before to play the part of an english dude in a new comedy the comedy had been what its enthusiastic backer had described in the newspaper advertisements as a rousing livewire success that is to say it had staggered along for six weeks on broadway to extremely poor houses and after three weeks on the road had perished for all time leaving percy out of work  since then no other english dude part having happened along he had rested living in the mysterious way in which outofwork actors do live he had a number of acquaintances such as the amiable burrows who were good for occasional loans but kirk winfield was the king of them all there was something princely about the careless openhandedness of kirks methods and percys whole soul rose in revolt against the prospect of being deprived of this source of revenue as something possibly ruths determined chin told him that he would be should kirk marry this girl  he had placed ruth at once directly he had heard her name he remembered having seen her photograph in the society section of the sunday paper which he borrowed each week this was the daughter of old john bannister there was no doubt about that how she had found her way to kirks studio he could not understand but there she certainly was and percy was willing to bet the twenty dollars which despite the excitement of the moment he had not forgotten to extract from kirk in a hurried conversation at the door that her presence there was not known and approved by her father  the only reasonable explanation that kirk was painting her portrait he dismissed there had been no signs of any portrait and kirks embarrassment had been so obvious that if there had been any such explanation he would certainly have given it no ruth had been there for other reasons than those of art  unchaperoned too by jove thought percy virtuously ignorant of mrs lora delane porter who at the time of his call had been busily occupied in a back room instilling into george pennicut the gospel of the fit body for george now restored to health had ceased to be a mere student of elementary rules for the preservation of the body and had become an active though unwilling practiser of its precepts  every morning mrs porter called and having shepherded him into the back room put him relentlessly through his exercises georges groans as he moved his stout limbs along the dotted lines indicated in the books illustrated plates might have stirred a faint heart to pity but lora delane porter was made of sterner stuff if george so much as bent his knees while touching his toes he heard of it instantly in no uncertain voice  thus in her decisive way did mrs porter spread light and sweetness with both hands achieving the bodily salvation of george while at the same time furthering the loves of ruth and kirk by leaving them alone together to make each others better acquaintance in the romantic dimness of the studio                                       percy proceeded downtown pondering his first impulse i regret to say was to send ruths father an anonymous letter this plan he abandoned from motives of fear rather than of selfrespect anonymous letters are too frequently traced to their writers and the prospect of facing kirk in such an event did not appeal to him  as he could think of no other way of effecting his object he had begun to taste the bitterness of futile effort when fortune always his friend put him in a position to do what he wanted in the easiest possible way with the minimum of unpleasantness  bailey bannister that strong keen napoleon of finance was not above a little relaxation of an evening when his father happened to be out of town that giant mind weary with the strain of business needed refreshment  and so at eleven thirty that night his father being in albany and not expected home till next day bailey might have been observed beautifully arrayed and discreetly jovial partaking of lobster at one of those broadway palaces where this fish is in brisk demand he was in company with his rabbitfaced friend clarence grayling and two members of the chorus of a neighbouring musical comedy  one of the two with whom clarence was conversing in a lively manner that showed his heart had not been irreparably broken as the result of his recent interview with ruth we may dismiss like clarence she is of no importance to the story the other who not finding baileys measured remarks very gripping was allowing her gaze to wander idly around the room has this claim to a place in the scheme of things that she had a wordless part in the comedy in which percy shanklyn had appeared as the english dude and was on terms of friendship with him  consequently seeing him enter the room as he did at that moment she signalled him to approach  its a little feller who was with me in the man from out west she explained to bailey as percy made his way toward them at which baileys prim mouth closed with an air of disapproval  the feminine element of the stage he found congenial to his business harassed brain but with the little fellers who helped them to keep the national drama sizzling he felt less in sympathy and he resented extremely his companions tactlessness in inciting this infernal mummer to intrude upon his privacy  he prepared to be cold and distant with percy and when bailey never a ray of sunshine deliberately tried to be chilly those with him at the time generally had the sensation that winter was once more in their midst  percy meanwhile threaded his way among the tables little knowing that fate had already solved the problem which had worried him the greater part of the day  he had come to the restaurant as a relief from his thoughts if he could find some kind friend who would invite him to supper well and good if not he was feeling so tired and depressed that he was ready to take the bull by the horns and pay for his meal himself he had obeyed miss freda reeces signal because it was impossible to avoid doing so but one glance at baileys face had convinced him that not there was his kind host  why perce said miss reece i aint saw you in years where you been hiding yourself  percy gave a languid gesture indicative of the man of affairs whose time is not his own  percy continued miss reece shake hands with my friend mr bannister i been telling him about how you made such a hit as the pin in pinafore  the name galvanized percy like a bugleblast  mr bannister he exclaimed any relation to mr john bannister the millionaire  bailey favoured him with a scrutiny through the goldrimmed glasses which would have frozen his very spine  my fathers name isahjohn and he is a millionaire  percy met the scrutiny with a suave smile  by jove he said i know your sister quite well mr bannister i meet her frequently at the studio of my friend kirk winfield very frequently she is there nearly every day well i must be moving on got a date with a man goodbye freda glad youre going strong good night mr bannister delighted to have made your acquaintance you must come round to the studio one of these days good night  he moved softly away miss reece watched him go with regret  hes a good little feller percy she said and so he knows your sister well aint that nice  bailey did not reply and to the feast of reason and flow of soul that went on at the table during the rest of the meal he contributed so little that miss reece in conversation that night with her friend alluded to him not without justice first as that stiff and later as a dead one                                       if percy shanklyn could have seen bailey in the small hours of that night he would have been satisfied that his words had borne fruit like a modern prometheus bailey writhed sleepless on his bed till daylight appeared the discovery that ruth was in the habit of paying clandestine visits to artists studios where she met men like the little bounder who had been thrust upon him at supper rent his haughty soul like a bomb  he knew no artists but he had read novels of bohemian life in paris and he had gathered a general impression that they were as a class shockheaded unwashed persons of no social standing whatever extremely short of money and much addicted to orgies and his sister had lowered herself by association with one of these  he rose early his appearance in the mirror shocked him he looked positively haggard  dressing with unwonted haste he inquired for ruth and was told that a telephone message had come from her late the previous evening to say that she was spending the night at the apartment of mrs lora delane porter the hated name increased baileys indignation he held mrs porter responsible for the whole trouble but for her pernicious influence ruth would have been an ordinary sweet american girl running as bailey held a girl should in a decent groove  it increased his troubles that his father was away from new york bailey who enjoyed the dignity of being temporary head of the firm of bannister  son had approved of his departure but now he would have given much to have him on the spot he did not doubt his own ability to handle this matter but he felt that his father ought to know what was going on  his wrath against this upstart artist who secretly entertained his sister in his studio grew with the minutes it would be his privilege very shortly to read that scrubby dauber a lesson in deportment which he would remember  in the interests of the family welfare he decided to stay away from the office that day the affairs of bannister  son would be safe for the time being in the hands of the head clerk having telephoned to wall street to announce his decision he made a moody breakfast and then proceeded as was his custom of a morning to the gymnasium for his daily exercise  the gymnasium was a recent addition to the bannister home it had been established as the result of a hearttoheart talk between old john bannister and his doctor the doctor spoke earnestly of nervous prostration and stated without preamble the exact number of months which would elapse before mr bannister living his present life would make firsthand acquaintance with it he insisted on a regular routine of exercise the gymnasium came into being and mr steve dingle physical instructor at the new york athletic club took up a position in the bannister household which he was wont to describe to his numerous friends as a soft snap  certainly his hours were not long thirty minutes with old mr bannister and thirty minutes with mr bailey between eight and nine in the morning and his duties were over for the day but steve was conscientious and checked any disposition on the part of his two clients to shirk work with a firmness which lora delane porter might have envied  there were moments when he positively bullied old mr bannister it would have amazed the clerks in his wall street office to see the meekness with which the old man obeyed orders but john bannister was a man who liked to get his moneys worth and he knew that steve was giving it to the last cent  steve at that time was twentyeight years old he had abandoned an active connection with the ring which had begun just after his seventeenth birthday twelve months before his entry into the bannister home leaving behind him a record of which any boxer might have been proud he personally was exceedingly proud of it and made no secret of the fact  he was a man in private life of astonishingly even temper the only thing that appeared to have the power to ruffle him to the slightest extent was the contemplation of what he described as the bunch of cheeses who pretended to fight nowadays he would have considered it a privilege it seemed to be allowed to encounter all the middleweights in the country in one ring in a single night without training but it appeared that he had promised his mother to quit and he had quit  steves mother was an old lady who in her day had been the best washerwoman on cherry hill she was moreover completely lacking in all the qualities which go to make up the patroness of sport steve had been injudicious enough to pay her a visit the day after his celebrated unpleasantness with that rugged warrior pat oflaherty ne smith and though he had knocked pat out midway through the second round he bore away from the arena a black eye of such a startling richness that old mrs dingle had refused to be comforted until he had promised never to enter the ring again which as steve said had come pretty hard he being a man who would rather be a waterbucket in a ring than a president outside it  but he had given the promise and kept it leaving the field to the abovementioned bunch of cheeses there were times when the temptation to knock the head off battling dick this and fighting jack that became almost agony but he never yielded to it all of which suggests that steve was a man of character as indeed he was  bailey entering the gymnasium found steve already there punching the bag with a force and precision which showed that the bunch of cheeses ought to have been highly grateful to mrs dingle for her antipugilistic prejudices  good morning dingle said bailey precisely  steve nodded bailey began to don his gymnasium costume steve gave the ball a final punch and turned to him he was a young man who gave the impression of being in a literal sense perfectly square this was due to the breadth of his shoulders which was quite out of proportion to his height his chest was extraordinarily deep and his stomach and waist small so that to the observer seeing him for the first time in boxing trunks he seemed to begin as a big man and halfway down change his mind and become a small one  his arms which were unusually long and thick hung down nearly to his knees and were decorated throughout with knobs and ridges of muscle that popped up and down and in and out as he moved in a manner both fascinating and frightening his face increased the illusion of squareness for he had thick straight eyebrows a straight mouth and a chin of almost the minimum degree of roundness he inspected bailey with a pair of brilliant brown eyes which no detail of his appearance could escape and bailey that morning as has been said was not looking his best  youre lookin kind o sick bo was steves comment i guess you was hittin it up with the gang last night in one of them lobster parlours  bailey objected to being addressed as bo and he was annoyed that steve should have guessed the truth respecting his overnight movements still more was he annoyed that steves material mind should attribute to a surfeit of lobster a pallor that was superinduced by a tortured soul  i didahtake supper last night it is true he said but if i am a little pale today that is not the cause things have occurred to annoy me intensely  you should worry advised steve catch  the heavy medicineball struck bailey in the chest before he could bring up his hands and sent him staggering back  damn it dingle he gasped kindly give me warning before you do that sort of thing  steve was delighted it amused his simple honest soul to catch bailey napping and the incident gave him a text on which to hang a lecture and next to fighting he loved best the sound of his own voice  warning nix he said aint it just what i been telling you every day for weeks you gotta be ready always you seen me holding the pellet you should oughter have been saying to yourself i gotta keep an eye on that gink sos he dont soak me one with that thing when i aint looking then you would have caught it and whizzed it back at me and maybe if i hadnt been ready for it you might have knocked the breeze out of me  i should have derived no pleasure  why say suppose a plugugly sasshays up to you on the street to take a crack at your pearl stickpin do you reckon hes going to drop you a postal card first you gotta be ready for him see what i mean  let us spar said bailey austerely he had begun to despair of ever making steve show him that deference and respect which he considered due to the son of the house the more frigid he was the more genial and friendly did steve become the thing seemed hopeless  it was a pleasing sight to see bailey spar he brought to the task the measured dignity which characterized all his actions a left jab from him had all the majesty of a formal declaration of war if he was a trifle slow in his movements for a pastime which demands a certain agility from its devotees he at least got plenty of exercise and did himself a great deal of good  he was perspiring freely as he took off the gloves a showerbath followed by brisk massage at the energetic hands of steve made him feel better than he had imagined he could feel after that night of spiritual storm and stress he was glowing as he put on his clothes and a certain high resolve which had come to him in the night watches now returned with doubled force  dingle he said how did i seem today  fine answered steve courteously youre gettin to be a regular terror  you think i shape well  sure  i am glad this morning i am going to thrash a man within an inch of his life  what  steve spun round baileys face was set and determined  you are said steve feebly  i am  whats he been doing to you  i am afraid i cannot tell you that but he richly deserves what he will get  steve eyed him with affectionate interest  well aint you the wildcat he said whod have thought it id always had you sized up as a kind o placid guy  i can be roused  gee cant i see it but say what sort of a gook is this gink anyway  in what respect  well i mean is he a heavy or a middle or a welter or what it makes a kind o difference you know  i cannot say i have not seen him  what not seen him then hows there this fuss between you  that is a matter into which i cannot go  well whats his name then maybe i know him i know a few good people in this burg  i have no objection to telling you that he is an artist and his name ishis name is  wrinkles appeared in baileys forehead his eyes bulged anxiously behind their glasses  ive forgotten he said blankly  for the love of mike know where he lives  i am afraid not  steve patted him kindly on the shoulder  take my advice bo he said let the poor fellow off this time  and so it came about that bailey instead of falling upon kirk winfield hailed a taxicab and drove to the apartment of mrs lora delane porter     chapter v  wherein opposites agree   the maid who opened the door showed a reluctance to let bailey in she said that mrs porter was busy with her writing and had given orders that she was not to be disturbed  nothing could have infuriated bailey more he bailey bannister was to be refused admittance because this preposterous woman wished to write it was the duty of all decent citizens to stop her writing if it had not been for her and her absurd books ruth would never have made it necessary for him to pay this visit at all  kindly take my card to mrs porter and tell her that i must see her at once on a matter of the utmost urgency he directed  the domestic workers of america had not been trained to stand up against baileys grand manner the maid vanished meekly with the card and presently returned and requested him to step in  bailey found himself in a comfortable room more like a mans study than a womans boudoir books lined the walls the furniture was strong and plain at the window on a swivelchair before a rolltop desk mrs porter sat writing her back to the door  the gentleman maam announced the maid  sit down said his aunt without looking round or ceasing to write  the maid went out bailey sat down the gentle squeak of the quill pen continued  bailey coughed  i have called this morning  the left hand of the writer rose and waggled itself irritably above her left shoulder  aunt lora spoke bailey sternly  shish said the authoress only that and nothing more bailey outraged relapsed into silence the pen squeaked on  after what seemed to bailey a considerable time the writing ceased it was succeeded by the sound of paper vigorously blotted then with startling suddenness mrs porter whirled round on the swivelchair tilted it back and faced him  well bailey she said  she looked at bailey bailey looked at her her eyes had the curious effect of driving out of his head what he had intended to say  well she said again  he tried to remember the excellent opening speech which he had prepared in the cab  good gracious bailey cried mrs porter you have not come here and ruined my mornings work for the pleasure of looking at me surely say something  bailey found his voice  i have called to see ruth who i am informed is with you  she is in her room i made her breakfast in bed is there any message i can give her  bailey suddenly remembered the speech he had framed in the cab  aunt lora he said i am sorry to have to intrude upon you at so early an hour but it is imperative that i see ruth and ask her to explain the meaning of a most disturbing piece of news that has come to my ears  mrs porter did not appear to have heard him  a man of your height should weigh more she said what is your weight  my weight beside the point  your weight is under a hundred and forty pounds and it ought to be over a hundred and sixty eat more avoid alcohol keep regular hours  aunt lora  well  i wish to see my sister  you will have to wait what did you wish to see her about  that is a matter that concernsno i will tell you for i believe you to be responsible for the whole affair  well  last night quite by chance i found out that ruth has for some time been paying visits to the studio of an artist  mrs porter nodded  quite right mr kirk winfield she is going to marry him  baileys hat fell to the floor his stick followed his mouth opened widely his glasses shot from his nose and danced madly at the end of their string  what  it will be a most suitable match in every way said mrs porter  bailey bounded to his feet  its incredible he shouted its ridiculous its abominable itsits incredible  mrs porter gazed upon his transports with about the same amount of interest which she would have bestowed upon a whirling dervish at coney island  you have not seen mr winfield i gather  when i do he will have reason to regret it i  sit down  bailey sat down  ruth and mr winfield are both perfect types mr winfield is really a splendid specimen of a man as to his intelligence i say nothing i have ceased to expect intelligence in man and i am grateful for the smallest grain but physically he is magnificent i could not wish dear ruth a better husband  bailey had pulled himself together with a supreme effort and had achieved a frozen calm  such a marriage is of course out of the question he said  why  my sister cannot marry aa nobody an outsider  mr winfield is not a nobody he is an extraordinarily healthy young man  are you aware that ruth if she had wished could have married a prince  she told me a little rat of a man i understand she had far too much sense to do any such thing she has a conscience she knows what she owes to the future of the  bah cried bailey rudely  i suppose said mrs porter that like most men you care nothing for the future of the race you are not interested in eugenics  bailey quivered with fury at the word but said nothing  if you have ever studied even so elementary a subject as the colour heredity of the andalusian fowl  the colour heredity of the andalusian fowl was too much for bailey  i decline to discuss any such drivel he said rising i came here to see ruth and  and here she is said mrs porter  the door opened and ruth appeared she looked to bailey insufferably radiant and pleased with herself  bailey she cried whatever brings my little bailey here when he ought to be working like a good boy in wall street  i will tell you baileys demeanour was portentous  hes frowning said ruth you have been stirring his hidden depths aunt lora  bailey coughed  ruth  bailey dont you dont know how terrible you look when youre roused  ruth kindly answer me one question aunt lora informs me that you are going to marry this man winfield is it or is it not true  of course its true  bailey drew in his breath he gazed coldly at ruth bowed to mrs porter and smoothed the nap of his hat  very good he said stonily i shall now call upon this mr winfield and thrash him with that he walked out of the room  he directed his cab to the nearest hotel looked up kirks address in the telephonebook and ten minutes later was ringing the studio bell  a look of relief came into george pennicuts eyes as he opened the door to george nowadays every ring at the bell meant a possible visit from lora delane porter  is mr kirk winfield at home inquired bailey  yes sir who shall i say sir  kindly tell mr winfield that mr bannister wishes to speak to him  yes sir will you step this way sir  bailey stepped that way                                       while bailey was driving to the studio in his taxicab kirk in boxing trunks and a sleeveless vest was engaged on his daily sparring exercise with steve dingle  this morning steve seemed to be amused at something as they rested at the conclusion of their fifth and final round kirk perceived that he was chuckling and asked the reason  why say explained steve i was only thinking that it takes all kinds of ivory domes to make a nuttery i ran across a new brand of simp this morning just before i came to you im scheduled to show up at one of these astorbilt homes tother side of the park first i mix it with the old man then son and heir blows in and i attend to him  well this morning son acts like hes all worked up hes one of these halfportion willieboys with chippendale legs but he throws out a line of talk that would make you wonder if its safe to let him run around loose says his minds made up hes going to thrash a gink within an inch of his life going to muss up his features so bad hell have to have em replanted  why i says never you mind says he well who is he i asks what do you think happens then he thinks hard for a spell rolls his eyes and says search me ive forgotten know where he lives i asks him nope he says  can you beat it seems to me if i had a kink in my coco that big id phone to an alienist and have myself measured for a straitjacket gee you meet all kinds going around the way i do  kirk laughed and lit a cigarette  if you want to use the shower steve he said youd better get up there now i shant be ready yet awhile then if this is one of your energetic mornings and you would care to give me a rubdown  sure said steve obligingly he picked up his clothes and went upstairs to the bathroom which like the bedrooms opened on to the gallery kirk threw himself on the couch fixed his eyes on the ceiling and began to think of ruth  mr bannister announced george pennicut at the door  kirk was on his feet in one bound the difference to a man whose mind is far away between mr bannister and miss bannister is not great and his first impression was that it was ruth who had arrived  he was acutely conscious of his costume and was quite relieved when he saw not ruth but a severelooking young man who advanced upon him in a tightlipped popeyed manner that suggested dislike and hostility the visitor was a complete stranger to him but his wandering wits returning to their duties he deduced that this must be one of ruths relatives  it is a curious fact that the possibility of ruth having other relatives than mrs porter had not occurred to him till now she herself filled his mind to such an extent that he had never speculated on any possible family that might be attached to her to him ruth was ruth he accepted the fact that she was mrs porters niece that she might also be somebodys daughter or sister had not struck him the look on baileys face somehow brought it home to him that the world was about to step in and complicate the idyllic simplicity of his wooing  bailey meanwhile as kirks hundred and eighty pounds of bone and muscle detached themselves from the couch and loomed up massively before him was conscious of a weakening of his determination to inflict bodily chastisement the truth of steves remark that it made a difference whether ones intended victim is a heavyweight a middle or a welter came upon him with some force  kirk in a sleeveless vest that showed up his chest and shoulders was not an inviting spectacle for a man intending assault and battery bailey decided to confine himself to words there was nothing to be gained by a vulgar brawl a dignified man of the world avoided violence  mr winfield  mr bannister  it was at this point that steve having bathed and dressed came out on the gallery the voices below halted him and the sound of baileys decided him to remain where he was steve was not above human curiosity and he was anxious to know the reason for baileys sudden appearance  that is my name it is familiar to you my sister said bailey bitterly has made it so  wont you sit down said kirk  no thank you i will not detain you long mr winfield  my dear fellow theres no hurry will you have a cigarette  no thank you  kirk was puzzled by his visitors manner so unseen in the shadows of the gallery was steve  i can say what i wish to say in two words mr winfield said bailey this marriage is quite out of the question  eh  my father would naturally never consent to it as soon as he hears of what has happened he will forbid it absolutely kindly dismiss from your mind entirely the idea that my sister will ever be permitted to marry you mr winfield  steve in the gallery with difficulty suppressed a whoop of surprise kirk laughed ruefully  arent you a little premature mr bannister arent you taking a good deal for granted  in what way  well that miss bannister cares the slightest bit for me for instance that ive one chance in a million of ever getting her to care the slightest bit for me  bailey was disgusted at this futile attempt to hide the known facts of the case from him  you need not trouble to try and fool me mr winfield he said tartly i know everything i have just seen my sister and she told me herself in so many words that she intended to marry you  to his amazement he found his hand violently shaken  my dear old man kirk was stammering in his delight my dear old sport you dont know what a weight youve taken off my mind you know how it is a fellow falls in love and instantly starts thinking he hasnt a chance on earth i hadnt a notion she felt that way about me im not fit to shine her shoes my dear old man if you hadnt come and told me this i never should have had the nerve to say a word to her  youre a corker youve changed everything youll have to excuse me i must go to her i cant wait a minute i must rush and dress make yourself at home here have you breakfasted george george say george ive got to rush away see that mr bannister has everything he wants get him some breakfast goodbye old man he gripped baileys hand once more youre all right goodbye  he sprang for the staircase george pennicut turned to the speechless bailey  how would it be if i made you a nice cup of hot tea and a rasher of am sir he inquired with a kindly smile  bailey eyed him glassily then found speech  go to hell he shouted he strode to the door and shot into the street a seething volcano  george for his part was startled but polite  yes sir he said very good sir and withdrew  kirk having reached the top of the stairs had to check the wild rush he was making for the bathroom in order not to collide with steve whom he found waiting for him with outstretched hand and sympathetic excitement writ large upon his face  excuse me squire said steve ive been playing the part of rubberneck rupert in that little drama youve just been starring in i just couldnt help listening say this mitts for you shake it so youre going to marry baileys sister ruth are you youre the lucky guy shes a queen  do you know her steve  do i know her didnt i tell you i was the tame physical instructor in that palace i wish i had a dollar for every time ive thrown the medicineball at her why im the guy that gave her that figure of hers she dont come to me regular like bailey and the old man but do i know her i should say i did know her  kirk shook his hand  youre all right steve he said huskily and vanished into the bathroom a sound as of a tropical deluge came from within  steve hammered upon the door the downpour ceased  say called steve  hello  i dont want to discourage you squire but  the door opened and kirks head appeared  whats the matter  well you heard what bailey said  about his father  sure it goes  kirk came out into the gallery towelling himself vigorously  who is her father he asked seating himself on the rail  hes a son of a gun said steve with emphasis as rich as john d pretty nearly and about as chummy as a rattlesnake were you thinking of calling and asking him for a fathers blessing  something of the sort i suppose  forget it hed give you the hook before youd got through asking if you might call him daddy  youre comforting steve they call you little sunbeam at home dont they  hell said steve warmly im not shooting this at you just to make you feel bad i gotta reason i want to make you see this aint going to be no society walkover with the four hundred looking on from the pews and poppa signing cheques in the background say did i ever tell you how i beat kid mitchell  does it apply to the case in hand  does it what to the which  had it any bearing on my painful position i only ask because thats what is interesting me most just now and if youre going to change the subject theres a chance that my attention may wander  sure it does its awhat dyou call it when you pull something thats got another meaning tucked up its sleeve  a parable  thats right awhat you said well this kid mitchell was looked on as a coming champ in those days he had cleaned up some good boys while i had only gotten a rep about as big as a nickel with a hole in it i guess i looked pie to him he turkeytrotted up to me for the first round and stopped in front of me as if he was wondering what had blown in and whether the gerry society would stand for his hitting it i could see him thinking this is too easy as plain as if hed said it and then he took another peek at me as much as to say well lets get it over where shall i soak him first and while hes doing this i get in range and i put my left pretty smart into his lunchwagon and i pick up my right off the carpet and hand it to him and down he goes and when he gets up again its pretty nearly tomorrow morning and ive drawn the winners end and gone home  and the moral  why dont spar punch dont wait for the wallop give it  you mean  why when old man bannister says nix you shall never marry my child come back at him by saying thanks very much but ive just done it  good heavens steve  youll never win out else you dont know old man bannister i do  but  the doorbell rang  who on earths that said kirk it cant be bailey back again  good morning pennicut spoke the clear voice of mrs lora delane porter i wish to see mr winfield  yes maam hes upstairs in is bath  i will wait in the studio  good lord cried kirk bounding from his seat on the rail for heavens sake steve go and talk to her while i dress ill be down in a minute  sure whats her name  mrs porter youll like her tell her all about yourselfwhere you were born how much you are round the chest whats your favourite breakfast food thats what she likes to chat about and tell her ill be down in a second  steve reaching the studio found mrs porter examining the boxinggloves which had been thrown on a chair  eightounce maam he said genially by way of introduction kirkll be lining up in a moment hes getting into his rags  mrs porter looked at him with the gimlet stare which made her so intensely disliked by practically every man she knew  are you a friend of mr winfield she said  sure we just been spieling together up above he sent me down to tell you he wont be long  mrs porter concluded her inspection  what is your name  dingle maam  you are extraordinarily well developed you have unusually long arms for a man of your height  yep i got a pretty good reach  are you an artist  a which  an artist a painter  steve smiled broadly  ive been called a good many things but no ones ever handed me that no maam im a hasbeen  i beg your pardon  granted  what did you say you were asked mrs porter after a pause  a hasbeen i used to be a middle but mother kicked and i quit all through taking a blue eye home wouldnt that jar you  i have no doubt you intend to be explicit  not on your life protested steve i may be a roughneck but ive got me manners i wouldnt get explicit with a lady  mrs porter sat down  we appear to be talking at crosspurposes she said i still do not gather what your profession is or was  why aint i telling you i used to be a middle  what is a middle  why its in between the lightheavies and the welters i was a welter when i broke into the fighting game but  now i understand you are a pugilist  used to be but mother kicked  kicked whom  you dont get me maam when i say she kicked i mean my blue eye threw a scare into her and she put a crimp in my career made me quit when i should have been champ in another couple of fights  i am afraid i cannot follow these domestic troubles of yours and why do you speak of your blue eye your eyes are brown  this one wasnt it was the fattest blue eye you ever seen i ran up against a short right hook i put him out next round maam mind you but that didnt help me any with mother directly she seen me blue eye she said thatll be all from you steve you stop it this minute so i quit but gee its tough on a fellow to have to sit out of the game and watch a bunch of cheeses like this new crop of middleweights swelling around and calling themselves fighters when they couldnt lick a postagestamp not if it was properly trained hell beg pardon maam  i find you an interesting study mr dingle said mrs porter thoughtfully i have never met a pugilist before do you box with mr winfield  sure kirk and me go five rounds every morning  you have been boxing with him today then perhaps you can tell me if an absurd young man in eyeglasses has called here yet he is wearing a grey  do you mean bailey maam bailey bannister  you know my nephew mr dingle  sure i box with him every morning  i never expected to hear that my nephew bailey did anything so sensible as to take regular exercise he does not look as if he did  he certainly is a kind o halfportion maam but say if hes your nephew miss ruths your niece  perfectly correct  then you know all about this business  which business mr dingle  why kirk and miss ruth  mrs porter raised her eyebrows  really mr dingle has mr winfield made you his confidant  hows that  has mr winfield told you about my niece and himself  hell no you dont find a real person like kirk shooting his head about that kind of thing i had it from bailey  from bailey  surest thing you know he blew in here and shouted it all out at the top of his voice  indeed i was wondering if he had arrived yet he left my apartment saying he was going to thrash mr winfield i came here to save him from getting hurt was there any trouble  not sos you could notice it i guess when hed taken a slant at kirk he thought he wouldnt bother to swat him say maam  well  whose corner are you in for this scrap  i dont understand you  well are you rooting for kirk or are you holding the towel for old man bannister  you mean do i wish mr winfield to marry my niece  youre hep  most certainly i do it was i who brought them together  bully for you well say i just been shooting the dope into kirk upstairs i beenyou didnt happen to read the report of a scrap i once had with a gazook called kid mitchell did you maam  i seldom i may say never read the sporting section of the daily papers  steve looked at her in honest wonder  for the love of pete what else do you find to read in em he said well i was telling kirk about it the kid came at me to soak me but i soaked him first and put him out its the only thing to do maam when youre up against it get in the first wallop before the other guy can get himself set for his punch kirk i says dont you wait for old man bannister to tell you you cant marry miss ruth marry her before he can say it i wish youd tell him the same thing maam you know the old man as well as i dobetter i guessand you know that kirk aint got a chance in a million with him if he dont rush him aint that right  mr dingle said mrs porter i should like to shake you by the hand it is amazing to me to find such sound sense in a man you have expressed my view exactly if i have any influence with mr winfield he shall marry my niece today you are a man of really exceptional intelligence mr dingle  aw check it with your hat maam murmured steve modestly nix on the bouquets im only a roughneck but i fall for miss ruth and there aint many like kirk so id like to see them happy it would sure get my goat the worst way to have the old man gum the game for them  i cannot understand a word you say said mrs porter but i fancy we mean the same thing here comes mr winfield at last i will speak to him at once  spiel away maam said steve the floors yours  kirk entered the studio     chapter vi  breaking the news   old john bannister returned that night learning from baileys trembling lips the tremendous events that had been taking place in his absence he was first irritated then coldly amused his coolness dampened while it comforted bailey  a bearer of sensational tidings likes to spread a certain amount of dismay and terror but on the other hand it was a relief to him to find that his father appeared to consider trivial a crisis which to bailey had seemed a disaster without parallel in the annals of american social life  she said she was going to marry him  old bannister opened the nutcracker mouth that always had the appearance of crushing something his pale eyes glowed for an instant  did she he said  she seemed veryahdetermined  did she  silence falling like a cloud at this point bailey rightly conjectured that the audience was at an end and left the room his father bit the end off a cigar and began to smoke  smoking he reviewed the situation and his fighting spirit rose to grapple with it he was not sorry that this had happened his was a patriarchal mind and he welcomed opportunities of exercising his authority over his children it had always been his policy to rule them masterfully and he had often resented the fact that his daughter by the nature of things was to a great extent outside his immediate rule  during office hours business took him away from her the sun never set on his empire over bailey but it needed a definite crisis like the present one to enable him to jerk at the reins which guided ruth and he was glad of the chance to make his power felt  the fact that this affair brought him into immediate contact with mrs porter added to his enjoyment of all the people men or women with whom his business or social life had brought him into conflict she alone had fought him squarely and retired with the honours of war when his patriarchal mind had led him to bully his late wife it was mrs porter who had fought her cause it was mrs porter who openly expressed her contempt for his money and certain methods of making it she was the only person in his immediate sphere over whom he had no financial hold  he was a man who liked to be surrounded by dependents and mrs porter stoutly declined to be a dependent she moved about the world blunt and selfsufficing and he hated her as he hated no one else the thought that she had now come to grips with him and that he could best her in open fight was pleasant to him all his life except in his conflicts with her he had won he meant to win now  baileys apprehensions amused him he had a thorough contempt for all actors authors musicians and artists whom he classed together in one group as men who did not count save in so far as they gave mild entertainment to the men who like himself did count the idea of anybody taking them seriously seemed too fantastic to be considered  of affection for his children he had little bailey was useful in the office and ruth ornamental at home they satisfied him he had never troubled to study their characters it had never occurred to him to wonder if they were fond of him they formed a necessary part of his household and beyond that he was not interested in them if he had ever thought about ruths nature he had dismissed her as a feminine counterpart of bailey than whom no other son and heir in new york behaved so exactly as a son and heir should  that ruth even under the influence of lora delane porter should have been capable of her present insubordination was surprising but the thing was too trivial to be a source of anxiety the mischief could be checked at once before it amounted to anything  bailey had not been gone too long before ruth appeared she stood in the doorway looking at him for a moment her face was pale and her eyes bright she was breathing quickly  are you busy father ii want to tell you something  john bannister smiled he had a wintry smile a sort of muscular affection of the mouth to which his eyes contributed nothing he had made up his mind to be perfectly calm and pleasant with ruth he had read in novels and seen on the stage situations of this kind where the father had stormed and blustered the foolishness of such a policy amused him a strong man had no need to behave like that  i think i have heard it already he said i have just been seeing bailey  what did bailey tell you father  that you fancied yourself in love with some actor or artist or other whose name i have forgotten  it is not fancy i do love him  yes  there was a pause  are you very angry father  why should i be lets talk it over quietly theres no need to make a tragedy of it  im glad you feel like that father  john bannister lit another cigar  tell me all about it he said  ruth found herself surprisingly near tears she had come into the room with every nerve in her body braced for a supreme struggle her fathers unexpected gentleness weakened her exactly as he had foreseen the plan of action which he had determined upon was that of the wrestler who yields instead of resisting in order to throw an antagonist off his balance  how did it begin he asked  well said ruth it began when aunt lora took me to his studio  yes i heard that it was she who set the whole thing going she is a friend of this fellowwhat is his name  kirk winfield yes she seemed to know him quite well  and then  in spite of her anxiety ruth smiled  well thats all she said i just fell in love with him  mr bannister nodded  you just fell in love with him he repeated pretty quick work wasnt it  i suppose it was  you just took one look at him and saw he was the affinity eh  i suppose so  and what did he do was he equally sudden  ruth laughed she was feeling quite happy now  he would have liked to be poor dear but he felt he had to be cautious and prepare the way before telling me if it hadnt been for bailey he might be doing it still apparently bailey went to him and said i had said i was going to marry him and kirk came flying round andwell then it was all right  mr bannister drew thoughtfully at his cigar he was silent for a few moments  well my dear he said at last i think you had better consider the engagement broken off  ruth looked at him quickly he still smiled but his eyes were cold and hard she realized suddenly that she had been played with that all his kindliness and amiability had been merely a substitute for the storm which she had expected after all it was to be war between them and she braced herself for it  father she cried  mr bannister continued to puff serenely at his cigar  we neednt get worked up about it he said lets keep right on talking it over quietly  very well said ruth but after what you have just said what is there to talk over  you might be interested to hear my reasons for saying it  and i will argue my side  mr bannister waved his hand gently  you dont have to argue you just listen  ruth bit her lip  well  in the first place said her father about this young man what is he bailey says he is an artist well what has he ever done why dont i know his name i buy a good many pictures but i dont remember ever signing a cheque for one of his i read the magazines now and then but i cant recall seeing his signature to any of the illustrations how does he live anyway without going into the question of how he intends to support a wife  aunt lora told me he had private means  how much  five thousand dollars a year  exactly the amount necessary to let him live without working i have him placed now i know his type i could show you a thousand men in this city in exactly the same position they dont starve and they dont work this young man of yours is a loafer  well  ruths voice was quiet but a faint colour had crept into her face and her eyes were blazing  now perhaps you would care to hear what i think of his principles how do you feel that he comes out of this business does he show to advantage isnt there just a suspicion of underhandedness about his behaviour  no  no he lets you pay these secret visits  ruth interrupted  there was nothing secret about themto him aunt lora brought me to the studio in the first place and she kept on bringing me i dont suppose it ever occurred to kirk to wonder who i was and who my father might be he has been perfectly straight if you like to say i have been underhanded i admit it i have more so than you imagine i just wanted him and i didnt care for anything except that  it did not strike you that you owed anything to me for instance  no  i should have thought that as your father i had certain claims  ruth was silent  mr bannister sighed  i thought you were fond of me ruth he said wistfully it was the wrestler yielding instead of resisting ruths hard composure melted instantly she flung her arms round his neck in a burst of remorseful affection  of course i am father dear youre making this awfully hard for me  mr bannister chuckled inwardly it seemed to him that victory was in sight he always won he told himself always  i only want you to be sensible  ruth stiffened at the word it jarred upon her she felt that they were leagues apart that they could never be in sympathy with each other  father she said  yes  would you like to see kirk  i have been wondering when he was going to appear on the scene i always thought it was customary on these occasions for the young man to present himself in person and not let the lady fight his battles for him is this mr winfield a little deficient in nerve  ruth flushed angrily  i particularly asked kirk not to come here before i had seen you i insisted on it naturally he wanted to  of course  there was a sneer in his voice which he did not try to hide it flicked ruth like a whip her painfully preserved restraint broke up under it  do you think kirk is afraid of you father  it crossed my mind  he is not  i have only your word for it  you can have his if you want it there is the telephone you can have him here in ten minutes if you want to see him  a very good idea but as it happens i do not want to see him there is no necessity his views on this matter do not interest me i  there was a hurried knock at the door bailey burst in ruffled and wild as to the eyes  father he cried i dont want to interrupt you but that infernal woman aunt lora has arrived and says she wont go till she has seen you shes downstairs now  not now said lora delane porter moving him to one side and entering the room i thought it would be a comfort to you ruth to have me with you to help explain exactly how matters stand good evening john go away bailey now let us discuss things quietly  she is responsible for the whole thing father cried bailey  mr bannister rose  there is nothing to discuss he said shortly i have no wish to speak to you at all as you appear to have played a large part in this affair i may as well tell you that it is settled ruth will not marry mr winfield  lora delane porter settled herself comfortably in a chair she drew off her gloves and placed them on the table  please ask that boy bailey to go she said he annoys me i cannot marshal my thoughts in his presence  quelled by her eye bailey removed himself his father remained standing ruth who had risen at her aunts entry sat down again mrs porter looked round the room with some approval  you have a nice taste in pictures john she said that is a corot surely above the mantelpiece  will you  but about this little matter you dislike the idea of ruth marrying mr winfield have you seen mr winfield  i have not  then how can you possibly decide whether he is a fit husband for ruth  i know all about him  what do you know  what ruth has told me that he is a loafer who pretends to be an artist  he is a poor artist i grant you that his drawing is weak but are you aware that he is fortythree inches round the chest six feet tall and in perfect physical condition  what has that got to do with it  everything you have not read my principles of selection  i have not  i will send you a copy tomorrow  i will burn it directly it arrives  then you will miss a great deal of valuable information said mrs porter tranquilly  there was a pause john bannister glared furiously at mrs porter but her gaze was moving easily about the room taking in each picture in turn in a leisurely inspection  an exclamation from ruth broke the silence a sharp cry like that of an animal in pain she sprang up her face working her eyes filled with tears  i cant stand it she cried i cant stand it any longer father kirk and i were married this afternoon  mrs porter went quickly to her and put her arm round her ruth was sobbing helplessly the strain had broken her john bannisters face was leaden the veins stood out on his forehead his mouth twisted dumbly  mrs porter led ruth gently to the door and pushed her out then she closed it and turned to him  so now you know john she said well what are you going to do about it  selfcontrol was second nature with john bannister for years he had cultivated it as a commercial asset often a fortune had depended on his mastery of his emotions now in an instant he had himself under control once more his face resumed its normal expression of cold impassiveness only his mouth twitched a little  well asked mrs porter  take her away he said quietly take her out of here let her go to him i have done with her  i suppose so said mrs porter and left the room     chapter vii  sufficient unto themselves   some months after john bannister had spoken his ultimatum in the library two droughtstricken men met on the rialto it was a close june evening full of thirst  i could do with a drink said the first man several  my tongue is black clear down to the roots said the second  lets go up to kirk winfields proposed the first man inspired  not for me said the other briefly havent you heard about kirk hes married  i knowbut  and when i say married i mean married shes old john bannisters daughter you know and i guess she inherits her fathers character shes what i call a determined girl she seems to have made up her mind that the old crowd that used to trail around the studio arent needed any longer and theyve been hitting the sidewalk on one ear ever since the honeymoon  if you want to see her in action go up there now shell be perfectly sweet and friendly but somehow youll get the notion that you dont want to go there again and that she can bear up if you dont its something in her manner i guess its a trick these society girls learn youve seen a bouncer handling a souse he doesnt roughhouse him he just puts his arm round his waist and kind of suggests he should leave the place well its like that  but doesnt kirk kick he used to like having us around  his friend laughed  kick kirk you should see him he just sits there waiting for you to go and when you do go shuts the door on you so quick you have to jump to keep from getting your coat caught in it i tell you those two are about all the company either of them needs theyve got the newlyweds licked to a whisper  its always the best fellows that get it the worse said the other philosophically and its always the fellows you think are safe too i could have bet on kirk six months ago id have given you any odds you wanted that he would never marry  and i wouldnt have taken you its always the way  the criticisms of the two thirsty men though prejudiced were accurate marriage had undeniably wrought changes in kirk winfield it had blown up decentralized and rearranged his entire scheme of life kirks was one of those natures that run to extremes he had been a wholehearted bachelor and he was assuredly a muchmarried man for the first six months ruth was almost literally his whole world his friends the old brigade of the studio had dropped away from him in a body they had visited the studio once or twice at first but after that had mysteriously disappeared he was too engrossed in his happiness to speculate on the reasons for this defection he only knew that he was glad of it  their visits had not been a success conversation had flowed fitfully some sixth sense told him that ruth though charming to them all had not liked them and he himself was astonished to find what bull dogs they really were it was odd how out of sympathy he felt with them they seemed so unnecessary yet what a large part of his life they had once made up  something had come between him and them what it was he did not know  ruth could have told him she was the angel with the flaming sword who guarded their paradise marriage was causing her to make unexpected discoveries with regard to herself before she had always looked on herself as a rather unusually reasonable and certainly not a jealous woman but now she was filled with an active dislike for these quite harmless young men who came to try and share kirk with her  she knew it was utterly illogical a man must have friends life could not be forever a hermitage of two she tried to analyse her objection to these men and came to the conclusion that it was the fact that they had known kirk before she did that caused it  she made a compromise with herself kirk should have friends but they must be new ones in a little while when this crazy desire to keep herself and him alone together in a world of their own should have left her they would begin to build up a circle but these men whose vocabulary included the words do you remember must be eliminated one and all  kirk blissfully unconscious that his future was being arranged for him and the steeringwheel of his life quietly taken out of his hands passed his days in a state of almost painful happiness it never crossed his mind that he had ceased to be master of his fate and captain of his soul the reins were handled so gently that he did not feel them it seemed to him that he was travelling of his own free will along a pleasant path selected by himself  he saw his friends go from him without a regret perhaps at the bottom of his heart he had always had a suspicion of contempt for them he had taken them on their surface value as amusing fellows who were good company of an evening there was not one of them whom he had ever known as real friends know each othernot one except hank jardine and hank had yet to be subjected to the acid test of the new conditions  there were moments when the thought of hank threw a shadow across his happiness he could let these others go but hank was different and something told him that ruth would not like hank  but these shadows were not frequent ruth filled his life too completely to allow him leisure to brood on possibilities of future trouble  looking back it struck him that on their weddingday they had been almost strangers they had taken each other blindly trusting to instinct since then he had been getting to know her it was astonishing how much there was to know there was a fresh discovery to be made about her every day she was a perpetually recurring miracle  the futility of his old life made him wince whenever he dared think of it how he had drifted a useless log on a sluggish current  he was certainly a wholehearted convert as to saul of tarsus so to him there had come a sudden blinding light he could hardly believe that he was the same person who had scoffed at the idea of a man giving up his life to one woman and being happy but then the abstract wife had been a pale bloodless phantom and ruth was real  it was the realness of her that kept him in a state of perpetual amazement to see her moving about the studio to touch her to look at her across the dinnertable to wake in the night and hear her breathing at his side it seemed to him that centuries might pass yet these things would still be wonderful  and always in his heart there was the gratitude for what she had done for him she had given up everything to share his life she had weighed him in the balance against wealth and comfort and her place among the great ones of the world and had chosen him there were times when the thought filled him with a kind of delirious pride times again when he felt a grateful humility that made him long to fall down and worship this goddess who had stooped to him  in a word he was very young very much in love and for the first time in his life was living with every drop of blood in his veins                                       hank returned to new york in due course he came to the studio the same night and he had not been there five minutes before a leaden weight descended on kirks soul it was as he had feared ruth did not like him  hank was not the sort of man who makes universal appeal also he was no ladies man he was long and lean and hardbitten and his supply of conventional small talk was practically nonexistent to get the best out of hank as has been said you had to let him take his coat off and put his feet up on the back of a second chair and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected  ruth conceded none of these things throughout the interview hank sat bolt upright tucking a pair of shoes of the dreadnought class coyly underneath his chair and drew suspiciously at turkish cigarettes from kirks case an air of constraint hung over the party again and again kirk hoped that hank would embark on the epic of his life but shyness kept hank dumb  he had heard on reaching new york that kirk was married but he had learned no details and had conjured up in his mind the vision of a jolly little girl of the bohemian type who would make a fuss over him as kirks oldest friend confronted with ruth he lost a nerve which had never before failed him this gorgeous creature he felt would never put up with those racy descriptions of wild adventures which had endeared him to kirk as soon as he could decently do so he left and kirk returning to the studio after seeing him out sat down moodily trying to convince himself against his judgment that the visit had not been such a failure after all  ruth was playing the piano softly she had turned out all the lights except one which hung above her head shining on her white arms as they moved from where he sat kirk could see her profile her eyes were half closed  the sight of her as it always did sent a thrill through him but he was conscious of an ache behind it he had hoped so much that hank would pass and he knew that he had not why was it that two people so completely one as ruth and himself could not see hank with the same eyes  he knew that she had thought him uncouth and impossible why could not hank have exerted himself more instead of sitting there in that stuffed way why could not ruth have unbent why had not he himself done something to save the situation of the three he blamed himself most he was the one who should have taken the lead and made things pleasant for everybody instead of forcing out conversational platitudes  once or twice he had caught hanks eye and had hated himself for understanding what it said and not being able to deny it he had marked the end of their old relationship the parting of the ways and that a tragedy had been played out that night  he found himself thinking of hank as of a friend who had died what times they had had how smoothly they had got on together he could not recall a single occasion on which they had fallen out from the time when they had fought as boys at the prep school and cemented their friendship the next day after that there had been periods when they had parted sometimes for more than a year but they had always come together again and picked up the threads as neatly as if there had been no gap in their intimacy  he had gone to college hank had started on the roving life which suited his temperament but they had never lost touch with each other and now it was all over they would meet again but it would not be the same the angel with the flaming sword stood between them  for the first time since the delirium of marriage had seized upon him kirk was conscious of a feeling that all was not for the best in a best of all possible worlds a feeling of regret not that he had marriedthe mere thought would have been a blasphemybut that marriage was such a complicated affair he liked a calm life free from complications and now they were springing up on every side  there was the matter of the models kirk had supposed that it was only in the comic papers that the artists wife objected to his employing models he had classed it with the motherinlaw joke respecting it for its antiquity but not imagining that it ever really happened and ruth had brought this absurd situation into the sphere of practical politics only a few days ago  since his marriage kirk had dropped his work almost entirely there had seemed to be no time for it he liked to spend his days going round the stores with ruth buying her things or looking in at the windows of fifth avenue shops and choosing what he would buy her when he had made his fortune it was agreed upon between them that he was to make his fortune some day  kirks painting had always been more of a hobby with him than a profession he knew that he had talent but talent without hard work is a poor weapon and he had always shirked hard work he had an instinct for colour but his drawing was uncertain he hated linework while knowing that only through steady practice at linework could he achieve his artistic salvation he was an amateur and a lazy amateur  but once in a while the work fever would grip him it had gripped him a few days before hanks visit an idea for a picture had come to him and he had set to work upon it with his usual impulsiveness  this had involved the arrival of miss hilda vince at the studio there was no harm in miss vince her morals were irreproachable she supported a workshy father and was engaged to be married to a young gentleman who travelled for a hat firm but she was of a chatty disposition and no respecter of persons she had posed frequently for kirk in his bachelor days and was accustomed to call him by his first namea fact which kirk had forgotten until ruth who had been out in the park came in  miss vince was saying at the moment so i says to her kirks just phoned to me to sit what kirk she says is he doin a bit of work for a change well its about time aw kirk dont need to work i says hes a plute hes got it in gobs so  i didnt know you were busy dear said ruth i wont interrupt you  she went out  was that your wife inquired miss vince shes got a sweet face say i read the piece about you and her in the paper you certainly got a nerve kirk breaking in on the millionaires that way  that night ruth spoke her mind about miss vince it was in vain that kirk touched on the workshy father dwelt feelingly on the young gentleman who travelled in hats ruth had made up her mind it was thumbs down for miss vince  but if im to paint said kirk i must have models  there must be hundreds who dont call you by your christian name  after about five minutes they all do said kirk its a way theyve got they mean no harm  ruth then made this brilliant suggestion kirk dear why dont you paint landscapes  in spite of his annoyance he laughed  why dont i paint landscapes ruth because im not a landscape painter thats why  you could learn  its a different branch of the trade altogether you might just as well tell a catcher to pitch  well anyhow reported ruth with spirit i wont have that vince creature in the place again  it was the first time she had jerked at the reins or given any sign that she was holding them and undoubtedly this was the moment at which kirk should have said my dearest the time has come for me to state plainly that my soul is my own i decline to give in to this absurd suggestion marriage is an affair of give and take not a circus where one party holds the hoop while the other jumps through and shams dead we shall be happier later on if we get this clearly into our heads now  what he did say was very well dear ill write and tell her not to come  he knew he was being abominably weak but he did not care he even felt a certain pleasure in his surrender big muscular men are given to this feebleness with women hercules probably wore an idiotic grin of happiness when he spun wool for omphale  since then the picture had been laid aside but kirks desire to be up and at it had grown with inaction when a lazy man does make up his mind to assail a piece of work he is like a dog with a bone                                       the music had stopped ruth swung round  what are you dreaming about kirk  kirk came to himself with a start  i was thinking of a lot of things for one about that picture of mine  what about it  well when i was going to finish it  why dont you  kirk laughed  wheres my model youve scared her up a tree and i cant coax her down  ruth came over to him and sat down on a low chair at his side she put her arm round his waist and rested her head in the hollow of his shoulder  is he pining for his horrid vince girl the poor boy  he certainly is said kirk or at any rate for some understudy to her  we must think do they all call you kirk  ive never met one who didnt  what horrible creatures you artists are  my dear kid you dont understand the thing at all when youre painting a model she ceases to be a girl at all you dont think of her as anything except a sort of layfigure  good gracious does your layfigure call you kirk too  it always looks as if it were going to  ruth shuddered  its a repulsive thing i hate it it gives me the creeps i came in here last night and switched on the light and there it was goggling at me  are you getting nervous  ruths face grew grave  do you know kirk i really believe i am this morning as i was dressing i suddenly got the most awful feeling that something terrible was going to happen i dont know what it was perfectly vague i just felt a kind of horror it passed off in a moment or two but while it lastedugh  how ghastly why didnt you tell me before you must be run down look here lets shut up this place and get out to florida or somewhere for the winter  lets dont do anything of the kind florida indeed for the love of mike as steve would say its much too expensive you know kirk we are both frightfully extravagant im sure we are spending too much money as it is you know you sold out some of your capital only the other day  it was only that once and you had set your heart on that pendant surely to goodness if i drag you away from a comfortable home to live in a hovel the least i can do is to  you didnt drag me i just walked in and sat down and you couldnt think how to get rid of me so in despair you married me  that was it and now ive got to set to work and make a fortune andwhat do you call itsupport you in the style to which you have been accustomed which brings us back to the picture i dont suppose i shall get ten dollars for it but i feel i shall curl up and die if i dont get it finished are you absolutely determined about the vince girl  im adamant im granite im chilled steel oh kirk cant you find a nice motherly old model with white hair and spectacles i shouldnt mind her calling you by your first name  but its absurd i told you just now that an artist doesnt look on his models as human beings while  i know ive read all about that in books and i believed it then why when i married you i said to myself i mustnt be foolish kirks an artist i mustnt be a comicsupplement wife and object to his using models oh i was going to be so good and reasonable you would have loved me and then when it came to the real thing i found i just could not stand it i know its silly of me i know just as well as you do that miss vince is quite a nice girl really and is going to make a splendid mrs travelling salesman but that doesnt help me its my wicked nature i suppose im just a plain cat and thats all there is to it look at the way i treat your friends  kirk started  you jumped said ruth you jerked my head do you think i didnt know you had noticed it i knew how unhappy you were when mr jardine was here and i just hated myself  didnt you like hank asked kirk  ruth was silent for a moment  i wish you would kirk went on you dont know what a real white man old hank is you didnt see him properly that night he was nervous but hes one of the very best god ever made weve known each other all our lives he and i  dont tell me cried ruth dont you see that thats just the reason why i cant like him dont tell me about the things you and he did together unless you want me to hate him dont you understand dear its the same with all your friends im jealous of them for having known you before i did and i hate these models because they come into a part of your life into which i cant i want you all to myself i want to be your whole life i know its idiotic and impossible but i do  you are my whole life said kirk seriously i wasnt born till i met you there isnt a single moment when you are not my whole life  she pressed her head contentedly against his arm  kirk  yes  let me pose for your picture  what you couldnt  why not  its terribly hard work its an awful strain  im sure im as strong as that vince girl you ask steve hes seen me throw the medicineball  but posing is different hilda vince has been trained for it  well let me try at any rate  but  do and ill promise to like your hank and not put on my grand manner when he begins telling me what fun you and he used to have in the good old days before i was born or thought of may i  but  quick promise  very well  you dear ill be the best model you ever had i wont move a muscle and ill stand there till i drop  youll do nothing of the kind youll come right down off that modelthrone the instant you feel the least bit tired                                       the picture which kirk was painting was one of those pictures which thousands of young artists are working on unceasingly every day kirks ideas about it were in a delightfully vague state he had a notion that it might turn out in the end as carmen on the other hand if anything went wrong and he failed to insert a sufficient amount of wild devilry into it he could always hedge by calling it a reverie or the spanish maiden  possibly if the thing became too pensive and soulful altogether he might give it some title suggestive of the absent lover at the bullfightthe toreadors brideor something of that sort the only point on which he was solid was that it was to strike the spanish note and to this end he gave ruth a costume of black and orange and posed her on the modelthrone with a rose in her hair  privately he had decided that ten minutes would be ruths limit he knew something of the strain of sitting to an artist  tired he asked at the end of this period  ruth shook her head and smiled  you must be come and sit down and take a rest  im quite all right dear go on with your work  well shout out the moment you feel youve had enough  he began to paint again the minutes went by and ruth made no movement he began to grow absorbed in his work he lost count of time ruth ceased to be ruth ceased even to be flesh and blood she was just something he was painting  kirk  the sharp suddenness of the cry brought him to his feet quivering ruth was swaying on the modelthrone her eyes were staring straight before her and her face was twisted with fear  as he sprang forward she fell pitching stiffly head foremost as he had seen men fall in the ring her arms hanging at her sides and he caught her  he carried her to the couch and laid her down he hung for an instant in doubt whether to go for water or telephone for the doctor he decided on the telephone  he hung up the receiver and went back to ruth she stirred and gave a little moan he flew upstairs and returned with a pitcher of water when he got back ruth was sitting up the look of terror was gone from her face she smiled at him a faint curiously happy smile he flung himself on his knees beside her his arm round her waist and burst into a babble of selfreproach  he cursed himself for being such a brute such a beast as to let her stand there tiring herself to death she must never do it again he was a devil he ought to have known she could not stand it he was not fit to be married he was not fit to live  ruth ruffled his hair  stop abusing my husband she said im fond of him did you catch me kirk  yes thank god i got to you just in time  thats the last thing i remember wondering if you would you seemed such miles and miles away it was like looking at something in a mist through the wrong end of a telescope oh kirk  yes honey  it came again that awful feeling as if something dreadful was going to happen and then i felt myself going she paused kirk i think i know now i understand and oh im so happy  she buried her face on his shoulder and they stayed there silent till there came a ring at the bell kirk got up george pennicut ushered in the doctor it was the same little old doctor who had ministered to george in his hour of need  feeling better mrs winfield he said as he caught sight of ruth your husband told me over the phone that you were unconscious  she fainted cried kirk it was all through me i  the doctor took him by the shoulders he had to stretch to do it  you go away young man he said take a walk round the block you arent on in this scene                                       kirk was waiting in the hall when he left a few minutes later  well he said anxiously  well said the little doctor  is she all right theres nothing wrong is there  the doctor grinned a friendly grin  on the contrary he said you ought to be very pleased  what do you mean  its quite a commonplace occurrence though i suppose it will seem like a miracle to you but believe me it has happened before if it hadnt you and i wouldnt be here now  kirk looked at him in utter astonishment his words seemed meaningless and then suddenly he understood and his heart seemed to stand still  you dont mean he said huskily  yes i do said the doctor goodbye my boy ive got to hurry off you caught me just as i was starting for the hospital                                       kirk went back to the studio his mind in a whirl ruth was lying on the couch she looked up as the door opened he came quickly to her side  ruth he muttered  her eyes were shining with a wonderful light of joy she drew his head down and kissed him  oh kirk she whispered im happy im happy ive wanted this so  he could not speak he sat on the edge of the couch and looked at her she had been wonderful to him before she was a thousand times more wonderful now     chapter viii  suspense   it seemed to kirk as the days went by that a mist of unreality fell like a curtain between him and the things of this world commonplace objects lost their character and became things to marvel at there was a new bond of sympathy between the world and himself  a citizen walking in the park with his children became a kind of miracle here was a man who had travelled the road which he was travelling now who had had the same hopes and fear and wonder once he encountered a prosperous looking individual moving like a liner among tugs in the midst of no fewer than six offspring kirk fixed him with such a concentrated stare of emotion and excitement that the other was alarmed and went on his way alertly as one in the presence of danger it is probable that if kirk had happened to ask him the time at that moment or indeed addressed him at all he would have screamed for the police  the mystery of childbirth and the wonder of it obsessed kirk as time crept on and still more was he conscious of the horrible dread that was gathering within him ruths unvarying cheerfulness was to him almost uncanny none of the doubts and fears which blackened his life appeared to touch her once he confided these to his friend the little doctor and was thoroughly bullied by him for his foolishness but in spite of ridicule the fear crept back cringingly like a whipped dog  and then time moving on its leisurely but businesslike fashion the day arrived and for the first time in his life kirk knew what fear really meant all that he had experienced till now had he saw been a mild apprehension not worthy of a stronger name his flesh crawled with the thoughts which rose in his mind like black bubbles in a pond there were moments when the temptation to stupefy himself with drink was almost irresistible  it was his utter uselessness that paralysed him he seemed destined to be of no help to ruth at just those crises when she needed him most when she was facing her father with the news of the marriage he had not been at her side and now when she was fighting for her life he could do nothing but pace the empty quiet studio and think  the doctor had arrived at eight oclock cheery as ever and had come downstairs after seeing ruth to ask him to telephone to mrs porter in his overwrought state this had jarred upon kirk here he felt was somebody who could help where he was useless  mrs porter had appeared in a cab and had had the cold brutality to ask for a glass of sherry and a sandwich before going upstairs she put forward the lame excuse that she had not dined kirk gave her the sherry and sandwich and resumed his patrol in a glow of indignation the idea of any one requiring food at this moment struck him as gross and revolting  his wrath did not last in a short while fear came back into its own  the hands of the clock pointed to ten before he stooped to following mrs porters example george pennicut had been sent out so he went into the little kitchen where he found eggs which he mixed with milk and swallowed after this he was aware of a momentary excess of optimism the future looked a little brighter but not for long presently he was prowling the studio as restlessly as ever  men of kirks type are not given to deep thought until now he had probably never spent more than a couple of minutes consecutively in selfexamination this vigil forced him upon himself and caused him to pass his character under review with strange and unsatisfactory results he had never realised before what a curiously contemptible and useless person he was it seemed to him that this was all he was fit forto hang about doing nothing while everybody else was busy and proving his or her own worth  a door opened and the little doctor came quietly down the stairs kirk sprang at him  well  my dear man everythings going splendidly couldnt be better the doctors eyes searched his face when did you have anything to eat last  i dont know i had some eggs and milk i dont know when  the doctor took him by the shoulders and hustled him into the kitchen where he searched and found meat and bread  eat that he said ill have some too  i couldnt  and some whisky where do you keep it  after the first few mouthfuls kirk ate wolfishly the doctor munched a sandwich with the placidity of a summer boarder at a picnic his calmness amazed and almost shocked kirk  you cant help her by killing yourself said the doctor philosophically i like that woman with the gimlet eyes at least i dont but shes got sense go on you havent done yet another highball wont hurt you he eyed kirk with some sympathy its a bad time for you of course  for me good god  you want to keep your nerve nothing awful is going to happen  if only there was something i could do  they also serve who only stand and wait quoted the doctor sententiously there is something you can do  what  light your pipe and take it easy  kirk snorted  i mean it in a very short while now you will be required to take the stage and embrace your son or daughter as the case may be you dont want to appear looking as if you had been run over by an automobile after a night out you want your appearance to give mrs winfield as little of a shock as possible bear that in mind well i must be going  and kirk was alone again  the food and the drink and the doctors words had a good effect his mind became quieter he sat down and filled his pipe after a few puffs he replaced it in his pocket it seemed too callous to think of smoking now the doctor was a good fellow but he did not understand all the same he was glad that he had had that whisky it had certainly put heart into him for the moment  what was happening upstairs he strained his ears but could hear nothing  gradually as he waited his mood of morbid selfcriticism returned he had sunk once more into the depths when he was aware of a soft tapping the door bell rang very gently he went to the door and opened it  i kinder thought id look in and see how things were getting along said a voice  it was steve a subdued and furtive steve kirks heart leaped at the sight of him it was as if he had found something solid to cling to in a shifting world  come in steve  he spoke huskily steve sidled into the studio embarrassment written on every line of him  dont mind my butting in do you ive been walking up and down and round the block till every cop on the islands standing by waiting for me to pull something another minute and theyd have pinched me on suspicion i just felt i had to come and see how miss ruth was making out  the doctor was down here just now he said everything was going well  i guess he knows his business  there was a silence kirks ears were straining for sounds from above  its hell said steve  kirk nodded this kind of talk was more what he wanted the doctor meant well but he was too professional steve was human  go and get yourself a drink steve i expect you need one  steve shook his head  waggon he said briefly and there was silence again  say kirk  yes  what a wonder she is miss ruth i mean ive helped her throw that medicineballoftenyou wouldnt believe shes a wonder he paused say this is hell aint it  kirk did not answer it was very quiet in the studio now in the street outside a heavy waggon rumbled part somebody shouted a few words of a popular song steve sprang to his feet  ill fix that guy he said but the singing ceased and he sat down again  kirk got up and began to walk quickly up and down steve watched him furtively  you want to take your mind off it he said youll be all in if you keep on worrying about it in that way  kirk stopped in his stride  thats what the doctor said he snapped savagely what do you two fools think im made of he recovered himself quickly ashamed of the outburst im sorry steve dont mind anything i say its awfully good of you to have come here and im not going to forget it  steve scratched his chin reflectively  say ill tell you something he said my mother told me once that when i was born my old dad took it just like you found he was getting all worked up by having to hang around and do nothing so he says to himself ive got to take my mind off this business or its me for the foolishhouse  well sir there was a big guy down on that street whod been picking on dad good and hard for a mighty long while and this guy suddenly comes into dads mind he felt of his muscle dad did gee he says to himself i believe the way im feeling i could just go and eat up that gink right away and the more he thought of it the better it looked to him so all of a sudden he grabs his hat and beats it like a streak down to the saloon on the corner where he knew the feller would be at that time and he goes straight up to him and hands him one  back comes the guy at himhe was a great big son of a gun weighing thirty pounds more than dadand him and dad mixes it right there in the saloon till the barkeep and about fifty other fellers throws them out and they goes off to a vacant lot to finish the thing and dads so worked up that he gives the other guy his till he hollers that thats all hell want and then dad goes home and waits quite quiet and happy and peaceful till they tell him im there  steve paused  kirk he said then how would you like a round or two with the small gloves just to get things off your mind for a spell and pass the time my dad said he found it eased him mighty good  kirk stared at him  just a couple of rounds urged steve and you can go all out at that i shant mind just try to think im some guy thats been picking on you and let me have it see what i mean  for the first time that day the faint ghost of a grin appeared on kirks face  i wonder if youre right steve  i know im right and say dont think i dont need it too i aint known miss ruth all this time for nothing youll be doing me a kindness if you knock my face in  the small gloves occupied a place of honour to themselves in a lower drawer it was not often that kirk used them in his friendly bouts with steve for ordinary occasions the larger and more padded species met with his approval steve during these daily sparring encounters was amiability itself but he could not be counted upon not to forget himself for an occasional moment in the heat of the fray and though kirk was courageous enough he preferred to preserve the regularity of his features at the expense of a little extra excitement  once after a brisk rally he had gone about the world looking as if he was suffering from mumps owing to a right hook which no one regretted more than steve himself  but today was different and kirk felt that even a repetition of that lethal punch would be welcome  steve when the contest opened was disposed to be consolatory in word as well as deed he kept up a desultory conversation as he circled and feinted  you gotta look at it this way he began sidestepping a left it aint often you hear of anything going wrong at times like this you gotta rememberhe hooked kirk neatly on the jawthat he concluded  kirk came back with a swing at the body which made his adversary grunt  thats true he said  sure rejoined steve a little breathlessly falling into a clinch  they moved warily round each other  so said steve blocking a left that ought to comfort you some  kirk nodded he guessed correctly that the other was alluding to his last speech not to the counter which had just made the sight of his left eye a little uncertain  gradually as the bout progressed kirk began to lose the slight diffidence which had hampered him at the start he had been feeling so wonderfully friendly toward steve so grateful for his presence and his sympathy that it had been hard in spite of the others admonitions to enter into the fray with any real conviction moreover subconsciously he was listening all the time for sounds from above which never came  these things gave a certain lameness to his operations it was immediately after this blow in the eye mentioned above that he ceased to be an individual with private troubles and a wandering mind and became a boxer pure and simple his whole brain concentrated on the problem of how to get past his opponents guard  steve recognizing the change in an instant congratulated himself on the success of his treatment it had worked even more quickly than he had hoped he helped the cure with another swift jab which shot over kirks guard  kirk came in with a rush steve slipped him kirk rushed again steve receiving a hard punch on a nose which though accustomed to such assaults had never grown really to enjoy them began to feel a slight diminution of his detached attitude toward this encounter till now his position had been purely that of the kindly physician soothing a patient the rapidity with which the patient was permitting himself to be soothed rendered the post of physician something of a sinecure and steve as kirk had done began to slip back into the boxer  it was while he was in what might be called a transition stage that an unexpected swing sent him with some violence against the wall and from that moment nature asserted itself a curious set look appeared on his face wrinkles creased his forehead his jaw protruded slightly  kirk made another rush this time steve did not slip he went to meet it head down and hands busy                                       mrs lora delane porter came downstairs with the measured impressiveness of one who bears weighty news her determined face was pale and tired as it had every right to be but she bore herself proudly as one who has fought and not been defeated  mr winfield she said  there was no answer looking about her she found the studio empty  then from behind the closed door of the inner room she was aware of a strange shuffling sound she listened astonished she heard a gasp then curious thuds finally a bump louder than the thuds and then there was silence  these things surprised mrs porter she opened the door and looked in  it says much for her iron selfcontrol that she remained quiet at this point a lesser person after a far less tiring ordeal than she had passed through would have found relief in some cry or exclamation possibly even in a scream  against the far wall breathing hard and fondling his left eye with a fourounce glove leaned steve dingle his nose was bleeding somewhat freely but this he appeared to consider a trifle unworthy of serious attention on the floor an even more disturbing spectacle kirk lay at full length to mrs porters startled gaze he appeared to be dead he too was bleeding but he was not in a position to notice it  its all right maam said steve removing the hand from his face and revealing an eye which for spectacular dilapidation must have rivalled the epochmaking one which had so excited his mother on a famous occasion its nothing serious  has mr winfield fainted  not exactly fainted maam its like this hed got me clear up in a corner and i seen its up to me if i dont want to be knocked through the wall so i has to cross him maybe id gotten a little worked up myself by then but it was my fault i told him to go all out and he sure did this eyes going to be a pippin tomorrow  mrs porter examined the wounded organ with interest  that i suppose mr dingle is what you call a blue eye  it sure is maam  what has been happening  well its this way i see hes all worked up sitting around doing nothing except wait so i makes him come and spar a round to take his mind off it my old dad maam when i was coming along found that dope fixed him all right so i reckoned it would do as much good here my old dad went and beat the block off a fellow down our street and it done him a lot of good  mrs porter shook his gloved hand  mr dingle she said with enthusiasm i really believe that you are the only sensible man i have ever met your common sense is astonishing i have no doubt you saved mr winfield from a nervous breakdown would you be kind enough when you are rested to fetch some water and bring him to and inform him that he is the father of a son     chapter ix  the white hope is turned down   william bannister winfield was the most wonderful child of course you had to have a certain amount of intelligence to see this to the vapid and irreflective observer he was not much to look at in the early stages of his career having a doughlike face almost entirely devoid of nose a lacklustre eye and the general appearance of a poached egg his immediate circle of intimates however thought him a model of manly beauty and there was the undeniable fact that he had come into the world weighing nine pounds take him for all in all a lad of promise  kirks sense of being in a dream continued his identity seemed to have undergone a change the person he had known as kirk winfield had disappeared to be succeeded by a curious individual bubbling over with an absurd pride for which it was not easy to find an outlet hitherto a rather reserved man he was conscious now of a desire to accost perfect strangers in the street and inform them that he was not the ordinary person they probably imagined but a father with an intensely unusual son at home and if they did not believe him they could come right along and see for themselves  the only flaw in his happiness at the moment was the fact that his circle of friends was so small he had not missed the old brigade of the studio before but now the humblest of them would have been welcome provided he would have sat still and listened even percy shanklyn would have been acceptable as an audience  steve excellent fellow was always glad to listen to him on his favourite subject he had many long talks with steve on the question of williams future steve as the infants godfather which post he had claimed and secured at an early date had definite views on the matter  here held steve was the chance of a lifetime with proper training a baby of such obvious muscular promise might be made the greatest fighter that ever stepped into the ring he was the real white hope he advised kirk to direct williams education on the lines which would insure his being when the time was ripe undisputed heavyweight champion of the world to steve life outside the ring was a poor affair practically barren of prizes for the ambitious  mrs lora delane porter eyeing williams brow of which there was plenty he being at this time extremely short of hair predicted a less robust and more intellectual future for him something more on the lines of president of some great university or ambassador at some important court struck her as his logical sphere  kirks view was that he should combine both careers and be an ambassador who took a few weeks off every now and then in order to defend his champions belt in his spare time he might paint a picture or two  ruth hesitated between the army the navy the bar and business but every one was agreed that william was to be something special  this remarkable child had a keen sense of humour thus he seldom began to cry in his best vein till the small hours of the morning and on these occasions he would almost invariably begin again after he had been officially pronounced to be asleep his sudden grab at the hair of any adult who happened to come within reach was very droll too  as to his other characteristics he was of rather an imperious nature he liked to be waited on he wanted what he wanted when he wanted it the greater part of his attention being occupied at this period with the important duty of chewing his thumb he assigned the drudgery of life to his dependants their duties were to see that he got up in the morning dressed and took his tub and after that to hang around on the chance of general orders  any idea kirk may have had of resuming his work was abandoned during these months no model young and breezy or whitehaired and motherly passed the studio doors life was far too interesting for work the canvas which might have become carmen or a reverie or even the toreadors bride lay unfinished and neglected in a corner  it astonished kirk to find how strong the paternal instinct was in him in the days when he had allowed his mind to dwell upon the abstract wife he had sometimes gone a step further and conjured up the abstract baby the result had always been to fill him with a firm conviction that the most persuasive of wild horses should not drag him from his bachelor seclusion he had had definite ideas on babies as a class and here he was with his world pivoting on one of them it was curious  the white hope as steve called his godsonpossibly with the idea of influencing him by suggestiongrew the ailments which attacked lesser babies passed him by he avoided croup and even whoopingcough paid him but a flying visit hardly worth mentioning his first tooth gave him a little trouble but that is the sort of thing which may happen to anyone and the spirited way in which he protested against the indignity of cutting it was proof of a high soul  such was the remarkableness of this child that it annoyed kirk more and more that he should be obliged to give the exhibition of his extraordinary qualities to so small an audience ruth felt the same and it was for this reason that the first overtures were made to the silent camp which contained her father and her brother bailey  since that evening in the library there had come no sign from the house on fifth avenue that its inmates were aware of her existence life had been too full till now to make this a cause of trouble to her but with william bannister becoming every day more amazing the desire came to her to try and heal the breach her father had so ordered his life in his relation to his children that ruths affection was not so deep as it might have been but after all he was william bannisters grandfather and as such entitled to consideration  it was these reflections that led to steves state visit to john bannisterprobably the greatest fiasco on record  steve had been selected for the feat on the strength of his having the right of entry to the fifth avenue house for john bannister was still obeying his doctors orders and taking his daily spell of exercise with the pugilistand steve bungled it hopelessly  his task was not a simple one he was instructed to employ tact to hint rather than to speak to say nothing to convey the impression that ruth in any way regretted the step she had taken to give the idea that it was a matter of complete indifference to her whether she ever saw her father again or not yet at the same time to make it quite clear that she was very anxious to see him as soon as possible  william bannister grown to maturity and upholding the interests of his country as ambassador at some important court might have jibbed at the mission  william bannister was to accompany steve and be produced dramatically to support verbal arguments it seemed to ruth that for her father to resist william when he saw him was an impossibility williams position was that of the ace of trumps in the cards which steve was to play  steve made a few objections his chief argument against taking up the post assigned to him was that he was a roughneck and that the job in question was one which no roughneck however gifted in the matter of left hooks could hope to carry through with real success but he yielded to pressure and the expedition set out  william bannister at this time was at an age when he was beginning to talk a little and walk a little and take a great interest in things his walking was a bit amateurish and his speech rather hard to follow unless you had the key to it but nobody could have denied that his walk though staggery was a genuine walk and his speech though limited genuine speech within the meaning of the act  he made no objections to the expedition on being told that he was going to see his grandpa he nodded curtly and said gwawah after his custom for as a conversationalist perhaps the best description of him is to say that he tried hard he rarely paused for a word when in difficulties he said something he did not seek refuge in silence that the something was not always immediately intelligible was the fault of his audience for not listening more carefully  perhaps the real mistake of the expedition was the nature of its baggage william bannister had stood out for being allowed to take with him his wheelbarrow his box of bricks and his particular favourite the dying pig which you blew out and then allowed to collapse with a pleasing noise these properties had struck his parents as excessive but he was firm and when he gave signs of being determined to fight it out on these lines if it took all the summer they gave in  steve had no difficulty in smuggling william into his grandfathers house he was a great favourite below stairs there his great ally was the english butler keggs  keggs was a stout dignified pigeontoed old sinner who cast off the butler when not on duty and displayed himself as something of a rounder he was a man of many parts it was his chief relaxation to look in at broadway hotels while some big fight was in progress out west to watch the ticker and assure himself that the man he had backed with a portion of the loot which he had accumulated in the form of tips was doing justice to his judgment for in private keggs was essentially the sport  it was this that so endeared steve to him a few years ago keggs had won considerable sums by backing steve and the latter was always given to understand that as far as the lower regions of it were concerned the house on fifth avenue was open to him at all hours  today he greeted steve with enthusiasm and suggested a cigar in the pantry before the latter should proceed to his work  he aint ready for you yet mr dingle hes lookin over some papers infor goodness sake whos this  he had caught sight of william bannister who having wriggled free of steve was being made much of by the maids  the kid said steve briefly  not  steve nodded  sure his grandson  keggs solemnity increased  you arent going to take him upstairs with you  surest thing you know thats why i brought him  dont you do it mr dingle es in an awful temper this morninghe gets worse and worsehell fire you as soon as look at you  cant be helped ive got me instructions  you always were game said keggs admiringly i used to see that quick enough before you retired from active work well good luck to you mr dingle  steve gathered up william bannister the wheelbarrow the box of bricks and the dying pig and made his way to the gymnasium  the worst of these prearranged scenes is that they never happen just as one figured them in ones mind steve had expected to have to wait a few minutes in the gymnasium then there would be a step outside and the old man would enter the beauty of this to steves mind was that he himself would be discovered as the stage term is the onus of entering and opening the conversation would be on mr bannister and as everybody who has ever had an awkward interview knows this makes all the difference  but the minutes passed and still no grandfather the nervousness which he had with difficulty expelled began to return to steve this was exactly like having to wait in the ring while ones opponent tried to get ones goat by dawdling in the dressing room  an attempt to relieve himself by punching the ball was a dismal failure at the first bang of the leather against the wood william bannister who had been working in a preoccupied way at the dying pig threw his head back and howled and would not be comforted till steve took out the rope and skipped before him much as dancers used to dance before oriental monarchs in the old days  steve was just saying to himself for the fiftieth time that he was a fool to have come when keggs arrived with the news that mr bannister was too busy to take his usual exercise this morning and that steve was at liberty to go  it speaks well for steves character that he did not go he would have given much to retire for the old man was one of the few people who inspired in him anything resembling fear but he could not return tamely to the studio with his mission unaccomplished  say ask him if he can see me for a minute say it is important  keggs eye rested on william bannister and he shook his head  i shouldnt mr dingle really i shouldnt you dont know what an ugly mood hes in somethings been worrying him its what you might call courting disaster  gee do you think i want to do it ive just got to thats all there is to it  a few moments later keggs returned with the news that mr bannister would see dingle in the library  come along kid said steve gimme hold of the excess baggage and lets get a move on  so in the end it was mr bannister who was discovered and steve who made the entrance and as steve pointed out to kirk later it just made all the difference  the effect of the change on steve was to make him almost rollicking in his manner as if he and mr bannister were the nucleus of an old home week celebration or two old college chums meeting after long absence nervousness on the rare occasions when he suffered from it generally had that effect on him  he breezed into the library carrying the wheelbarrow the box of bricks and the dying pig and trailing william in his wake williams grandfather was seated with his back to the door dictating a letter to one of his secretaries  he looked up as steve entered he took in steve and william in a rapid glance and guessed the latters identity in an instant he had expected something of this sort ever since he had heard of his grandsons birth indeed he had been somewhat surprised that the visit had not occurred before  he betrayed no surprise  one moment dingle he said and turned to the secretary again a faint sneer came and went on his face  the delay completed steves discomfiture he placed the wheel harrow on the floor the box of bricks on the wheelbarrow and the dying pig on the box of bricks whence it was instantly removed and inflated by william  referring to your letter of the eighth said mr bannister in his cold level voice  he was interrupted by the incisive cry of the dying pig  ask your son to be quiet dingle he said impassively  steve was staggered  say this aint my son squire he began breezily  your nephew then or whatever relation he happens to be to you  he resumed his dictation steve wiped his forehead and looked helplessly at the white hope who having discarded the dying pig was now busy with the box of bricks  steve wished he had not come he was accustomed to the primitive exhibition of emotions having moved in circles where the wrathful expressed their wrath in a normal manner  anger which found its expression in an exaggerated politeness was out of his line and made him uncomfortable  after what seemed to him a century john bannister dismissed the secretary even then however he did not come immediately to steve he remained for a few moments writing with his back turned then just when steve had given up hope of ever securing his attention he turned suddenly  well  say its this way colonel steve had begun when a triumphant cry from the direction of the open window stopped him the white hope was kneeling on a chair looking down into the street  bix he explained over his shoulder  kindly ring the bell dingle said mr bannister unmoved your little nephew appears to have dropped his bricks into fifth avenue  in answer to the summons keggs appeared he looked anxious  keggs said mr bannister tell one of the footmen to go out into the avenue and pick up some wooden bricks which he will find there dingles little brother has let some fall  as keggs left the room steves pentup nervousness exploded in a whirl of words  aw say boss quit yer kiddin you know this kid aint anything to do with me why say how would he be any relation of a roughneck like me come off the roof bo you know well enough who he is hes your grandson on the level  mr bannister looked at william now engaged in running the wheelbarrow up and down the room emitting the while a curious sound possibly to encourage an imaginary horse the inspection did not seem to excite him or afford him any pleasure  oh he said  steve was damped but resumed gamely  say boss this is the greatest kid on earth im not stringing you honest hes a wonder on the level did you ever see a kid that age with a pair of shoulders on him like what this kids got say squire whats the matter with calling the fight off and starting fair miss ruth would be tickled to death if you would can the rough stuff colonel i know you think youve been given a raw deal kirk chipping in like that and copping off miss ruth but for the love of mike what does it matter you seen for yourself what a dandy kid this is well then check your grouch with your hat do the square thing have out the auto and come right round to the studio and make it up whats wrong with that colonel honest theyd be tickled clean through  at this point keggs entered followed by a footman carrying wooden bricks  keggs said mr bannister telephone for the automobile at once  thats the talk colonel cried steve joyfully i know you were a sport  to take me down to wall street  keggs bowed  oh keggs said mr bannister as he turned to leave  sir  another thing see that dingle does not enter the house again  and mr bannister resumed his writing while steve gathering up the wheelbarrow the box of bricks and the dying pig took william by the hand and retreated                                       that terminated ruths attempts to conciliate her father  there remained bailey from bailey she was prepared to stand no nonsense meeting him on the street she fairly kidnapped him driving him into a taxicab and pushing him into the studio where he was confronted by his nephew  bailey came poorly through the ordeal william bannister a stern critic weighed him up in one long stare found him wanting and announced his decision with all the strength of powerful lungs in the end he had to be removed hiccupping and bailey after lingering a few uneasy moments making conversation to kirk departed with such a look about the back of him as he sprang into his cab that ruth felt that the visit was one which would not be repeated  she went back into the studio with a rather heavy heart she was fond of bailey  the sight of kirk restored her after all what had happened was only what she had expected she had chosen her path and she did not regret it     chapter x  an interlude of peace   two events of importance in the small world which centred round william b winfield occurred at about this time the first was the entrance of mamie the second the exit of mrs porter  mamie was the last of a series of nurses who came and went in somewhat rapid succession during the early years of the white hopes life she was introduced by steve who it seemed had known her since she was a child she was the nineteenyearold daughter of a compositor on one of the morning papers a little mouselike thing with tiny hands and feet a soft voice and eyes that took up far more than their fair share of her face  she had had no professional experience as a nurserymaid but as steve pointed out the fact that in the absence of her mother who had died some years previously she had had sole charge of three small brothers at the age when small brothers are least easily handled and had steered them through to the officeboy age without mishap put her extremely high in the class of gifted amateurs mamie was accordingly given a trial and survived it triumphantly william bannister that discerning youth took to her at once kirk liked the neat way she moved about the studio his heart being still sore at the performance of one of her predecessors who had upset and put a substantial foot through his masterpiece that same ariadne in naxos which lora delane porter had criticised on the occasion of her first visit to the studio ruth for her part was delighted with mamie  as for steve though as an outside member of the firm he cannot be considered to count he had long ago made up his mind about her some time before when he had found it impossible for him to be in her presence still less to converse with her without experiencing a warm clammy shooting sensation and a feeling of general weakness similar to that which follows a welldirected blow at the solar plexus he had come to the conclusion that he must be in love the furious jealousy which assailed him on seeing her embraced by and embracing a stout person old enough to be her father convinced him of this  the discovery that the stout man actually was her fathers brother relieved his mind to a certain extent but the episode left him shaken he made up his mind to propose at once and get it over when mamie joined the garrison of no 90 a year later the dashing feat was still unperformed there was that about mamie which unmanned steve she was so small and dainty that the ruggedness which had once been his pride seemed to him when he thought of her an insuperable defect the conviction that he was a roughneck deepened in him and tied his tongue  the defection of mrs porter was a gradual affair from a very early period in the new regime she had been dissatisfied accustomed to rule she found herself in an unexpectedly minor position she had definite views on the hygienic upbringing of children and these she imparted to ruth who listened pleasantly smiled and ignored them  mrs porter was not used to such treatment she found ruth considerably less malleable than she had been before marriage and she resented the change  kirk coming in one afternoon found ruth laughing  its only aunt lora she said she will come in and lecture me on how to raise babies shes crazy about microbes its the new idea sterilization and all that she thinks that everything a child touches ought to be sterilized first to kill the germs bills running awful risks being allowed to play about the studio like this  kirk looked at his son and heir who was submitting at that moment to be bathed he was standing up it was a peculiarity of his that he refused to sit down in a bath being apparently under the impression when asked to do so that there was a conspiracy afoot to drown him  i dont see how the kid could be much fitter  its not so much what he is now she is worrying about what might happen to him she can talk about bacilli till your flesh creeps honestly if bill ever did get really ill i believe aunt lora could talk me round to her views about them in a minute its only the fact that he is so splendidly well that makes it seem so absurd  kirk laughed  its all very well to laugh you havent heard her ive caught myself wavering a dozen times do you know she says a child ought not to be kissed  it has struck me said kirk meditatively that your aunt lora if i may make the suggestion is the least bit of what steve would call a shydome is there anything else she had mentioned  hundreds of things bill ought to be kept in a properly sterilized nursery with sterilized toys and sterilized everything and the temperature ought to be just so high and no higher and just so low and no lower get her to talk about it to you she makes you wonder why everybody is not dead  this is a new development surely has she ever broken out in this place before  oh yes in the old days she often used to talk about it she has written books about it  i thought her books were all about the selfishness of the modern young man in not marrying  not at all some of them are about how to look after the baby its no good the modern young man marrying if hes going to murder his baby directly afterward is it  something in that theres just one objection to this sterilized nursery business though which she doesnt seem to have detected how am i going to provide these things on an income of five thousand and at the same time live in that luxury which the artist soul demands bill my lad youll have to sacrifice yourself for your fathers good when im a millionaire well see about it meanwhile  meanwhile said ruth come and be dried before you catch your death of cold she gathered william bannister into her lap  i pity any germ that tries to play catchascatchcan with that infant remarked kirk hed simply flatten it out in a round did you ever see such a chest on a kid of that age  it was after the installation of whiskers at the studio that the diminution of mrs porters visits became really marked there was something almost approaching a battle over whiskers who was an irish terrier puppy which hank jardine had presented to william bannister as a belated birthday present  mrs porter utterly excommunicated whiskers nothing she maintained was so notoriously supercharged with bacilli as a longhaired dog if this was true william bannister certainly gave them every chance to get to work upon himself it was his constant pleasure to clutch whiskers to him in a vicelike clinch to bury his face in his shaggy back and generally to court destruction yet the more he clutched the healthier did he appear to grow and mrs porters demand for the dogs banishment was overruled  mrs porter retired in dudgeon she liked to rule and at no 90 she felt that she had become merely among those present she was in the position of a mother country whose colony has revolted for years she had been accustomed to look on ruth as a disciple a weaker spirit whom she could mould to her will and now ruth was refusing to be moulded  so mrs porters visits ceased ruth still saw her at the apartment when she cared to go there but she kept away from the studio she considered that in the matter of william bannister her claim had been jumped that she had been deposed and she withdrew  i shall bear up said kirk when this fact was brought home to him i mistrust your aunt lora as i should mistrust some great natural force which may become active at any moment and give you yours an earthquake for instance i have no quarrel with your aunt lora in her quiescent state but i fear the developments of that giant mind we are better off without her  all the same said ruth loyally shes rather a dear and we ought to remember that if it hadnt been for her you and i would never have met  i do remember it and im grateful but i cant help feeling that a woman capable of taking other peoples lives and juggling with them as if they were indiarubber balls as she did with ours is likely at any moment to break out in a new place my gratitude to her is the sort of gratitude you would feel toward a cyclone if you were walking home late for dinner and it caught you up and deposited you on your doorstep your aunt lora is a human cyclone no on the whole shes more like an earthquake she has a habit of splitting up and altering the face of the world whenever she feels like it and im too well satisfied with my world at present to relish the idea of having it changed  little by little the garrison of the studio had been whittled down except for steve the community had no regular members outside the family itself hank was generally out of town bailey paid one more visit then seemed to consider that he could now absent himself altogether and the members of kirks bachelor circle stayed away to a man  their isolation was rendered more complete by the fact that ruth when she had ornamented new york society had made few real friends most of the girls she had known bored her they were gushing creatures with a passion for sharing and imparting secrets and ruths cool reserve had alienated her from them  when she married she dropped out the romance of her wedding gave people something to talk about for a few days and then she was forgotten  and so it came about that she had her desire and was able practically to monopolize kirk he and she and william bannister lived in a kind of hermits cell for three and enjoyed this highly unnatural state of things enormously life had never seemed so full either to kirk or herself there was always something to do something to think about something to look forward to if it was only a visit to a theatre or the inspection of william bannisters bath     chapter xi  stung to action   it was in the third year of the white hopes life that the placid evenness of kirks existence began to be troubled the orderly procession of the days was broken by happenings of unusual importance one at least of them extraordinarily unpleasant this was the failure of a certain stock in which nearly half of kirks patrimony was invested that capital which had always seemed to him as solid a part of life as the asphalt on which he walked as unchangeable a part of nature as the air he breathed he had always had it and he could hardly bring himself to realize that he was not always to have it  it gave him an extraordinary feeling of panic and discomfort when at length he faced the fact squarely that his private means on the possession of which he had based the whole lazy scheme of his life were as much at the mercy of fate as the stake which a gambler flings on the green cloth he did not know enough of business to understand the complicated processes by which a stock hitherto supposed to be as impregnable as municipal bonds had been hammered into a ragged remnant in the course of a single day but the result of them was unpleasantly clear and easily grasped  his income was cut in half and instead of being a comfortably off young man idly watching the pageant of life from a seat in the grand stand he must now plunge into the crowd and endeavour to earn a living as others did  for his losses did not begin and end with the ruin of this particular stock at intervals during the past two years he had been nibbling at his capital and now forced to examine his affairs frankly and minutely he was astonished at the inroads he had made upon it  there had been the upkeep of the summer shack he had bought in connecticut there had been expenses in connection with william bannister there had been little treats for ruth there had been cigars and clothes and dinners and taxicabs and all the other trifles which cost nothing but mount up and make a man wander beyond the bounds of his legitimate income  it was borne in upon kirk as he reflected upon these things that the only evidence he had shown of the possession of the artistic temperament had been the joyous carelessness of his extravagance in that only had he been the artist it shocked him to think how little honest work he had done during the past two years he had lived in a golden haze into which work had not entered  he was to be shocked still more very soon  stung to action by his thoughts he embarked upon a sweeping attack on the stronghold of those who exchange cash for artists dreams he ransacked the studio and set out on his mission in a cab bulging with large small and mediumsized canvases like a wave receding from a breakwater he returned late in the day a branded failure  the dealers had eyed his canvases large small and mediumsized and in direct contravention of their professed object in life had refused to deal only one of them a man with grimy hands but a moderately golden heart after passing a sepia thumb over some of the more ambitious works had offered him fifteen dollars for a little sketch which he had made in an energetic moment of william bannister crawling on the floor this the dealer asserted was the sort of darned mushy stuff the public fell for and he held it to be worth the fifteen but not a cent more kirk humble by now accepted three batteredlooking bills and departed  he had a long talk with ruth that night and rose from it in the frame of mind which in some men is induced by prayer ruth was quite marvellously sensible and sympathetic  i wanted you she said in answer to his selfreproaches and here we are together its simply nonsense to talk about ruining my life and dragging me down what does it matter about this money we have got plenty left  weve got about as much left as you used to spend on hats in the old days  well we can easily make it do ive thought for some time that we were growing too extravagant and talking of hats i had no right to have that last one you bought me it was wickedly expensive we can economize there at any rate we can get along splendidly on what you have now besides directly you settle down and start to paint we shall be quite rich again  kirk laughed grimly  i wish you were a dealer he said fifteen dollars is what i have managed to extract from them so far one of the great unwashed on sixth avenue gave me that for that sketch i did of bill on the floor  which took you about three minutes to do ruth pointed out triumphantly you see youre bound to make a fortune if you stick to it  kirk put his arm round her and gave her a silent hug of gratitude he had dreaded this talk and lo it was putting new life into him  they sat for a few moments in silence  i dont deserve it said kirk at last instead of comforting me like this and making me think im rather a fine sort of a fellow you ought to be lashing me with scorpions i dont suppose any man has ever made such a criminal idiot of himself in this city before  you couldnt tell that this stock was going to fail  no but i could have done some work these last three years and made it not matter whether it failed or not you cant comfort me out of that knowledge i knew all along that i was being a waster and a loafer but i was so happy that i didnt mind i was so interested in seeing what you and the kid would do next that i didnt seem to have time to work and the result is that ive gone right back  there was a time when i really could paint a bit not much its true but enough to get along with well im going to start it again in earnest now and if i dont make good well theres always hanks offer  ruth turned a little pale they had discussed hanks offer before but then life had been bright and cloudless and hanks offer a thing to smile at now it had assumed an uncomfortably practical aspect  you will make good said ruth  ill do my best said kirk but even as he spoke his mind was pondering on the proposition which hank had made  hank always flitting from new york into the unknown and back again had called at the studio one evening after a long absence looking sick and tired he was one of those lean wiry men whom it is unusual to see in this condition and kirk was sympathetic and inquisitive  hank needed no pressing he was full of his story  ive been in colombia he said i got back on a fruitsteamer this morning do you know anything of colombia  kirk reflected  only that theres generally a revolution there he said  there wasnt anything of that kind this trip except in my interior hank pulled thoughtfully at his pipe the odour of his remarkable brand of tobacco filled the studio ive had a hades of a time he said simply  kirk looked at him curiously hank was in a singularly chastened mood tonight  what took you there  gold  gold mining  hank nodded  i didnt know there were goldmines in that part of the world said kirk  there are the gold that filled the holds of spanish galleons in the sixteenth century came from colombia the place is simply stiff with old spanish relics  but surely the mines must have been worked out ages ago  only on the surface  kirk laughed  how do you mean only on the surface explain i dont know a thing about gold except that getting it out of picturedealers is like getting blood out of a turnip  its simple enough the earth hoards its gold in two ways theres auriferous rock and auriferous dirt if the stuff is in the rock you crush it if its in the dirt you wash it  it sounds simple  it is the difficult part is finding it  and you have done that  i have or im practically certain i have at any rate i know that i have discovered the ditches made by the spaniards three hundred years ago if there was gold there in those days there is apt to be gold there now only it isnt on the surface any longer they cleaned up as far as the surface is concerned so i have to sink shafts and dig tunnels  i see it isnt so simple as it used to be  it is practically if you have any knowledge of mining  well whats your trouble asked kirk why did you come back why arent you out there grabbing it with both hands and getting yourself into shape to be a walking goldmine to your friends i dont like to see this idle spirit in you hank  hank smoked long and thoughtfully  kirk he said suddenly  well  hank shook his head  no its no good  what is no good what do you mean  i came back said hank suddenly lucid with a wild notion of getting you to come in with me on this thing  what go to colombia with you  hank nodded  but of course its not possible its no job for a married man  why not if this gold of yours is just lying about in heaps it seems to me that a married man is exactly the man who ought to be around grabbing it or do you believe that old yarn about two being able to live as cheaply as one take it from me its not so if there is gold waiting to be gathered up in handfuls me for it when do we start can i bring ruth and the kid  i wish we could start if i could have had you with me these last few months id never have quit but i guess its out of the question youve no idea what sort of an inferno it is and i wont let you come into it with your eyes shut but if ever you are in a real tight corner let me know it might be worth your while then to take a few risks  oh there are risks  risks my claims are located along the atrato river in the choco district does that convey anything to you  not a thing  the workings are three hundred miles inland just three hundred miles of pure hades you can get all the fevers you ever heard of and a few more i got most of them last trip  i thought you were looking pretty bad  i ought to be ive swallowed so much quinine since i saw you last that my ears are buzzing still and then there are the insects they all bite some bite worse than others but not much darn it even the butterflies bite out there every animal in the country has some other animal constantly chasing it until a white man comes along when they call a truce and both chase him and the vegetation is so thick and grows so quickly that you have to cut down the jungle about the workings every few days or so to avoid being swamped by it otherwise finished hank refilling his pipe and lighting it the place is a pretty good kind of summer resort  and youre going back to it back to the quinine and the beasts and the butterflies  sure the gold runs up to twenty dollars the cubic yard and is worth eighteen dollars an ounce  when are you going  im in no hurry this year next year some time never no not never call it some time  and you want me to come too  i would give half of whatever there is in the mine to have you come but things being as they are well i guess we can call it off is there any chance in the world kirk of your ever ceasing to be a bloated capitalist could any of your stocks go back on you  i doubt it theyre pretty giltedged i fancy though ive never studied the question of stocks my little goldmine isnt in the same class with yours but its as solid as a rock and no fevers and insects attached to it either                                       and now the goldmine had proved of less than rocklike solidity the most giltedged of all the stocks had failed the capitalist had become in one brief day the struggling artist  hanks proposal seemed a good deal less fantastic now to kirk as he prepared for his second onslaught the grand attack on the stronghold of those who bought art with gold     chapter xii  a climax   one afternoon about two weeks later kirk returning to the studio from an unprofitable raid into the region of the dealers found on the table a card bearing the name of mrs robert wilbur this had been crossed out and beneath it in a straggly hand the name miss wilbur had been written  the phenomenon of a caller at the cell of the two hermits was so strange that he awaited ruths arrival with more than his customary impatience she would be able to identify the visitor george pennicut questioned on the point had no information of any value to impart a very pretty young lady she was said george with what you might call a lively manner she had seemed disappointed at finding nobody at home no she had left no message  ruth arriving a few moments later was met by kirk with the card in his hand  can you throw any light on this he said who is miss wilbur who has what you might call a lively manner and appears disappointed when she does not find us at home  ruth looked at the card  sybil wilbur i wonder what she wants  who is she lets get that settled first  oh shes a girl i used to know i havent seen her for two years i thought she had forgotten my existence  call her up on the phone if we dont solve this mystery we shant sleep tonight its like robinson crusoe and the footprint  ruth went to the telephone after a short conversation she turned to kirk with sparkling eyes and the air of one with news to impart  kirk she wants you to paint her portrait  what  shes engaged to bailey just got engaged and the first thing she does is to insist on his letting her come to you for her portrait ruth bubbled with laughter its to be a birthday present for bailey and bailey has got to pay for it thats so exactly like sybil  i hope the portrait will be shes taking chances  i think its simply sweet of her shes a real friend  at fairly long intervals apparently did you say you had not seen her for two years  she is an erratic little thing with an awfully good heart i feel touched at her remembering us oh kirk you must do a simply wonderful portrait something that everybody will talk about and then our fortune will be made you will become the only painter that people will go to for their portraits  kirk did not answer his experiences of late had developed in him an unwonted mistrust of his powers to this was added the knowledge that except for an impressionist study of ruth for private exhibition only he had never attempted a portrait to be called upon suddenly like this to show his powers gave him much the same feeling which he had experienced when called upon as a child to recite poetry before an audience it was a species of stage fright  but it was certainly a chance portraitpainting was an uncommonly lucrative line of business his imagination stirred by ruths saw visions of wealthy applicants turned away from the studio door owing to pressure of work on the part of the famous man for whose services they were bidding vast sums  by jove he said thoughtfully  another aspect of the matter occurred to him  i wonder what bailey thinks about it  oh hes probably so much in love with her that he doesnt mind what she does besides bailey likes you  does he  oh well if he doesnt he will this will bring you together  i suppose he knows about it  oh yes sybil said he did its all settled she will be here tomorrow for the first sitting  kirk spoke the fear that was in his mind  ruth old girl im horribly nervous about this i am taken with a sort of second sight i see myself making a ghastly failure of this job and bailey knocking me down and refusing to come across with the cheque  sybil is bringing the cheque with her tomorrow said ruth simply  is she said kirk now i wonder if that makes it worse or better im trying to think  sybil wilbur fluttered in next day at noon a tiny restless creature who darted about the studio like a hummingbird she effervesced with the joy of life she uttered little squeaks of delight at everything she saw she hugged ruth beamed at kirk went wild over william bannister thought the studio too cute for words insisted on being shown all over it and talked incessantly  it was about two oclock before she actually began to sit and even then she was no statue a thought would come into her small head and she would whirl round to impart it to ruth destroying in a second the pose which it had taken kirk ten painful minutes to fix  kirk was too amused to be irritated she was such a friendly little soul and so obviously devoted to ruth that he felt she was entitled to be a nuisance as a sitter he wondered more and more what weird principle of selection had been at work to bring bailey and this butterfly together he had never given any deep thought to the study of his brotherinlaws character but from his small knowledge of him he would have imagined some one a trifle more substantial and serious as the ideal wife for him life he conceived was to bailey a stately march sybil wilbur evidently looked on it as a mad gallop  ruth felt the same she was fond of sybil but she could not see her as the foreordained mrs bailey  i suppose she swept him off his feet she said it just shows that you never really get to know a person even if youre their sister bailey must have all sorts of hidden sides to his character which i never noticedunless she has but i dont think there is much of that about sybil shes just a child but shes very amusing isnt she she enjoys life so furiously  i think bailey will find her rather a handful does she ever sit still by the way if she is going to act right along as she did today this portrait will look like that cubist picture of the dance at the spring  as the sittings went on miss wilbur consented gradually to simmer down and the portrait progressed with a fair amount of speed but kirk was conscious every day of a growing sensation of panic he was trying his very hardest but it was bad work and he knew it  his hand had never had very much cunning but what it had had it had lost in the years of his idleness every day showed him more clearly that the portrait of miss wilbur on which so much depended was an amateurish daub he worked doggedly on but his heart was cold with that chill that grips the artist when he looks on his work and sees it to be bad  at last it was finished ruth thought it splendid sybil wilbur pronounced it cute as she did most things kirk could hardly bear to look at it in its finished state it was worse than he could have believed possible  in the old days he had been a fair painter with one or two bad faults now the faults seemed to have grown like weeds choking whatever of merit he might once have possessed this was a horrible production and he was profoundly thankful when it was packed up and removed from the studio but behind his thankfulness lurked the feeling that all was not yet over that there was worse to come  it came  it was heralded by a tearful telephone call from miss wilbur who rang up ruth with the agitated information that bailey didnt seem to like it and on the heels of the message came bailey in person pink from forehead to collar and almost as wrathful as he had been on the great occasion of his first visit to the studio his annoyance robbed his speech of its normal stateliness he struck a colloquial note unusual with him  i guess you know what ive come about he said  he had found kirk alone in the studio as ill luck would have it in the absence of ruth he ventured to speak more freely than he would have done in her presence  its an infernal outrage he went on ive been stung and you know it  kirk said nothing his silence infuriated bailey  its the portrait im speaking aboutthe portrait if you have the nerve to call it that of miss wilbur i was against her sitting to you from the first but she insisted now shes sorry  its as bad as all that is it said kirk dully he felt curiously indisposed to fight a listlessness had gripped him he was even a little sorry for bailey he saw his point of view and sympathized with it  yes said bailey fiercely it is and you know it  kirk nodded bailey was quite right he did know it  its a joke went on bailey shrilly i cant hang it up people would laugh at it and to think that i paid you all that money for it i could have got a real artist for half the price  that is easily remedied said kirk i will send you a cheque tomorrow  bailey was not to be appeased the venom of more than three years cried out for utterance he had always held definite views upon kirk and heaven had sent him the opportunity of expressing them  yes i dare say he said contemptuously that would settle the whole thing wouldnt it what do you think you area millionaire talking as if that amount of money made no difference to you where does my sister come in how about ruth you sneak her away from her home and then  kirks lethargy left him he flushed  i think that will be about all bannister he said he spoke quietly but his voice trembled  but baileys longdammed hatred having at last found an outlet was not to be checked in a moment  will it will it the hell it will let me tell you that i came here to talk straight to you and im going to do it its about time you had your darned dimenovel romance shown up to you the way it strikes somebody else you think youre a tremendous dashing twentiethcentury young lochinvar dont you you thought you had done a pretty smooth bit of work when you sneaked ruth away you you havent enough backbone in you even to make a bluff at working to support her youre just what my father said you werea loafer who pretends to be an artist youve got away with it up to now but youve shown yourself up at last you damned waster  kirk walked to the door and flung it open  youre perfectly right bannister he said quietly everything you have said is quite true and now would you mind going  ive not finished yet  yes you have  bailey hesitated the first time frenzy had left him and he was beginning to be a little ashamed of himself for having expressed his views in a manner which though satisfying was he felt less dignified than he could have wished  he looked at kirk who was standing stiffly by the door something in his attitude decided bailey to leave well alone such had been his indignation that it was only now that for the first time it struck him that his statement of opinion had not been made without considerable bodily danger to himself jarred nerves had stood him in the stead of courage but now his nerves were soothed and he saw things clearly  he choked down what he had intended to say and walked out kirk closed the door softly behind him and began to pace the studio floor as he had done on that night when ruth had fought for her life in the room upstairs  his mind worked slowly at first then as it cleared he began to think more and more rapidly till the thoughts leaped and ran like tongues of fire scorching him  it was all true that was what hurt every word that bailey had flung at him had been strictly just  he had thought himself a fine romantic fellow he was a waster and a loafer who pretended to be an artist he had thrown away the little talent he had once possessed he had behaved shamefully to ruth shirking his responsibilities and idling through life he realized it now when it was too late  suddenly through the chaos of his reflections there shone out clearly one coherent thought the recollection of what hank jardine had offered to him if ever you are in a real tight corner                                       his brain cleared he sat down calmly to wait for ruth his mind was made up hanks offer was the way out the only way out and he must take it      book two     chapter i  emptyhanded   the steamship santa barbara of the united fruit line moved slowly through the glittering water of the bay on her way to dock out at quarantine earlier in the morning there had been a mist through which passing ships loomed up vague and shapeless but now the sun had dispersed it and a perfect may morning welcomed the santa barbara home  kirk leaned on the rail looking with dull eyes on the city he had left a year before only a year it seemed ten as he stood there he felt an old man  a drummer a cheery soul who had come aboard at porto rico sauntered up beaming with wellbeing and goodfellowship  looks pretty good sir said he  kirk did not answer he had not heard  some burg ventured the drummer  again encountering silence he turned away hurt this churlish attitude on the part of one returning to gods country on one of gods own mornings surprised and wounded him  to him all was right with the world he had breakfasted well he was smoking a good cigar and he was strong in the knowledge that he had done well by the firm this trip and that bouquets were due to be handed to him in the office on lower broadway he was annoyed with kirk for having cast even a tiny cloud upon his contentment  he communicated his feelings to the third officer who happened to come on deck at that moment  say who is that guy he asked complainingly the big son of a gun leaning on the rail seems like hed got a hangover this morning is he deaf and dumb or just plain grouchy  the third officer eyed kirks back with sympathy  i shouldnt worry him freddie he said i guess if you had been up against it like him youd be shy on the small talk thats a fellow called winfield they carried him on board at colon he was about all in got fever in colombia inland at the mines and nearly died his pal did die ever met hank jardine  long thin man  the other nodded  one of the best he made two trips with us  and hes dead  died of fever away back in the interior where theres nothing much else except mosquitoes he and winfield went in there after gold  did they get any asked the drummer interested  the third officer spat disgustedly over the rail  you ask winfield or rather dont because i guess its not his pet subject he told me all about it when he was getting better there was gold there all right in chunks it only needed to be dug for and somebody else did the digging of all the skin games it made me pretty hot under the collar and it wasnt me that was stung  out there you cant buy land if youre a foreigner you have to lease it from the natives poor old hank leased his bit all right and when hed got to his claim he found somebody else working on it it seemed there had been a flaw in his agreement and the owners had let it over his head to these other guys who had slipped them more than what hank had done  what did he do  he couldnt do anything they were the right side of the law or what they call law out there there was nothing to do except beat it back again three hundred miles to the coast thats where they got the fever which finished hank so you can understand concluded the third officer that mr winfield isnt in what you can call a sunny mood if i were you id go and talk to someone else if conversations what you need  kirk stood motionless at the rail thinking it was not what was past that occupied his thoughts as the third officer had supposed it was the future  the forlorn hope had failed he was limping back to ruth wounded and broken he had sent her a wireless message she would be at the dock to meet him how could he face her fate had been against him it was true but he was in no mood to make excuses for himself he had failed that was the beginning and the end of it he had set out to bring back wealth and comfort to her and he was returning emptyhanded  that was what the immediate future held the meeting with ruth and after his imagination was not equal to the task of considering that he had failed as an artist there was no future for him there he must find some other work but he was fit for no other work he had no training what could he do in a city where keenness of competition is a tradition it would be as if an unarmed man should attack a fortress  the thought of the years he had wasted was very bitter looking back he could see how fate had tricked him into throwing away his one talent he had had promise with hard work he could have become an artist a professionala man whose work was worth money in the open market he had never had it in him to be a great artist but he had had the facility which goes to make a good worker of the second class he had it still given the time for hard study it was still in him to take his proper place among painters  but time for study was out of his reach now he must set to work at once without a days delay on something which would bring him immediate money the reflection brought his mind back abruptly to the practical consideration of the future  before him as he stood there the ragged battlements of new york seemed to frown down on him with a cold cruelty that paralysed his mind he had seen them a hundred times before they should have been familiar and friendly but this morning they were strange and sinister the skyline which daunts the emigrant as he comes up the bay to his new home struck fear into kirks heart  he turned away and began to walk up and down the deck  he felt tired and lonely for the first time he realized just what it meant to him that he should never see hank again it had been hard almost impossible till now to force his mind to face that fact he had winced away from it but now it would not be avoided it fell upon him like a shadow  hank had filled a place of his own in kirks life theirs had been one of those smooth friendships which absence cannot harm often they had not seen each other for months at a time indeed now that he thought of it hank was generally away and he could not remember that they had ever exchanged letters yet even so there had been a bond between them which had never broken and now hank had dropped out  kirk began to think about death as with most men of his temperament it was a subject on which his mind had seldom dwelt never for any length of time his parents had died when he was too young to understand and circumstances had shielded him from the shadow of the great mystery birth he understood it had forced itself into the scheme of his life but death till now had been a stranger to him  the realization of it affected him oddly in a sense he found it stimulating not stimulating as birth had been but more subtly he could recall vividly the thrill that had come to him with the birth of his son for days he had walked as one in a trance the world had seemed unreal like an opiumsmokers dream there had been magic everywhere  but death had exactly the opposite effect it made everything curiously realhimself most of all he had the sensation as he thought of hank of knowing himself for the first time somehow he felt strengthened braced for the fight as a soldier might who sees his comrade fall at his side  there was something almost vindictive in the feeling that came to him it was too vague to be analysed but it filled him with a desire to fight gave him a sense of determination of which he had never before been conscious it toughened him and made the old easygoing kirk winfield seem a stranger at whom he could look with detachment and a certain contempt  as he walked back along the deck the battlements of the city met his gaze once more but now they seemed less formidable  in the leisurely fashion of the homecoming ship the santa barbara slid into her dock the gangplank was thrust out kirk walked ashore  for a moment he thought that ruth had not come to meet him then his heart leaped madly he had seen her                                       there are worse spots in the world than the sheds of the new york customs but few more desolate yet to kirk just then the shadowy vastness seemed a sunlit garden a flame of happiness blazed up in his mind blotting out in an instant the forebodings which had lurked there like evil creatures in a dark vault the future with its explanations and plans could take care of itself ruth was a thing of the present  he put his arms round her and held her the friendly drummer who chanced to be near observed them with interest and a good deal of pleasure the third officers story had temporarily destroyed his feeling that all was right with the world and his sympathetic heart welcomed this evidence that life held compensations even for men who had been swindled out of valuable goldmines  i guess hes not feeling so worse after all he mused and went on his way with an easy mind to be fawned upon by his grateful firm  ruth was holding kirk at arms length her eyes full of tears at the sight  you poor boy how thin you are  i had fever its an awful place for fever out there  kirk  oh im all right now the voyage set me up they made a great fuss over me on board  ruths hand was clinging to his arm he squeezed it against his side it was wonderful to him this sense of being together again after these centuries of absence it drove from his mind the thought of all the explanations which sooner or later he had got to make whatever might come after he would keep this moment in his memory golden and untarnished  dont you worry about me he said now that ive found you again im feeling better than i ever did in my life you wait till you see me sparring with steve tomorrow by the way how is steve  splendid  and bill  ruth drew herself up haughtily  you dare to ask about your son after steve how clumsy that sounds i mean you dare to put steve before your son i believe youve only just realized that you have a son  ive only just realized theres anybody or anything in the world except my wife  well after that i suppose ive got to forgive you since you have asked after bill at last i may tell you that hes very well indeed  kirks eyes glowed  he ought to be a great kid by now  he is  and mamie have you still got her  i wouldnt lose her for a million  and whiskers  im afraid whiskers is gone  not dead  no i gave him away  for heavens sake why  well dear the fact is ive come around to aunt loras way of thinking  eh  about germs  kirk laughed the first real laugh he had had for a year  that insane fad of hers  ruth was serious  i have she said were taking a great deal more care of bill than in the old days i hate to think of the way i used to let him run around wild then he might have died  what nonsense he was simply bursting with health all the time  i had a horrible shock after you left ruth went on the poor little fellow was awfully ill with some kind of a fever the doctor almost gave him up  good heavens  aunt lora helped me to nurse him and she made me see how i had been exposing him to all sorts of risks andwell now we guard against them  there was a silence  i grew to rely on her a great deal kirk when you were away you know i always used to before we were married shes so wonderfully strong and then when your letters stopped coming  there arent any postal arrangements out there in the interior it was the worst part of itnot being able to write to you or hear from you heavens what an exile ive been this last year anything may have happened  perhaps something has said ruth mysteriously  what do you mean  wait and see oh i know one thing that has happened ive been looking at you all this while trying to think what it was youve grown a beard and it looks perfectly horrid  sheer laziness it shall come off this very day i knew you would hate it  i certainly do it makes you look so old  kirks face clouded  i feel old  for the first time since he had left the ship the memory of hank had come back to him the sight of ruth had driven it away but now it swept back on him the golden moment was over life with all its troubles and its explanations and its burdening sense of failure must be faced  whats the matter asked ruth startled by the sudden change  i was thinking of poor old hank  where is mr jardine didnt he come back with you  hes dead dear said kirk gently he died of fever while we were working our way back to the coast  oh  it was the idea of death that shocked ruth not the particular manifestation of it hank had not touched her life she had begun by disliking him and ended by feeling for him the tolerant sort of affection which she might have bestowed upon a dog or a cat hank as a man was nothing to her and she could not quite keep her indifference out of her voice  it was only later when he looked back on this conversation that kirk realized this at the moment he was unconscious of it significant as it was of the fact that there were points at which his mind and ruths did not touch  when ruth spoke again it was to change the subject  well kirk she said have you come back with your trunk crammed with nuggets you havent said a word about the mine yet and im dying to know  he groaned inwardly the moment he had been dreading had arrived more swiftly than he had expected it was time for him to face facts  no he said shortly  ruth looked at him curiously she met his eyes and saw the pain in them and intuition told her in an instant what kirk stumbling through his story could not have told her in an hour she squeezed his arm affectionately  dont tell me she said i understand and it doesnt matter it doesnt matter a bit  doesnt matter but  ruths eyes were dancing  kirk dear ive something to tell you wait till we get outside  what do you mean  youll soon see  they went out into the street against the kerb a large red automobile was standing the chauffeur touched his cap as he saw them kirk stared at him dumbly  in you get dear said ruth  she met his astonished gaze with a smile of triumph this was her moment the moment for which she had been waiting the chauffeur started the machine  i dont understand whose car is this  mine yours ours oh kirk darling i was so afraid that you would come back bulging with a fortune that would make my little one look like nothing but you havent you havent and its just splendid she caught his hand and pressed it its simply sweet of you to look so astonished i was hoping you would this car belongs to us and theres another just as big besides and a house andoheverything you can think of kirk dear weve nothing to worry us any longer were rich     chapter ii  an unknown path   kirk blinked he closed his eyes and opened them again the automobile was still there and he was still in it ruth was still gazing at him with the triumphant look in her eyes the chauffeur silent emblem of a substantial bankbalance still sat stiffly at the steeringwheel  rich kirk repeated  rich ruth assured him  i dont understand  ruths smile faded  poor father  your father  he died just after you sailed just before bill got ill she gave a little sigh kirk how odd life is  but  it was terrible it was some kind of a stroke he had been working too hard and taking no exercise you know when he sent steve away that time he didnt engage anybody else in his place he went back to his old way of living which the doctor had warned him against he worked and worked until one day bailey says he fainted at the office they brought him home and he just went out like a burnedout candle ii went to him but for a long time he wouldnt see me  oh kirk the hours i spent in the library hoping that he would let me come to him but he never did till right at the end then i went up and he was dying he couldnt speak i dont know now how he felt toward me at the last i kissed him he was all shrunk to nothing i had a horrible feeling that i had never been a real daughter to him butbutyou know he made it difficult awfully difficult and then he died bailey was on one side of the bed and i was on the other and the nurse and the doctor were whispering outside the door i could hear them through the transom  she slipped her hand into kirks and sat silent while the car slid into the traffic of fifth avenue for the second time the shadow of the great mystery had fallen on the brightness of the perfect morning  the car had stopped at thirtyfourth street to allow the hurrying crowds to cross the avenue kirk looked at them with a feeling of sadness it was not caused by john bannisters death he was too honest to be able to plunge himself into false emotion at will his feeling was more a vague uneasiness almost a presentiment things changed so quickly in this world old landmarks shifted as the crowd of strangers was shifting before him now hurrying into his life and hurrying out of it  he too had changed ruth though he had detected no signs of it must be different from the ruth he had left a year ago the old life was dead what had the new life in store for him wealth for one thingother standards of livingnew experiences  an odd sensation of regret that this stream of gold had descended upon him deepened his momentary depression they had been so happy he and ruth and the kid in the old days of the hermits cell something that was almost a superstitious fear of this unexpected legacy came upon him  it was unlucky money grudgingly given at the eleventh hour he seemed to feel john bannister watching him with a sneer and he was afraid of him his nerves were still a little unstrung from the horror of his wanderings and the fever had left him weak it seemed to him that there was a curse on the old mans wealth that somehow it was destined to bring him unhappiness  the policeman waved his hand the car jerked forward the sudden movement brought him to himself he smiled a little ashamed of having been so fanciful the sky was blue the sun shone a cool breeze put the joy of life into him and at his side ruth sat smiling now from her too the cloud had been lifted  it seems like a fairystory said kirk breaking the silence that had fallen between them  i think it must have been the thought of bill that made him do it said ruth he left half his money to bailey and half to me during my lifetime baileys married now by the way she paused im afraid father never forgave you dear she added he made bailey the trustee for the money and it goes to bill in trust after my death  she looked at him rather nervously it seemed to kirk the terms of the will had been the cause of some trouble to her especially had she speculated on his reception of the news that bailey was to play so important a part in the administration of the money kirk had never told her what had passed between him and bailey that afternoon in the studio but her quick intelligence had enabled her to guess at the truth and she was aware that the minds of the two men their temperaments were naturally antagonistic  kirks reception of the news relieved her  of course he said he couldnt do anything else he knew nothing of me except that i was a kind of man with whom he was quite out of sympathy he mistrusted all artists i expect in a bunch and anyway an artist is pretty sure to be a bad man of business he would know that andand well what i mean is it strikes me as a very sensible arrangement why are we stopping here  the car had drawn up before a large house on the upper avenue one of those houses which advertise affluence with as little reticence as a fat diamond solitaire  we live here said ruth laughing  kirk drew a long breath  do we by george he exclaimed i see its going to take me quite a while to get used to this state of things  a thought struck him  how about the studio have you got rid of it  of course not the idea after the perfect times we had there were going to keep it on as an annex every now and then when we are tired of being rich well creep off there and boil eggs over the gasstove and pretend we are just ordinary persons again  and oftener than every now and then this particular plutocrat is going to creep off there and try to teach himself to paint pictures  ruth nodded  yes i think you ought to have a hobby its good for you  kirk said nothing but it was not as a hobby that he was regarding his painting he had come to a knowledge of realities in the wilderness and to an appreciation of the fact that he had a soul which could not be kept alive except by honest work  he had the decent mans distaste for living on his wifes money he supposed it was inevitable that a certain portion of it must go to his support but he was resolved that there should be in the sight of the gods who look down on human affairs at least a reasonable excuse for his existence if work could make him anything approaching a real artist he would become one  meanwhile he was quite willing that ruth should look upon his lifework as a pleasant pastime to save him from ennui even to his wife a man is not always eager to exhibit his soul in its nakedness  by the way said ruth you wont find george pennicut at the studio he has gone back to england  im sorry i liked george  he liked you he left all sorts of messages he nearly wept when he said goodbye but he wouldnt stop in a burst of confidence he told me what the trouble was our blue sky had got on his nerves he wanted a london drizzle again he said the thought of it made him homesick  kirk entered the house thoughtfully somehow this last piece of news had put the copingstone on the edifice of hishis what depression it was hardly that no it was rather a kind of vague regret for the life which had so definitely ended the feeling which the romans called desiderium and the greeks pathos the defection of george pennicut was a small thing in itself but it meant the removal of another landmark  we had some bully good times in that studio he said  the words were a requiem  the first person whom he met in this great house in the kingdom of which he was to be kingconsort was a butler of incredible stateliness this was none other than steves friend keggs but round the outlying portions of this official he had perceived as the door opened a section of a woman in a brown dress  the butler moving to one side he found himself confronting mrs lora delane porter  if other things in kirks world had changed time had wrought in vain upon the great authoress she looked as masterful as unyielding and as efficient as she had looked at the time of his departure she took his hand without emotion and inspected him keenly  you are thinner she remarked  i said that aunt lora said ruth poor boy hes a skeleton  you are not so robust  i have been ill  ruth interposed  hes had fever aunt lora and you are not to tease him  i should be the last person to tease any man what sort of fever  i think it was a blend of all sorts replied kirk a kind of irish stew of a fever  you are not infectious  certainly not  mrs porter checked ruth as she was about to speak  we owe it to william to be careful she explained after all the trouble we have taken to exclude him from germs it is only reasonable to make these inquiries  come along dear said ruth and ill show you the house dont mind aunt lora she whispered she means well and she really is splendid with bill  kirk followed her he was feeling chilled again his old mistrust of mrs porter revived if their brief interview was to be taken as evidence she seemed to have regained entirely her old ascendancy over ruth he felt vaguely uneasy as a man might who walks in a powder magazine  aunt lora lives here now observed ruth casually as they went upstairs  kirk started  literally do you mean is this her home  ruth smiled at him over her shoulder  she wont interfere with you she said surely this great house is large enough for the three of us besides shes so devoted to bill she looks after him all the time of course nowadays i dont get quite so much time to be with him myself one has an awful lot of calls on one i feel bill is so safe with aunt lora on the premises  she stopped at a door on the first floor  this is bills nursery hes out just now mamie takes him for a drive every morning when its fine  something impelled kirk to speak  dont you ever take him for walks in the morning now he asked he used to love it  silly of course i do when i can manage it for drives rather aunt lora is rather against his walking much in the city he might so easily catch something you know  she opened the door  there she said what do you think of that for a nursery  if kirk had spoken his mind he would have said that of all the ghastly nurseries the human brain could have conceived this was the ghastliest it was a large square room and to kirks startled eyes had much the appearance of an operating theatre at a hospital  there was no carpet on the tiled floor the walls likewise tiled were so bare that the eye ached contemplating them in the corner by the window stood the little white cot beside it on the wall hung a large thermometer various knobs of brass decorated the opposite wall at the farther end of the room was a bath complete with shower and all the other apparatus of a modern tub  it was probably the most horrible room in all new york  well what do you think of it demanded ruth proudly  kirk gazed at her speechless this he said to himself was ruth his wife who had housed his son in the spare bedroom of the studio and allowed a shaggy irish terrier to sleep on his bed who had permitted him to play by the hour in the dust of the studio floor who had even assisted him to do so by descending into the dust herself in the role of a bear or a snake  what had happened to this world from which he had been absent but one short year was everybody mad or was he hopelessly behind the times  well ruth reminded him  kirk eyed the dreadful room  it looks clean he said at last  it is clean said the voice of lora delane porter proudly behind him she had followed them up the stairs to do the honours of the nursery the centre of her world it is essentially clean there is not an object in that room which is not carefully sterilized night and morning with a weak solution of boric acid  even mamie inquired kirk  it had been his intention to be mildly jocular but mrs porters reply showed him that in jest he had spoken the truth  certainly have you any idea kirk of the number of germs there are on the surface of the human body it runs into billions youshe fixed him with her steely eyeyou are at the present moment one mass of microbes  i sneaked through quarantine all right  to the adult there is not so much danger in these microbes provided he or she maintains a reasonable degree of personal cleanliness that is why adults may be permitted to mix with other adults without preliminary sterilization but in the case of a growing child it is entirely different no precaution is excessive so  from below at this point there came the sound of the frontdoor bell ruth went to the landing and looked over the banisters  that ought to be bill and mamie back from their drive she said  the sound of a childs voice came to kirk as he stood listening and as he heard it all the old feeling of paternal pride and excitement which had left him during his wanderings swept over him like a wave he reproached himself that while the memory of ruth had been with him during every waking moment of the past year there had been occasions when that of william bannister had become a little faded  he ran down the stairs  hello mamie he said how are you youre looking well  mamie greeted him with the shy smile which was wont to cause such havoc in steves heart  and whos this youve got with you mamie you know youve no business going about with young men like this who is he  he stood looking at william bannister and william bannister stood looking at him kirk smiling william staring with the intense gravity of childhood and trying to place this bearded stranger among his circle of friends he seemed to be thinking that the familiarity of the others manner indicated a certain amount of previous acquaintanceship  watch that busy brain working said kirk hes trying to place me its all right bill old man its my fault i had no right to spring myself on you with eight feet of beard it isnt giving you a square deal never mind its coming off in a few minutes never to return and then perhaps youll remember that youve a father  faaaar shrieked william bannister triumphantly taking the cue with admirable swiftness  he leaped at kirk and kirk swung him up in the air it was quite an effort for william bannister had grown astonishingly in the past year  pop said he firmly as if resolved to prevent any possibility of mistake daddy he added continuing to play upon the theme he summed up youre my pop  then satisfied that this was final and that there could now be no chance for kirk to back out of the contract he reached out a hand and gave a tug at the beard which had led to all the confusion  whats this  you may well ask said kirk i got struck that way because i left you and mummy for a whole year but now im back im going to be allowed to take it off and give it away whom shall i give it to steve do you think steve would like it yes you can go on pulling it it wont break on the other hand i should just like to mention that its hurting something fierce my son its fastened on at the other end you know  why  dont ask me thats the way its built  william bannister obligingly disentangled himself from the beard  where you been he inquired  miles and miles away you know the battery  william bannister nodded  well a long way past that first i took a ship and went ever so many miles then i landed and went ever so many more miles with all sorts of beasts trying to bite pieces out of me  this interested william bannister  tigers he inquired  i didnt actually see any tigers but i expect they were sneaking round there were mosquitoes though you know what a mosquito is  william nodded  bumps he observed crisply  thats right you see this lump here just above my mouth well thats not a mosquitobite thats my nose but think of something about that size and youll have some idea of what a mosquitobite is like out there but why am i boring you with my troubles tell me all about yourself youve certainly been growing whatever else you may have been doing while ive been away i can hardly lift you has steve taught you to box yet  at this moment he was aware that he had become the centre of a small group looking round he found himself gazing into a face so stiff with horror and disapproval that he was startled almost into dropping william what could have happened to induce mrs porter to look like that he could not imagine but her expression checked his flow of light conversation as if it had been turned off with a switch he lowered bill to the ground  what on earths the matter he asked what has happened  without replying mrs porter made a gesture in the direction of the nursery which had the effect of sending mamie and her charge off again on the journey upstairs which kirks advent had interrupted bill seemed sorry to go but he trudged sturdily on without remark kirk followed him with his eyes till he disappeared at the bend of the stairway  whats the matter he repeated  are you mad kirk demanded mrs porter in a tense voice  kirk turned helplessly to ruth  you had better let me explain aunt lora she said of course kirk couldnt be expected to know poor boy you seem to forget that he has only this minute come into the house  aunt lora was not to be appeased  that is absolutely no excuse he has just left a ship where he cannot have failed to pick up bacilli of every description he has himself only recently recovered from a probably infectious fever he is wearing a beard notoriously the most germridden abomination in existence  kirk started he was not proud of his beard but he had not regarded it as quite the pestilential thing which it seemed to be in the eyes of mrs porter  and he picks up the child she went on hugs him kisses him and you say he could not have known better surely the most elementary common sense  aunt lora said ruth  she spoke quietly but there was a note in her voice which acted on mrs porter like magic her flow of words ceased abruptly it was a small incident but it had the effect of making kirk grateful as he was for the interruption somehow vaguely uneasy for a moment  it seemed to indicate some subtle change in ruths character some new quality of hardness added to it the ruth he had left when he sailed for colombia would he felt have been incapable of quelling her masterful aunt so very decisively and with such an economy of words it suggested previous warfare in which the elder women had been subdued to a point where a mere exclamation could pull her up when she forgot herself  kirk felt uncomfortable he did not like these sudden discoveries about ruth  i will explain to kirk she said you go up and see that everything is right in the nursery  andamazing spectacleoff went mrs porter without another word  ruth put her arm in kirks and led him off to the smokingroom  you may smoke a cigar while i tell you all about bill she said  kirk lit a cigar bewildered it is always unpleasant to be the person to whom things have to be explained  poor old boy ruth went on you certainly are thin but about bill i am afraid you are going to be a little upset about bill kirk aunt lora has no tact and she will make a speech on every possible occasion but she was right just now it really was rather dangerous picking bill up like that and kissing him  kirk stared  i dont understand did you expect me to wave my hand to him or would it have been more correct to bow  dont be so satirical kirk you wither me no seriously you really mustnt kiss bill i never do nobody does  what  i dare say it sounds ridiculous to you but you were not here when he was so ill and nearly died you remember what i was telling you at the dock about giving whiskers away well this is all part of it after what happened i feel like aunt lora that we simply cant take too many precautions you saw his nursery well it would be simply a waste of money giving him a nursery like that if he was allowed to be exposed to infection when he was out of it  and i am supposed to be infectious  not more than anybody else theres no need to be hurt about it its just as much a sacrifice for me  so nobody makes a fuss over bill nowis that it  well no not in the way you mean  pretty dreary outlook for the kid isnt it  its all for his good  what a ghastly expression  ruth left her chair and came and sat on the arm of kirks she ruffled his hair lightly with the tips of her fingers kirk who had been disposed to be militant softened instantly the action brought back a flood of memories it conjured up recollections of peaceful evenings in the old studio for this had been a favourite habit of ruths it made him feel that he loved her more than he had ever done in his life andincidentallythat he was a brute to try and thwart her in anything whatsoever  i know its horrid for you dear old boy said ruth coaxingly but do be good and not make a fuss about it not kissing bill doesnt mean that you need be any the less fond of him i know it will be strange at firsti didnt get used to it for ever so longbut honestly it is for his good however ghastly the expression of the thing may sound  its treating the kid like a wretched invalid grumbled kirk  you wait till you see him playing and then youll know if hes a wretched invalid or not  may i see him playing  dont be silly of course  i thought i had better ask being the perambulating plaguespot i am i was not taking any risks  how horribly selfcentred you are you will talk as if you were in some special sort of quarantine i keep on telling you its the same for all of us  i suppose when im with him i shall have to be sterilized  i dont think it necessary myself but aunt lora does so its always done it humours her and it really isnt any trouble besides it may be necessary after all one never knows and its best to be on the safe side  kirk laid down his cigar firmly the cold cigar which stress of emotion had made him forget to keep alight  ruth old girl he said earnestly this is pure lunacy  ruths fingers wandered idly through his hair she did not speak for some moments  you will be good about it wont you kirk dear she said at last  it is curious what a large part hair and its treatment may play in the undoing of strong men the case of samson may be recalled in this connection kirk with ruth ruffling the wiry growth that hid his scalp was incapable of serious opposition he tried to be morose and resolute but failed miserably  oh very well he grunted  thats a good boy and you promise you wont go hugging bill again  very well  theres an angel for you now ill fix you a cocktail as a reward  well mind you sterilize it carefully  ruth laughed having gained her point she could afford to she made the cocktail and brought it to him  and now ill be off and dress and then you can take me out to lunch somewhere  arent you dressed  my goodness no not for going to restaurants you forget that im one of the idle rich now i spend my whole day putting on different kinds of clothes ive a position to keep up now mr winfield  kirk lit a fresh cigar and sat thinking the old feeling of desolation which had attacked him as he came up the bay had returned he felt like a stranger in a strange world life was not the same ruth was not the same nothing was the same  the more he contemplated the new regulations affecting bill the chillier and more unfriendly did they seem to him he could not bring himself to realize ruth as one of the great army of cranks preaching and carrying out the gospel of lora delane porter it seemed so at variance with her character as he had known it he could not seriously bring himself to believe that she genuinely approved of these absurd restrictions yet apparently she did  he looked into the future it had a grey and bleak aspect he seemed to himself like a man gazing down an unknown path full of unknown perils     chapter iii  the misadventure of steve   kirk was not the only person whom the sudden change in the financial position of the winfield family had hit hard the blighting effects of sudden wealth had touched steve while kirk was still in colombia  in a sense it had wrecked steves world nobody had told him to stop or even diminish the number of his visits but the fact remained that by the time kirk returned to new york he had practically ceased to go to the house on fifth avenue  for all his roughness steve possessed a delicacy which sometimes almost amounted to diffidence and he did not need to be told that there was a substantial difference as far as he was concerned between the new headquarters of the family and the old at the studio he had been accustomed to walk in when it pleased him sure of a welcome but he had an idea that he did not fit as neatly into the atmosphere of fifth avenue as he had done into that of sixtyfirst street and nobody disabused him of it  it was perhaps the presence of mrs porter that really made the difference in spite of the compliments she had sometimes paid to his common sense mrs porter did not put steve at his ease he was almost afraid of her consequently when he came to fifth avenue he remained below stairs talking pugilism with keggs  it was from keggs that he first learned of the changes that had taken place in the surroundings of william bannister  ive ad the privilege of serving in some of the best houses in england said the butler one evening as they sat smoking in the pantry and ive never seen such goings on i dont hold with the pampering of children  what do you mean pampering asked steve  well lord love a duck replied the butler who in his moments of relaxation was addicted to homely expletives of the lower london type if you dont call it pampering what do you call pampering he aint allowed to touch nothing that aint beenits slipped my memory what they call it but its got something to do with microbes they sprinkle stuff on his toys and on his clothes and on his nurse whats more and on any one who comes to see him and his nursery aint what i call a nursery at all its nothing more or less than a private ospital with its white tiles and its antiseptics and what not and the temperature just so and no lower nor higher i dont call it aving a proper faith in providence pampering and fussing over a child to that extent  youre stringing me  not a bit of it mr dingle ive seen the nursery with my own eyes and i ave my information direct from the young person who looks after the child  but say in the old days that kid was about the dandiest little sport that ever came down the pike you seen him that day i brought him round to say hello to the old man he didnt have no nursery at all then let alone one with white tiles ive seen him come up off the studio floor looking like a coon with the dust and miss ruth tickled to see him like that too for the love of mike whats come to her  its all along of this porter said keggs morosely shes done it all and if he went on with sudden heat she dont break her abit of addressing me in a tone what the umblest dorg would resent im liable to forget my place and give her a piece of my mind coming round and interfering  got your goat has she commented steve interested shes what youd call a tough proposition that dame i used to have my eye on her all the time in the old days waiting for her to start something but say id like to see this nursery youve been talking about take me up and let me lamp it  keggs shook his head  i darent mr dingle it ud be as much as my place is worth  but darn it im the kids godfather  that wouldnt make no difference to that porter shed pick on me just the same but if you care to risk it mr dingle ill show you where it is youll find the young person up there shell tell you more about the childs abits and daily life than i can  good enough said steve  he had not seen mamie for some time and absence had made the heart grow fonder it embittered him that his meetings with her were all too rare nowadays she seemed to have abandoned the practice of walking altogether for whenever he saw her now she was driving in the automobile with bill keggs information about the new system threw some light upon this and made him all the more anxious to meet her now  it was a curious delusion of steves that he was always going to pluck up courage and propose to mamie the very next time he saw her this had gone on now for over two years but he still clung to it repeated failures to reveal his burning emotions never caused him to lose the conviction that he would do it for certain next time  it was in his customary bracedup doordie frame of mind that he entered the nursery now  his visit to keggs had been rather a late one and had lasted some time before the subject of the white hope had been broached with the result that when steve arrived among the white tiles and antiseptics he found his godson in bed and asleep in a chair by the cot mamie sat sewing  her eyes widened with surprise when she saw who the visitor was and she put a finger to her lip and pointed to the sleeper and as we have to record another of the long list of steves failures to propose we may say here in excuse that this reception took a great deal of the edge off the dashing resolution which had been his up to that moment it made him feel selfconscious from the start  whatever brings you up here steve whispered mamie  it was not a very tactful remark perhaps considering that steve was the childs godfather and as such might reasonably expect to be allowed a free pass to his nursery but mamie like keggs had fallen so under the domination of lora delane porter that she had grown to consider it almost a natural law that no one came to see bill unless approved of and personally conducted by her  steve did not answer he was gaping at the fittings of the place in which he found himself it was precisely as keggs had described it white tiles and all  he was roused from his reflections by the approach of mamie or rather not so much by her approach as by the fact that at this moment she suddenly squirted something at him it was cold and wet and hit him in the face before as he put it to keggs later he could get his guard up  for the love of  sh said mamie warningly  whats the idea what are you handing me  ive got to its to sterilize you i do it to every one  gee youve got a swell job well go to it then shoot im ready  its boric acid explained mamie  i shouldnt wonder is this all part of the porter circus  yes  where is she inquired steve in sudden alarm is she likely to butt in  no shes out  good said steve and sat down relieved to resume his inspection of the room  when he had finished he drew a deep breath  well he said softly say mamie what do you think about it  im not paid to think about it steve  that means you agree with me that its the punkest state of things you ever struck well youre quite right it is its a shame to think of that innocent kid having this sort of deal handed to him why just think of him at the studio  but mamie whatever her private views was loyal to her employers she refused to be drawn into a discussion on the subject  have you been downstairs with mr keggs steve  yes it was him that told me about all this say mame we aint seen much of each other lately  no  mighty little  yes  having got as far as this steve should of course have gone resolutely ahead after all it is not a very long step from telling a girl in a hushed whisper with a shake in it that you have not seen much of her lately to hinting that you would like to see a great deal more of her in the future  steve was on the right lines and he knew it but that fatal lack of nerve which had wrecked him on all the other occasions when he had got as far as this undid him now he relapsed into silence and mamie went on sewing  in a way if you shut your eyes to the white tiles and the thermometer and the brass knobs and the showerbath it was a peaceful scene and steve as he sat there and watched mamie sew was stirred by it remove the white tiles the thermometer the brass knobs and the showerbath and this was precisely the sort of scene his imagination conjured up when the business of life slackened sufficiently to allow him to dream dreams  there he was sitting in one chair there was mamie sitting in another and there in the corner was the little white cotwell perhaps that was being a shade too prophetic on the other hand it always came into these dreams of his there in short was everything arranged just as he pictured it and all that was needed to make the picture real was for him to propose and mamie to accept him  it was the disturbing thought that the second condition did not necessarily follow on to the first that had kept steve from taking the plunge for the last two years unlike the hero of the poem he feared his fate too much to put it to the touch to win or lose it all  presently the silence began to oppress steve mamie had her needlework and that apparently served her in lieu of conversation but steve had nothing to occupy him and he began to grow restless he always despised himself thoroughly for his feebleness on these occasions and he despised himself now he determined to make a big effort  mamie he said  as he was nervous and had been silent so long that his vocal cords had gone off duty under the impression that their days work was over the word came out of him like a husky gunshot mamie started and the white hope who had been sleeping peacefully stirred and muttered  ssh hissed mamie  steve collapsed with the feeling that it was not his lucky night while mamie bent anxiously over the cot the sleeper however did not wake he gurgled gave a sigh then resumed his interrupted repose mamie returned to her seat  yes she said as if nothing had occurred and as if there had been no interval between steves remark and her reply  steve could not equal her calmness he had been strung up when he spoke and the interruption had undone him he reflected ruefully that he might have said something to the point if he had been allowed to go straight on now he had forgotten what he had meant to say  oh nothing he replied  silence fell once more on the nursery  steve was bracing himself up for another attack when suddenly there came a sound of voices from the stairs one voice was a mere murmur but the other was sharp and unmistakable the incisive note of lora delane porter it brought steve and mamie to their feet simultaneously  whats it matter said steve stoutly answering the panic in mamies eyes its not her house and i got a perfect right to be here  you dont know her i shall get into trouble  mamie was pale with apprehension she knew her lora delane porter and she knew what would happen if steve were to be discovered there it was as keggs put it as much as her place was worth  for a brief instant mamie faced a future in which she was driven from bills presence into outer darkness dismissed and told never to return that was what would happen sitting and talking with steve in the sacred nursery at this time of night was a crime and she had known it all the time but she had been glad to see steve again after all this whileif steve had known how glad he would certainly have found courage and said what he had so often failed to sayand knowing that mrs porter was out she had thought the risk of his presence worth taking now with discovery imminent panic came upon her  the voices were quite close now there was no doubt of the destination of the speakers they were heading slowly but directly for the nursery  steve not being fully abreast of the new rules and regulations of the sacred apartment could not read mamies mind completely he did not know that under mrs porters code the admission of a visitor during the hours of sleep was a felony in the first degree punishable by instant dismissal but mamies face and her brief reference to trouble were enough to tell him that the position was critical and with the instinct of the trapped he looked round him for cover  but the white hopes nursery was not constructed with a view to providing cover for bulky gentlemen who should not have been there it was as bare as a billiardtable as far as practicable hidingplaces were concerned  and then his eye caught the waterproof sheet of the showerbath behind that there was just room for concealment  with a brief nod of encouragement to mamie he leaped at it the door opened as he disappeared  mrs porters rules concerning visitors though stringent as regarded mamie were capable of being relaxed when she herself was the person to relax them she had a visitor with her nowa long severelooking lady with a sharp nose surmounted by spectacles who taking in the white tiles the thermometer the cot and the brass knobs in a single comprehensive glance observed admirable  mrs porter was obviously pleased with this approval her companion was a woman doctor of great repute among the advanced apostles of hygiene and praise from her was praise indeed she advanced into the room with an air of suppressed pride  these tiles are thoroughly cleaned twice each day with an antiseptic solution  just so said the spectacled lady  you notice the thermometer  exactly  those knobs you see on the wall have various uses  quite  they examined the knobs with an air of profound seriousness mrs porter erect and complacent the other leaning forward and peering through her spectacles mamie took advantage of their backs and turned to cast a hurried glance at the waterproof curtain it was certainly an admirable screen no sign of steve was visible but nevertheless she did not cease to quake  this said mrs porter controls the heat this this and this are for the ventilation  just so just so just so said the doctor and this of course is for the showerbath i understand  and extending a firm finger she gave the knob a forceful push  mrs porter nodded  that is the cold shower she said this is the hot it is a very ingenious arrangement one of malcolmsons patents there is a regulator at the side of the bath which enables the nurse to get just the correct temperature i will turn on both and then  it was as mrs porters hand was extended toward the knob that the paralysis which terror had put upon mamie relaxed its grip she had stood by without a movement while the cold water splashed down upon the hidden steve her heart had ached for him but she had not stirred but now with the prospect of allowing him to be boiled alive before her she acted  it is generally only on the stage that a little child comes to the rescue of adults at critical moments but william bannister was accorded the opportunity of doing so off it it happened that at the moment of mrs porters entry mamie had been standing near his cot and she had not moved since the consequence was that she was within easy reach of him and despair giving her what in the circumstances amounted to a flash of inspiration she leaned quickly forward even as mrs porters finger touched the knob and gave the round head on the pillow a rapid push  william bannister sat up with a grunt rubbed his eyes and seeing strangers began to cry  it was so obvious to mrs porter and her companion both from the evidence of their guilty consciences and the look of respectful reproach on mamies face that the sound of their voices had disturbed the child that they were routed from the start  oh dear me he is awake said the lady doctor  i am afraid we did not lower our voices added mrs porter and yet william is usually such a sound sleeper perhaps we had better  just so said the doctor  go downstairs while the nurse gets him off to sleep again  quite  the door closed behind them                                       oh steve said mamie  the white hope had gone to sleep again with the amazing speed of childhood and mamie was looking pityingly at the bedraggled object which had emerged cautiously from behind the waterproof  i got mine muttered steve ruefully you aint got a towel anywhere have you mame  mamie produced a towel and watched him apologetically as he attempted to dry himself  im so sorry steve  cut it out it was my fault i oughtnt to have been there say it was a bit of luck the kid waking just then  yes said mamie  observe the tricks that conscience plays us if mamie had told steve what had caused william to wake he would certainly have been so charmed by her presence of mind exerted on his behalf to save him from the warm fate which mrs porters unconscious hand had been about to bring down upon him that he would have forgotten his diffidence then and there and as the poet has it have eased his bosom of much perilous stuff  but conscience would not allow mamie to reveal the secret already she was suffering the pangs of remorse for having in however good a cause broken her idols rest with a push that might have given the poor lamb a headache she could not confess the crime even to steve  and if steve had had the pluck to tell mamie that he loved her as he stood before her dripping with the water which he had suffered in silence rather than betray her she would have fallen into his arms for steve at that moment had all the glamour for her of the selfsacrificing hero of a movingpicture film he had not actually risked death for her perhaps but he had taken a sudden cold showerbath without a murmurall for her  mamie was thrilled she looked at him with the gleaming eyes of devotion  but steve just because he knew that he was wet and fancied that he must look ridiculous held his peace  and presently his secret still locked in his bosom and his collar sticking limply to his neck he crept downstairs avoiding the society of his fellow man and slunk out into the night where if there was no mamie there were at any rate dry clothes     chapter iv  the widening gap   the new life hit kirk as a wave hits a bather and like a wave swept him off his feet choked him and generally filled him with a feeling of discomfort  he should have been prepared for it but he was not he should have divined from the first that the money was bound to produce changes other than a mere shifting of headquarters from sixtyfirst street to fifth avenue but he had deluded himself at first with the idea that ruth was different from other women that she was superior to the artificial pleasures of the society which is distinguished by the big s  in a moment of weakness induced by hairruffling he had given in on the point of the hygienic upbringing of william bannister but there he had imagined his troubles were to cease he had supposed that he was about to resume the old hermitscell life of the studio and live in a world which contained only ruth bill and himself  he was quickly undeceived within two days he was made aware of the fact that ruth was in the very centre of the social whirlpool and that she took it for granted that he would join her there there was nothing of the hermit about ruth now she was amazingly undomestic  her old distaste for the fashionable life of new york seemed to have vanished absolutely as far as kirk could see she was always entertaining or being entertained he was pitched headlong into a world where people talked incessantly of things which bored him and did things which seemed to him simply mad and ruth whom he had thought he understood revelled in it all  at first he tried to get at her point of view to discover what she found to enjoy in this lunatic existence of aimlessness and futility one night as they were driving home from a dinner which had bored him unspeakably he asked the question pointblank it seemed to him incredible that she could take pleasure in an entertainment which had filled him with such depression  ruth he said impulsively as the car moved off what do you see in this sort of thing how can you stand these people what have you in common with them  poor old kirk i know you hated it tonight but we shant be dining with the baileys every night  bailey bannister had been their host on that occasion and the dinner had been elaborate and gorgeous mrs bailey was now one of the leaders of the younger set bailey looking much more than a year older than when kirk had seen him last had presided at the head of the table with great dignity and the meeting with him had not contributed to the pleasure of kirks evening  were you awfully bored you seemed to be getting along quite well with sybil  i like her shes good fun  shes certainly having good fun id give anything to know what bailey really thinks of it she is the most shockingly extravagant little creature in new york you know the wilburs were quite poor and poor sybil was kept very short i think that marrying bailey and having all this money to play with has turned her head  it struck kirk that the criticism applied equally well to the critic  she does the most absurd things she gave a freak dinner when you were away that cost i dont know how much she is always doing something well i suppose bailey knows what he is about but at her present pace she must be keeping him busy making money to pay for all her fads you ought to paint a picture of bailey kirk as the typical patient american husband you couldnt get a better model  suggest it to him and let me hide somewhere where i can hear what he says bailey has his own opinion of my pictures  ruth laughed a little nervously she had always wondered exactly what had taken place that day in the studio and the subject was one which she was shy of exhuming she turned the conversation  what did you ask me just now something about  i asked you what you had in common with these people  ruth reflected  oh well its rather difficult to say if you put it like that theyre just people you know they are amusing sometimes i used to know most of them i suppose that is the chief thing which brings us together they happen to be there and if youre travelling on a road you naturally talk to your fellow travellers but why dont you like them which of them didnt you like  it was kirks turn to reflect  well thats hard to answer too i dont think i actively liked or disliked any of them they seemed to me just not worth while my point is rather why are we wasting a perfectly good evening mixing with them whats the use thats my case in a nutshell  if you put it like that whats the use of anything one must do something we cant be hermits  a curious feeling of being infinitely far from ruth came over kirk she dismissed his dream as a whimsical impossibility not worthy of serious consideration why could they not be hermits they had been hermits before and it had been the happiest period of both their lives why just because an old man had died and left them money must they rule out the best thing in life as impossible and plunge into a nightmare which was not life at all  he had tried to deceive himself but he could do so no longer ruth had changed the curse with which his sensitive imagination had invested john bannisters legacy was after all no imaginary curse like a golden wedge it had forced ruth and himself apart  everything had changed he was no longer the centre of ruths life he was just an encumbrance a nuisance who could not be got rid of and must remain a permanent handicap always in the way  so thought kirk morbidly as the automobile passed through the silent streets it must be remembered that he had been extremely bored for a solid three hours and was predisposed consequently to gloomy thoughts  whatever his faults kirk rarely whined he had never felt so miserable in his life but he tried to infuse a tone of lightness into the conversation after all if ruths intuition fell short of enabling her to understand his feelings nothing was to be gained by parading them  i guess its my fault he said that i havent got abreast of the society game as yet you had better give me a few pointers my trouble is that being new to them i cant tell whether these people are types or exceptions take clarence grayling for instance are there any more at home like clarence  my dear child all baileys special friends are like clarence exactly like i remember telling him so once  who was the specimen with the little black moustache who thought america crude and said that the only place to live in was southern italy is he an isolated case or an epidemic  he is scarcer than clarence but hes quite a wellmarked type he is the millionaires son who has done europe and doesnt mean you to forget it  there was a chesty person with a wave of hair coming down over his forehead a sickeningly handsome fellow who looked like a poet i think they called him basil does he run around in flocks or is he unique  ruth did not reply for a moment basil milbank was a part of the past which in the year during which kirk had been away had come rather startlingly to life  there had been a time when basil had been very near and important to her indeed but for the intervention of mrs porter described in an earlier passage she would certainly have married basil then kirk had crossed her path and had monopolized her during the studio period the recollection of basil had grown faint after that just at the moment when kirk was not there to lend her strength he had come back into her life for nearly a year she had seen him daily and graduallyat first almost with fearshe had realized that the old fascination was by no means such a thing of the past as she had supposed  she had hoped for kirks return as a general sorely pressed hopes for reinforcements with kirk at her side she felt basil would slip back into his proper place in the scheme of things and behold kirk had returned and still the tension remained unrelaxed  for kirk had changed after the first day she could not conceal it from herself that it was she who had changed did not present itself to her as a possible explanation of the fact that she now felt out of touch with her husband all she knew was that they had been linked together by bonds of sympathy and were so no longer  she found kirk dull she hated to admit it but the truth forced itself upon her he had begun to bore her  she collected her thoughts and answered his question  basil milbank oh i should call him unique  she felt a wild impulse to warn him to explain the real significance of this man whom he classed contemptuously with clarence grayling and that absurd little dana ferris as somebody of no account she wanted to cry out to him that she was in danger and that only he could help her but she could not speak and kirk went on in the same tone of halftolerant contempt  who is he  she controlled herself with an effort and answered indifferently  oh basil well you might say hes everything he plays polo leads cotillions yachts shoots plays the piano wonderfullyeverything people usually like him very much she paused women especially  she had tried to put something into her tone which might serve to awaken him something which might prepare the way for what she wanted to sayand what if she did not say it nowwhen the mood was on her she could never say but kirk was deaf  he looks that sort of man he said  and as he said it the accumulated boredom of the past three hours found vent in a vast yawn  ruth set her teeth she felt as if she had received a blow  when he spoke again it was on the subject of streetpaving defects in new york city                                       it was true as ruth had said that they did not dine with the baileys every night but that seemed to kirk as the days went on the one and only bright spot in the new state of affairs he could not bring himself to treat life with a philosophical resignation his was not open revolt he was outwardly docile but inwardly he rebelled furiously  perhaps the unnaturally secluded life which he had led since his marriage had unfitted him for mixing in society even more than nature had done he had grown out of the habit of mixing crowds irritated him he hated doing the same thing at the same time as a hundred other people  like most bohemians he was at his best in a small circle he liked his friends as single spies not in battalions he was a man who should have had a few intimates and no acquaintances and his present life was bounded north south east and west by acquaintances most of the men to whom he spoke he did not even know by name  he would seek information from ruth as they drove home  who was the popeyed secondstory man with the bald head and the convex waistcoat who glued himself to me tonight  if you mean the fine old gentleman with the slightly prominent eyes and rather thin hair that was brock mason the vicepresident of consolidated groceries you mustnt even think disrespectfully of a man as rich as that  he isnt what you would call a sparkling talker  he doesnt have to be his time is worth a hundred dollars a minute or a secondi forget which  put me down for a nickels worth next time  and then they began to laugh over ruths suggestion that they should save up and hire mr mason for an afternoon and make him keep quiet all the time for ruth was generally ready to join him in ridiculing their new acquaintances she had none of that reverence for the great and the neargreat which running to seed becomes snobbery  it was this trait in her which kept alive long after it might have died the hope that her present state of mind was only a phase and that when she had tired of the new game she would become the old ruth of the studio but when he was honest with himself he was forced to admit that she showed no signs of ever tiring of it  they had drifted apart they were out of touch with each other it was not an uncommon state of things in the circle in which kirk now found himself indeed it seemed to him that the semidetached couple was the rule rather than the exception  but there was small consolation in this reflection he was not at all interested in the domestic troubles of the people he mixed with his own hit him very hard  ruth had criticized little mrs bailey but there was no doubt that she herself had had her head turned quite as completely by the new life  the first time that kirk realized this was when he came upon an article in a sunday paper printed around a blurred caricature which professed to be a photograph of mrs kirk winfield in which she was alluded to with reverence and gusto as one of societys leading hostesses in the course of the article reference was made to no fewer than three freak dinners of varying ingenuity which she had provided for her delighted friends  it was this that staggered kirk that mrs bailey should indulge in this particular form of insanity was intelligible but that ruth should have descended to it was another thing altogether  he did not refer to the article when he met ruth but he was more than ever conscious of the gap between themthe gap which was widening every day  the experiences he had undergone during the year of his wandering had strengthened kirk considerably but nature is not easily expelled and the constitutional weakness of character which had hampered him through life prevented him from making any open protests or appeal moreover he could understand now her point of view and that disarmed him  he saw how this state of things had come about in a sense it was the natural state of things ruth had been brought up in certain surroundings her love for him new and overwhelming had enabled her to free herself temporarily from these surroundings and to become reconciled to a life for which he told himself she had never been intended fate had thrown her back into her natural sphere and now she revelled in the old environment as an exile revels in the life of the homeland from which he has been so long absent  that was the crux of the tragedy ruth was at home he was not ruth was among her own people he was a stranger among strangers a prisoner in a land where men spoke with an alien tongue  there was nothing to be done the gods had played one of their practical jokes and he must join in the laugh against himself and try to pretend that he was not hurt     chapter v  the real thing   kirk sat in the nursery with his chin on his hands staring gloomily at william bannister on the floor william bannister played some game of his own invention with his box of bricks  they were alone it was the first time they had been alone together for two weeks as a rule when kirk paid his daily visit lora delane porter was there watchful and forbidding prepared on the slightest excuse to fall upon him with rules and prohibitions today she was out and kirk had the field to himself for mamie whose duty it was to mount guard and who had been threatened with many terrible things by mrs porter if she did not stay on guard had once more allowed her too sympathetic nature to get the better of her and had vanished  kirk was too dispirited to take advantage of his good fortune he had a sense of being there on parole of being on his honour not to touch so he sat in his chair and looked at bill while bill crooning to himself played decorously with bricks  the truth had been a long time in coming home to kirk but it had reached him at last ever since his return he had clung to the belief that it was a genuine conviction of its merits that had led ruth to support her aunts scheme for bills welfare he himself had always looked on the exaggerated precautions for the maintenance of the latters health as ridiculous and unnecessary but he had acquiesced in them because he thought that ruth sincerely believed them indispensable  after all he had not been there when bill so nearly died and he could understand that the shock of that episode might have distorted the judgment even of a woman so well balanced as ruth he was quite ready to be loyal to her in the matter however distasteful it might be to him  but now he saw the truth a succession of tiny incidents had brought light to him ruth might or might not be to some extent genuine in her belief in the new system but her chief motive for giving it her support was something quite different he had tried not to admit to himself but he could do so no longer ruth allowed mrs porter to have her way because it suited her to do so because with mrs porter on the premises she had more leisure in which to amuse herself because to put it in a word the child had begun to bore her  everything pointed to that in the old days it had been her chief pleasure to be with the boy their walks in the park had been a daily ceremony with which nothing had been allowed to interfere but now she always had some excuse for keeping away from him  her visits to the nursery when she did go there were brief and perfunctory and the mischief of it was that she always presented such admirable reasons for abstaining from bills society when it was suggested to her that she should go to him that it was impossible to bring her out into the open and settle the matter once and for all  patience was one of the virtues which set off the defects in kirks character but he did not feel very patient now as he sat and watched bill playing on the floor  well bill old man what do you make of it all he said at last  the child looked up and fixed him with unwinking eyes kirk winced they were so exactly ruths eyes that wideopen expression when somebody speaking suddenly to her interrupted a train of thought was one of her hundred minor charms  bill had reproduced it to the life he stared for a moment then as if there had been some telepathy between them said i want mummy  kirk laughed bitterly  you arent the only one i want mummy too  where is mummy  i couldnt tell you exactly at a luncheonparty somewhere  whats luncheonparty  a sort of entertainment where everybody eats too much and talks all the time without ever saying a thing thats worth hearing  bill considered this gravely  why  because they like it i suppose  why do they like it  goodness knows  does mummy like it  i suppose so  does mummy eat too much  she doesnt the others do  why  william bannisters thirst for knowledge was at this time perhaps his most marked characteristic no encyclopaedia could have coped with it kirk was accustomed to do his best cheerfully yielding up what little information on general subjects he happened to possess but he was like mrs partington sweeping back the atlantic ocean with her broom  because theyve been raised that way he replied to the last question bill old man when you grow up dont you ever become one of these fellows who cant walk two blocks without stopping three times to catch up with their breath if you get like that mutt dana ferris youll break my heart and youre heading that way poor kid  whats ferris  hes a man i met at dinner the other night when he was your age he was the richest child in america and everybody fussed over him till he grew up into a wretched little creature with a black moustache and two chins you ought to see him he would make you laugh and you dont get much to laugh at nowadays i guess it isnt hygienic for a kid to laugh bill honestlywhat do you think of things dont you ever want to hurl one of those sterilized bricks of yours at a certain lady or has she taken all the heart out of you by this time  this was beyond bill as kirks monologues frequently were he changed the subject  i wish i had a cat he said by way of starting a new topic  well why havent you a cat why havent you a dozen cats if you want them  i asked aunty lora could i have a cat and she said certainly not cats arecats are  unhygienic  whats that  its what your aunt lora might think a cat was or did she say pestilential  i dont amember  but she wouldnt let you have one  mamie said a cat might scratch me  well you wouldnt mind that said kirk anxiously  he had come to be almost morbidly on the lookout for evidence which might go to prove that this cottonwool existence was stealing from the child the birthright of courage which was his from both his parents much often depends on little things and if bill had replied in the affirmative to the question it would probably have had the result of sending kirk there and then raging through the house conducting a sort of war of independence  the only thing that had kept him from doing so before was the reflection that mrs porters system could not be definitely taxed with any harmful results but his mind was never easy every day found him still nervously on the alert for symptoms  bill soothed him now by answering no in a very decided voice all well so far but it had been an anxious moment  it seemed incredible to kirk that the life he was leading should not in time turn the child into a whimpering bundle of nerves his conversations with bill were as a result a sort of spiritual parallel to the daily taking of his temperature with the thermometer sooner or later he always led the talk round to some point where bill must make a definite pronouncement which would show whether or not the insidious decay had begun to set in  so far all appeared to be well in earlier conversations bill subtly questioned had stoutly maintained that he was not afraid of indians dogs pirates mice cows junebugs or noises in the dark he had even gone so far as to state that if an indian chief found his way into the nursery he bill would chop his head off the most exacting father could not have asked more and yet kirk was not satisfied he remained uneasy  it so happened that this afternoon bill who had had hitherto to maintain his reputation for intrepidity entirely by verbal statements was afforded an opportunity of providing a practical demonstration that his heart was in the right place the game he was playing with the bricks was one that involved a certain amount of running about with a puffing accompaniment of a vaguely equine nature and while performing this part of the programme he chanced to trip he hesitated for a moment as if uncertain whether to fall or remain standing then did the former with a most emphatic bump  he scrambled up stood looking at kirk with a twitching lip then gave a great gulp and resumed his trotting the whole exhibition of indomitable heroism was over in half a minute and he did not even bother to wait for applause  the effect of the incident on kirk was magical he was in the position of an earnest worshipper who tortured with doubts has prayed for a sign this was a revelation a million antiindian statements however resolute were nothing to this  this was the real thing before his eyes this superchild of his had fallen in a manner which might quite reasonably have led to tears which would kirk felt sure have produced bellows of anguish from every other child in america and what had happened not a moan no sir not one solitary cry just a gulp which you had to strain your ears to hear and which at that might have been a mere takingin of breath such as every athlete must do and all was over  this child of his was the real thing it had been proved beyond possibility of criticism  there are moments when a man on parole forgets his promise all thought of rules and prohibitions went from kirk he rose from his seat grabbed his son with both hands and hugged him we cannot even begin to estimate the number of bacilli which must have rushed whooping with joy on to the unfortunate child under a microscope it would probably have looked like an old home week and kirk did not care he simply kept on hugging that was the sort of man he wasthoroughly heartless  bill youre great he cried  bill had been an amazed party to the incident nothing of this kind had happened to him for so long that he had forgotten there were children to whom this sort of thing did happen then he recollected a similar encounter with a bearded man down in the hall when he came in one morning from his ride in the automobile a moment later he had connected his facts  this man who had no beard was the same man as the man who had a beard and this behaviour was a personal eccentricity of his the thought crossed his mind that aunty lora would not approve of this  and then surprisingly there came the thought that he did not care whether aunty lora approved or not he liked it and that was enough for him  the seeds of revolt had been sown in the bosom of william bannister  it happened that ruth returning from her luncheonparty looked in at the nursery on her way upstairs she was confronted with the spectacle of bill seated on kirks lap his face against kirks shoulder kirk though he had stopped speaking as the door opened appeared to be in the middle of a story for bill after a brief glance at the newcomer asked what happened then  kirk really said ruth  kirk did not appear in the least ashamed of himself  ruth this kid is the most amazing kid do you know what happened just now he was running along and he tripped and came down flat and he didnt even think of crying he just picked himself up and  that was very brave of you billy but seriously kirk you shouldnt hug him like that think what aunt lora would say  aunt lora bebother aunt lora  well i wont give you away if she heard she would write a book about it and she was just starting to come up when i was downstairs we came in together you had better fly while theres time  it was sound advice and kirk took it  it was not till some time later going over the incident again in his mind he realized how very lightly ruth had treated what if she really adhered to mrs porters views on hygiene should have been to her a dreadful discovery the reflection was pleasant to him for a moment it seemed to draw ruth and himself closer together then he saw the reverse side of it  if ruth did not really believe in this absurd hygienic nonsense why had she permitted it to be practised upon the boy there was only one answer and it was the one which kirk had already guessed at she did it because it gave her more freedom because it bored her to look after the child herself because she was not the same ruth he had left at the studio when he started with hank jardine for colombia     chapter vi  the outcasts   three months of his new life had gone by before kirk awoke from the stupor which had gripped him as the result of the general upheaval of his world ever since his return from colombia he had honestly been intending to resume his painting and attacking it this time in a businesslike way to try to mould himself into the semblance of an efficient artist  his mind had been full of fine resolutions he would engage a good teacher some competent artist whom fortune had not treated well and who would be glad of the jobwashington square and its neighbourhood were full of themand settle down grimly working regular hours to recover lost ground  but the rush of life as lived on the upper avenue had swept him away he had been carried along on the rapids of dinners parties dances theatres luncheons and the rest and his great resolve had gone bobbing away from him on the current  he had recovered it now and climbed painfully ashore feeling bruised and exhausted but determined                                       among the motley crowd which had made the studio a home in the days of kirks bachelorhood had been an artistone might almost say an exartistnamed robert dwight penway an overfondness for rye whisky at the brevoort cafe had handicapped robert as an active force in the world of new york art as a practical worker he was not greatly esteemedleast of all by the editors of magazines who had paid advance cheques to him for work which when delivered at all was delivered too late for publication these once bitten were now twice shy of mr penway they did not deny his great talents which were indeed indisputable but they were fixed in their determination not to make use of them  fate could have provided no more suitable ally for kirk it was universally admitted around washington square andgrudginglydowntown that in the matter of theory mr penway excelled he could teach to perfection what he was too erratic to practise  robert dwight penway run to earth one sultry evening in the brevoort welcomed kirk as a brother as a rich brother even when his first impression that he was to have the run of the house on fifth avenue and mix freely with touchable multimillionaires had been corrected his altitude was still brotherly he parted from kirk with many solemn promises to present himself at the studio daily and teach him enough art to put him clear at the top of the profession way above all these other dubs asserted mr penway  robert dwight penways attitude toward his contemporaries in art bore a striking resemblance to steves estimate of his successors in the middleweight department of the american prizering  surprisingly to those who knew him mr penway was as good as his word certainly kirks terms had been extremely generous but he had thrown away many a contract of equal value in his palmy days possibly his activity was due to his liking for kirk or it may have been that the prospect of sitting by with a cigar while somebody else worked with nothing to do all day except offer criticism and advice appealed to him  at any rate he appeared at the studio on the following afternoon completely sober and excessively critical he examined the canvases which kirk had hauled from shelves and corners for his inspection one after another he gazed upon them in an increasingly significant silence when the last one was laid aside he delivered judgment  golly he said  kirk flushed it was not that he was not in complete agreement with the verdict looking at these paintings some of which he had in the old days thought extremely good he was forced to admit that golly was the only possible criticism  he had not seen them for a long time and absence had enabled him to correct first impressions moreover something had happened to him causing him to detect flaws where he had seen only merits life had sharpened his powers of judgment he was a grown man looking at the follies of his youth  burn them said mr penway lighting a cigar with the air of one restoring his tissues after a strenuous ordeal burn the lot theyre awful darned amateur nightmares they offend the eye cast them into a burning fiery furnace  kirk nodded the criticism was just it erred if at all on the side of mildness certainly something had happened to him since he perpetrated those daubs he had developed he saw things with new eyes  i guess i had better start right in again at the beginning he sad  earlier than that amended mr penway                                       so kirk settled down to a routine of hard work and so doing drove another blow at the wedge which was separating his life from ruths there were days now when they did not meet at all and others when they saw each other for a few short moments in which neither seemed to have much to say  ruth had made a perfunctory protest against the new departure  really she said it does seem absurd for you to spend all your time down at that old studio it isnt as if you had to but of course if you want to  and she had gone on to speak of other subjects it was plain to kirk that his absence scarcely affected her she was still in the rapids and every day carried her farther away from him  it did not hurt him now a sort of apathy seemed to have fallen on him the old days became more and more remote sometimes he doubted whether anything remained of her former love for him and sometimes he wondered if he still loved her she was so different that it was almost as if she were a stranger once they had had everything in common now it seemed to him that they had nothingnot even bill  he did not brood upon it he gave himself no time for that he worked doggedly on under the blasphemous but efficient guidance of mr penway he was becoming a man with a fixed ideathe idea of making good  he began to make headway his beginnings were small but practical he no longer sat down when the spirit moved him to dash off vague masterpieces which might turn into something quite unexpected on the road to completion he snatched at anything definite that presented itself  sometimes it was a couple of illustrations to a short story in one of the minor magazines sometimes a picture to go with an eulogy of a patent medicine whatever it was he seized upon it and put into it all the talent he possessed and thanks to the indefatigable coaching of robert dwight penway a certain merit was beginning to creep into his work his drawing was growing firmer he no longer shirked difficulties  mr penway was good enough to approve of his progress being free from any morbid distaste for himself he attributed that progress to its proper source as he said once in a moment of expansive candour he could given a free hand and something to drink and smoke while doing it make an artist out of two sticks and a lump of coal  why ive made you turn out things that are like something on earth my boy he said proudly and that he added as he reached out for the bottle of bourbon which kirk had provided for him is going some  kirk was far too grateful to resent the slightly unflattering note a more spirited man might have detected in the remark                                       only once during those days did kirk allow himself to weaken and admit to himself how wretched he was he was drawing a picture of steve at the time and steve had the sympathy which encourages weakness in others  it was a significant sign of his changed attitude towards his profession that he was not drawing steve as a figure in an allegorical picture or as apollo or the toiler but simply as a welldeveloped young man who had had the good sense to support his nether garments with middletons undeniable suspenders the picture when completed would show steve smirking down at the region of his waistline and announcing with pride and satisfaction theyre middletons kirk was putting all he knew into the work and his face as he drew was dark and gloomy  steve noted this with concern he had perceived for some time that kirk had changed he had lost all his old boyish enjoyment of their sparringbouts and he threw the medicineball with an absent gloom almost equal to baileys  it had not occurred to steve to question kirk about this if kirk had anything on his mind which he wished to impart he would say it meanwhile the friendly thing for him to do was to be quiet and pretend to notice nothing  it seemed to steve that nothing was going right these days here was he chafing at his inability to open his heart to mamie here was kirk obviously in trouble anda smaller thing but of interest as showing how universal the present depression wasthere was bailey bannister equally obviously much worried over something or other  for bailey had reinstated steve in the place he had occupied before old john bannister had dismissed him and for some time past steve had marked him down as a man with a secret trouble he had never been of a riotously cheerful disposition but it had been possible once to draw him into conversation at the close of the mornings exercises now he hardly spoke and often when steve arrived in the morning he was informed that mr bannister had started for wall street early on important business  these things troubled steve his simple soul abhorred a mystery  but it was the case of kirk that worried him most for he half guessed that the latters gloom had to do with ruth and he worshipped ruth  kirk laid down his sketch and got up  i guess thatll do for the moment steve he said  steve relaxed the attitude of proud satisfaction which he had assumed in order to do justice to the undeniable suspenders he stretched himself and sat down  you certainly are working to beat the band just now squire he remarked  its a pretty good thing work steve said kirk if it does nothing else it keeps you from thinking  he knew it was feeble of him but he was powerfully impelled to relieve himself by confiding his wretchedness to steve he need not say much he told himself plausiblyonly just enough to lighten the burden a little  he would not be disloyal to ruthhe had not sunk to thatbut after all steve was steve it was not like blurting out his troubles to a stranger it would harm nobody and do him a great deal of good if he talked to steve  he relit his pipe which had gone out during a tense spell of work on the suspenders  well steve he said what do you think of life how is this best of all possible worlds treating you  steve deposed that life was pretty punk  youre a great describer steve youve hit it first time punk is the word its funny if you look at it properly take my own case the superficial observer who is apt to be a bonehead would say that i ought to be singing psalms of joy i am married to the woman i wanted to marry i have a son who not to be fulsome is a perfectly good sort of son i have no financial troubles i eat well i have ceased to tremble when i see a job of work in fact i have advanced in my art to such an extent that shrewd business men like middleton put the pictorial side of their undeniable suspenders in my hands and go off to play golf with their minds easy having perfect confidence in my skill and judgment if i cant be merry and bright who can do you find me merry and bright steve  ive seen you in better shape said steve cautiously  ive felt in better shape  steve coughed the conversation was about to become delicate  whats eating you colonel he asked presently  kirk frowned in silence at the undeniable for a few moments then the pentup misery of months exploded in a cascade of words he jumped up and began to walk restlessly about the studio  damn it steve i ought not to say a word i know its weak and cowardly and bad taste and everything else you can think of to speak of iteven to you ones supposed to stand this sort of roasting at the stake with a grin as if one enjoyed it but after all you are different its not as if it was any one you are different arent you  sure  well you know whats wrong as well as i do  surest thing you know its hit me too  hows that  well things aint the same thats about what it comes to  kirk stopped and looked at him his expression was wistful i ought not to be talking about it  you go right ahead squire said steve soothingly i know just how you feel and i guess talkings not going to do any harm act as if i wasnt here look on it as a monologue i dont amount to anything  when did you go to the house last steve  steve reflected  about a couple of weeks ago i reckon  see the kid  steve shook his head  seeing his nibs aint my long suit these days i may be wrong but i got the idea there was a deadline for me about three blocks away from the nursery i asked keggs was the coast clear but he said the porter dame was in the ring so i kind of thought id better away i dont seem to fit in with all them white tiles and thermometers  you used to see him every day when we were here and you didnt seem to contaminate him as far as any one could notice  there was a silence  do you see him often colonel  kirk laughed  oh yes im favoured i pay a state visit every day think of that i sit in a chair at the other end of the room while mrs porter stands between to see that i dont start anything bill plays with his sterilized bricks occasionally he and i exchange a few civil words its as jolly and sociable as you could want we have great times  say on the level i wonder you stand for it  ive got to stand for it  hes your kid  not exclusively i have a partner steve  steve snorted dolefully  aint it hell the way things break loose in this world he sighed whod have thought two years ago  do you make it only two i should have put it at about two thousand  honest squire if any one had told me then that miss ruth had it in her to take up with all these fool stunts  well i cant say i was prepared for it  steve coughed again kirk was in an expansive mood this afternoon and the occasion was ideal for the putting forward of certain views which he had long wished to impart but on the other hand the subject was a peculiarly delicate one it has been well said that it is better for a third party to quarrel with a buzzsaw than to interfere between husband and wife and steve was constitutionally averse to anything that savoured of butting in  still kirk had turned the talk into this channel he decided to risk it  if i were you he said id get busy and start something  such as what  steve decided to abandon caution and speak his mind him almost as much as kirk the existing state of things had driven to desperation though in a sense he was only a spectator the fact that the altered conditions of kirks life involved his almost complete separation from mamie gave him what might be called a stake in the affair the brief and rare glimpses which he got of her nowadays made it absolutely impossible for him to conduct his wooing on a businesslike basis a diffident man cannot possibly achieve any success in odd moments constant propinquity is his only hope  that fact alone he considered almost gave him the right to interfere and apart from that his affection for kirk and ruth gave him a claim finally he held what was practically an official position in the family councils on the strength of being william bannister winfields godfather  he loved william bannister as a son and it had been one of his favourite day dreams to conjure up a vision of the time when he should be permitted to undertake the childs physical training he had toyed lovingly with the idea of imparting to this promising pupil all that he knew of the greatest game on earth he had watched him in the old days staggering about the studio and had pictured him grown to his full strength his muscles trained his brain full of the wisdom of one who if his mother had not kicked would have been middleweight champion of america  he had resigned himself to the fact that the infants social status made it impossible that he should be the real white hope whom he had once pictured beating all comers in the roped ring but after all there was a certain mild fame to be acquired even by an amateur and now that dream was overunless kirk could be goaded into strong action in time  why dont you sneak the kid away somewhere he suggested why dont you go right in at them and say its my kid and im going to take him away into the country out of all this whitetile stuff and let him roll in the mud same as he used to why say theres that shack of yours in connecticut just made for it that kid would have the time of his life there  you think thats the solution do you steve  im dead sure it is steves voice became more and more enthusiastic as the idea unfolded itself why it aint only the kid im thinking of theres miss ruth say you dont mind me pulling this line of talk  go ahead i began it what about miss ruth  well you know just whats the matter with her shes let this society game run away with her i guess she started it because she felt lonesome when you were away and now its got her and she cant drop it all she wants is a jolt it would slow her up and show her just where she was shes asking for it one good snappy jolt would put the whole thing right and this thing of jerking the kid away to connecticut would be the right dope believe me  kirk shook his head  it wouldnt do steve it isnt that i dont want to do it but one must play to the rules i cant explain what i mean i can only say its impossible lets think of a parallel case when you were in the ring there must have been times when you had a chance of hitting your man low why didnt you do it it would have jolted him all right  why id have lost on a foul  well so should i lose on a foul if i started the sort of roughhouse you suggest  i dont get you  well if you want it in plain english ruth would never forgive me is that clear enough  youre dead wrong boss said steve excitedly i know her  i thought i did well anyway steve thanks for the suggestion but believe me nothing doing and now if you feel like it i wish you would resume your celebrated imitation of a man exulting over the fact that he is wearing middletons undeniable there isnt much more to do and i should like to get through with it today if possible there hold that pose its exactly right the honest man gloating over his suspenders you ought to go on the stage steve     chapter vii  cutting the tangled knot   there are some men whose mission in life it appears to be to go about the world creating crises in the lives of other people when there is thunder in the air they precipitate the thunderbolt  bailey bannister was one of these he meant extraordinarily well but he was a dangerous man for that very reason and in a properly constituted world would have been segregated or kept under supervision he would not leave the tangled lives of those around him to adjust themselves he blundered in and tried to help he nearly always produced a definite result but seldom the one at which he aimed  that he should have interfered in the affairs of ruth and kirk at this time was it must be admitted unselfish of him for just now he was having troubles of his own on a somewhat extensive scale his wifes extravagance was putting a strain on his finances and he was faced with the choice of checking her or increasing his income being very much in love he shrank from the former task and adopted the other way out of the difficulty  it was this that had led to the change in his manner noticed by steve in order to make more money he had had to take risks and only recently had he begun to perceive how extremely risky these risks were for the first time in its history the firm of bannister was making firsthand acquaintance with frenzied finance  it is perhaps a little unfair to lay the blame for this entirely at the door of baileys sybil her extravagance was largely responsible but baileys newly found freedom was also a factor in the developments of the firms operations if you keep a dog a dog with a high sense of his abilities and importance tied up and muzzled for a length of time and then abruptly set it free the chances are that it will celebrate its freedom this had happened in the case of bailey  just as her fathers money had caused ruth to plunge into a whirl of pleasures which she did not really enjoy merely for the novelty of it so the death of john bannister and his own consequent accession to the throne had upset baileys balance and embarked him on an orgy of speculation quite foreign to his true nature all their lives ruth and bailey had been repressed by their father and his removal had unsteadied them  bailey on whom the shadow of the dead man had pressed particularly severely had been quite intoxicated by sudden freedom he had been a cipher in the firm of bannister  son in the firm of bannister  co he was an untrammelled despot he did that which was right in his own eyes and there was no one to say him nay  it was true that veteran members of the firm looking in the glass found white hairs where no white hairs had been and wrinkles on foreheads which under the solid rule of old john bannister had been smooth but it would have taken more than these straws to convince bailey that the wind which was blowing was an illwind he had developed in a day the sublime selfconfidence of a young napoleon he was all dash and enterprisethe hurricane fighter of wall street  with these private interests to occupy him it is surprising that he should have found time to take the affairs of ruth and kirk in hand but he did  for some time he had watched the widening gulf between them with pained solicitude he disliked kirk personally but that did not influence him he conceived it to be his duty to suppress private prejudices duty seemed to call him to go to kirks aid and smooth out his domestic difficulties  what urged him to this course more than anything else was ruths growing intimacy with basil milbank for in the period which had elapsed since the conversation recorded earlier in the story when kirk had first made the others acquaintance the gifted basil had become a very important and menacing figure in ruths life  to ruth as to most women his gifts were his attraction he danced well he talked well he did everything well he appealed to a side of ruths nature which kirk scarcely toucheda side which had only come into prominence in the last year  his manner was admirable he suggested sympathy without expressing it he could convey to ruth that he thought her a misunderstood and neglected wife while talking to her about the weather he could make his own knighterrant attitude toward her perfectly plain without saying a word merely by playing soft music to her on the piano for he had the gift of saying more with his fingertips than most men could have said in a long speech carefully rehearsed  kirks inability to accompany ruth into her present life had given basil his chance into the gap which now lay between them he had slipped with a smooth neatness born of experience  bailey hated basil men as a rule did without knowing why basils reputation was shady without being actually bad he was a suspect who had never been convicted new york contained several husbands who eyed him askance but could not verify their suspicions and the apparent hopelessness of ever doing so made them look on basil as a man who had carried smoothness into the realms of fine art he was considered too gifted to be wholesome the men of his set being for the most part amiably stupid resented his cleverness  bailey just at present was feeling strongly on the subject of basil he was at that stage of his married life when he would have preferred his sybil to speak civilly to no other man than himself and only yesterday sybil had come to him to inform him with obvious delight that basil milbank had invited her to join his yacht party for a lengthy voyage  this had stung bailey he was not included in the invitation the whole affair struck him as sinister it was true that sybil had never shown any sign of being fascinated by basil but he told himself there was no knowing he forbade sybil to accept the invitation to soothe her disappointment he sent her off then and there to tiffanys with a roving commission to get what she liked for bailey the stern strong man the man who knew when to put his foot down was no tyrant but he would have been indignant at the suggestion that he had bribed sybil to refuse basils invitation  one of the arguments which sybil had advanced in the brief discussion which had followed the putting down of baileys foot had been that ruth had been invited and accepted so why should not she bailey had not replied to thisit was at this point of the proceedings that the tiffany motive had been introduced but he had not forgotten it he thought it over and decided to call upon ruth he did so  it was unfortunate that the nervous strain of being the napoleon of wall street had had the effect of increasing to a marked extent the portentousness of baileys always portentous manner ruth rebelled against it there was an insufferable suggestion of ripe old age and fatherliness in his attitude which she found irritating in the extreme all her life she had chafed at authority and now when bailey set himself up as one possessing it she showed the worst side of herself to him  he struck this unfortunate note from the very beginning  ruth he said i wish to speak seriously to you  ruth looked at him with hostile eyes but did not speak he did not know it poor man but he had selected an exceedingly bad moment for his lecture it so happened that only half an hour before she and kirk had come nearer to open warfare than they had ever come  it had come about in this way kirk had slept badly the night before and as he lay awake in the small hours his conscience had troubled him  had he done all that it was in him to do to bridge the gap between ruth and himself that was what his conscience had wanted to know the answer was in the negative on the following day just before baileys call he accordingly sought ruth out andrather nervously for ruth made him feel nervous nowadayssuggested that he and she and william bannister should take the air in each others company and go and feed the squirrels in the park  ruth declined it is possible that she declined somewhat curtly the day was close and oppressive and she had a headache and a general feeling of illwill toward her species also in her heart she considered that the scheme proposed smacked too much of sunday afternoon domesticity in brooklyn the idea of papa mamma and baby sporting together in a public park offended her sense of the social proprieties  she did not reveal these thoughts to kirk because she was more than a little ashamed of them a year ago she knew she would not have objected to the idea a year ago such an expedition would have been a daily occurrence with her now she felt if william bannister wished to feed squirrels mamie was his proper companion  she could not put all this baldly to kirk so she placed the burden of her refusal on the adequate shoulders of lora delane porter aunt lora she said would never hear of william bannister wandering at large in such an unhygienic fashion upon which kirk whose patience was not so robust as it had been and who like ruth found the day oppressive and making for irritability had cursed aunt lora heartily given it as his opinion that between them she and ruth were turning the child from a human being into a sort of spineless effeminate exhibit in a museum and had taken himself off to the studio muttering disjointed things  ruth was still quivering with the indignation of a woman who has been cheated of the last word when bailey appeared and announced that he wished to speak seriously to her  bailey saw the hostility in her eyes and winced a little before it he was not feeling altogether at his ease he had had experience of ruth in this mood and she had taught him to respect it  but he was not going to shirk his duty he resumed  i am only speaking for your own good he said i know that it is nothing but thoughtlessness on your part but i am naturally anxious  bailey interrupted ruth get to the point  bailey drew a long breath  well then he said baulked of his preamble and rushing on his fate i think you see too much of basil milbank  ruth raised her eyebrows  oh  the mildness of her tone deceived bailey  i do not like to speak of these things he went on more happily but i feel that i must it is my duty basil milbank has not a good reputation he is not the sort of man whoahwhoin fact he has not a good reputation  oh  i understand that he has invited you to form one of his yacht party  how did you know  sybil told me he invited her i refused to allow her to accept the invitation  and what did sybil say  she was naturally a little disappointed of course but she did as i requested  i wonder she didnt pack her things and go straight off  my dear ruth  that is what i should have done  you dont know what you are saying  oh do you think i should let kirk dictate to me like that  he is certain to disapprove of your going when he hears of the invitation what will you do  ruths eyes opened for a moment she looked almost ugly  what shall i do why go of course  she clenched her teeth a womans mind can work curiously and she was associating kirk with bailey in what she considered an unwarrantable intrusion into her private affairs it was as if kirk and not bailey were standing there demanding that she should not associate with basil milbank  i shall make it my business said bailey to warn kirk that this man is not a desirable companion for you  the discussion of this miserable yacht affair had brought back to bailey all the jealousy which he had felt when sybil had first told him of it all the vague stories he had ever heard about basil were surging in his mind like waves of some corrosive acid he had become a leading member of the extreme wing of the antimilbank party he regarded basil with the aversion which a dignified pigeon might feel for a circling hawk and he was now looking on this yacht party as a deadly peril from which ruth must be saved at any cost  i shall speak to him very strongly he added  ruths suppressed anger blazed up in the sudden way which before now had disconcerted her brother  bailey what do you mean by coming here and saying this sort of thing youre becoming a perfect old woman you spend your whole time prying into other peoples affairs im sorry for sybil  bailey cast one reproachable look at her and left the room with pained dignity something seemed to tell him that no good could come to him from a prolongation of the interview ruth in this mood always had been too much for him and always would be well he had done his duty as far as he was concerned it now remained to do the same by kirk  he hailed a taxi and drove to the studio  kirk was busy and not anxious for conversation least of all with bailey he had not forgotten their last teteatete  bailey however was regarding him with a feeling almost of friendliness they were bound together by a common grievance against basil milbank  i came here winfield he said after a few moments of awkward conversation on neutral topics because i understand that this man milbank has invited ruth to join his yacht party  what yacht party  this man milbank is taking a party for a cruise shortly in his yacht  who is milbank  surely you have met him yes he was at my house one night when you and ruth dined there shortly after your return  i dont remember him however it doesnt matter but why does the fact that he has asked ruth on his yacht excite you are you nervous about the sea  i dislike this man milbank very much winfield i think ruth sees too much of him  kirk stiffened his eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch  oh he said  it seemed to bailey for an instant that he had been talking all his life to people who raised their eyebrows and said oh but he continued manfully  i do not think that ruth should know him winfield  wouldnt ruth be rather a good judge of that  his tone nettled bailey but the man conscious of doing his duty acquires an artificial thickness of skin and he controlled himself but he had lost that feeling of friendliness of sympathy with a brother in misfortune which he had brought in with him  i disagree with you entirely he said  another thing went on kirk if this man milbanki still cant place himis such a thug or whatever it is that he happens to be how did he come to be at your house the night you say i met him  bailey winced he wished the world was not perpetually reminding him that basil and sybil were on speaking terms  sybil invited him i may say he has asked sybil to make one of the yacht party i absolutely forbade it  but heavens whats wrong with the man  he has a bad reputation  has he indeed  and i wish my wife to associate with him as little as possible and i should advise you to forbid ruth to see more of him than she can help  kirk laughed the idea struck him as comic  my good man i dont forbid ruth to do things  bailey objecting to being called any ones good man especially kirks permitted his temper to get the better of him  then you should he snapped i have no wish to quarrel with you i came in here in a friendly spirit to warn you but i must say that for a man who married a girl as you married ruth in direct opposition to the wishes of her family you take a curious view of your obligations ruth has always been a headstrong impulsive girl and it is for you to see that she is protected from herself if you are indifferent to her welfare then all i can say is that you should not have married her you appear to think otherwise good afternoon  he stalked out of the studio leaving kirk uncomfortably conscious that he had had the worst of the argument bailey had been officious no doubt and his pompous mode of expression was not soothing but there was no doubt that he had had right on his side  marrying ruth did not involve obligations he had never considered her in that light but perhaps she was a girl who had to be protected from herself she was certainly impulsive bailey had been right there if nowhere else  who was this fellow milbank who had sprung suddenly from nowhere into the position of a menace what were ruths feelings toward him kirk threw his mind back to the dinnerparty at baileys and tried to place him  was it the manyes he had it now it was the man with the wave of hair over his forehead the fellow who looked like a poet memory came to him with a rush he recalled his instinctive dislike for the fellow  so that was milbank was it he got up and put away his brushes there would be no more work for him that afternoon  he walked slowly home the heat of the day had grown steadily more oppressive it was one of those airless stifling afternoons which afflict new york in the summer he remembered seeing something about a record in the evening paper which he had bought on his way to the studio a whole column about heat and humidity it certainly felt unusually warm even for new york  it was one of those days when nerves are strained when molehills become mountains and mountains are all everests he had felt it when he talked with ruth about bill and the squirrels and he felt it now he was conscious of being extraordinarily irritated not so much with any particular person as with the world in general the very vagueness of baileys insinuations against basil milbank increased his resentment  what a pompous ass bailey was what a fool he had been to give bailey such a chance of snubbing him what an extraordinarily futile and unpleasant world it was altogether  he braced himself with an effort it was this heat which was making him magnify trifles bailey was a fool probably there was nothing whatever wrong with this fellow milbank probably he had some personal objection to the man and that was all  and yet the image of basil which had come back to his mind was not reassuring he had mistrusted him that night and he mistrusted him now  what should he do ruth was not sybil she was not the sort of woman a man could forbid to do things it would require tact to induce her to refuse basils invitation  as he reached the door an idea came to him so simple that he wondered that it had not occurred to him before it was perhaps an echo of his conversation with steve  he would get ruth to come away with him to the shack in the connecticut woods as he dwelt on the idea the heat of the day seemed to become less oppressive and his heart leaped how cool and pleasant it would be out there they would take bill with them and live the simple life again in the country this time instead of in town perhaps out there far away from the overcrowded city he and ruth would be able to come to an understanding and bridge over that ghastly gulf  as for his work he could do that as well in the woods as in new york and anyhow he had earned a vacation for days mr penway had been hinting that the time had arrived for a folding of the hands  mr penways views on new york and its record humidity were strong and crisply expressed his idea he told kirk was that some sport with a heart should loan him a couple of hundred bucks and let him beat it to the seashore before he melted  in the drawingroom ruth was playing the piano softly as she had done so often at the studio kirk went to her and kissed her a marked coolness in her reception of the kiss increased the feeling of nervousness which he had felt at the sight of her it came back to him that they had parted that afternoon for the first time on definitely hostile terms  he decided to ignore the fact something told him that ruth had not forgotten but it might be that cheerfulness now would blot out the resentment of past irritability  but in his embarrassment he was more than cheerful as steve had been on the occasion of his visit to old john bannister he was breezy breezy with an effort that was as painful to ruth as it was to himself breezy with a horrible musical comedy breeziness  he could have adopted no more fatal tone with ruth at that moment all the afternoon she had been a complicated tangle of fretted nerves her quarrel with kirk baileys visit a conscience that would not lie down and go to sleep at her orders but insisted on running riotall these things had unfitted her to bear up amiably under sudden selfconscious breeziness  and the heat of the day charged now with the oppressiveness of longoverdue thunder completed her mood when kirk came in and began to speak the softest notes of the human voice would have jarred upon her and kirk in his nervousness was almost shouting  his voice rang through the room and ruth winced away from it like a stricken thing from out of the hell of nerves and heat and interfering brothers there materialized itself as she sat there a very vivid hatred of kirk  kirk meanwhile uneasy but a little guessing at the fury behind ruths calm face was expounding his great scheme his panacea for all the ills of domestic misunderstandings and parted lives  ruth old girl  ruth shuddered  ruth old girl ive had a bully good idea its getting too warm for anything in new york did you ever feel anything like it is today why shouldnt you and i pop down to the shack and camp out there for a week or so and we would take bill with us just we three with somebody to do the cooking it would be great what do you say  what ruth said languidly was its quite impossible  it was damping but kirk felt that at all costs he must refuse to be damped he clutched at his cheerfulness and held it  nonsense he retorted why is it impossible its a great idea  ruth half hid a yawn she knew she was behaving abominably and she was glad of it  its impossible as far as im concerned i have a hundred things to do before i can leave new york  well i could do with a day or two to clear up a few bits of work i have on hand why couldnt we start this day week  it is out of the question for me about then i shall be on mr milbanks yacht he has invited me to join his party the actual day is not settled but it will be in about a weeks time  oh said kirk  ruth said nothing  have you accepted the invitation  i have not actually answered his letter i was just going to when you came in  but you mean to accept it  certainly several of my friends will be there sybil for one  not sybil  oh i know bailey has made some ridiculous objection to her going but i mean to persuade her  kirk did not answer she looked at him steadily  so bailey did call on you this afternoon he told me he was going to but i hoped he would think better of it but apparently there are no limits to baileys stupidity  yes bailey came to the studio he seemed troubled about this yacht party  did he advise you to forbid me to go  well yes he did  and now you have come to do it  not at all i told bailey that you were not the sort of woman one forbade to do things  im not  there was a pause  all the same i wish you wouldnt go  ruth did not answer  it would be very jolly out at the shack  ruth shuddered elaborately and gave a little laugh  would it its rather a question of taste personally i cant imagine anything more depressing and uncomfortable than being cooped up in a draughty frame house miles away from anywhere theres no reason why you should not go though if you like that sort of thing of course you must not take bill  why not  kirk spoke calmly enough but he was very near the breaking point all his good resolutions had vanished under the acid of ruths manner  i couldnt let him rough it like that aunt lora would have a fit  conditions being favourable it only needs a spark to explode a powder magazine and there are moments when a word can turn an outwardly calm and patient man into a raging maniac this introduction of mrs porters name into the discussion at this particular point broke down the last remnants of kirks selfcontrol  for a few seconds his fury so mastered him that he could not speak then suddenly the storm passed and he found himself cool and venomous he looked at ruth curiously it seemed incredible to him that he had ever loved her  we had better get this settled he said in a hard quiet voice  ruth started she had never heard him speak like this before she had not imagined him capable of speaking in that way even in the days when she had loved him most she had never looked up to him she had considered his nature weak and she had loved his weakness except in the case of her father she had always dominated the persons with whom she mixed and she had taken it for granted that her will was stronger than kirks something in his voice now told her that she had underestimated him  get what settled she asked and was furious with herself because her voice shook  is mrs porter the mother of the child or are you what has mrs porter to do with it why should i ask her permission how does it happen to be any business of mrs porters at all  ruth felt baffled he was giving her no chance to take the offensive there was nothing in his tone which she could openly resent he was not shouting at her he was speaking quietly there was nothing for her to do but answer the question and she knew that her answer would give him another point in the contest even as she spoke she knew that her words were ridiculous  aunt lora has been wonderful with him no child could have been better looked after  i know she has used him as a vehicle for her particular form of insanity but thats not the point what i am asking is why she was introduced at all  i told you when you were away bill nearly  died i know im not forgetting that and naturally for a time you were frightened it is just possible that for the moment you lost your head and honestly thought that mrs porters methods were the only chance for him but that state of mind could not last all the time with you you are not a crank like your aunt you are a perfectly sensible levelheaded woman and you must have seen the idiocy of it all long before i came back why did you let it go on  ruth did not answer  i will tell you why because it saved you trouble because it gave you more leisure for the sort of futile waste of time which seems to be the only thing you care for nowadays dont trouble to deny it do you think i havent seen in these last few months that bill bores you to death oh i know you always have some perfect excuse for keeping away from him its too much trouble for you to be a mother to him so you hedge with your conscience by letting mrs porter pamper him and sterilize his toys and all the rest of it and try to make yourself think that you have done your duty to him you know that as far as everything goes that matters any tenement child is better off than bill  i  you had better let me finish what i have got to say i will be as brief as i can that is my case as regards bill now about myself what do you think i am made of ive stood it just as long as i could you have tried me too hard im through heaven knows why it should have come to this it is not so very long ago that bill was half the world to you and i was the other half now apparently there is not room in your world for either of us  ruth had risen she was trembling  i think we had better end this  he broke in on her words  end it yes youre right one way or the other either go back to the old life or start a new one what we are living now is a horrible burlesque  what do you mean how start a new life  i mean exactly what i say in the life you are living now i am an anachronism im a survival im out of date and in the way you would be freer without me  thats absurd  is the idea so novel is our marriage the only failure in new york  do you mean that we ought to separate  only a little more a very little more than we are separated now never see each other again instead of seeing each other for a few minutes every day its not a very big step to take  ruth sat down and rested her chin on her hand staring at nothing kirk went to the window and looked out  over the park the sky was black in the room behind him the light had faded till it seemed as if night were come the air was heavy and stifling a flicker of lightning came and went in the darkness over the trees  he turned abruptly  it is the only reasonable thing to do our present mode of life is a farce we are drifting farther apart every day perhaps i have changed i know you have we are two strangers chained together we have made a muddle of it and the best thing we can do is to admit it  i am no good to you i have no part in your present life youre the queen and im just the prince consort the fellow who happens to be mrs winfields husband its not a pleasant part to have to play and i have had enough of it we had better separate before we hate each other you have your amusements i have my work we can continue them apart we shall both be better off  he stopped ruth did not speak she was still sitting in the same attitude it was too dark to see her face it formed a little splash of white in the dusk she did not move  kirk went to the door  im going up to say goodbye to bill have you anything to say against that and i shall say goodbye to him in my own way  she made no sign that she had heard him  goodbye he said again  the door closed  up in the nursery bill crooned to himself as he played on the floor mamie sat in a chair sewing the opening of the door caused them to look up simultaneously  hello said bill  his voice was cordial without being enthusiastic he was glad to see kirk but tin soldiers were tin soldiers and demanded concentrated attention when you are in the middle of intricate manoeuvres you cannot allow yourself to be more than momentarily distracted by anything  mamie said kirk hoarsely go out for a minute will you i shant be long  mamie obediently departed later when keggs was spreading the news of kirks departure in the servants hall she remembered that his manner had struck her as strange  kirk sat down in the chair she had left and looked at bill he felt choked there was a mist before his eyes  bill  the child absorbed in his game did not look up  bill old man come here a minute ive something to say  bill looked up nodded moved a couple of soldiers and got up he came to kirks side his chosen mode of progression at this time was a kind of lurch he was accustomed to breathe heavily during the journey and on arrival at the terminus usually shouted triumphantly  kirk put an arm round him bill stared gravely up into his face there was a silence from outside came a sudden rumbling crash bill jumped  funder he said in a voice that shook a little  not afraid of thunder are you said kirk  bill shook his head stoutly  bill  yes daddy  kirk fought to keep his voice steady  bill old man im afraid you wont see me again for some time im going away  in a ship  no not in a ship  in a train  perhaps  take me with you daddy  im afraid i cant bill  shant i ever see you again  kirk winced how direct children are what was it they called it in the papers the custody of the child how little it said and how much it meant  the sight of bills wide eyes and quivering mouth reminded him that he was not the only person involved in the tragedy of those five words he pulled himself together bill was waiting anxiously for an answer to his question there was no need to make bill unhappy before his time  of course you will he said trying to make his voice cheerful  of course i will echoed bill dutifully  kirk could not trust himself to speak again the old sensation of choking had come back to him the room was a blur  he caught bill to him in a grip that made the child cry out held him for a long minute then put him gently down and made blindly for the door  the storm had burst by the time kirk found himself in the street the thunder crashed and great spears of lightning flashed across the sky a few heavy drops heralded the approach of the rain and before he had reached the corner it was beating down in torrents  he walked on raising his face to the storm finding in it a curious relief a magical coolness had crept into the air and with it a strange calm into his troubled mind he looked back at the scene through which he had passed as at something infinitely remote he could not realize distinctly what had happened he was only aware that everything was over that with a few words he had broken his life into small pieces too impatient to unravel the tangled knot he had cut it and nothing could mend it now  why  the rain had ceased as suddenly as it had begun the sun was struggling through a mass of thin cloud over the park the world was full of the drip and rush of water all that had made the day oppressive and strained nerves to breaking point had gone leaving peace behind kirk felt like one waking from an evil dream  why did it happen he asked himself what made me do it  a distant rumble of thunder answered the question     chapter viii  steve to the rescue   it is an unfortunate fact that when a powdermagazine explodes the damage is not confined to the person who struck the match but extends to the innocent bystanders in the present case it was steve dingle who sustained the worst injuries  of the others who might have been affected mrs lora delane porter was bombproof no explosion in her neighbourhood could shake her she received the news of kirks outbreak with composure privately in her eugenic heart she considered his presence superfluous now that william bannister was safely launched upon his career  in the drama of which she was the selfappointed stagedirector kirk was a mere super supporting the infant star her great mind occupied almost entirely by the past and the future took little account of the present so long as kirk did not interfere with her management of bill he was at liberty so far as she was concerned to come or go as he pleased  steve could not imitate her admirable detachment he was a poor philosopher and all that his mind could grasp was that kirk was in trouble and that ruth had apparently gone mad  the affair did not come to his ears immediately he visited the studio at frequent intervals and found kirk there working hard and showing no signs of having passed through a crisis which had wrecked his life he was quiet it is true but then he was apt to be quiet nowadays  probably if it had not been for keggs he would have been kept in ignorance of what had happened for a time  walking one evening up broadway he met keggs taking the air and observing the nightlife of new york like himself  keggs greeted steve with enthusiasm he liked steve and it was just possible that steve might not have heard about the great upheaval he suggested a drink at a neighbouring saloon  we have not seen you at our house lately mr dingle he remarked having pecked at his glass of beer like an old wise bird  he looked at steve with a bright eye somewhat puffy at the lids but full of life  no said steve thats right guess i must have been busy  keggs uttered a senile chuckle and drank more beer  theyre rum uns he went on ive been in some queer places but this beats em all  what do you mean inquired steve as a second chuckle escaped his companion  why its come to an ead things has mr dingle thats what i mean you wont have forgotten all about the pampering of that child what i told you of quite recent well its been and come to an ead  yes continue colonel this listens good  you aint eard  not a word  keggs smiled a happy smile and sipped his beer it did the old man good finding an entirely new audience like this  why mr winfield as packed up and left  steve gasped  left he cried not quit not gone for good  for his own good i should say finds himself better off away from it all if you ask me but adnt you reelly heard mr dingle god bless my soul i thought it was public property by now that little bit of noos why mr winfield asnt been living with us for the matter of a week or more  for the love of mike  im telling you the honest truth mr dingle two weeks ago come next saturday mr winfield meets me in the all looking wild and arassedit was the same day there was that big thunderstormand he looks at me glassy like and says to me keggs ave my bag packed and my boxes too im going away for a time ill send a messenger for em and out he goes into the rain which begins to come down cats and dogs the moment he was in the street  i start to go out after him with his raincoat thinking hed get wet before he could find a cab they being so scarce in this city not like london where you simply ave to raise your and to ave a dozen flocking round you but he dont stop he just goes walking off through the rain and all and i gets back into the house not wishing to be wetted myself on account of my rheumatism which is always troublesome in the damp weather and i says to myself ullo ullo ullo whats all this  see what i mean i could tell as plain as if id been in the room with them that they had been having words and since that day e aint been near the ouse and where he is now is more than i can tell you mr dingle  why hes at the studio  at the studio is he well i shouldnt wonder if he wasnt better off e didnt strike me as a man what was used to the ways of society hes happier where he is i expect  and having summed matters up in this philosophical manner keggs drained his glass and cocked an expectant eye at steve  steve obeyed the signal and ordered a further supply of the beer for which mr keggs had a plebian and unbutlerlike fondness his companion turned the conversation to the prospects of one of that group of inefficient middleweights whom steve so heartily despised between whom and another of the same degraded band a tenround contest had been arranged and would shortly take place  ordinarily this would have been a subject on which steve would have found plenty to say but his mind was occupied with what he had just heard and he sat silent while the silverhaired patron of sport opposite prattled on respecting current form  steve felt stunned it was unthinkable that this thing had really occurred  mr keggs sipping beer discussed the coming fight he weighed the alleged left hook of one principal against the muchadvertised right swing of the other he spoke with apprehension of a yellow streak which certain purists claimed to have discovered in the gladiator on whose chances he proposed to invest his cash  steve was not listening to him a sudden thought had come to him filling his mind to the exclusion of all else  the recollection of his talk with kirk at the studio had come back to him he had advised kirk as a solution of his difficulties to kidnap the child and take him to connecticut well kirk was out of the running now but he steve was still in it  he would do it himself  the idea thrilled him it was so in keeping with his theory of the virtue of the swift and immediate punch administered with the minimum of preliminary sparring there was a risk attached to the scheme which appealed to him above all he honestly believed that it would achieve its object the straightening out of the tangle which ruth and kirk had made of their lives  when once an idea had entered steves head he was tenacious of it he had come to the decision that ruth needed what he called a jolt to bring her to herself much as a sleepwalker is aroused by the touch of a hand and he clung to it  he interrupted mr keggs in the middle of a speech touching on his mans alleged yellow streak  will you be at home tonight colonel he asked  i certainly will mr dingle  mind if i look in  i shall be delighted i can offer you a cigar that i think youll appreciate and we can continue this little chat at our leisure mrs winfields dining out and that there porter thank gawd as gone to boston     chapter ix  at one in the morning   william bannister winfield slept the peaceful sleep of childhood in his sterilized cot the light gleamed faintly on the white tiles it lit up the brass knobs on the walls the spotless curtains the large thermometer  an intruder interested in these things would have seen by a glance at this last that the temperature of the room was exactly that recommended by doctors as the correct temperature for the nursery of a sleeping child no higher no lower the transom over the door was closed but the window was open at the top to precisely the extent advocated by the authorities due consideration having been taken for the time of year and the condition of the outer atmosphere  the hour was one in the morning  childhood is a readily adaptable time of life and william bannister after a few days of blank astonishment varied by open mutiny had accepted the change in his surroundings and daily existence with admirable philosophy his memory was not farreaching and as time went on and he began to accommodate himself to the new situation he had gradually forgotten the days at the studio as it is to be supposed he had forgotten the clouds of glory which he had trailed on his entry into this world if memories of past bearhunts among the canvases on the dusty floor ever came to him now he never mentioned it  a child can weave romance into any condition of life in which fate places him and william bannister had managed to interest himself in his present existence with a considerable gusto scraps of conversation between mrs porter and mamie overheard and digested had given him a good working knowledge of the system of hygiene of which he was the centre he was vague as to details but not vaguer than most people  he knew that something called sterilizing was the beginning and end of life and that things known as germs were the great peril he had expended much thought on the subject of germs mamie questioned could give him no more definite information than that they were things which got at you and hurt you and his awe of mrs porter had kept him from going to the fountainhead of knowledge for further data  building on the information to hand he had formed in his mind an odd kind of anthropomorphic image of the germ he pictured it as a squat thickset man of repellent aspect and stealthy movements who sneaked up on you when you were not looking and did unpleasant things to you selecting as the time for his attacks those nights when you had allowed your attention to wander while saying your prayers  on such occasions it was bills practice to fool him by repeating his prayers to himself in bed after the official ceremony some times to make certain he would do this so often that he fell asleep in midprayer  he was always glad of the nightlight a germ hates light preferring to do his scoundrelly work when it is so black that you cant see your hand in front of your face and the darkness presses down on you like a blanket occasionally a fear would cross his mind that the nightlight might go out but it never did being one of mr edisons best electric efforts neatly draped with black veiling  apart from this he had few worries certainly none serious enough to keep him awake  he was sleeping now his head on his right arm a sterilized teddybear clutched firmly in his other hand with the concentration of one engaged upon a feat at which he is an expert                                       the door opened slowly a head insinuated itself into the room furtively as if uncertain of its welcome the door continued to open and steve slipped in  he closed the door as gently as he had opened it and stood there glancing about him a slow grin appeared upon his face to be succeeded by an expression of serious resolve for steve was anxious  it was still steves intention to remove steal purloin and kidnap william bannister that night but now that the moment had come for doing it he was nervous  he was not used to this sort of thing he was an honest exmiddleweight not a burglar and just now he felt particularly burglarious the stillness of the house oppressed him he had not relished the long wait between the moment of his apparent departure and that of his entry into the nursery  he had acted with simple cunning he had remained talking pugilism with keggs in the pantry till a prodigious yawn from his host had told him that the time was come for the breaking up of the party then begging keggs not to move as he could find his way out he had hurried to the back door opened and shut it and darted into hiding presently keggs yawning loudly had toddled along the passage bolted the door and made his way upstairs to bed leaving steve to his vigil  steves reflections during this period had not been of the pleasantest exactly what his explanation was to be if by any mischance he should make a noise and be detected he had been unable to decide finally he had dismissed the problem as insoluble and had concentrated his mind on taking precautions to omit any such noise  so far he had succeeded he had found his way to the nursery easily enough having marked the location earnestly on his previous visits during the whole of his conversation with keggs in the pantry he had been repeating to himself the magic formula which began first staircase to the leftturn to the right and here he was now at his goal and ready to begin  but it was just this question of beginning which exercised him so grievously how was he to begin should he go straight to the cot and wake the kid suppose the kid was scared and let out a howl  a warm prickly sensation about the forehead was steves silent comment on this reflection he took a step forward and stopped again he was conscious of tremors about the region of the spine the thought crossed his mind at that moment that burglars earned their money  as he stood hesitating his problem was solved for him there came a heavy sigh from the direction of the cot which made him start as if a pistol had exploded in his ear and then he was aware of two large eyes staring at him  there was a tense pause a drop of perspiration rolled down his cheekbone and anchored itself stickily on the angle of his jaw it tickled abominably but he did not dare to move for fear of unleashing the scream which brooded over the situation like a cloud  at any moment now a howl of terror might rip the silence and bring the household on the run and thenthe explanations a second drop of perspiration started out in the wake of the first  the large eyes continued to inspect him they were clouded with sleep suddenly a frightened look came into them and as he saw it steve braced his muscles for the shock  here it comes he said miserably to himself oh lord were off  he searched in his brain for speech desperately as the best man at a wedding searches for that ring while the universe stands still waiting expectantly  he found no speech  the childs mouth opened steve eyed him fascinated no bird encountering a snake was ever so incapable of movement as he  are you a germ inquired william bannister  steve tottered to the cot and sat down on it the relief was too much for him  gee kid he said you had my goat then ive got to hand it to you  his sudden approach had confirmed william bannisters worst suspicions this was precisely how he had expected the germ to behave he shrank back on the pillow gulping  why for the love of mike said steve dont you know me kid im not a porchclimber dont you remember steve who used to raise hades with you at the studio darn it im your godfather im steve  william bannister sat up partially reassured  whats steve he inquired  im steve  why  how do you meanwhy  the large eyes inspected him gravely  i remember he said finally  well dont go forgetting kid i couldnt stand a second session like that i got a weak heart  youre steve  thats right stick to that and well get along fine  i thought you were a germ  a what  they get at you and hurt you  who said so  mamie  are you scared of germs  the white hope nodded gravely  i have to be sterilized because of them are you sterilized  nobody ever told me so but say kid you dont want to be frightened of germs or microbes or bacilli or any of the rest of the circus you dont want to be frightened of nothing youre the white hope the bearcat that aint scared of anything on earth whats this germ thing like anyway  its aive never seen one but mamie says they get at you and hurt you i think its a kind of big sort of ugly man that creeps in when youre asleep  so thats why you thought i was one  the white hope nodded  forget it said steve mamie is a queen all right believe me but shes got the wrong dope on this microbe proposition you dont need to be scared of them any more why some of me best pals are germs  whats pals  why friends you and me are pals me and your pop are pals  wheres pop  hes gone away  i remember  he thought he needed a change of air dont you ever need a change of air  i dont know  well you do take it from me this is about the punkest joint i ever was in you dont want to stay in a dairykitchen like this  whats dairykitchen  this is all these white tiles and fixings it makes me feel like a pint of milk to look at em  its because of the germs  aint i telling you the germs dont want to hurt you  aunt lora told mamie they do  say cull you tell your aunt lora to make a noise like an icecream in the sun and melt away shes a prune and what she says dont go do you want to know what a germ or a microbeits the same thingreally is its a fellow that has the best time you can think of theyve been fooling you kid they saw you were easy so they handed it to you on a plate im the guy that can put you wise about microbes  tell me  sure well a microbe is a kid that just runs wild out in the country he dont have to hang around in a whitetiled nursery and eat sterilized junk and go to bed when they tell him to he has a swell time out in the woods fishing and playing around in the dirt and going after birds eggs and picking berries andoh shucks anything else you can think of wouldnt you like to do that  william bannister nodded  well say as it happens theres a fine chance for you to be a germ right away i know a little place down in the connecticut woods which would just hit you right you could put on overalls  whats overalls  sort of clothes not like the fussedup scenery you have to wear now but the real sort of clothes which you can muss up and nobody cares a darn you can put em on and go out and tear up jack like a regular kid all you want say dont you remember the fool stunts you and me used to pull off in the studio  what studio  gee youre a bit shy on your english aint you it makes it sort of hard for a guy to keep up what you might call a flow of talk still you should worry why dont you remember where you used to live before you came to this joint big dusty sort of place where you and me used to play around on the floor  the white hope nodded  well wouldnt you like to do that again  yes  and be a regular microbe  yes  steve looked at his watch  well thats lucky he said it happens to be exactly the right time for starting out to be one thats curious aint it  yes  ive got a palfriend you know  is he a germ  sure hes waiting for me now in an automobile in the park  why  because i asked him to he owns a garage place where automobiles live you know i asked him to bring out a car and wait around near by because i might be taking a pal of minethats youfor a ride into the country tonight of course you dont have to come if you dont want to only its mighty nice out there you can spend all tomorrow rolling about in the grass and listening to the birds i shouldnt wonder if we couldnt borrow a farmers kid for you to play with theres lots of them around he should show you the best time youve had in months  william bannisters eyes gleamed the finer points of the scheme were beginning to stand out before him with a growing clarity  would i have to take my bib he asked excitedly  steve uttered a scornful laugh  no sir we dont wear bibs out there  as far as william bannister was concerned this appeared to settle it of all the trials of his young life he hated most his bib  lets go  steve breathed a sigh of relief  right squire we will he said but i guess we had best leave a letter for mamie sos she wont be wondering where youve got to  will mamie be cross  not on your life shell be tickled to death  he scribbled a few lines on a piece of paper and left them on the cot from which william bannister had now scrambled  can you dress yourself asked steve  oh yes it was an accomplishment of which the white hope was extremely proud  well go to it then  steve  hello  wont it be a surprise for mamie  you bet it will and she wont be the only one at that  will mother be surprised  she sure will  and pop  you bet  william bannister chuckled delightedly  ready said steve  yes  now listen weve got to get out of this joint as quiet as mice it would spoil the surprise if they was to hear us and come out and ask what we were doing get that  yes  well see how quiet you can make it you dont want even to breathe more than you can help                                       they left the room and crept down the dark stairs in the hall steve lit a match and switched on the electric light he unbolted the door and peered out into the avenue close by under the trees stood an automobile its headlights staring into the night  quick cried steve  he picked up the white hope closed the door and ran     chapter x  accepting the gifts of the gods   it was fortunate considering the magnitude of the shock which she was to receive that circumstances had given steves mamie unusual powers of resistance in the matter of shocks for years before her introduction into the home of the winfield family her life had been one long series of crises she had never known what the morrow might bring forth though experience had convinced her that it was pretty certain to bring forth something agitating which would call for all her wellknown ability to handle disaster  the sole care of three small brothers and a weakminded father gives a girl exceptional opportunities of cultivating poise under difficult conditions it had become second nature with mamie to keep her head though the heavens fell  consequently when she entered the nursery next morning and found it empty she did not go into hysterics she did not even scream she read steves note twice very carefully then sat down to think what was her best plan of action  her ingrained habit of looking on the bright side of things the result of a life which had pessimism been allowed to rule it might have ended prematurely with what the papers are fond of calling a rash act led her to consider first those points in the situation which she labelled in her meditations as bits of luck  it was a bit of luck that mrs porter happened to be away for the moment it gave her time for reflection it was another bit of luck that as she had learned from keggs whom she met on the stairs on her way to the nursery a mysterious telephonecall had caused ruth to rise from her bed some three hours before her usual time and depart hurriedly in a cab this also helped  keggs had no information to give as to ruths destination or the probable hour of her return she had vanished without a word except a request to keggs to tell the driver of her taxi to go to the thirtythird street subway  must a ad bad noos keggs thought because she were lookn white as a sheet  mamie was sorry that ruth had had bad news but her departure certainly helped to relieve the pressure of an appalling situation  with the absence of ruth and mrs porter the bits of luck came to an end try as she would mamie could discover no other silver linings in the cloudbank and even these ameliorations of the disaster were only temporary  ruth would return worse mrs porter would return like two mother hubbards they would go to the cupboard and the cupboard would be bare and to her mamie would fall the task of explanation  the only explanation that occurred to her was that steve had gone suddenly mad he had given no hint of his altruistic motives in the hurried scrawl which she had found on the empty cot he had merely said that he had taken away william bannister but that it was all right  why steve should imagine that it was all right baffled mamie anything less all right she had never come across in a lifetime of disconcerting experiences  she was aware that things were not as they should be between ruth and kirk and the spectacle of the broken home had troubled her gentle heart but she failed to establish a connection between kirks departure and steves midnight raid  after devoting some ten minutes to steady brainwork she permitted herself the indulgence of a few tears she did not often behave in this shockingly weak way her role in life hitherto having been that of the one calm person in a disrupted world when her father had lost his job and the rent was due and brother jim had fallen in the mud to the detriment of his only suit of clothes and brothers terence and mike had developed respectively a sore throat and a funny feeling in the chest she had remained dryeyed and capable her father had cried her brother jim had cried her brother terence had cried and her brother mike had cried in a manner that made the weeping of the rest of the family seem like the uncanny stillness of a summer night but she had not shed a tear  now however she gave way she buried her little face on the pillow which so brief a while before had been pressed by the round head of william bannister and mourned like a modern niobe  at the end of two minutes she rose sniffing but courageous herself again in her misery an idea had come to her it was quite a simple and obvious idea but till now it had eluded her  she would go round to the studio and see kirk after all it was his affair as much as anybody elses and she had a feeling that it would be easier to break the news to him than to ruth and mrs porter  she washed her eyes put on her hat and set out  luck however was not running her way that morning arriving at the studio she rang the bell and rang and rang again without result except a marked increase in her already substantial depression when it became plain to her that the studio was empty she desisted  it is an illustration of her remarkable force of character that at this point refusing to be crushed by the bludgeoning of fate she walked to broadway and went into a movingpicture palace there was nothing to be effected by staying in the house and worrying so she resolutely declined to worry  from this point onward her day divided itself into a series of three movements repeated at regular intervals from the moving pictures she went to the house on fifth avenue finding that neither ruth nor mrs porter had returned she went to the studio ringing the bell there and getting no answer she took in the movies once more  mamie was a philosopher  the atmosphere of the great house was still untroubled on her second visit the care of the white hope had always been left exclusively in the hands of the women and the rest of the household had not yet detected his absence it was not their business to watch his comings in and his goings out besides they had other things to occupy them  the unique occasion of the double absence of ruth and mrs porter was being celebrated by a sort of saturnalia or slaves holiday it was true that either or both might return at any moment but there was a disposition on the part of the domestic staff to take a chance on it  keggs that sinful butler had strolled round to an apparently untenanted house on fortyfirst street where those who knew their new york could by giving the signal obtain admittance and the privilege of losing their money at the pleasing game of roulette with a double zero  george the footman in company with henriette the ladysmaid and rollins the chauffeur who had butted in absolutely uninvited to georges acute disgust were taking the air in the park the rest of the staff with the exception of a housemaid who had been bribed with two dollars and an old dress which had once been ruths and was now the property of henriette to stand by the ship were somewhere on the island amusing themselves in the way that seemed best to them for all practical purposes it was a safe and sane fourth provided out of a blue sky by the god of chance  it was about five oclock when mamie having at a modest estimate seen five hundred persecuted heroes a thousand illused heroines several regiments of cowboys and perhaps two thousand comic men pursued by angry mobs returned from her usual visit to the studio  this time there were signs of hope in the shape of a large automobile opposite the door she rang the bell and there came from within the welcome sound of footsteps an elderly man of a somewhat dissipated countenance opened the door  i want to see mr winfield said mamie  mr penway for it was he gave her the approving glance which your man of taste and discrimination does not fail to bestow upon youth and beauty and bawled over his shoulder  kirk  kirk came down the passage he was looking brown and healthy he was in his shirtsleeves  oh mr winfield im in such trouble  why mamie whats the matter come in  mamie followed him into the studio eluding mr penway whose arm was hovering in the neighbourhood of her waist  sit down said kirk whats the trouble have you been trying to get at me before weve been down to long beach  a delightful spot observed mr penway who had followed sandy but replete with squabs why didnt you come earlier we could have taken you  may i talk privately with you mr winfield  sure  kirk looked at mr penway who nodded agreeably  outside for robert he inquired amiably very well there is no buttinsky blood in the penway family let me just fix myself a highball and borrow one of your cigars and ill go and sit in the car and commune with nature take your time  just a moment mamie said kirk when he had gone he picked up a telegram which lay on the table ill read this and see if its important and then well get right down to business we only got back a moment before you arrived so im a bit behind with my correspondence  as he read the telegram a look of astonishment came into his face he sat down and read the message a second time mamie waited patiently  good lord he muttered  a sudden thought struck mamie  mr winfield is it from steve she said  kirk started and looked at her incredulously  how on earth did you know good heavens are you in this mamie too  mamie handed him her note he read it without a word when he had finished he sat back in his chair thinking  i thought steve might have telegraphed to you said mamie  kirk roused himself from his thoughts  was this what you came to see me about  yes  what does ruthwhat do they think of itup there  they dont know anything about it mrs winfield went away early this morning mr keggs said she had had a telephone call mrs porter is in boston she will be back today some time what are we to do  do kirk jumped up and began to pace the floor ill tell you what im going to do steve has taken the boy up to my shack in connecticut im going there as fast as the auto can take me  steves mad  is he steves the best pal ive got for two years ive been aching to get at this boy and steve has had the sense to show me the way  he went on as if talking to himself  steves a man im just a fool who hangs round without the nerve to act if i had had the pluck of a rabbit id have done this myself six months ago but ive hung round doing nothing while that damned porter woman played the fool with the boy ill be lucky now if he remembers who i am  he turned abruptly to mamie  mamie you can tell them whatever you please when you get home they cant blame you its not your fault tell them that steve was acting for me with my complete approval tell them that the kids going to be brought up right from now on ive got him and im going to keep him  mamie had risen and was facing him a very determined midget pink and resolute  im not going home mr winfield  what  if you are going to bill i am coming with you  nonsense  thats my placewith him  but you cant its impossible  not more impossible than what has happened already  i wont take you  then ill go by train i know where your house is steve told me  its out of the question  mamies irish temper got the better of her professional desire to maintain the discreetly respectful attitude of employee toward employer  is it then well see do you think im going to leave you and steve to look after my bill what do men know about taking care of children you would choke the poor mite or let him kill himself a hundred ways  she glared at him defiantly he glared back at her then his sense of humour came to his rescue she looked so absurdly small standing there with her chin up and her fists clenched he laughed delightedly he went up to her and placed a hand on each of her shoulders looking down at her he felt that he loved her for her championship of bill  youre a brick mamie of course you shall come well call at the house and you can pack your grip but by george if you put that infernal thermometer in ill run the automobile up against a telegraphpole and then bill will lose us both  finished said a voice oh i beg your pardon sorry  mr penway was gazing at them with affectionate interest from the doorway kirk released mamie and stepped back  i only looked in explained mr penway didnt mean to intrude thought you might have finished your chat and it was a trifle lonely communing with nature  bob said kirk youll have to get on without me for a day or two make yourself at home you know where everything is  i can satisfy my simple needs thinking of going away  ive got to go up to connecticut i dont know how long i shall be away  take your time said mr penway affably going in the auto  yes  the weather is very pleasant for automobiling just now remarked mr penway                                       ten minutes later having thrown a few things together into a bag kirk took his place at the wheel mamie sat beside him the bag had the rear seat to itself  there seems to be plenty of room still said mr penway i have half a mind to come with you  he looked at mamie  but on reflection i fancy you can get along without me  he stood at the door gazing after the motor as it moved down the street when it had turned the corner he went back into the studio and mixed himself a highball  kirk does manage to find them he said enviously     chapter xi  mr penway on the grill   fate moves in a mysterious way luck comes hand in hand with misfortune what we lose on the swings we make up on the roundabouts if keggs had not seen twentyfive of his hardearned dollars pass at one swoop into the clutches of the croupier at the apparently untenanted house on fortyfirst street and become disgusted with the pleasing game of roulette he might have delayed his return to the house on fifth avenue till a later hour in which case he would have missed the remarkable and stimulating spectacle of kirk driving to the door in an automobile with mamie at his side of mamie jumping out and entering the house of mamie leaving the house with a suitcase of kirk helping her into the automobile and of the automobile disappearing with its interesting occupants up the avenue at a high rate of speed  having lost his money as stated and having returned home he was enabled to be a witness the only witness of these notable events and his breast was filled with a calm joy in consequence this was something special this was exclusive a scoop he looked forward to the return of mrs porter with an eagerness which earlier in the day he would have considered impossible somehow ruth did not figure in his picture of the delivery of the sensational news that mr winfield had eloped with the young person engaged to look after her son mrs porters was one of those characters which monopolize any stage on which they appear besides keggs disliked mrs porter and the pleasure of the prospect of giving her a shock left no room for other thoughts  it was nearly seven oclock when mrs porter reached the house she was a little tired from the journey but in high good humour she had had a thoroughly satisfactory interview with her publisherssatisfactory that is to say to herself the publishers had other views  is mrs winfield in she asked keggs as he admitted her  ruth was always sympathetic about her guerrilla warfare with the publishers she looked forward to a cosy chat in the course of which she would trace step by step the progress of the late campaign which had begun overnight and had culminated that morning in a sort of gettysburg from which she had emerged with her arms full of captured flags and all the other trophies of conquest  no madam said keggs mrs winfield has not yet returned  keggs was an artist in tragic narration he did not give away his climax he led up to it by degrees as slow as his audience would permit  returned i did not know she intended to go away her yacht party is next week i understand  yes madam  where has she gone  to tuxedo madam  tuxedo  mrs winfield has just rung us up from there upon the telephone to request that necessaries for an indefinite stay be despatched to her she is visiting mrs bailey bannister  if mrs porter had been steve she would probably have said for the love of mike at this point being herself she merely repeated the butlers last words  if i may be allowed to say so madam i think that there must have been trouble at mrs bannisters a telephonecall came from her very early this morning for mrs winfield which caused mrs winfield to rise and leave in a taximetercab in an extreme hurry if i might be allowed to suggest it it is probably a case of serious illness mrs winfield was looking very disturbed  hm said mrs porter the exclamation was one of disappointment rather than of apprehension sudden illnesses at the bailey home did not stir her but she was annoyed that her recital of the squelching of the publishers would have to wait  she went upstairs her intention was to look in at the nursery and satisfy herself that all was well with william bannister she had given mamie specific instructions as to his care on her departure but you never knew perhaps her keen eye might be able to detect some deviation from the rules she had laid down  it detected one at once the nursery was empty according to schedule the child should have been taking his bath  she went downstairs again keggs was waiting in the hall he had foreseen this return he had allowed her to go upstairs with his story but half heard because that appealed to his artistic sense this story to his mind was too good to be bolted at a sitting it was the ideal serial  keggs  madam  where is master william  i fear i do not know madam  when did he go out it is seven oclock he should have been in an hour ago  i have been making inquiries madam and i regret to inform you that nobody appears to have seen master william all day  what  it not being my place to follow his movements i was unaware of this until quite recently but from conversation with the other domestics i find that he seems to have disappeared  disappeared  a glow of enjoyment such as he had sometimes experienced when the ticker at the cadillac hotel informed him that the man he had backed in some san francisco fight had upset his opponent for the count began to permeate keggs  disappeared madam he repeated  perhaps mrs winfield took him with her to tuxedo  no madam mrs winfield was alone i was present when she drove away  send mamie to me at once said mrs porter  keggs could have whooped with delight had not such an action seemed to him likely to prejudice his chances of retaining a good situation he contented himself with wriggling ecstatically the young person is not in the house madam  not in the house what business has she to be out where is she  i could not tell you madam keggs paused reluctant to deal the final blow as a child lingers lovingly over the last lick of icecream in a cone i last saw her at about five oclock driving off with mr winfield in an automobile  what  keggs was content his climax had not missed fire its staggering effect was plain on the face of his hearer for once mrs porters poise had deserted her her one word had been a scream  she did not tell me her destination madam went on keggs making all that could be made of what was left of the situation after its artistic finish she came in and packed a suitcase and went out again and joined mr winfield in the automobile and they drove off together  mrs porter recovered herself this was a matter which called for silent meditation not for chitchat with a garrulous butler  that will do keggs  very good madam  keggs withdrew to his pantry well pleased he considered that he had done himself justice as a raconteur he had not spoiled a good story in the telling  mrs porter went to her room and sat down to think she was a woman of action and she soon reached a decision  the errant pair must be followed and at once her great mind playing over the situation like a searchlight detected a connection between this elopement and the disappearance of william bannister she had long since marked kirk down as a malcontent and she now labelled the absent mamie as a snake in the grass who had feigned submission to her rule while meditating all the time the theft of the child and the elopement with kirk she had placed the same construction on mamies departure with kirk as had mr penway showing that it is not only great minds that think alike  a latent conviction as to the immorality of all artists which had been one of the maxims of her late mother sprang into life she blamed herself for having allowed a nurse of such undeniable physical attractions to become a member of the household mamies very quietness and apparent absence of bad qualities became additional evidence against her now mrs porter arguing that these things indicated deep deceitfulness she told herself what was not the case that she had never trusted that girl  but lora delane porter was not a woman to waste time in retrospection she had not been in her room five minutes before her mind was made up it was improbable that kirk and his guilty accomplice had sought so near and obvious a haven as the studio but it was undoubtedly there that pursuit must begin she knew nothing of his way of living at that retreat but she imagined that he must have appointed some successor to george pennicut as general factotum and it might be that this person would have information to impart  the task of inducing him to impart it did not daunt mrs porter she had a just confidence in her powers of crossexamination  she went to the telephone and called up the garage where ruths automobiles were housed her plan of action was now complete if no information were forthcoming at the studio she would endeavour to find out where kirk had hired the car in which he had taken mamie away he would probably have secured it from some garage near by but this detective work would be a last resource like a good general she did not admit of the possibility of failing in her first attack  and luck being with her it happened that at the moment when she set out mr penway feeling pretty comfortable where he was abandoned his idea of going out for a stroll along broadway and settled himself to pass the next few hours in kirks armchair  mr penways first feeling when the bell rang rousing him from his peaceful musings was one of mild vexation a few minutes later when mrs porter had really got to work upon him he would not have recognized that tepid emotion as vexation at all  mrs porter wasted no time she perforated mr penways spine with her eyes reduced it to the consistency of summer squash and drove him before her into the studio where she took a seat and motioned him to do the same for a moment she sat looking at him by way of completing the work of subjection while mr penway writhed uneasily on his chair and thought of past sins  my name is mrs porter she began abruptly  mines penway said the miserable being before her it struck him as the only thing to say  i have come to inquire about mr winfield  as she paused mr penway felt it incumbent upon him to speak again  dear old kirk he mumbled  nothing of the kind said mrs porter sharply mr winfield is a scoundrel of the worst type and if you are as intimate a friend of his as your words imply it does not argue well for your respectability  mr penway opened his mouth feebly and closed it again having closed it he reopened it and allowed it to remain ajar as it were it was his idea of being conciliatory  tell me mr penway started violently tell me when did you last see mr winfield  we went to long beach together this afternoon  in an automobile  yes  ah were you here when mr winfield left again  for the life of him mr penway had not the courage to say no there was something about this womans stare which acted hypnotically upon his mind never at its best as early in the evening  he nodded  there was a young woman with him pursued mrs porter  at this moment mr penways eyes roving desperately about the room fell upon the bottle of bourbon which kirks kindly hospitality had provided his emotions at the sight of it were those of the shipwrecked mariner who see a sail he sprang at it and poured himself out a stiff dose before mrs porters disgusted gaze he drained the glass and then turned to her a new man  the noble spirit restored his own for the first time since the interview had begun he felt capable of sustaining his end of the conversation with ease and dignity  hows that he said  there was a young woman with him repeated mrs porter  mr penway imagined that he had placed her by this time here he told himself in his own crude language was the squabs mother camping on kirks trail with an axe mr penways moral code was of the easiest description his sympathies were entirely with kirk fortified by the bourbon he set himself resolutely to the task of lying wholeheartedly on behalf of his absent friend  no he said firmly  no exclaimed mrs porter  no repeated mr penway with iron resolution no young woman no young woman whatsoever i noticed it particularly because i thought it strange dont you knowwhat i mean is dont you know strange there shouldnt be  how tragic is a mans fruitless fight on behalf of a friend for one short instant mrs porter allowed mr penway to imagine that the victory was his then she administered the coupdegrace  dont lie you worthless creature she said they stopped at my house on their way while the girl packed a suitcase  mr penway threw up his brief there are moments when the stoutest hearted even under the influence of old bourbon realize that to fight on is merely to fight in vain  he condensed his emotions into four words  of all the chumps he remarked and pouring himself out a further instalment of the raw spirit he sat down a beaten man  mrs porter continued to harry him  exactly she said so you see that there is no need for any more subterfuge and concealment i do not intend to leave this room until you have told me all you have to tell so you had better be quick about it kindly tell me the truth in as few words as possibleif you know what is meant by telling the truth  a belated tenderness for his dignity came to mr penway  you are insulting he remarked you areyou aremost insulting  i meant to be said mrs porter crisply now tell me where has mr winfield gone  mr penway preserved an offended silence mrs porter struck the table a blow with a book which caused him to leap in his seat  where has mr winfield gone  how should i know  how should you know because he told you i should imagine wherehasmrwinfieldgone  cnnecticut said mr penway finally capitulating  what part of connecticut  i dont know  what part of connecticut  i tell you i dont know he said im off to connecticut and left it suddenly struck mr penway that his defeat was not so overwhelming as he had imagined so you havent got much out of me you see after all he added  mrs porter rose  on the contrary she said i have got out of you precisely the information which i required and in considerably less time than i had supposed likely if it interests you i may tell you that mr winfield has gone to a small house which he owns in the connecticut woods  then what demanded mr penway indignantly did you mean by keeping on saying what part of cnnecticut what part of cnnecticut what part  because mr winfields destination has only just occurred to me she looked at him closely you are a curious and not uninteresting object mr penway  mr penway started eh  object lesson i should have said i should like to exhibit you as a warning to the youth of this country  what  from the look of your frame i should imagine that you were once a man of some physique your shoulders are good even now a rigorous course of physical training might save you i have known more helpless cases saved by firm treatment you have allowed yourself to deteriorate much as did a man named pennicut who used to be employed here by mr winfield i saved him i dare say i could make something of you i can see at a glance that you eat drink and smoke too much you could not hold out your hand now at this minute without it trembling  i could said mr penway indignantly  he held it out and it quivered like a tuningfork  there said mrs porter calmly what do you expect you know your own business best i suppose but i should like to tell you that if you do not become a teetotaller instantly and begin taking exercise you will probably die suddenly within a very few years personally i shall bear the calamity with fortitude good evening mr penway  for some moments after she had gone mr penway sat staring before him his eyes wore a glassy look his mouth was still ajar  damn woman he said at length  he turned to his meditations  damn impertinent woman  another interval for reflection and he spoke again  damn impertinent interfering woman that  he reached out for the bottle of bourbon and filled his glass he put it to his lips then slowly withdrew it  damn impertinent interi wonder  there was a small mirror on the opposite wall he walked unsteadily toward it and put out his tongue he continued in this attitude for a time then with increased dejection turned away  he placed a hand over his heart this seemed to depress him still further finally he went to the table took up the glass poured its contents carefully back into the bottle which he corked and replaced on the shelf  on the floor against the wall was a pair of indian clubs he picked these up and examined them owlishly he gave them little tentative jerks finally with the air of a man carrying out a great resolution he began to swing them he swung them in slow irregular sweeps his eyes the while still glassy staring fixedly at the ceiling     chapter xii  dolls with souls   ruth had not seen bailey since the afternoon when he had called to warn her against basil milbank whether it was offended dignity that kept him away or merely pressure of business she did not know  that pressure of business existed she was aware the papers were full and had been full for several days of wars and rumours of wars down in wall street and though she understood nothing of finance she knew that bailey was in the forefront of the battle her knowledge was based partly on occasional references in the papers to the firm of bannister  co and partly on what she heard in society  she did not hear all that was said in society about baileys financial operationswhich as bailey had the control of her money was unfortunate for her the manipulation of money bored her and she had left the investing of her legacy entirely to bailey her father she knew had always had a high opinion of baileys business instincts and that was good enough for her  she could not know how completely revolutionized the latters mind had become since the old mans death and how freedom had turned him from a steady young man of business to a frenzied financier  it was common report now that bailey was taking big chances some went so far as to say that he was asking for it it in his case being presumably the nemesis which waits on those who take big chances in an uncertain market it was in the air that he was going up against the pinkeydowd group and the normangraham combination and everybody knew that the cemeteries of wall street were full of the unhonoured graves of others who in years past had attempted to do the same  pinkey that sinister buccaneer could have eaten a dozen baileys devouring aspiring young men of the bailey type was normans chief diversion  ruth knew nothing of these things she told herself that it was her abruptness that had driven bailey away  weariness and depression had settled on ruth since that afternoon of the storm it was as if the storm had wrought an awakening in her it had marked a definite point of change in her outlook she felt as if she had been roused from a trance by a sharp blow  if steve had but known she had had the jolt by which he set such store she knew now that she had thrown away the substance for the shadow  kirks anger so unlike him so foreign to the weak easygoing person she had always thought him had brought her to herself but it was too late there could be no going back and picking up the threads she had lost him and must bear the consequences  the withdrawal of bailey was a small thing by comparison a submotive in the greater tragedy but she had always been fond of bailey and it hurt her to think that she should have driven him out of her life  it seemed to her that she was very much alone now she was marooned on a desert island of froth and laughter everything that mattered she had lost  even bill had gone from her the bitter justice of kirks words came home to her now in her time of clear thinking it was all true in the first excitement of the new life he had bored her she had looked upon mrs porter as a saviour who brought her freedom together with an easy conscience it had been so simple to deceive herself to cheat herself into the comfortable belief that all that could be done for him was being done when as concerned the essential thing as kirk had said there was no child of the streets who was not better off  she tramped her round of social duties mechanically everything bored her now the joy of life had gone out of her she ate the bread of sorrow in captivity  and then this morning had come a voice from the world she had lostlittle mrs baileys voice small and tearful  could she possibly come out by the next train bailey was very ill bailey was dying bailey had come home last night looking ghastly he had not slept in the early morning he had begun to babblemrs baileys voice had risen and broken on the word and ruth at the other end of the wire had heard her frightened sobs the doctor had come the doctor had looked awfully grave the doctor had telephoned to new york for another doctor they were both upstairs now it was awful and ruth must come at once  this was the bad news which had brought about the pallor which had impressed mr keggs as he helped ruth into her cab  little mrs bailey was waiting for her on the platform when she got out of the train her face was drawn and miserable she looked like a beaten kitten she hugged ruth hysterically  oh my dear im so glad youve come hes better but it has been awful the doctors have had to fight him to keep him in bed he was crazy to get to town he kept saying over and over again that he must be at the office they gave him something and he was asleep when i left the house  she began to cry helplessly the fates had not bestowed upon sybil bannister the same care in the matter of education for times of crisis which they had accorded to steves mamie her life till now had been sheltered and unruffled and disaster swooping upon her had found her an easy victim  she was trying to be brave but her powers of resistance were small like her body she clung to ruth as a child clings to its mother ruth as she tried to comfort her felt curiously old it occurred to her with a suggestion almost of grotesqueness that she and sybil had been debutantes in the same season  they walked up to the house the summer cottage which bailey had taken was not far from the station on the way in the intervals of her sobs sybil told ruth the disjointed story of what had happened  bailey had not been looking well for some days she had thought it must be the heat or business worries or something he had not eaten very much and he had seemed too tired to talk when he got home each evening she had begged him to take a few days rest that had been the only occasion in the whole of the last week when she had heard him laugh and it had been such a horrid ugly sort of laugh that she wished she hadnt  he had said that if he stayed away from the office for some time to come it would mean love in a cottage for them for the rest of their livesand not a summer cottage at tuxedo at that my dear child he had gone on and you know when bailey calls me that said sybil it means that there is something the matter for as a rule he never calls me anything but my name or baby or something like that  which gave ruth a little shock of surprise somehow the idea of the dignified bailey addressing his wife as baby startled her she was certainly learning these days that she did not know people as completely as she had supposed there seemed to be endless sides to peoples characters which had never come under her notice a sudden memory of kirk on that fateful afternoon came to her and made her wince  mrs bailey continued my dear child he went on this week is about the most important week you and i are ever likely to live through its the showdown we either come out on top or we blow up its one thing or the other and if i take a few days holiday just now you had better start looking about for the best place to sell your jewellery  those were his very words she said tearfully i remember them all it was so unlike his usual way of talking  ruth acknowledged that it was more than ever she felt that she did not know the complete bailey  he was probably exaggerating she said for the sake of saying something  sybil was silent for a moment  it isnt that thats worrying me she went on then somehow i dont seem to care at all whether we come out right or not so long as he gets well last night when i thought he was going to die i made up my mind that i couldnt go on living without him i wouldnt have either  this time the shock of surprise which came to ruth was greater by a hundredfold than the first had been she gave a quick glance at sybil her small face was hard and the little white teeth gleamed between her drawn lips it was the face for one brief instant of a fanatic the sight of it affected ruth extraordinarily it was as if she had seen a naked soul where she had never imagined a soul to be  she had weighed sybil in the same calm complacent almost patronizing fashion in which she had weighed bailey kirk everybody she had set her down as a delightful child an undeveloped featherbrained little thing pleasant to spend an afternoon with but not to be taken seriously by any one as magnificent and superior as ruth winfield and what manner of a man must bailey be bailey whom she had always looked on as a dear but as quite a joke something to be chaffed and made to look foolish if he was capable of inspiring love like this  a wave of humility swept over her the pygmies of her world were springing up as giants dwarfing her the pinnacle of superiority on which she had stood so long was crumbling into dust  she was finding herself she winced again as the thought stabbed her that she was finding herself too late  they reached the house in silence each occupied with her own thoughts the defiant look had died out of sybils face and she was once more a child crying because unknown forces had hurt it but ruth was not looking at her now  she was too busy examining this new world into which she had been abruptly cast this world where dolls had souls and jokes lost their point  at the cottage good news awaited them the crisis was past bailey was definitely out of danger he was still asleep and sleeping easily it had just been an ordinary breakdown due to worrying and overwork said the doctor the bigger of the doctors the one who had been summoned from new york  all your husband needs now mrs bannister is rest see that he is kept quiet thats all there is to it  as if by way of a commentary on his words a small boy on a bicycle rode up with a telegram  sybil opened it she read it and looked at ruth with large eyes  from the office she said handing it to her  ruth read it it was a c d q an sos from the front an appeal for help from the forefront of the battle she did not understand the details of it but the purport was clear the battle had begun and bailey was needed but bailey lay sleeping in his tent  she handed it back in silence there was nothing to be done  the second telegram arrived half an hour after the first it differed from the first only in its greater emphasis panic seemed to be growing in the army of the lost leader  the ringing of the telephone began almost simultaneously with the arrival of the second telegram ruth went to the receiver a frantic voice was inquiring for mr bannister even as she put it to her ear  this is mrs winfield speaking she said steadily mr bannisters sister mr bannister is very ill and cannot possibly attend to any business  there was a silence at the other end of the wire then a voice with the calm of desperation said thank you there was a pause thank you said the voice again in a crushed sort of way and the receiver was hung up ruth went back to sybil  the hours passed how she got through them ruth hardly knew time seemed to have stopped for the most part they sat in silence in the afternoon sybil was allowed to see bailey for a few minutes she returned thoughtful she kissed ruth before she sat down and once or twice after that ruth looking up found her eyes fixed upon her it seemed to ruth that there was something which she was trying to say but she asked no questions  after dinner they sat out on the porch it was a perfect night the cool dusk was soothing  ruth broke a long silence  sybil  yes dear  may i tell you something  well  im afraid its bad news  sybil turned quickly  you called up the office while i was with bailey  ruth started  how did you know  i guessed i have been trying to do it all day but i hadnt the pluck well  im afraid things are about as bad as they can be a mr meadows spoke to me he was very gloomy he told me a lot of things which i couldnt follow details of what had happened but i understood all that was necessary im afraid  baileys ruined said sybil quietly  mr meadows seemed to think so he may have exaggerated  sybil shook her head  no bailey was talking to me upstairs i expected it  there was a long silence  ruth  yes  im afraid  sybil stopped  yes  a sudden light of understanding came to ruth she knew what it was that sybil was trying to say had been trying to say ever since she spoke with bailey  my money has gone too is that it  sybil did not answer ruth went quickly to her and took her in her arms  you poor baby she cried was that what was on your mind wondering how you should tell me i knew there was something troubling you  sybil began to sob  i didnt know how to tell you she whispered  ruth laughed excitedly she felt as if a great weight had been lifted from her shouldersa weight which had been crushing the life out of her in the last few days the scales had fallen from her eyes and she had seen clearly  she realized now what kirk had realized from the first that what had forced his life apart from hers had been the golden wedge of her fathers money it was the burden of wealth that had weighed her down without her knowing it she felt as if she had been suddenly set free  im dreadfully sorry said sybil feebly  ruth laughed again  im not she said if you knew how glad i was you would be congratulating me instead of looking as if you thought i was going to bite you  glad  of course im glad everythings going to be all right again now sybil dear kirk and i had the most awful quarrel the other day wewe actually decided it would be better for us to separate it was all my fault i had neglected kirk and i had neglected bill and kirk couldnt stand it any longer but now that this has happened dont you see that it will be all right again you cant stand on your dignity when youre up against real trouble if this had not happened neither of us would have had the pluck to make the first move but now you see we shall just naturally fall into each others arms and be happy again he and i and bill just as we were before  it must be lovely for you having bill said little mrs bailey wistfully i wish  she stopped there was a corner of her mind into which she could not admit any one even ruth  having him ought to have been enough for any woman ruths voice was serious it was enough for me in the old days when we were at the studio what fools women are sometimes i suppose i lost my head coming suddenly into all that moneyi dont know why for it was not as if i had not had plenty of time when father was alive to get used to the idea of being rich i think it must have been the unexpectedness of it i certainly did behave as if i had gone mad goodness im glad its over and that we can make a fresh start  what is it like being poor ruth of course we were never very well off at home but we werent really poor  its heaven if youre with the right man  mrs bailey sighed  baileys the right man as far as im concerned but im wondering how he will bear it poor dear  ruth was feeling too happy herself to allow any one else to be unhappy if she could help it  why of course he will be splendid about it she said youre letting your imagination run away with you you have got the idea of bailey and yourself as two broken creatures begging in the streets i dont know how badly bailey will be off after this smash but i do know that he will have all his brains and his energy left  ruth was conscious of a momentary feeling of surprise that she should be eulogizing bailey in this fashion andstranger stillthat she should be really sincere in what she said but today seemed to have changed everything and she was regarding her brother with a newborn respect she could still see sybils face as it had appeared in that memorable moment of selfrevelation it had made a deep impression upon her  a man like bailey is worth a large salary to any one even if he may not be able to start out for himself again immediately im not worrying about you and bailey you will have forgotten all about this crash this time next year sybil brightened up she was by nature easily moved and ruths words had stimulated her imagination  he is awfully clever she said her eyes shining  why this sort of thing happens every six months to anybody who has anything to do with wall street proceeded ruth fired by her own optimism you read about it in the papers every day nobody thinks anything of it  sybil though anxious to look on the bright side could not quite rise to these heights of scorn for the earthquake which had shaken her world  i hope not it would be awful to go through a time like this again  ruth reassured her though it entailed a certain inconsistency on her part she had a true womans contempt for consistency  of course you wont have to go through it again bailey will be careful in future not tonot to do whatever it is that he has done  she felt that the end of her inspiring speech was a little weak but she did not see how she could mend it her talk with mr meadows on the telephone had left her as vague as before as to the actual details of what had been happening that day in wall street she remembered stray remarks of his about bulls and she had gathered that something had happened to something which mr meadows called grds which had evidently been at the root of the trouble but there her grasp of high finance ended  sybil however was not exigent she brightened at ruths words as if they had been an authoritative pronouncement from an expert  bailey is sure to do right she said i think ill creep in and see if hes still asleep  ruth left alone on the porch fell into a pleasant train of thought there was something in her mental attitude which amused her she wondered if anybody had ever received the announcement of financial ruin in quite the same way before yet to her this attitude seemed the only one possible  how simple everything was now she could go to kirk and as she had said to sybil start again the golden barrier between them had vanished one day had wiped out all the wretchedness of the last year they were back where they had started with all the accumulated experience of those twelve months to help them steer their little ship clear of the rocks on its new voyage                                       she was roused from her dream by the sound of an automobile drawing up at the door a voice that she recognised called her name she went quickly down the steps  is that you aunt lora  mrs porter masterly woman never wasted time in useless chatter  jump in my dear she said crisply your husband has stolen william and eloped with that girl mamie whom i never trusted to connecticut     chapter xiii  pastures new   steve had arrived at the connecticut shack in the early dawn of the day which had been so eventful to most of his friends and acquaintances william bannisters interest in the drive at first acute had ceased after the first five miles and he had passed the remainder of the journey in a sound sleep from which the stopping of the car did not awaken him  steve jumped down and stretched himself there was a wonderful freshness in the air which made him forget for a moment his desire for repose he looked about him breathing deep draughts of its coolness the robins which though not so well advertised rise just as punctually as the lark were beginning to sing as they made their simple toilets before setting out to attend to the early worm the sky to the east was a delicate blend of pinks and greens and yellows with a hint of blue behind the grey which was still the prevailing note  a vaguely sentimental mood came upon steve in his heart he knew perfectly well that he could never be happy for any length of time out of sight and hearing of broadway cars but at that moment such was the magic of the dawn he felt a longing to settle down in the country and pass the rest of his days a simple farmer with beard unchecked by razor he saw himself feeding the chickens and addressing the pigs by their pet names while mamie in a cotton frock called cheerfully to him to come in because breakfast was ready and getting cold  mamie ah  his sigh turned into a yawn he realized with the abruptness which comes to a man who stands alone with nature in the small hours that he was very sleepy the excitement which had sustained him till now had begun to ebb the free life of the bearded farmer seemed suddenly less attractive bed was what he wanted now not nature  he opened the door of the car and lifted william bannister out swathed in rugs the white hope gurgled drowsily but did not wake steve carried him on to the porch and laid him down then he turned his attention to the problem of effecting an entry  once an honest man has taken to amateur burgling he soon picks up the tricks of it to open his knife and shoot back the catch of the nearest window was with steve the work if not of a moment of a very few minutes he climbed in and unlocked the front door then he carried his young charge into the sittingroom and laid him down on a chair a step nearer his ultimate destinationbed  steves faculties were rapidly becoming numb with approaching sleep but he roused himself to face certain details of the country life which till now had escaped him his earnest concentration on the main plank of his platform the spiriting away of william bannister had caused him to overlook the fact that no preparations had been made to welcome him on his arrival at his destination he had treated the shack as if it had been a summer hotel where he could walk in and engage a room it now struck him that there was much to be attended to before he could as he put it to himself hit the hay there was the white hopes bed to be made and by the way of a preliminary to that sheets must be found and blankets not to mention pillows  yawning wearily he set out on his search  he found sheets but mistrusted them they might or might not be perfectly dry he did not care to risk his godsons valuable health in the experiment a hazy notion that blankets were always safe restored his spirits and he became cheerful on reflecting that a child with william bannisters gift for sleep would not be likely to notice the absence of linen in his bed  the couch which he finally passed adequate would have caused lora delane porters hair to stand erect but it satisfied steve he went downstairs and returning with william bannister placed him carefully on it and tucked him in the white hope slept on  having assured himself that all was well steve made up a similar nest for himself and removing his coat and shoes crawled under the blankets five minutes later rhythmical snores proclaimed the fact that nature had triumphed over all the discomforts of one of the worstmade beds in connecticut                                       the sun was high when steve woke he rose stiffly and went into the other room william bannister still slept  steve regarded him admiringly  for the dormouse act he mused that kid certainly stands alone you got to hand it to him  an aching void within him called his mind to the question of breakfast it began to come home to him that he had not planned out this expedition with that thoroughness which marks the great general  i guess ill have to get out to the nearest village in the bubble he said and while im there maybe id better send kirk a wire and i reckon ill have to take the kid if he wakes up and finds me gone hell throw fits up you get squire  he kneaded the recumbent form of his godson with a large hand until he had massaged out of him the last remains of his great sleep it took some time but it was effective the white hope sat up full of life and energy he inspected steve gravely for a moment endeavouring to place him  hello steve he said at length  hello kid  where am i  in the country in connecticut  whats necticut  this is where we are  where are we  here in connecticut  why  steve raised a protesting hand  not so early in the day kid not before breakfast he pleaded honest im not strong enough it aint as if we was a vaudeville team that had got to rehearse  whats rehearse  steve changed the subject  say kid aint you feeling like you could bite into something i got an emptiness inside me as big as all outdoors how about a mouthful of cereal and a shirred egg now for the love of mike he went on quickly as his godson opened his mouth to speak dont say whats shirred its something you do to eggs its one way of fixing em  whats fixing inquired william bannister brightly  steve sighed when he spoke he was calm but determined  thatll be all the dialogue for the present he said well play the rest of our act in dumb show get a move on you and ill take you out in the bubblethe automobile the car the chugchug wagon the thing we came here in if you want to know what bubble isand well scare up some breakfast  steves ignorance of the locality in which he found himself was complete but he had a general impression that farmers as a class were people who delighted in providing breakfasts for the needy if the needy possessed the necessary price acting on this assumption he postponed his trip to the nearest town and drove slowly along the roads with his eyes open for signs of life  he found a suitable farm and applying the brakes gathered up william bannister and knocked at the door  his surmise as to the hospitality of farmers proved correct and presently they were sitting down to a breakfast which it did his famished soul good to contemplate  william bannister seemed less enthusiastic steve having disposed of two eggs in quick succession turned to see how his young charge was progressing with his repast and found him eyeing a bowl of breadandmilk in a sort of frozen horror  whats the matter kid he asked get busy  no paper said william bannister  for the love of pete do you expect your morning paper out in the woods  no paper repeated the white hope firmly  steve regarded him thoughtfully  i didnt have this trip planned out right he said regretfully i ought to have got mamie to come along i bet a hundred dollars she would have got next to your meanings in a second i pass whats your kick anyway whats all this about paper  aunty lora says not to eat bread that doesnt come wrapped up in paper said the white hope becoming surprisingly lucid mamie undoes it out of crinkly paper  i get you they feed you rolls at home wrapped up in tissuepaper is that it  whats tissue  same as crinkly well see here you remember what we was talking about last night about germs  yes  well thats one thing germs never do eat bread out of crinkly paper you want to forget all the dope they shot into you back in new york and start fresh you do what i tell you and you cant go wrong if youre going to be a regular germ what youve got to do is to wrap yourself round that breadandmilk the quickest you can get me till you do that we cant begin to start out to have a good time  william bannister made no more objections he attacked his meal with an easy conscience and about a quarter of an hour later leaned back with a deep sigh of repletion  steve meanwhile had entered into conversation with the lady of the house  say i guess you aint got a kid of your own anywheres have you  sure i have said the hostess proudly hes out in the field with his pop this minute his names jim  fine i want to get hold of a kid to play with this kid here jim sounds pretty good to me about the same age as this one  for the lords sake jims eighteen and weighs two hundred pounds  cut out jim i thought from the way you spoke he was a regular kid know any one in these parts whos got something about the same weight as this one  the farmers wife reflected  kids is pretty scarce round here she said i reckon you wont get one that i knows of theres that tom whiting but hes a bad boy he aint been raised right  whats the matter with him  i dont want to speak harm of no one but his father used to be a low prizefighter and you know what they are  steve nodded sympathetically  regular pluguglies he said a friend of mine used to have to mix with them quite a lot poor fellah he used to say they was none of them truly refined and this kid takes after his pop eh kind of scrappy kid is that it  hes a bad boy  well maybe id better look him over just in case wheres he to be found  they live in the cottage by the big house you can see through them trees his pop looks after mr wilsons prize dawgs thats his job  whats wilson asked the white hope coming out of his stupor  you beat me to it by a second kid i was just going to ask it myself  hes one of them rich new yawkers he has his summer place here and this whiting looks after his prize dawgs  well i guess ill give him a call its going to be lonesome for my kid if he aint got some one to show him how to hit it up hes not used to country life come along well get into the bubble and go and send your pop a telegram  whats telegram asked william bannister  i got you placed now said steve regarding him with interest youre not going to turn into an ambassador or an artist or any of them things youre going to be the greatest district attorney that ever came down the pike     chapter xiv  the sixtyfirst street cyclone   it was past seven oclock when kirk bending over the wheel with mamie at his side came in sight of the shack the journey had been checked just outside the city by a blowout in one of the back tyres kirk had spent the time while the shirtsleeved rescuer from the garage toiled over the injured wheel walking up and down with a cigar neither he nor mamie had shown much tendency towards conversation mamie was habitually of a silent disposition and kirks mind was too full of his thoughts to admit of speech  ever since he had read steves telegram he had been in the grip of a wild exhilaration he had not stopped to ask himself what this mad freak of steves could possibly lead to in the endhe was satisfied to feel that its immediate result would be that for a brief while at any rate he would have his son to himself away from all the chilling surroundings which had curbed him and frozen his natural feelings in the past  he tried to keep his mind from dwelling upon ruth he had thought too much of her of late for his comfort since they had parted that day of the thunderstorm the thought that he had lost her had stabbed him incessantly he had tried to tell himself that it was the best thing they could do to separate since it was so plain that their love had died but he could not cheat himself into believing it  it might be true in her caseit must be or why had she let him go that afternoonbut for himself the separation had taught him that he loved her as much as ever more than ever absence had purified him of that dull anger which had been his so short a while before he looked back and marvelled that he could ever have imagined for a moment that he had ceased to love her  now as he drove along the empty country roads he forced his mind to dwell as far as he could only upon his son there was a mist before his eyes as he thought of him what a bully lad he had been what fun they had had in the old days but that brought his mind back to ruth and he turned his mind resolutely to the future again  he chuckled silently as he thought of steve of all the mad things to do what had made him think of it how had such a wild scheme ever entered his head this he supposed was what steve called punching instead of sparring but he had never given him credit for the imagination that could conceive a punch of this magnitude  and how had he carried it out he could hardly have broken into the house yet that seemed the only way in which it could have been done  from steve his thoughts returned to william bannister he smiled again what a time they would havewhile it lasted the worst of it was it could not last long tomorrow he supposed he would have to take the child back to his home he could not be a party to this kidnapping raid for any length of time this must be looked on as a brief holiday not as a permanent relief  that was the only flaw in his happiness as he stopped the car at the door of the shack for by now he had succeeded at last in thrusting the image of ruth from his mind  there was a light in the groundfloor window he raised his head and shouted  steve  the door opened  hello kirk that you come along in youre just in time for the main performance  he caught sight of mamie standing beside kirk  whos that he cried for a moment he thought it was ruth and his honest heart leaped at the thought that his scheme had worked already and brought kirk and her together again  its me steve said mamie in her small voice and steve as he heard it was seized with the first real qualm he had had since he had embarked upon his great adventure  as kirk had endeavoured temporarily to forget ruth so had he tried not to think of mamie it was the only thing he was ashamed of in the whole affair the shock he must have given her  hello mamie he said sheepishly and paused words did not come readily to him  mamie entered the house without speaking it seemed to steve that invective would have been better than this ominous silence he looked ruefully at her retreating back and turned to greet kirk  youre mighty late he said  i only got your telegram toward the end of the afternoon i had been away all day i came here as fast as i could hit it up directly i read it we had a blowout and that delayed us  steve ventured a question  say kirk why us while were talking of it how does mamie come to be here  she insisted on coming it seems that everybody in the house was away today so she tells me so she came round to me with your note  i guess this has put me in pretty bad with mamie observed steve regretfully has she been knocking me on the trip  not a word  steve brightened but became subdued again next moment  i guess shes just saving it he said resignedly  steve what made you do it  oh i reckoned you could do with having the kid to yourself for a spell said steve awkwardly  youre all right steve but how did you manage it i shouldnt have thought it possible  oh it wasnt so hard that part i just hid in the house andbut say lets forget it it makes me feel kind of mean somehow it seems to me i may have lost mamie her job its mighty hard to do the right thing by every one in this world aint it come along in and see the kid hes great are you feeling ready for supper him and me was just going to start  it occurred to kirk for the first time that he was hungry  have you got anything to eat steve  steve brightened again  have we he said weve got everything there is in connecticut why say were celebrating this is our big day know whats happened why  he stopped short as if somebody had choked him they had gone into the sittingroom while he was speaking the table was laid for supper a chafingdish stood at one end and the remainder of the available space was filled with a collection of foods from cold chicken to candy which did credit to steves imagination  but it was not the sight of these that checked his flow of speech it was the look on mamies face as he caught sight of it in the lamplight the white hope was sitting at the table in the attitude of one who has heard the gong and is anxious to begin while mamie bending over him raised her head as the two men entered and fixed steve with a baleful stare  what have you been doing to the poor mite she demanded fiercely to get his face scratched this way  there was no doubt about the scratch it was a long angry red line running from temple to chin the white hope becoming conscious of the fact that the attention of the public was upon him and diagnosing the cause volunteered an explanation  bad boy he said and looked meaningly again at the candy  what does he mean by bad boy  just what he says mamie honest gee you dont think i done it do you  have you been letting the precious lamb fight cried mamie her eyes two circles of blue indignation  steves enthusiasm overcame his sense of guilt he uttered a whoop  letting him gee listen to her why say that kid dont have to be let hes a scrapper from swatvilleonthebingle honest thats what all this food is about were celebrating this is a little supper given in his honour by a few of his admirers and backers meaning me why say kirk that kid of yours is just the greatest thing that ever happened get that chafingdish going and ill tell you all about it  how did he come by that scratch said mamie coldly sticking to her point  ill tell you quick enough but lets start in on the eats first you wouldnt keep a coming champ waiting for his grub would you look how hes lamping that candy  were you going to let the poor mite stuff himself with candy steve dingle  sure whatever he says goes he owns the joint after this afternoon  mamie swiftly removed the unwholesome delicacy  the idea  kirk was busying himself with the chafingdish  what have you got in here steve  lobster colonel i had to do thirty miles to get it too  mamie looked at him fixedly  were you going to feed lobster to this child she asked with ominous calm were you intending to put him to bed full of broiled lobster and marshmallows  nix on the rough stuff mamie pleaded the embarrassed pugilist how was i to know what kids feed on and maybe he would have passed up the lobster at that and stuck to the sardines  sardines  aint kids allowed sardines said steve anxiously the guy at the store told me they were wholesome and nourishing it looked to me as if that ought to hit young fitzsimmons about right whats the matter with them  a little breadandmilk is all that he ever has before he goes to bed  steve detected a flaw in this and hastened to make his point  sure he said but he dont win the bantamweight champeenship of connecticut every night  is that what hes done today steve asked kirk  it certainly is aint i telling you  thats the trouble youre not you and mamie seem to be having a discussion about the nourishing properties of sardines and lobster what has been happening this afternoon  bad boy remarked william bannister with his mouth full  thats right said steve thats it in a nutshell say it was this way it seemed to me that having no kid of his own age to play around with his nibs was apt to get lonesome so i asked about and found that there was a guy of the name of whiting living near here who had a kid of the same age or thereabouts maybe you remember him he used to fight at the featherweight limit some time back called himself young obrien he was a pretty good scrapper in his time and now hes up here looking after some gents prize dogs  well i goes to him and borrows his kid hes a scrappy sort of kid at that and weighs ten pounds more than his nibs but i reckoned hed have to do and i thought i could stay around and part em if they got to mixing it  mamie uttered an indignant exclamation but kirks eyes were gleaming proudly  well he said  steve swallowed lobster and resumed  well you know how it is you meet a guy whos been in the same line of business as yourself and you find youve got a heap to talk about id never happened across the gink whiting but i knew of him and of course hed heard of me and we got to discussing things i seen him lose on a foul to tommy king in the eighteenth round out in los angeles and that kept us busy talking him having it that he hadnt gone within a mile of fouling tommy and me saying id been in a ringseat and had the goods on him same as if id taken a snapshot well we was both getting pretty hot under the collar about it when suddenly theres the blazes of a noise behind us and theres the two kids scrapping all over the lot the whiting kid had started it mind you and him ten pounds heavier than bill and tough too  the white hope confirmed this  bad boy he remarked and with a deep breath resumed excavating work on a grapefruit  well i was just making a jump to separate them when this whiting gook says betcha a dollar my kid wins and before i knew what i was doing id taken him it wasnt that that stopped me though it was his saying that his kid took after his dad and could eat up anything of his own age in america well darn it could i take that from a slob of a mixedale scrapper when it was handed out at the finest kid that ever came from new york  of course not said kirk indignantly and even mamie forbore to criticize she bent over the white hope and gave his grapefruitstained cheek a kiss  well i should say not cried steve i just hollered to his nibs soak it to him kid for the honour of no 99 and believe me the young bearcat sort of gathered himself together winked at me and began to hammer the stuffing out of the scrappy kid say there wasnt no sterilized stuff about his work you were a regular germ all right werent you squire  germ agreed the white hope he spoke drowsily  gee steve resumed his saga in a whirl of enthusiasm gee if theyre right to start with if theyre born right if theyve got the grit in them you cant sterilize it out of em if you use up half the germkiller in the country from the way that kid acted youd have thought hed been spending the last year in a trainingcamp the other kid rolled him over but he come up again as if that was just the sort of stuff he liked and pretty soon i see that hes uncovered a yellow streak in the whiting kid as big as a barn door you were on it werent you colonel  but the white hope had no remarks to offer this time his head had fallen forward and was resting peacefully in his grapefruit  hes asleep said mamie  she picked him up gently and carried him out  hes a champeen at that too said steve i had to pull him out of the hay this morning well i guess hes earned it hes had a busy day  what happened then steve  why after that there wasnt a thing to it whiting poor simp couldnt see it betcha ten dollars my kid wins he hollers hes got him going take you i shouts and at that moment the scrappy kid sees its all over so he does the old business of fouling same as his pop done when he fought tommy king its in the blood i guess he takes and scratches poor bill on the cheek  that was enough for me i jumps in all over i says my kid wins on a foul foul nothing says whiting it was an accident and you lose because you jumped into the fight same as connie mcvey did when corbett fought sharkey think you can get away with it pulling that oldtime stuff i didnt trouble to argue with him oh i says is that it say just take a slant at your man if you dont stop him quick hell be in texas  for the scrappy kid was beating it while the going was good and was half a mile away running hard well that was enough even for the whiting guy i guess well call it a draw he says and all bets off i just looks at him and says quite civil and polite you darned halfbaked slob of a roughhouse scrapper i says it aint a draw or anything like it my kid wins and ill trouble you now to proceed to cash in with the dough or else im liable to start something so he paid up and i took the white hope indoors and give him a wash and brushup and we cranks up the bubble and hikes off to the town and spends the money on getting food for the celebration supper and whats over i slips into the kids pocket and says thats your first winners end kid and youve earned it  steve paused and filled his glass  im on the waggon as a general thing nowadays he said but i reckon this an occasion right here is where we drink his health  and overcome by his emotion he burst into discordant song  foor hes a jolly good fellow bellowed steve for hes a jolly good fellow for hes  there was a sound of quick footsteps outside and mamie entered the room like a small whirlwind  be quiet she cried do you want to wake him  wake him said steve you cant wake that kid with dynamite  he raised his glass  ladeezn gentlemen the boy wonder heres to him the bantamweight champeen of connecticut the sixtyfirst street cyclone the kid they couldnt sterilize the white hope  the white hope echoed kirk  foor hes a jolly good fellow sang steve  be quiet said mrs porter from the doorway and steve wheeling round caught her eye and collapsed like a pricked balloon     chapter xv  mrs porters waterloo   of the little band of revellers it would be hard to say which was the most taken aback at this invasion the excitement of the moment had kept them from hearing the sound of the automobile which mrs porter mistrusting the rough road that led to the shack had stopped some distance away  perhaps on the whole kirk was more surprised than either of his companions their guilty consciences had never been quite free from the idea of the possibility of pursuit but kirk having gathered from mamie that neither ruth nor her aunt was aware of what had happened had counted upon remaining undisturbed till the time for return came on the morrow  he stood staring at ruth who had followed mrs porter into the room  mrs porter took charge of the situation she was in her element she stood with one hand resting on the table as if she were about to make an afterdinner speechas indeed she was  lora delane porter was not dissatisfied with the turn events had taken on the whole perhaps it might be said that she was pleased she intended when she began to speak to pulverize kirk and the abandoned young woman whom he had selected as his partner in his shameful escapade but in this she was swayed almost entirely by a regard for abstract morality  as concerned ruth she felt that the situation was on the whole the best thing that could have happened to her napoleonic mind which took little account of the softer emotions concerning itself entirely with the future of the race kirk had played his part and was now lagging superfluous on the stage his tendency she felt was to retard rather than to assist william bannisters development his influence such as it was clashed with hers she did not forget that there had been a time when ruth having practically to choose between them had chosen to go kirks way and had abandoned herself to a life which could only be considered unhygienic and retrograde her defeat in the matter of whiskers the microbeharbouring dog from ireland still rankled  it was true that in what might be called the return match she had utterly routed kirk but until this moment she had always been aware of him as an opponent who might have to be reckoned with she was quite convinced that it would be in the best interests of everybody especially of william bannister if he could be eliminated there were signs of human weakness in ruth which sometimes made her uneasy ruth she told herself might bear the torch but when it came to not faltering she was less certain of her  ruth it was true had behaved admirably in the matter of the upbringing of william from the moment of her conversion till now but might she not at any moment become a backslider and fill the whitetiled nursery with abominable longhaired dogs most certainly she might in a woman who had once been a longhaired dogist there are always possibilities of a relapse into longhaired dogism just as in a converted cannibal there are always possibilities of a return to the gods of wood and stone and the disposition to look on his fellowman purely in the light of breakfastfood  for these reasons mrs porter was determined to push home her present advantage to wipe kirk off the map as an influence in ruths life it was her intention having recovered william bannister and bathed him from head to foot in a weak solution of boric acid to stand over ruth while she obtained a divorce that done she would be in a position to defy kirk and all his antagonistic views on the subject of the hygienic upbringing of children  she rapped the table and prepared to speak  even a napoleon however may err from lack of sufficient information and there was a flaw in her position of which she was unaware from the beginning of the drive to the end of it ruth had hardly spoken a word and mrs porter in consequence was still in ignorance of what had been happening that day in wall street and the effect of these happenings on her nieces outlook on life could she have known it the silent girl beside her had already suffered the relapse which she had feared as a remote possibility  ruths mind during that drive had been in a confusion of regrets and doubts and hopes there were times when she refused absolutely to believe the story of kirks baseness which her aunt poured into her ear during the first miles of the journey it was absurd and incredible yet as they raced along the dark roads doubt came to her and would not be driven out  a single unfortunate phrase of kirks spoken in haste but remembered at leisure formed the basis of this uncertainty that afternoon when he had left her he had said that mamie was the real mother of the child could it be that mamies undeviating devotion to the boy had won the love which she had lost it was possible considered in the light of what mrs porter had told her it seemed in her blackest moments certain  she knew how wrapped up in the boy kirk had been was it not a logical outcome of his estrangement from herself that he should have turned for consolation to the one person in sympathy with him in his great love for his child  she tried to read his face as he stood looking at her now but she could find no hope in it the eyes that met hers were cold and expressionless  mrs porter rapped the table a second time  mr winfield she said in the metallic voice with which she was wont to cow publishers insufficiently equipped with dash and enterprise in the matter of advertising treatises on the future of the race i have no doubt you are surprised to see us you appear to be looking your wife in the face it speaks well for your courage but badly for your sense of shame if you had the remnants of decent feeling in you you would be physically incapable of the feat if you would care to know how your conduct strikes an unprejudiced spectator i may tell you that i consider you a scoundrel of the worst type and unfit to associate with any but the low company in which i find you  steve who had been listening with interest and indeed a certain relish while kirk was as he put it to himself getting his in this spirited fashion started at the concluding words of the address which in his opinion seemed slightly personal he had long ago made up his mind that lora delane porter though an entertaining woman and on the whole more worth while than a movingpicture show was quite mad but he felt even lunatics ought to realize that there is a limit to what they may say  he moaned protestingly and rashly for he drew the speakers attention upon himself  this person went on mrs porter indicating steve with a wave of her hand which caused him to sidestep swiftly and throw up an arm as had been his habit in the ring when battling dick or fighting jack endeavoured to blot him out with a right swing who i observe retains the tattered relics of a conscience seeing that he winces you employed to do the only dangerous part of your dirty work i hope he will see that he gets his money in his place i should be feeling uneasy  maam protested steve  mrs porter silenced him with a gesture  be quiet she said  steve was quiet  mrs porter returned to kirk  of all her burning words kirk had not heard one his eyes had never left ruths like her he was trying to read a message from a face that seemed only cold in this crisis of their two lives he had no thought for anybody but her he had a sense of great issues of being on the verge of the tremendous but his brain felt numbed and heavy he could not think he could see nothing except her eyes  his inattention seemed to communicate itself to mrs porter she rapped imperatively upon the table for the third time the report galvanized steve as earlier in the day a similar report had galvanized mr penway but kirk did not move  mr winfield  still kirk made no sign that he had heard her it was discouraging but lora delane porter was not made of the stuff that yields readily to discouragement she resumed  as for this wretched girlshe indicated the silent mamie with a wave of her handthis abandoned creature whom you have led astray this shameless partner of your  say  the exclamation came from steve and it stopped mrs porter like a bullet to her this interruption from one whom she had fallen upon and wiped out resembled a voice from the tomb she was not accustomed to having her victims rise up and cut sharply even peremptorily into the flow of her speech macbeth confronted by the ghost of banquo may have been a little more taken aback but not much  she endeavoured to quell steve with a glance but it was instantly apparent that he was immune for the time being to quelling glances his brown eyes were fixed upon her in a cold stare which she found arresting and charged with menace his chin protruded and his upper lip was entirely concealed behind its fellow in a most uncomfortable manner  she had never had the privilege of seeing steve in the active exercise of his late profession or she would have recognized the look it was the one which proclaims the state of mind commonly known as being fighting mad and in other days had usually heralded a knockout for some too persistent opponent  say maam you want to cut that out that line of talk dont go  great is the magic of love that can restore a man in an instant of time from being an obsequious wreck to a thing of fire and resolution a moment before steves only immediate object in life had been to stay quiet and keep out of the way as much as possible he had never been a man of ready speech in the presence of an angry woman words intimidated him as blows never did especially the whirl of words which were at lora delane porters command in moments of emotion  but this sudden onslaught upon mamie innocent mamie who had done nothing to anybody scattered his embarrassment and filled him with much the same spirit which sent bantamweight knights up against heavyweight dragons in the middle ages he felt inspired  nix on the abandoned creature he said with dignity youre on the wrong wire this here lady is my affianced wife  he went to mamie and putting his arm round her waist pressed her to him he was conscious as he did so of a sensation of wonderment at himself this was the attitude he had dreamed of a thousand times and had been afraid to assume for the last three years he had been picturing himself in precisely this position and daily had cursed the lack of nerve which had held him back yet here he was and it had all happened in a moment a funny thing life  what exclaimed mrs porter  sure thing said steve his coolness the ease with which he found words astonished him as much as his rapidity of action  i stole the kid he said and it was my idea at that kirk didnt know anything about it i wired to him today what i had done and that he was to come right along and added steve in a burst of inspiration i said bring along mamie too as the kids used to her and there ought to be a woman around and she could be here all right and no harm she being my affianced wife he liked that phrase he had read it in a book somewhere and it was the goods  he eyed mrs porter jauntily mrs porters gaze wavered she was not feeling comfortable hers was a nature that did not lend itself easily to apologies yet apologies were obviously what the situation demanded the thought of all the eloquence which she had expended to no end added to her discomfort for the first time she was pleased that kirk had so manifestly not been listening to a word of it  oh she said  she paused  that puts a different complexion on this affair  betcha life  she paused once more it was some moments before she could bring herself to speak she managed it at last  i beg your pardon she said  mine maam said steve grandly five minutes before the idea that he could ever speak grandly to lora delane porter would have seemed ridiculous to him but he was surprised at nothing now  and the young wom and the future mrs dingles said mrs porter with an effort  thank you maam said steve and released mamie who forthwith bolted from the room like a scared rabbit  steve had started to follow her when mrs porter magnificent woman snatching what was left from defeat stopped him  wait she said what you have said alters the matter in one respect but there is another point on your own confession you have been guilty of the extremely serious offence the penal offence of kidnapping a child who  drop me a line about it maam said steve me times rather full just now  he disappeared into the outer darkness after mamie                                       in the room they had left kirk and ruth faced each other in silence lora delane porter eyed them grimly it was the hour of her defeat and she knew it forces too strong for her were at work her grand attack the bringing of these two together that ruth might confront kirk in his guilt had recoiled upon her the old guard had made their charge up the hill and it had failed victory had become a rout with one speech steve had destroyed her whole plan of campaign  she knew it was all over that in another moment if she remained she would be compelled to witness the humiliating spectacle of ruth in kirks arms stammering the words which intuition told her were even now trembling on her lips she knew ruth she could read her like a primer and her knowledge told her that she was about to capitulate that all her pride and resentment had been swept away that she had gone over to the enemy  elemental passions were warring against lora delane porter and she bowed before them  mr winfield she said sharply her voice cutting the silence like a knife i beg your pardon i seem to have made a mistake good night  kirk did not answer  good night ruth  ruth made no sign that she had heard  mrs porter grand in defeat moved slowly to the door  but even in the greatest women there is that germ of feminine curiosity which cannot be wholly eliminated that little grain of dust that asserts itself and clogs the machinery it had been mrs porters intention to leave the room without a glance her back defiantly toward the foe but as she reached the door there came from behind her a sound of movement a stifled cry a little sound whose meaning she knew too well  she hesitated she stood still fighting herself but the grain of dust had done its work for an instant she ceased to be a smoothly working machine and became a woman subject to the dictates of impulse  she turned  intuition had not deceived her ruth had gone over to the enemy she was in kirks arms holding him to her her face hidden against his shoulder for all the world as if lora delane porter her guiding force had ceased to exist  mrs porter closed the door and walked stiffly through the scented night to where the headlights of her automobile cleft the darkness birds asleep in the trees fluttered uneasily at the sudden throbbing of the engine     chapter xvi  the whitehope link   the white hope slept the noise of the departing car which had roused the birds had made no impression on him as steve had said dynamite could not do it he slumbered on calmly detached unaware of the remarkable changes which in the past twentyfour hours had taken place in his life an epoch had ended and a new one begun but he knew it not  and probably if kirk and ruth who were standing at his bedside watching him had roused him and informed him of these facts he would have displayed little excitement he had the philosophical temperament he took things as they came great natural phenomena like lora delane porter he accepted as part of life when they were in his life he endured them stoically when they went out of it he got on without them marcus aurelius would have liked william bannister winfield they belonged to the same school of thought  the years have a tendency to destroy this placidity towards life and to develop in man a sense of gratitude to fate for its occasional kindnesses and kirk having been in the world longer than william bannister did not take the gifts of the gods so much for granted he was profoundly grateful for what had happened that lora delane porter should have retired from active interference with his concerns was much but that he should have had the incredible good fortune to be freed from the burden of john bannisters money was more  if ever money was the root of all evil this had been it had come into his life like a poisonous blight withering and destroying wherever it touched it had changed ruth it had changed william bannister it had changed himself it was as if the spirit of the old man had lived on hating him and working him mischief he always had superstitious fear of it and events had proved him right  and now the cloud had rolled away a few crowded hours of baileys dashing imbecility had removed the curse forever  he was alone with ruth and his son in a world that contained only them just as in the old days of their happiness there was something symbolic something suggestive of the beginning of a new order of things in their isolation at this very moment steve had gone only he and ruth and the child were left  the childthe white hopehe was the real hero of the story the real principal of the drama of their three lives he was the link that bound them together the force that worked for coherence and against chaos he stood between them his hands in theirs and while he did so there could be no parting of the ways his grip was light but as strong as steel time would bring troubles moods misunderstandings for they were both human but while that grip held there could be no gulf dividing ruth and himself as it had divided them in the past  he faced the future calmly with open eyes it would be rough going at first very rough going it meant hard work incessant work no more vague masterpieces which might or might not turn into carmen or the spanish maiden no more delightful idle days to be loafed through in the studio or the shops no more dreams seen hazily through the smoke of a cigar as he lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling of what he would do tomorrow tomorrow must look after itself his business was with the present and the work of the present  he braced himself to the fight confident of his power to win he had found himself  bill stirred in his sleep and muttered ruth bent over him and kissed the honourable scratch on his cheek  poor little chap
