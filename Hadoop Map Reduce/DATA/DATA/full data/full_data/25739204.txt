25739204	the greek transliterations throughout this file are either missing or very suspect   illustration f finden sculp london john murray albernarle st 1837  autographed dear sir your obliged servant s t coleridge  specimens of the table talk of samuel taylor coleridge   to james gillman esquire of the grove highgate and to mrs gillman this volume is gratefully inscribed     preface                                       it is nearly fifteen years since i was for the first time enabled to become a frequent and attentive visitor in mr coleridges domestic society his exhibition of intellectual power in living discourse struck me at once as unique and transcendant and upon my return home on the very first evening which i spent with him after my boyhood i committed to writing as well as i could the principal topics of his conversation in his own words i had no settled design at that time of continuing the work but simply made the note in something like a spirit of vexation that such a strain of music as i had just heard should not last forever what i did once i was easily induced by the same feeling to do again and when after many years of affectionate communion between us the painful existence of my revered relative on earth was at length finished in peace my occasional notes of what he had said in my presence had grown to a mass of which this volume contains only such parts as seem fit for present publication i know better than any one can tell me how inadequately these specimens represent the peculiar splendour and individuality of mr coleridges conversation how should it be otherwise who could always follow to the turningpoint his long arrowflights of thought who could fix those ejaculations of light those tones of a prophet which at times have made me bend before him as before an inspired man such acts of spirit as these were too subtle to be fettered down on paper they liveif they can live any wherein the memories alone of those who witnessed them yet i would fain hope that these pages will prove that all is not lostthat something of the wisdom the learning and the eloquence of a great mans social converse has been snatched from forgetfulness and endowed with a permanent shape for general use and although in the judgment of many persons i may incur a serious responsibility by this publication i am upon the whole willing to abide the result in confidence that the fame of the loved and lamented speaker will lose nothing hereby and that the cause of truth and of goodness will be every way a gainer this sprig though slight and immature may yet become its place in the poets wreath of honour among flowers of graver hue  if the favour shown to several modern instances of works nominally of the same description as the present were alone to be considered it might seem that the old maxim that nothing ought to be said of the dead but what is good is in a fair way of being dilated into an understanding that every thing is good that has been said by the dead the following pages do not i trust stand in need of so much indulgence their contents may not in every particular passage be of great intrinsic importance but they can hardly be without some and i hope a worthy interest as coming from the lips of one at least of the most extraordinary men of the age whilst to the best of my knowledge and intention no living persons name is introduced whether for praise or for blame except on literary or political grounds of common notoriety upon the justice of the remarks here published it would be out of place in me to say any thing and a commentary of that kind is the less needed as in almost every instance the principles upon which the speaker founded his observations are expressly stated and may be satisfactorily examined by themselves but for the purpose of general elucidation it seemed not improper to add a few notes and to make some quotations from mr coleridges own works and in doing so i was in addition actuated by an earnest wish to call the attention of reflecting minds in general to the views of political moral and religious philosophy contained in those works which through an extensive but now decreasing prejudice have hitherto been deprived of that acceptance with the public which their great preponderating merits deserve and will as i believe finally obtain and i can truly say that if in the course of the perusal of this little work any one of its readers shall gain a clearer insight into the deep and pregnant principles in the light of which mr coleridge was accustomed to regard god and the worldi shall look upon the publication as fortunate and consider myself abundantly rewarded for whatever trouble it has cost me  a cursory inspection will show that this volume lays no claim to be ranked with those of boswell in point of dramatic interest coleridge differed not more from johnson in every characteristic of intellect than in the habits and circumstances of his life during the greatest part of the time in which i was intimately conversant with him he was naturally very fond of society and continued to be so to the last but the almost unceasing ill health with which he was afflicted after fifty confined him for many months in every year to his own room and most commonly to his bed he was then rarely seen except by single visiters and few of them would feel any disposition upon such occasions to interrupt him whatever might have been the length or mood of his discourse and indeed although i have been present in mixed company where mr coleridge has been questioned and opposed and the scene has been amusing for the momenti own that it was always much more delightful to me to let the river wander at its own sweet will unruffled by aught but a certain breeze of emotion which the stream itself produced if the course it took was not the shortest it was generally the most beautiful and what you saw by the way was as worthy of note as the ultimate object to which you were journeying it is possible indeed that coleridge did not in fact possess the precise gladiatorial power of johnson yet he understood a swordplay of his own and i have upon several occasions seen him exhibit brilliant proofs of its effectiveness upon disputants of considerable pretensions in their particular lines but he had a genuine dislike of the practice in himself or others and no slight provocation could move him to any such exertion he was indeed to my observation more distinguished from other great men of letters by his moral thirst after the truththe ideal truthin his own mind than by his merely intellectual qualifications to leave the everyday circle of society in which the literary and scientific rarely the rest neverbreak through the spell of personalitywhere anecdote reigns everlastingly paramount and exclusive and the mildest attempt to generalize the babel of facts and to control temporary and individual phenomena by the application of eternal and overruling principles is unintelligible to many and disagreeable to moreto leave this species of converseif converse it deserves to be calledand pass an entire day with coleridge was a marvellous change indeed it was a sabbath past expression deep and tranquil and serene you came to a man who had travelled in many countries and in critical times who had seen and felt the world in most of its ranks and in many of its vicissitudes and weaknesses one to whom all literature and genial art were absolutely subject and to whom with a reasonable allowance as to technical details all science was in a most extraordinary degree familiar throughout a longdrawn summers day would this man talk to you in low equable but clear and musical tones concerning things human and divine marshalling all history harmonizing all experiment probing the depths of your consciousness and revealing visions of glory and of terror to the imagination but pouring withal such floods of light upon the mind that you might for a season like paul become blind in the very act of conversion and this he would do without so much as one allusion to himself without a word of reflection on others save when any given act fell naturally in the way of his discoursewithout one anecdote that was not proof and illustration of a previous positiongratifying no passion indulging no caprice but with a calm mastery over your soul leading you onward and onward for ever through a thousand windings yet with no pause to some magnificent point in which as in a focus all the partycoloured rays of his discourse should converge in light in all this he was in truth your teacher and guide but in a little while you might forget that he was other than a fellow student and the companion of your wayso playful was his manner so simple his language so affectionate the glance of his pleasant eye  there were indeed some whom coleridge tired and some whom he sent asleep it would occasionally so happen when the abstruser mood was strong upon him and the visiter was narrow and ungenial i have seen him at times when you could not incarnate himwhen he shook aside your petty questions or doubts and burst with some impatience through the obstacles of common conversation then escaped from the flesh he would soar upwards into an atmosphere almost too rare to breathe but which seemed proper to him and there he would float at ease like enough what coleridge then said his subtlest listener would not understand as a man understands a newspaper but upon such a listener there would steal an influence and an impression and a sympathy there would be a gradual attempering of his body and spirit till his total being vibrated with one pulse alone and thought became merged in contemplation    and so his senses gradually wrapt   in a half sleep hed dream of better worlds   and dreaming hear thee still o singing lark   that sangest like an angel in the clouds  but it would be a great mistake to suppose that the general character of mr coleridges conversation was abstruse or rhapsodical the contents of the following pages may i think be taken as pretty strong presumptive evidence that his ordinary manner was plain and direct enough and even when as sometimes happened he seemed to ramble from the road and to lose himself in a wilderness of digressions the truth was that at that very time he was working out his foreknown conclusion through an almost miraculous logic the difficulty of which consisted precisely in the very fact of its minuteness and universality he took so large a scope that if he was interrupted before he got to the end he appeared to have been talking without an object although perhaps a few steps more would have brought you to a point a retrospect from which would show you the pertinence of all he had been saying i have heard persons complain that they could get no answer to a question from coleridge the truth is he answered or meant to answer so fully that the querist should have no second question to ask in nine cases out of ten he saw the question was short or misdirected and knew that a mere yes or no answer could not embrace the truththat is the whole truthand might very probably by implication convey error hence that exhaustive cyclical mode of discoursing in which he frequently indulged unfit indeed for a dinner table and too longbreathed for the patience of a chance visiterbut which to those who knew for what they came was the object of their profoundest admiration as it was the source of their most valuable instruction mr coleridges affectionate disciples learned their lessons of philosophy and criticism from his own mouth he was to them as an old master of the academy or lyceum the more time he took the better pleased were such visiters for they came expressly to listen and had ample proof how truly he had declared that whatever difficulties he might feel with pen in hand in the expression of his meaning he never found the smallest hitch or impediment in the utterance of his most subtle reasonings by word of mouth how many a time and oft have i felt his abtrusest thoughts steal rhythmically on my soul when chanted forth by him nay how often have i fancied i heard rise up in answer to his gentle touch an interpreting music of my own as from the passive strings of some windsmitten lyre  mr coleridges conversation at all times required attention because what he said was so individual and unexpected but when he was dealing deeply with a question the demand upon the intellect of the hearer was very great not so much for any hardness of language for his diction was always simple and easy nor for the abstruseness of the thoughts for they generally explained or appeared to explain themselves but preeminently on account of the seeming remoteness of his associations and the exceeding subtlety of his transitional links upon this point it is very happily though according to my observation too generally remarked by one whose powers and opportunities of judging were so eminent that the obliquity of his testimony in other respects is the more unpardonablecoleridge to many peopleand often i have heard the complaintseemed to wander and he seemed then to wander the most when in fact his resistance to the wandering instinct was greatestviz when the compass and huge circuit by which his illustrations moved travelled farthest into remote regions before they began to revolve long before this coming round commenced most people had lost him and naturally enough supposed that he had lost himself they continued to admire the separate beauty of the thoughts but did not see their relations to the dominant theme     however i can assert upon my long and intimate knowledge of coleridges mind that logic the most severe was as inalienable from his modes of thinking as grammar from his language footnote taits mag sept 1834 p 514 true his mind was a logicvice let him fasten it on the tiniest flourish of an error he never slacked his hold till he had crushed body and tail to dust he was always ratiocinating in his own mind and therefore sometimes seemed incoherent to the partial observer it happened to him as to pindar who in modern days has been called a rambling rhapsodist because the connections of his parts though never arbitrary are so fine that the vulgar reader sees them not at all but they are there nevertheless and may all be so distinctly shown that no one can doubt their existence and a little study will also prove that the points of contact are those which the true genius of lyric verse naturally evolved and that the entire pindaric ode instead of being the loose and lawless outburst which so many have fancied is without any exception the most artificial and highly wrought composition which time has spared to us from the wreck of the greek muse so i can well remember occasions in which after listening to mr coleridge for several delightful hours i have gone away with divers splendid masses of reasoning in my head the separate beauty and coherency of which i deeply felt but how they had produced or how they bore upon each other i could not then perceive in such cases i have mused sometimes even for days afterwards upon the words till at length spontaneously as it seemed the fire would kindle and the association which had escaped my utmost efforts of comprehension before flash itself all at once upon my mind with the clearness of noonday light  it may well be imagined that a style of conversation so continuous and diffused as that which i have just attempted to describe presented remarkable difficulties to a mere reporter by memory it is easy to preserve the pithy remark the brilliant retort or the pointed anecdote these stick of themselves and their retention requires no effort of mind but where the salient angles are comparatively few and the object of attention is a longdrawn subtle discoursing you can never recollect except by yourself thinking the argument over again in so doing the order and the characteristic expressions will for the most part spontaneously arise and it is scarcely credible with what degree of accuracy language may thus be preserved where practice has given some dexterity and long familiarity with the speaker has enabled or almost forced you to catch the outlines of his manner yet with all this so peculiar were the flow and breadth of mr coleridges conversation that i am very sensible how much those who can best judge will have to complain of my representation of it the following specimens will i fear seem too fragmentary and therefore deficient in one of the most distinguishing properties of that which they are designed to represent and this is true yet the reader will in most instances have little difficulty in understanding the course which the conversation took although my recollections of it are thrown into separate paragraphs for the sake of superior precision as i never attempted to give dialogueindeed there was seldom much dialogue to give the great point with me was to condense what i could remember on each particular topic into intelligible wholes with as little injury to the living manner and diction as was possible with this explanation i must leave it to those who still have the tones of that old man eloquent ringing in their ears to say how far i have succeeded in this delicate enterprise of stamping his winged words with perpetuity  in reviewing the contents of the following pages i can clearly see that i have admitted some passages which will be pronounced illiberal by those who in the present day emphatically call themselves liberalthe liberal i allude of course to mr coleridges remarks on the reform bill and the malthusian economists the omission of such passages would probably have rendered this publication more generally agreeable and my disposition does not lead me to give gratuitous offence to any one but the opinions of mr coleridge on these subjects however imperfectly expressed by me were deliberately entertained by him and to have omitted in so miscellaneous a collection as this what he was well known to have said would have argued in me a disapprobation or a fear which i disclaim a few words however may be pertinently employed here in explaining the true bearing of coleridges mind on the politics of our modern days he was neither a whig nor a tory as those designations are usually understood well enough knowing that for the most part halftruths only are involved in the parliamentary tenets of one party or the other in the common struggles of a session therefore he took little interest and as to mere personal sympathies the friend of frere and of poole the respected guest of canning and of lord lansdowne could have nothing to choose but he threw the weight of his opinionand it was considerableinto the tory or conservative scale for these two reasonsfirst generally because he had a deep conviction that the cause of freedom and of truth is now seriously menaced by a democratical spirit growing more and more rabid every day and giving no doubtful promise of the tyranny to come and secondly in particular because the national church was to him the ark of the covenant of his beloved country and he saw the whigs about to coalesce with those whose avowed principles lead them to lay the hand of spoliation upon it add to these two grounds some relics of the indignation which the efforts of the whigs to thwart the generous exertions of england in the great spanish war had formerly roused within him and all the constituents of any active feeling in mr coleridges mind upon matters of state are i believe fairly laid before the reader the reform question in itself gave him little concern except as he foresaw the present attack on the church to be the immediate consequence of the passing of the bill for let the form of the house of commons said he be what it may it will be for better or for worse pretty much what the country at large is but once invade that truly national and essentially popular institution the church and divert its funds to the relief or aid of individual charity or public taxationhow specious soever that pretext may beand you will never thereafter recover the lost means of perpetual cultivation give back to the church what the nation originally consecrated to its use and it ought then to be charged with the education of the people but half of the original revenue has been already taken by force from her or lost to her through desuetude legal decision or public opinion and are those whose very houses and parks are part and parcel of what the nation designed for the general purposes of the clergy to be heard when they argue for making the church support out of her diminished revenues institutions the intended means for maintaining which they themselves hold under the sanction of legal robbery upon this subject mr coleridge did indeed feel very warmly and was accustomed to express himself accordingly it weighed upon his mind night and day and he spoke upon it with an emotion which i never saw him betray upon any topic of common politics however decided his opinion might be in this therefore he was felix opportunitate mortis non enim vidit and the just and honest of all parties will heartily admit over his grave that as his principles and opinions were untainted by any sordid interest so he maintained them in the purest spirit of a reflective patriotism without spleen or bitterness or breach of social union  it would require a rare pen to do justice to the constitution of coleridges mind it was too deep subtle and peculiar to be fathomed by a morning visiter few persons knew much of it in any thing below the surface scarcely three or four ever got to understand it in all its marvellous completeness mere personal familiarity with this extraordinary man did not put you in possession of him his pursuits and aspirations though in their mighty range presenting points of contact and sympathy for all transcended in their ultimate reach the extremest limits of most mens imaginations for the last thirty years of his life at least coleridge was really and truly a philosopher of the antique cast he had his esoteric views and all his prose works from the friend to the church and state were little more than feelers pioneers disciplinants for the last and complete exposition of them of the art of making hooks he knew little and cared less but had he been as much an adept in it as a modern novelist he never could have succeeded in rendering popular or even tolerable at first his attempt to push locke and paley from their common throne in england a little more working in the trenches might have brought him closer to the walls with less personal damage but it is better for christian philosophy as it is though the assailant was sacrificed in the bold and artless attack mr coleridges prose works had so very limited a sale that although published in a technical sense they could scarcely be said to have ever become publici juris he did not think them such himself with the exception perhaps of the aids to reflection and generally made a particular remark if he met any person who professed or showed that he had read the friend or any of his other books and i have no doubt that had he lived to complete his great work on philosophy reconciled with christian religion he would without scruple have used in that work any part or parts of his preliminary treatises as their intrinsic fitness required hence in every one of his prose writings there are repetitions either literal or substantial of passages to be found in some others of those writings and there are several particular positions and reasonings which he considered of vital importance reiterated in the friend the literary life the lay sermons the aids to reflection and the church and state he was always deepening and widening the foundation and cared not how often he used the same stone in thinking passionately of the principle he forgot the authorshipand sowed beside many waters if peradventure some chance seedling might take root and bear fruit to the glory of god and the spiritualization of man  his mere reading was immense and the quality and direction of much of it well considered almost unique in this age of the world he had gone through most of the fathers and i believe all the schoolmen of any eminence whilst his familiarity with all the more common departments of literature in every language is notorious the early age at which some of these acquisitions were made and his ardent selfabandonment in the strange pursuit might according to a common notion have seemed adverse to increase and maturity of power in after life yet it was not so he lost indeed for ever the chance of being a popular writer but lambs inspired charityboy of twelve years of age continued to his dying day when sixtytwo the eloquent centre of all companies and the standard of intellectual greatness to hundreds of affectionate disciples far and near had coleridge been master of his genius and not alas mastered by it had he less romantically fought a singlehanded fight against the whole prejudices of his age nor so mercilessly racked his fine powers on the problem of a universal christian philosophyhe might have easily won all that a reading public can give to a favourite and have left a namenot greater nor more enduring indeedbutbetter known and more prized than now it is amongst the wise the gentle and the good throughout all ranks of society nevertheless desultory as his labours fragmentary as his productions at present may seem to the cursory observermy undoubting belief is that in the end it will be found that coleridge did in his vocation the days work of a giant he has been melted into the very heart of the rising literatures of england and america and the principles he has taught are the masterlight of the moral and intellectual being of men who if they shall fail to save will assuredly illustrate and condemn the age in which they live as it is they bide their time  coleridge himselfblessings on his gentle memorycoleridge was a frail mortal he had indeed his peculiar weaknesses as well as his unique powers sensibilities that an averted look would rack a heart which would have beaten calmly in the tremblings of an earthquake he shrank from mere uneasiness like a child and bore the preparatory agonies of his death attack like a martyr sinned against a thousand times more than sinning he himself suffered an almost lifelong punishment for his errors whilst the world at large has the unwithering fruits of his labours his genius and his sacrifice

in memoria hominum et sermone versabitur postquam ab oculis recessit                                       samuel taylor coleridge was the youngest child of the reverend john coleridge vicar of the parish of ottery st mary in the county of devon and master of henry the eighths free grammar school in that town his mothers maiden name was ann bowdon he was born at ottery on the 21st of october 1772 about eleven oclock in the forenoon as his father the vicar has with rather a curious particularity entered it in the register  he died on the 25th of july 1834 in mr gillmans house in the grove

chivalrous moorish chief  shakspeare learned the sprit of the character from the spanish poetry which was prevalent in england in his time1  jelousy does not strike me as the point in his passion i take it to be rather an agony that the creature whom he had believed angelic with whom he had garnered up his heart and whom he could not help still loving should be proved impure and worthless  it was the struggle  not to love her  it was a moral indignation and regret that virture should so fallbut yet the pity of it iagoo iago the pity of it iago  in addition to this his hourour was concerned iago would not have succeeded but by hinting that this honour was compromised  there is no ferocity in othello his mind is majestic and composed  he deliberately determines to die and speaks his last speech with a view of showing his attachment to the venetian state though it had superseded him  footnote 1   caballaeros granadinos   aunque moros hijos dalgoed

kemble what a quaint creature he was i remember a party in which he was discoursing in his measured manner after dinner when the servant announced his carriage he nodded and went on the announcement took place twice afterwards kemble each time nodding his head a little more impatiently but still going on at last and for the fourth time the servant entered and saidmrs kemble says sir she has the rheumatise and cannot stay addism dropped john in a parenthesis and proceeded quietly in his harangue                                       kemble would correct any body at any time and in any place

much he was one of my earliest friends i remember once he was talking and found himself out of snuff i offered him my box he declined taking anyhe a poor actor could not put his fingers into a royal box i said take some pray you will obleege me upon which kemble repliedit would become your royal mouth better to say oblige me and took a pinch                                       it is not easy to put me out of countenance or interrupt the feeling of the time by mere external noise or circumstance yet once i was thoroughly done up as you would say i was reciting at a particular house the

mankind  privilege is a substitution for law where from the nature of the circumstances a law cannot act without clashing with greater and more general principles the house of commons must of course have the power of taking cognizance of offences against its own rights sir francis burdett might have been properly sent to the tower for the speech he made in the house 1 but when afterwards he published it in cobbett and they took cognizance of it as a breach of privilege they violated the plain distinction between privilege and law  as a speech in the house the house could alone animadvert upon it consistently with the effective preservation of its most necessary prerogative of freedom of debate but when that speech became a book then the law was to look to it and there being a law of libel commensurate with every possible object of attack in the state privilege which acts or ought to act only as a substitute for other laws could have nothing to do with it i have heard that one distinguished individual saidthat he for one would not shrink from affirming that if the house of commons chose to burn one of their own members in palace yard it had an inherent power and right by the constitution to do so this was said if at all by a moderateminded man and may show to what atrocious tyranny some persons may advance in theory under shadow of this word privilege  footnote 1 march 12 1810 sir francis burdett made a motion in the house of commons for the discharge of mr gale jones who had been committed to newgate by a resolution of the house on the 21st of february preceding sir francis afterwards published in cobbetts political register of the 24th of the same month of march a letter to his constituents denying the power of the house of commons to imprison the people of england and he accompanied the letter with an argument in support of his position on the 27th of march a complaint of breach of privilege founded on this publication was made in the house by mr now sir thomas lethbridge and after several long debates a motion that sir francis burdett should be committed to the tower was made on the 5th of april 1810 by sir robert salisbury and carried by

england which are as new and fresh now as they were a hundred and sixty years ago and will be so for ever to us these two principles came to a struggle it was natural that the great and the good of the nation should he found in the ranks of either side in the mohammedan states there is no principle of permanence and therefore they sink directly they existed and could only exist in their efforts at progression when they ceased to conquer they fell in pieces turkey would long since have fallen had it not been supported by the rival and conflicting interests of christian europe the turks have no church religion and state are one hence there is no counterpoise no mutual support this is the very essence of their unitarianism they have no past they are not an historical people they exist only in the present china is an instance of a permanency without progression the persians are a superior race they have a history and a literature they were always considered by the greeks as quite distinct from the other barbarians the afghans are a remarkable people they have a sort of republic europeans and orientalists may be well represented by two figures standing back to back the latter looking to the east that is backwards the former looking westward or forwards  footnote 1 see this position stated and illustrated in detail in mr coleridges work on the constitution of the church and

and with the reasons and what is more with the causes of it i still wonder that this particular treatise has not been more noticed first because it is a little book secondly because it is or at least nineteentwentieths of it are written in a popular style and thirdly because it is the only work that i know or have ever heard mentioned that even attempts a solution of the difficulty in which an ingenious enemy of the church of england may easily involve most of its modern defenders in parliament or through the press upon their own principles and admissions mr coleridge himself prized this little work highly although he admitted its incompleteness as a compositionbut i dont care a rush about it he said to me as an author the saving distinctions are plainly stated in it and i am sure nothing is wanted to make them tell but that some kind friend should steal them from their obscure hidingplace and just tumble them down before the public as his owned

which is also the definition of a shadow therefore a vulgar ghost and a shadow would be the same because two different things cannot properly have the same definition a visible substance without susceptibility of impact i maintain to be an absurdity    unless there be an external substance the bodily eye cannot see it therefore in all such cases that which is supposed to be seen is in fact not seen but is an image of the brain external objects naturally produce sensation but here in truth sensation produces as it were the external object in certain states of the nerves however i do believe that the eye although not consciously so directed may by a slight convulsion see a portion of the body as if opposite to it the part actually seen will by common association seem the whole and the whole body will then constitute an external object which explains many stories of persons seeing themselves lying dead bishop berkeley once experienced this he had the presence of mind to ring the bell and feel his pulse keeping his eye still fixed on his own figure right opposite to him he was in a high fever and the brain image died away as the door opened i observed something very like it once at grasmere and was so conscious of the cause that i told a person what i was experiencing whilst the image still remained  of course if the vulgar ghost be really a shadow there must be some substance of which it is the shadow these visible and intangible shadows without substances to cause them are absurd    january 4 1828  character of the age for logicplato and xenophongreek drama

deductions are almost always legitimate whereas in the writings of the present day the premisses are commonly sound but the conclusions false i think a great deal of commendation is due to the university of oxford for preserving the study of logic in the schools it is a great mistake to suppose geometry any substitute for it                                       negatively there may be more of the philosophy of socrates in the memorabilia of xenophon than in plato that is there is less of what does not belong to socrates but the general spirit of and impression left by plato are more socratic1  footnote 1 see p 26 mr coleridge meant in both these passages that xenophon had preserved the most of the man socrates that he was the best boswell and that socrates as a persona dialogi was little more than a poetical phantom in platos hands on the other hand he says that plato is more socratic that is more of a philosopher in the socratic mode of reasoning cicero calls the platonic writings generally socratici libri and mr c also says that in the metaphysical disquisitions plato is pythagorean meaning that he worked on the supposed ideal or transcendental principles of the

his epistlesto prove the divinity and also the actual human nature and bodily suffering of jesus christthat he was god and man the notion that the effusion of blood and water from the saviours side was intended to prove the real death of the sufferer originated i believe with some modern germans and seems to me ridiculous there is indeed a very small quantity of water occasionally in the præcordia but in the pleura where wounds are not generally mortal there is a great deal st john did not mean i apprehend to insinuate that the spearthrust made the death merely as such certain or evident but that the effusion showed the human nature i saw it he would say with my own eyes it was real blood composed of lymph and crassamentum and not a mere celestial ichor as the phantasmists allege                                       i think the verse of the three witnesses 1 john v 7 spurious not only because the balance of external authority is against it as porson seems to have shown but also because in my way of looking at it it spoils the reasoning                                       st johns logic is oriental and consists chiefly in position and parallel whilst st paul displays all the intricacies of the greek system                                       whatever may be thought of the genuineness or authority of any part of the book of daniel it makes no difference in my belief in christianity for christianity is within a man even as he is a being gifted with reason it is associated with your mothers chair and with the firstremembered tones of her blessed voice                                       i do not believe st paul to be the author of the epistle to the hebrews luthers conjecture is very probable that it was by apollos an alexandrian jew the plan is too studiously regular for st paul it was evidently written during the yet existing glories of the temple for three hundred years the church did not affix st pauls name to it but its apostolical or catholic character independently of its genuineness as to st paul was never much doubted                                       the first three gospels show the history that is the fulfilment of the prophecies in the facts st john declares explicitly the doctrine oracularly and without comment because being pure reason it can only be proved by itself for christianity proves itself as the sun is seen by its own light its evidence is involved in its existence st paul writes more particularly for the dialectic understanding and proves those doctrines which were capable of such proof by common logic                                       st john used the term greek ho logos technically philojudæus had so used it several years before the probable date of the composition of this gospel and it was commonly understood amongst the jewish rabbis at that time and afterwards of the manifested god                                       our translators unfortunately as i think render the clause greek pros ton theos with god that would be right if the greek were greek syn to theo1  by the preposition greek pros in this place is meant the utmost possible proximity without confusion likeness without sameness the jewish church understood the messiah to be a divine person philo expressly cautions against any ones supposing the logos to be a mere personification or symbol he says the logos is a substantial self existent being the gnostics as they were afterwards called were a kind of arians and thought the logos was an afterbirth they placed greek abyssos and greek sigae the abyss and silence before him therefore it was that st john said with emphasis greek en archae aen ho logos in the beginning was the word he was begotten in the first simultaneous burst of godhead if such an expression may be pardoned in speaking of eternal existence  footnote 1 john ch i v 1 2                                       the understanding suggests the materials of reasoning the reason decides upon them the first can only saythis is or ought to be so the last saysit must be so1  footnote 1 i have preserved this and several other equivalent remarks out of a dutiful wish to popularize by all the honest means in my power this fundamental distinction a thorough mastery of which mr coleridge considered necessary to any sound system of psychology and in the denial or neglect of which he delighted to point out the source of most of the vulgar errors in philosophy and religion the distinction itself is implied throughout almost all mr cs works whether in verse or prose but it may be

mackintosh said to me thats a very extraordinary young man but he is gone wrong on some points but davy was at that time at least a man of genius and i doubt if mackintosh ever heartily appreciated an

till glasgow and paisley became great manufacturing places and then people said we must subscribe for the poor or else we shall have poorlaws that is to say they enacted for themselves a poorlaw in order to avoid having a poorlaw enacted for them it is absurd to talk of queen elizabeths act as creating the poorlaws of this country the poorrates are the consideration paid by or on behalf of capitalists for having labour at demand it is the price and nothing else the hardship consists in the agricultural interest having to pay an undue proportion of the rates for although perhaps in the

of the whigsreform of the house of commons   the conduct of the whigs is extravagantly inconsistent it originated in the fatal error which fox committed in persisting after the first three years of the french revolution when every shadow of freedom in france had vanished in eulogizing the men and measures of that shallowhearted people so he went on gradually further and further departing from all the principles of english policy and wisdom till at length he became the panegyrist through thick and thin of a military frenzy under the influence of which the very name of liberty was detested and thus it was that in course of time foxs party became the absolute abettors of the buonapartean invasion of spain and did all in their power to thwart the generous efforts of this country to resist it now when the invasion is by a bourbon and the cause of the spanish nation neither united nor indeed sound in many respects the whigs would precipitate this country into a crusade to fight up the cause of a faction  i have the honour of being slightly known to my lord darnley in 18089 i met him accidentally when after a few words of salutation he said to me are you mad mr coleridgenot that i know my lord i replied what have i done which argues any derangement of mindwhy i mean said he those letters of yours in the courier on the hopes and fears of a people invaded by foreign armies the spaniards are absolutely conquered it is absurd to talk of their chance of resistingvery well my lord i said we shall see but will your lordship permit me in the course of a year or two to retort your question upon you if i should have grounds for so doingcertainly said he that is fair two years afterwards when affairs were altered in spain i met lord darnley again and after some conversation ventured to say to him does your lordship recollect giving me leave to retort a certain question upon you about the spaniards who is mad nowvery true very true mr coleridge cried he you are right it is very extraordinary it was a very happy and hold guess upon which i remarked i think guess is hardly a fair term for has any thing happened that has happened from any other causes or under any other conditions than such as i laid down beforehand lord darnley who was always very courteous to me took this with a pleasant nod of his head                                       many votes are given for

we can prove that we hold the doctrines of the primitive church for the first three hundred years the council of trent made the papists what they are 1 a foreign romish bishop has declared that the protestants of his acquaintance were more like what he conceived the enlightened catholics to have been before the council of trent than the best of the latter in his days perhaps you will say this bishop was not a good catholic2 i cannot answer for that the course of christianity and the christian church may not unaptly be likened to a mighty river which filled a wide channel and bore along with its waters mud and gravel and weeds till it met a great rock in the middle of its stream by some means or other the water flows purely and separated from the filth in a deeper and narrower course on one side of the rock and the refuse of the dirt and troubled water goes off on the other in a broader current and then cries out we are the river  footnote 1 see aids to reflection p 180 note

call them catholics will you not i answered that i would not for i would not tell a lie upon any much less upon so solemn an occasion the adherents of the church of rome i repeat are not catholic christians if they are then it follows that we protestants are heretics and schismatics as indeed the papists very logically from their own premisses call us and roman catholics makes no difference catholicism is not capable of degrees or local apportionments there can be but one body of catholics ex vi termini to talk strictly of irish or scotch roman catholics is a mere absurdity

certain hands is capable of being made so flattering to the passions and selfdelusion of men that it is impossible to say how far it would spread amongst the higher orders of society especially if the secular disadvantages now attending its profession were removed1  footnote 1 here at least the prophecy has been fulfilled the wisdom of our ancestors in the reign of king william iii would have been jealous of the daily increase in the numbers of the romish church in england of which every attentive observer must be aware see sancti dominici pallium in vol ii p 80 of mr coleridges poemsed    april 30 1823  zendavestapantheism and idolatry   the zendavesta must i think have been copied in parts from the writings of moses in the description of the creation the first chapter of genesis is taken almost literally except that the sun is created before the light and then the herbs and the plants after the sun which are precisely the two points they did not understand and therefore altered as errors1  there are only two acts of creation properly so called in the mosaic accountthe material universe and man the intermediate acts seem more as the results of secondary causes or at any rate of a modification of prepared materials  footnote 1 the zend or zendavesta is the sacred book ascribed to zoroaster or zerdusht the founder or reformer of the magian religion the modern edition or

endorsocinianism   there is a great difference in the credibility to be attached to stories of dreams and stories of ghosts dreams have nothing in them which are absurd and nonsensical and though most of the coincidences may be readily explained by the diseased system of the dreamer and the great and surprising power of association yet it is impossible to say whether an inner sense does not really exist in the mind seldom developed indeed but which may have a power of presentiment 1  all the external senses have their correspondents in the mind the eye can see an object before it is distinctly apprehendedwhy may there not be a corresponding power in the soul the power of prophecy might have been merely a spiritual excitation of this dormant faculty hence you will observe that the hebrew seers sometimes seem to have required music as in the instance of elisha before jehorambut now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him 2 every thing in nature has a tendency to move in cycles and it would be a miracle if out of such myriads of cycles moving concurrently some coincidences did not take place no doubt many such take place in the daytime but then our senses drive out the remembrance of them and render the impression hardly felt but when we sleep the mind acts without interruption terror and the heated imagination will even in the daytime create all sorts of features shapes and colours out of a simple object possessing none of them in reality  but ghost stories are absurd whenever a real ghost appearsby which i mean some man or woman dressed up to frighten anotherif the supernatural character of the apparition has been for a moment believed the effects on the spectator have always been most terribleconvulsion idiocy madness or even death on the spot consider the awful descriptions in the old testament of the effects of a spiritual presence on the prophets and seers of the hebrews the terror the exceeding great dread the utter loss of all animal power but in our common ghost stories you always find that the seer after a most appalling apparition as you are to believe is quite well the next day perhaps he may have a headach but that is the outside of the effect produced alston a man of genius and the best painter yet produced by america when he was in england told me an anecdote which confirms what i have been saying it was i think in the university of cambridge near boston that a certain youth took it into his wise head to endeavour to convert a tompainish companion of his by appearing as a ghost before him he accordingly dressed himself up in the usual way having previously extracted the ball from the pistol which always lay near the head of his friends bed upon first awaking and seeing the apparition the youth who was to be frightened a very coolly looked his companion the ghost in the face and said i know you this is a good joke but you see i am not frightened now you may vanish the ghost stood still come said a that is enough i shall get angry away still the ghost moved not by  ejaculated a if you do not in three minutes go away ill shoot you he waited the time deliberately levelled the pistol fired and with a scream at the immobility of the figure became convulsed and afterwards died the very instant he believed it to be a ghost his human nature fell before it  footnote 1 see this point suggested and reasoned with extraordinary subtlety in the third essay marked c in the appendix to the statesmans manual or first lay sermon p 19 c one beautiful paragraph i will venture to quote not only may we expect that men of strong religious feelings but little religious knowledge will occasionally be tempted to regard such occurrences as supernatural visitations but it ought not to surprise us if such dreams should sometimes be confirmed by the event as though they had actually possessed a character of divination for who shall decide how far a perfect reminiscence of past experiences of many perhaps that had escaped our reflex consciousness at the timewho shall determine to what extent this reproductive imagination unsophisticated by the will and undistracted by intrusions from the senses may or may not be concentred and sublimed into foresight and presentiment there would be nothing herein either to foster superstition on the one hand or to justify contemptuous disbelief on the other incredulity is but credulity seen from behind bowing and nodding assent to the habitual and the fashionableed  footnote 2 2 kings iii 15 and see

dined with us and several men came to meet him i have heard him more brilliant but he was very fine and delighted every one very much it is impossible to carry off or commit to paper his long trains of argument indeed it is not always possible to understand them he lays the foundation so deep and views every question in so original a manner nothing can be finer than the principles which he lays down in morals and religion his deep study of scripture is very astonishing the rest of the party were but as children in his hands not merely in general views of theology but in nice verbal criticism he thinks it clear that st paul did not write the epistle to the hebrews but that it must have been the work of some alexandrian greek and he thinks apollos it seemed to him a desirable thing for christianity that it should have been written by some other person than st paul because its inspiration being unquestioned it added another independent teacher and expounder of the faith  we fell upon ghosts and he exposed many of the stories physically and metaphysically he seemed to think it impossible that you should really see with the bodily eye what was impalpable unless it were a shadow and if what you fancied you saw with the bodily eye was in fact only an impression on the imagination then you were seeing something out of your senses and your testimony was full of uncertainty he observed how uniformly in all the bestattested stories of spectres the appearance might be accounted for from the disturbed state of the mind or body of the seer as in the instances of dion and brutus upon some ones saying that he wished to believe these stories true thinking that they constituted a useful subsidiary testimony of another state of existence mr c differed and said he thought it a dangerous testimony and one not wanted it was saul with the scriptures and the prophet before him calling upon the witch of endor to certify him of the truth he explained very ingeniously yet very naturally what has often startled people in ghost storiessuch as lord lytteltonsnamely that when a real person has appeared habited like the phantom the ghostseer has immediately seen two the real man and the phantom he said that such must be the case the man under the morbid delusion sees with the eye of the imagination and sees with the bodily eye too if no one were really present he would see the spectre with one and the bedcurtains with the other when therefore a real person comes he sees the real man as he would have seen any one else in the same place and he sees the spectre not a whit the less being perceptible by different powers of vision so to say the appearances do not interfere with each other  he told us the following story of the phantom portrait 1  a stranger came recommended to a merchants house at lubeck he was hospitably received but the house being full he was lodged at night in an apartment handsomely furnished but not often used there was nothing that struck him particularly in the room when left alone till he happened to cast his eyes on a picture which immediately arrested his attention it was a single head but there was something so uncommon so frightful and unearthly in its expression though by no means ugly that he found himself irresistibly attracted to look at it in fact he could not tear himself from the fascination of this portrait till his imagination was filled by it and his rest broken he retired to bed dreamed and awoke from time to time with the head glaring on him in the morning his host saw by his looks that he had slept ill and inquired the cause which was told the master of the house was much vexed and said that the picture ought to have been removed that it was an oversight and that it always was removed when the chamber was used the picture he said was indeed terrible to every one but it was so fine and had come into the family in so curious a way that he could not make up his mind to part with it or to destroy it the story of it was thismy father said he was at hamburgh on business and whilst dining at a coffeehouse he observed a young man of a remarkable appearance enter seat himself alone in a corner and commence a solitary meal his countenance bespoke the extreme of mental distress and every now and then he turned his head quickly round as if he heard something then shudder grow pale and go on with his meal after an effort as before my father saw this same man at the same place for two or three successive days and at length became so much interested about him that he spoke to him the address was not repulsed and the stranger seemed to find some comfort in the tone of sympathy and kindness which my father used he was an italian well informed poor but not destitute and living economically upon the profits of his art as a painter their intimacy increased and at length the italian seeing my fathers involuntary emotion at his convulsive turnings and shuddering which continued as formerly interrupting their conversation from time to time told him his story he was a native of rome and had lived in some familiarity with and been much patronized by a young nobleman but upon some slight occasion they had fallen out and his patron besides using many reproachful expressions had struck him the painter brooded over the disgrace of the blow he could not challenge the nobleman on account of his rank he therefore watched for an opportunity and assassinated him of course he fled from his country and finally had reached hamburgh he had not however passed many weeks from the night of the murder before one day in the crowded street he heard his name called by a voice familiar to him he turned short round and saw the face of his victim looking at him with a fixed eye from that moment he had no peace at all hours in all places and amidst all companies however engaged he might be he heard the voice and could never help looking round and whenever he so looked round he always encountered the same face staring close upon him at last in a mood of desperation he had fixed himself face to face and eye to eye and deliberately drawn the phantom visage as it glared upon him and this was the picture so drawn the italian said he had struggled long but life was a burden which he could now no longer bear and he was resolved when he had made money enough to return to rome to surrender himself to justice and expiate his crime on the scaffold he gave the finished picture to my father in return for the kindness which he had shown to him  footnote 1 this is the story which mr washington irving has dressed up very prettily in the first volume of his tales of a traveller pp 84119 professing in his preface that he could not remember whence he had derived the anecdoteed                                       i have no doubt that the jews believed generally in a future state independently of the mosaic law the story of the witch of endor is a proof of it what we translate witch or familiar spirit is in the hebrew ob that is a bottle or bladder and means a person whose belly is swelled like a leathern bottle by divine inflation in the greek it is greek engastrimuthos a ventriloquist the text 1 sam ch xxviii is a simple record of the facts the solution of which the sacred historian leaves to the reader i take it to have been a trick of ventriloquism got up by the courtiers and friends of saul to prevent him if possible from hazarding an engagement with an army despondent and oppressed with bodings of defeat saul is not said to have seen samuel the woman only pretends to see him and then what does this samuel do he merely repeats the prophecy known to all israel which the true samuel had uttered some years before read captain lyons account of the scene in the cabin with the esquimaux bladder or conjurer it is impossible not to be reminded of the witch of endor i recommend you also to look at websters admirable treatise on witchcraft                                       the pet texts of a socinian are quite enough for his confutation with acute thinkers if christ had been a mere man it would have been ridiculous in him to call himself the son of man but being god and man it then became in his own assumption of it a peculiar and mysterious title so if christ had been a mere man his saying my father is greater than i john xv 28 would have been as unmeaning it would be laughable enough for example to hear me say my remorse succeeded indeed but shakspeare is a greater dramatist than i but how immeasurably more foolish more monstrous would it not be for a man however honest good or wise to say but jehovah is greater than i    may 8 1824  plato and xenophonreligions of the greeksegyptian antiquities miltonvirgil   platos works are logical exercises for the mind little that is positive is advanced in them socrates may be fairly represented by plato in the more moral parts but in all the metaphysical disquisitions it is pythagoras xenophons representation of his master is quite different1  footnote 1 see p 9 ned                                       observe the remarkable contrast between the religion of the tragic and other poets of greece the former are always opposed in heart to the popular divinities in fact there are the popular the sacerdotal and the mysterious religions of greece represented roughly by homer pindar and Æschylus the ancients had no notion of a fall of man though they had of his gradual degeneracy prometheus in the old mythus and for the most part in aeschylus is the redeemer and the devil jumbled together                                       i cannot say i expect much from mere egyptian antiquities almost every thing really that is intellectually great in that country seems to me of grecian origin                                       i think nothing can be added to miltons definition or rule of poetry that it ought to be simple sensuous and impassioned that is to say single in conception abounding in sensible images and informing them all with the spirit of the mind  miltons latin style is i think better and easier than his english his style in prose is quite as

referred in this manner to an actual miracle i think it absurd to attribute so much to the deluge an inundation which left an olivetree standing and bore up the ark peacefully on its bosom could scarcely have been the sole cause of the rents and dislocations observable on the face of the earth how could the tropical animals which have been discovered in england and in russia in a perfectly natural state have been transported thither by such a flood those animals must evidently have been natives of the countries in which they have been found the climates must have been altered assume a sudden evaporation upon the retiring of the deluge to have caused an intense cold the solar heat might not be sufficient afterwards to overcome it i do not think that the polar cold is adequately explained by mere comparative distance from the sun                                       you will observe that there is no mention of rain previously to the deluge hence it may be inferred that the rainbow was exhibited for the first time after gods covenant with noah however i only suggest this                                       the earth with its scarred face is the symbol of the past the

they can throw themselves forth in natural liberty we have no adequate conception of the perfection of the ancient tragic dance the pleasure which the greeks received from it had for its basis difference and the more unfit the vehicle the more lively was the curiosity and intense the delight at seeing the difficulty overcome                                       the ancients certainly seem to have understood some principles in acoustics which we have lost or at least they applied them better they contrived to convey the voice distinctly in their huge theatres by means of pipes which created no echo or confusion our theatresdrury lane and covent gardenare fit for nothing they are too large for acting and too small for a bullfight                                       june 7 1824

prize good versification  footnote 1 how well i remember this midsummerday i shall never pass such another the sun was setting behind caen wood and the calm of the evening was so exceedingly deep that it arrested mr coleridges attention we were alone together in mr gillmans drawingroom and mr c left off talking and fell into an almost trancelike state for ten minutes whilst contemplating the beautiful prospect before us his eyes swam in tears his head inclined a little forward and there was a slight uplifting of the fingers which seemed to tell me that he was in prayer i was awestricken and remained absorbed in looking at the man in forgetfulness of external nature when he recovered himself and after a word or two fell by some secret link of association upon spensers poetry upon my telling him that i did not very well recollect the prothalamion then i must read you a bit of it said he and fetching the book from the next room he recited the whole of it in his finest and most musical manner i particularly bear in mind the sensible diversity of tone and rhythm with which he gave    sweet thames run softly till i end my song  the concluding line of each of the ten strophes

magnetized that i could not for two or three days afterwards reflect enough to put any thing on papered                                       i have often told you that i do not think there is any jealousy properly so called in the character of othello there is no predisposition to suspicion which i take to be an essential term in the definition of the word desdemona very truly told emilia that he was not jealous that is of a jealous habit and he says so as truly of himself iagos suggestions you see are quite new to him they do not correspond with any thing of a like nature previously in his mind if desdemona had in fact been guilty no one would have thought of calling othellos conduct that of a jealous man he could not act otherwise than he did with the lights he had whereas jealousy can never be strictly right see how utterly unlike othello is to leontes in the winters tale or even to leonatus in cymbeline the jealousy of the first proceeds from an evident trifle and something like hatred is mingled with it and the conduct of leonatus in accepting the wager and exposing his wife to the trial denotes a jealous temper already formed                                       hamlets character is the prevalence of the abstracting and generalizing habit over the practical he does not want courage skill will or opportunity but every incident sets him thinking and it is curious and at the same time strictly natural that hamlet who all the play seems reason itself should he impelled at last by mere accident to effect his object i have a smack of hamlet myself if i may say so                                       a maxim is a conclusion upon observation of matters of fact and is merely retrospective an idea or if you like a principle carries knowledge within itself and is prospective polonius is a man of maxims whilst he is descanting on matters of past experience as in that excellent speech to laertes before he sets out on his travels he is admirable but when he comes to advise or project he is a mere dotard 1 you see hamlet as the man of ideas despises him  footnote 1 act i sc 3                                        a man of maxims only is like a cyclops with one

her reserve and coyness fancies there are some listeners and then to sustain his part breaks out into all that coarseness  love is the admiration and cherishing of the amiable qualities of the beloved

coleridge was a great master in the art of love but he had not studied in ovids school hear his account of the matter  love truly such is itself not the most common thing in the world and mutual love still less so but that enduring personal attachment so beautifully delineated by erins sweet melodist and still more touchingly perhaps in the wellknown ballad john anderson my jo john in addition to a depth and constancy of character of no everyday occurrence supposes a peculiar sensibility and tenderness of nature a constitutional communicativeness and utterancy of heart and soul a delight in the detail of sympathy in the outward and visible signs of the sacrament withinto count as it were the pulses of the life of love but above all it supposes a soul which even in the pride and summertide of life even in the lustihood of health and strength had felt oftenest and prized highest that which age cannot take away and which in all our lovings is the love i mean that willing sense of the unsufficingness of the self for itself which predisposes a generous nature to see in the total being of another the supplement and completion of its own that quiet perpetual seeking which the presence of the beloved object modulates not suspends where the heart momently finds and finding again seeks on lastly when lifes changeful orb has passed the full a confirmed faith in the nobleness of humanity thus brought home and pressed as it were to the very bosom of hourly experience it supposes i say a heartfelt reverence for worth not the less deep because divested of its solemnity by habit by familiarity by mutual infirmities and even by a feeling of modesty which will arise in delicate minds when they are conscious of possessing the same or the correspondent excellence in their own characters in short there must be a mind which while it feels the beautiful and the excellent in the beloved as its own and by right of love appropriates it can call goodness its playfellow and dares make sport of time and infirmity while in the person of a thousandfoldly endeared partner we feel for aged virtue the caressing fondness that belongs to the innocence of childhood and repeat the same attentions and tender courtesies which had been dictated by the same affection to the same object when attired in feminine loveliness or in manly beauty poetical works vol ii p 120ed  measure for

strong but a dim one of the relation of place i remember the man or the tree but where i saw them i mostly forget1  footnote 1 there was no man whose opinion in morals or even in a matter of general conduct in life if you furnished the pertinent circumstances i would have sooner adopted than mr coleridges but i would not take him as a guide through streets or fields or earthly roads he had much of the geometrician about him but he could not find his way in this as in many other peculiarities of more importance he inherited strongly from his learned and excellent father who deserves and will i trust obtain a separate notice for himself when his greater sons life comes to be written i believe the beginning of mr cs liking for dr spurzheim was the hearty good humour with which the doctor bore the laughter of a party in the presence of which he unknowing of his man denied any ideality and awarded an unusual share of locality to the majestic silverhaired head of my dear uncle and fatherinlaw but mr coleridge immediately shielded the craniologist under the distinction preserved in the text and perhaps since that time there may be a couple of organs assigned to the latter facultyed                                       craniology is worth some consideration although it is merely in its rudiments and guesses yet but all the coincidences which have been observed could scarcely be by accident the confusion and absurdity however will be endless until some names or proper terms are discovered for the organs which are not taken from their mental application or significancy the forepart of the head is generally given up to the higher intellectual powers the hinder part to the sensual emotions                                       silence does not always mark wisdom i was at dinner some time ago in company with a man who listened to me and said nothing for a long time but he nodded his head and i thought him intelligent at length towards the end of the dinner some apple dumplings were placed on the table and my man had no sooner seen them than he burst forth withthems the jockies for me i wish spurzheim could have examined the fellows head

alterity 3 community you may express the formula thus  god the absolute will or identity  prothesis the father  thesis the son  antithesis the spirit  synthesis  footnote 1 mr coleridges admiration of bull and waterland as high theologians was very great bull he used to read in the latin defensio fidei nicaenae using the jesuit zolas edition of 1784 which i think he bought at rome he told me once that when he was reading a protestant english bishops work on the trinity in a copy edited by an italian jesuit in italy he felt proud of the church of england and in good humour with the church of romeed                                       the author of the athanasian creed is unknown it is in my judgment heretical in the omission or implicit denial of the filial subordination in the godhead which is the doctrine of the nicene creed and for which bull and waterland have so fervently and triumphantly contended and by not holding to which sherlock staggered to and fro between tritheism and sabellianism this creed is also tautological and if not persecuting which i will not discuss certainly containing harsh and illconceived language                                       how much i regret that so many religious persons of the present day think it necessary to adopt a certain cant of manner and phraseology as a token to each other they must improve this and that text and they must do so and so in a prayerful way and so on why not use common language a young lady the other day urged upon me that such and such feelings were the marrow of all religion upon which i recommended her to try to walk to london upon her marrowbones only                                       july 9 1827  scale of animal being   in the very lowest link in the vast and mysterious chain of being there is an effort although scarcely apparent at individualization but it is almost lost in the mere nature a little higher up the individual is apparent and separate but subordinate to any thing in man at length the animal rises to be on a par with the lowest power of the human nature there are some of our natural desires which only remain in our most perfect state on earth as means of the higher powers acting1  footnote 1 these remarks seem to call for a citation of that wonderful passage transcendant alike in eloquence and philosophic depth which the readers of the aids to reflection have long since laid up in cedar  every rank of creatures as it ascends in the scale of creation leaves death behind it or under it the metal at its height of being seems a mute prophecy of the coming vegetation into a mimic semblance of which it crystallizes the blossom and flower the acme of vegetable life divides into correspondent organs with reciprocal functions and by instinctive motions and approximations seems impatient of that fixture by which it is differenced in kind from the flowershaped psyche that flutters with free wing above it and wonderfully in the insect realm doth the irritability the proper seat of instinct while yet the nascent sensibility is subordinate theretomost wonderfully i say doth the muscular life in the insect and the musculoarterial in the bird imitate and typically rehearse the adaptive understanding yea and the moral affections and charities of man let us carry ourselves back in spirit to the mysterious week the teeming workdays of the creator as they rose in vision before the eye of the inspired historian of the generations of the heaven and earth in the days that the lord god made the earth and the heavens and who that hath watched their ways with an understanding heart could as the vision evolving still advanced towards him contemplate the filial and loyal bee the home building wedded and divorceless swallow and above all the manifoldly intelligent ant tribes with their commonwealth and confederacies their warriors and miners the husbandfolk that fold in their tiny flocks on the honied leaf and the virgin sisters with the holy instincts of maternal love detached and in selfless purity and not say to himself behold the shadow of approaching humanity the sun rising from behind in the kindling morn of creation thus all lower natures find their highest good in semblances and seekings of that which is higher and better all things strive to ascend and ascend in their striving and shall man alone stoop shall his pursuits and desires the reflections of his inward life be like the reflected image of a tree on the edge of a pool that grows downward and seeks a mock heaven in the unstable element beneath it in neighbourhood with the slim waterweeds and oozy bottomgrass that are yet better than itself and more noble in as far as substances that appear as shadows are preferable to shadows mistaken for substance no it must be a higher good to make you happy while you labour for any thing below your proper humanity you seek a happy life in the region of death well saith the moral poet

of colours   what is said of some persons not being able to distinguish colours i believe it may proceed from general weakness which will render the differences imperceptible just as the dusk or

cowardliness and impolicy of the nonconformists at the restoration could have prevented a real reformation on a wider basis but the truth is by going over to breda with their stiff flatteries to the hollowhearted king they put sheldon and the bishops on the side of the constitution                                       the reformation in the sixteenth century narrowed reform as soon as men began

purpose of imbibing noble principles and at the same time of learning to exercise caution and thought in detecting his numerous errors                                       i must acknowledge with some hesitation that i think hooker has been a little overcredited for his judgment  take as an instance of an idea the continuity and coincident distinctness of nature or thisvegetable life is always striving to be something that it is not animal life to be itself1 hence in a plant the parts as the root the stem the branches leaves c remain after they have each produced or contributed to produce a different status of the whole plant in an animal nothing of the previous states remains distinct but is incorporated into and constitutes progressively the very self  footnote 1 the reader who has never studied plato bacon kant or coleridge in their philosophic works will need to be told that the word idea is not used in this passage in the sense adopted by dr holofernes who in a lecture on metaphysics delivered at one of the mechanics institutions explodes all ideas but those of sensation whilst his friend deputy costard has no idea of a betterflavoured haunch of venison than he dined off at the london tavern last week he admits for the deputy has travelled that the french have an excellent idea of cooking in general but holds that their most accomplished maîtres de cuisine have no more idea of dressing a turtle than the parisian gourmands themselves have any real idea of the true taste and colour of the fat church and state p 78 no what mr coleridge meant by an idea in this place may be expressed in various ways out of his own works i subjoin a sufficient definition from the church and state p 6 that which contemplated objectively that is as existing externally to the mind we call a law the same contemplated subjectively that is as existing in a subject or mind is an idea hence plato often names ideas laws and lord bacon the british plato describes the laws of the material universe as the ideas in nature quod in natura naturata lex in natura naturante idea dicitur a more subtle limitation of the word may be found in the last paragraph of essay e in the appendix to the statesmans manualed                                       to know any thing for certain is to have a clear insight into the inseparability of the predicate from the subject the matter from the

testamentmessiahjewsthe trinity  if the prophecies of the old testament are not rightly interpreted of jesus our christ then there is no prediction whatever contained in it of that stupendous eventthe rise and establishment of christianityin comparison with which all the preceding jewish history is as nothing with the exception of the book of daniel which the jews themselves never classed among the prophecies and an obscure text of jeremiah there is not a passage in all the old testament which favours the notion of a temporal messiah what moral object was there for which such a messiah should come what could he have been but a sort of virtuous sesostris or buonaparte                                       i know that some excellent menisraelites without guiledo not in fact expect the advent of any messiah but believe or suggest that it may possibly have been gods will and meaning that the jews should remain a quiet light among the nations for the purpose of pointing at the doctrine of the unity of god to which i say that this truth of the essential unity of god has been preserved and gloriously preached by christianity alone the romans never shut up their temples nor ceased to worship a hundred or a thousand gods and goddesses at the bidding of the jews the persians the hindus the chinese learned nothing of this great truth from the jews but from christians they did learn it in various degrees and are still learning it the religion of the jews is indeed a light but it is as the light of the glowworm which gives no heat and illumines nothing but itself                                        it has been objected to me that the vulgar notions of the trinity are at variance with this doctrine and it was added whether as flattery or sarcasm matters not that few believers in the trinity thought of it as i did to which again humbly yet confidently i reply that my superior light if superior consists in nothing more than thisthat i more clearly see that the doctrine of trinal unity is an absolute truth transcending my human means of understanding it or demonstrating it i may or may not be able to utter the formula of my faith in this mystery in more logical terms than some others but this i say go and ask the most ordinary man a professed believer in this doctrine whether he believes in and worships a plurality of gods and he will start with horror at the bare suggestion he may not be able to explain his creed in exact terms but he will tell you that he does believe in one god and in one god only reason about it as you may                                       what all the churches of the east and west what romanist and protestant believe in common that i call christianity in no proper sense of the word can i call unitarians and socinians believers in christ at least not in the only christ of whom i have read or know any thing   april 14 1830  conversion of the jewsjews in poland  there is no hope of converting the jews in the way and with the spirit unhappily adopted by our church and indeed by all other modern churches in the first age the jewish christians undoubtedly considered themselves as the seed of abraham to whom the promise had been made and as such a superior order witness the account of st peters conduct in the acts 1 and the epistle to the galatians2 st paul protested against this so far as it went to make jewish observances compulsory on christians who were not of jewish blood and so far as it in any way led to bottom the religion on the mosaic covenant of works but he never denied the birthright of the chosen seed on the contrary he himself evidently believed that the jews would ultimately be restored and he saysif the gentiles have been so blest by the rejection of the jews how much rather shall they be blest by the conversion and restoration of israel why do we expect the jews to abandon their national customs and distinctions the abyssinian church said that they claimed a descent from abraham and that in virtue of such ancestry they observed circumcision but declaring withal that they rejected the covenant of works and rested on the promise fulfilled in jesus christ in consequence of this appeal the abyssinians were permitted to retain their customs  if rhenferds essays were translatedif the jews were made acquainted with the real argumentif they were addressed kindly and were not required to abandon their distinctive customs and national type but were invited to become christians as of the seed of abrahami believe there would be a christian synagogue in a years time as it is the jews of the lower orders are the very lowest of mankind they have not a principle of honesty in them to grasp and be getting money for ever is their single and exclusive occupation a learned jew once said to me upon this subjecto sir make the inhabitants of hollywell street and dukes place israelites first and then we may debate about making them christians3  in poland the jews are great landholders and are the worst of tyrants they have no kind of sympathy with their labourers and dependants they never meet them in common worship land in the hand of a large number of jews instead of being what it ought to be the organ of permanence would become the organ of rigidity in a nation by their intermarriages within their own pale it would be in fact perpetually entailed then again if a popular tumult were to take place in poland who can doubt that the jews would be the first objects of murder and spoliation  footnote 1 chap xv  footnote 2  chap ii  footnote 3 mr coleridge had a very friendly acquaintance with several learned jews in this country and he told me that whenever he had fallen in with a jew of thorough education and literary habits he had always found him possessed of a strong natural capacity for metaphysical disquisitions i may mention here the best known of his jewish friends one whom he deeply respected hyman hurwitzed  april 17 1830   mosaic miraclespantheism  in the miracles of moses there is a remarkable intermingling of acts which we should nowadays call simply providential with such as we should still call miraculous the passing of the jordan in the 3d chapter of the book of joshua is perhaps the purest and sheerest miracle recorded in the bible it seems to have been wrought for the miracles sake and so thereby to show to the jewsthe descendants of those who had come out of egypt that the same god who had appeared to their fathers and who had by miracles in many respects providential only preserved them in the wilderness was their god also the manna and quails were ordinary provisions of providence rendered miraculous by certain laws and qualities annexed to them in the particular instance the passage of the red sea was effected by a strong wind which we are told drove hack the waters and so on but then again the death of the firstborn was purely miraculous hence then both jews and egyptians might take occasion to learn that it was one and the same god who interfered specially and who governed all generally                                       take away the first verse of the hook of genesis and then what immediately follows is an exact history or sketch of pantheism pantheism was taught in the mysteries of greece of which the samothracian or cabeiric were probably the purest and the most ancient     april 18 1830   poetic promise  in the present age it is next to impossible to predict from specimens however favourable that a young man will turn out a great poet or rather a poet at all poetic taste dexterity in composition and ingenious imitation often produce poems that are very promising in appearance but genius or the power of doing something new is another thing mr tennysons sonnets such as i have seen have many of the characteristic excellencies of those of wordsworth and southey    april 19 1830   it is a small thing that the patient knows of his own state yet some things he does know better than

right and both wrong they each maintained opposite poles of the same truth which truth neither of them saw for want of a higher premiss duns scotus was the head of the realists ockham1 his own disciple of the nominalists ockham though certainly very prolix is a most extraordinary writer  footnote 1 john duns scotus was born in 1274 at dunstone in the parish of emildune near alnwick he was a fellow of merton college and professor of divinity at oxford after acquiring an uncommon reputation at his own university he went to paris and thence to cologne and there died in 1308 at the early age of thirtyfour years he was called the subtle doctor and found time to compose works which now fill twelve volumes in folio see the lyons edition by luke wadding in 1639  william ockham was an englishman and died about 1347 but the place and year of his birth are not clearly ascertained he was styled the invincible doctor and wrote bitterly against pope john xxii we all remember butlers

irrefragable doctor was alexander hales a native of gloucestershire who died in 1245 amongst his pupils at paris was fidanza better known by the name of bonaventura the seraphic doctor the controversy of the realists and the nominalists cannot he explained in a note but in substance the original point of dispute may be thus stated the realists held generally with aristotle that there were universal ideas or essences impressed upon matter and covëal with and inherent in their objects plato held that these universal forms existed as exemplars in the divine mind previously to and independently of matter but both maintained under one shape or other the real existence of universal forms on the other hand zeno and the old stoics denied the existence of these universals and contended that they were no more than mere tenms and nominal representatives of their particular objects the nominalists were the followers of zeno and held that universal forms are merely modes of conception and exist solely in and for the mind it does not require much reflection to see how great an influence these different systems might have upon the enunciation of the higher doctrines of christianityed                                       it is remarkable that two thirds of the eminent schoolmen were of british birth it was the schoolmen who made the languages of europe what they now are we laugh at the quiddities of those writers now but in truth these quiddities are just the parts of their language which we have rejected whilst we never think of the mass which we have adopted and have in daily use

seems to have gained a glimpse of the truth in the last letter published in his works it appears that he began to suspect his premiss his unica substantia is in fact a mere notion a subject of the mind and no object at all                                       platos works are preparatory exercises for the mind he leads you to see that propositions involving in themselves contradictory conceptions are nevertheless true and which therefore must belong to a higher logic that of ideas they are contradictory only in the aristotelian logic which is the instrument of the understanding i have read most of the works of plato several times with profound attention but not all his writings in fact i soon found that i had read plato by anticipation he was a consummate genius1  footnote 1 this is the test and character of a truth so affirmed a truth of the reason an ideathat in its own proper form it is inconceivable for to conceive is a function of the understanding which can he exercised only on subjects subordinate thereto and yet to the forms of the understanding all truth must be reduced that is to be fixed as an object of reflection and to be rendered expressible and

darling book and the favourite of his library to its great and honoured author and donor  the coincidence throughout of all these methodist cases with those of the magnetists makes me wish for a solution that would apply to all now this sense or appearance of a sense of the distant both in time and space is common to almost all the magnetic patients in denmark germany france and north italy to many of whom the same or a similar solution could not apply likewise many cases have been recorded at the same time in different countries by men who had never heard of each others names and where the simultaneity of publication proves the independence of the testimony and among the magnetisers and attesters are to be found names of men whose competence in respect of integrity and incapability of intentional falsehood is fully equal to that of wesley and their competence in respect of physio and psychological insight and attainments incomparably greater who would dream indeed of comparing wesley with a cuvier hufeland blumenbach eschenmeyer reil c were i asked what i think my answer would bethat the evidence enforces scepticism and a non liquettoo strong and consentaneous for a candid mind to be satisfied of its falsehood or its solvibility on the supposition of imposture or casual coincidencetoo fugacious and unfixable to support any theory that supposes the always potential and under certain conditions and circumstances occasionally active existence of a correspondent faculty in the human soul and nothing less than such an hypothesis would be adequate to the satisfactory explanation of the factsthough that of a metastasis of specific functions of the nervous energy taken in conjunction with extreme nervous excitement plus some delusion plus some illusion plus some imposition plus some chance and accidental coincidence might determine the direction in which the scepticism should vibrate nine years has the subject of zoomagnetism been before me i have traced it

wakefulness that is to say lucid intervals during this sleep or recession of the spirit the lower or bestial states of life rise up into action and prominence it is an awful thing to be eternally tempted by the perverted senses the reason may resistit does resistfor a long time but too often at length it yields for a moment and the man is mad for ever an act of the will is in many instances

and he generally passed from it to a high commendation of miss austens novels as being in their way perfectly genuine and individual productionsed  footnote 2 this was a strong way of expressing a deeprooted feeling a better and a truer character would be that coleridge was a lover of the church and a defender of the faith this last expression is the utterance of a conviction so profound that

artificial you will be struck with the combinations of vivid greenery and water and building but every thing is so distinct and rememberable that you would not improve your conception by visiting the country a hundred times over it is interesting to see a country and a nature made as it were by man and to compare it with gods nature1  if you go remark indeed you will be forced to do so in spite of yourself remark i say the identity for it is more than proximity of a disgusting dirtiness in all that concerns the dignity of and reverence for the human person and a persecuting painted cleanliness in every thing connected with property you must not walk in their gardens nay you must hardly look into them  footnote 1 in the summer of 1828 mr coleridge made an excursion with mr wordsworth in holland flanders and up the rhine as far as bergen he came back delighted especially with his stay near bonn but with an abiding disgust at the filthy habits of the people upon cologne in particular

told me the most but he and all of them have a notable trick of passing siccissimis pedibus over the parts which puzzle a man of reflection  the walkerite creed or doctrine of the new church as it is called appears to be a miscellany of calvinism and quakerism but it is hard to understand it                                         may 7 1830  horne tookediversions of purleygender of the sun in german   horne tooke was preeminently a readywitted man he had that clearness which is founded on shallowness he doubted nothing and therefore gave you all that he himself knew or meant with great completeness his voice was very fine and his tones exquisitely discriminating his mind had no progression or developement all that is worth any thing and that is but little in the diversions of purley is contained in a short pamphletletter which he addressed to mr dunning then it was enlarged to an octavo hut there was not a foot of progression beyond the pamphlet at last a quarto volume 1 believe came out and yet verily excepting newspaper lampoons and political insinuations there was no addition to the argument of the pamphlet it shows a base and unpoetical mind to convert so beautiful so divine a subject as language into the vehicle or makeweight of political squibs all that is true in horne tookes book is taken from lennep who gave it for so much as it was worth and never pretended to make a system of it tooke affects to explain the origin and whole philosophy of language by what is in fact only a mere accident of the history of one language or one or two languages his abuse of harris is most shallow and unfair harris in the hermes was dealingnot very profoundly it is truewith the philosophy of language the moral physical and metaphysical causes and conditions of it c horne tooke in writing about the formation of words only thought he was explaining the philosophy of language which is a very different thing in point of fact he was very shallow in the gothic dialects i must say all that decantata fabula about the genders of the sun and moon in german seems to me great stuff originally i apprehend in the plattdeutsch of the north of germany there were only two definite articlesdie for masculine and feminine and das for neuter then it was die sonne in a masculine sense as we say with the same word as article the sun luther in constructing the hochdeutsch for really his miraculous and providential translation of the bible was the fundamental act of construction of the literary german took for his distinct masculine article the der of the oberdeutsch and thus constituted the three articles of the present high german der die das naturally therefore it would then have been der sonne but here the analogy of the greek grammar prevailed and as sonne had the arbitrary feminine termination of the greek it was left with its old article die which originally including masculine and feminine both had grown to designate the feminine only to the best of my recollection the minnesingers and all the old poets always use the sun as masculine and since luthers time the poets feel the awkwardness of the classical gender affixed to the sun so much that they more commonly introduce phoebus or some other synonyme instead i must acknowledge my doubts whether upon more accurate investigation it can be shown that there ever was a nation that considered the sun in itself and apart from language as the feminine power the moon does not so clearly demand a feminine as the sun does a masculine sex it might be considered negatively or neuteryet if the reception of its light from the sun were known that would have been a good reason for making her feminine as being the recipient body                                       as our the was the german die so i believe our that stood for das and was used as a neuter definite article  the plattdeutsch was a compact language like the english not admitting much agglutination the oberdeutsch was fuller and fonder of agglutinating words together although it was not so soft in its sounds    may 8 1830  horne tookejacobins   horne tooke said that his friends might if they pleased go as far as sloughhe should go no farther than hounslow but that was no reason why he should not keep them company so far as their roads were the same the answer is easy suppose you know or suspect that a man is about to commit a robbery at slough though you do not mean to be his accomplice have you a moral right to walk arm in arm with him to hounslow and by thus giving him your countenance prevent his being taken up the history of all the world tells us that immoral means will ever intercept good ends                                       enlist the interests of stern morality and religious enthusiasm in the cause of political liberty as in the time of the old puritans and it will be irresistible but the jacobins played the whole game of religion and morals and domestic happiness into the hands of the aristocrats thank god that they did so england was saved from civil war by their enormous their providential blundering                                       can a politician a statesman slight the feelings and the convictions of the whole matronage of his country the women are as influential upon such national interests as the men                                       horne tooke was always making a butt of mr godwin who nevertheless had that in him which tooke could never have understood i saw a good deal of tooke at one time he left upon me the impression of his being a keen iron man     may 9 1830  persian and arabic poetrymilesian tales   i must acknowledge i never could see much merit in the persian poetry which i have read in translation there is not a ray of imagination in it and but a glimmering of fancy it is in fact so far as i know deficient in truth poetry is certainly something more than good sense but it must be good sense at all events just as a palace is more than a house but it must be a house at least the arabian nights tales are a different thing they are delightful but i cannot help surmising that there is a good deal of greek fancy in them no doubt we have had a great loss in the milesian tales1 the book of job is pure arab poetry of the highest and most antique cast  think of the sublimity i should rather say the profundity of that passage in ezekiel 2son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest i know nothing like it   footnote 1 the milesiacs were so called because written or composed by aristides of miletus and also because the scene of all or most of them was placed in that rich and luxurious city harpocration cites the sixth book of this collection nothing i believe is now known of the age or history of this aristides except what may be inferred from the fact that lucius cornelius sisenna translated the tales into latin as we learn from ovid    junxit aristides milesia crimina secum  and afterwards    vertit aristidem sisenna nec obfuit illi   historiae turpes inseruisse jocos    fasti ii 412445  and also from the incident mentioned in the plutarchian life of crassus that after the defeat at carrhae a copy of the milesiacs of aristides was found in the baggage of a roman officer and that surena who by the by if history has not done him injustice was not a man to be over scrupulous in such a case caused the book to be brought into the senate house of seleucia and a portion of it read aloud for the purpose of insulting the romans who even during war he said could not abstain from the perusal of such infamous compositionsc 32 the immoral character of these tales therefore may be considered pretty clearly established they were the decameron and heptameron of antiquityed  footnote 2

intellectual grasp canning had a sense of the beautiful and the good  rarely speaks but to abuse detract and degrade i confine myself to institutions of course and do not mean personal detraction in my judgment no man can rightly apprehend an abuse till he has first mastered the idea of the use of an institution how fine for example is the idea of the unhired magistracy of england taking in and linking together the duke to the country gentleman in the primary distribution of justice or in the preservation of order and execution of law at least throughout the country yet some men never seem to have thought of it for one moment but as connected with brewers and barristers and tyrannical squire westerns from what i saw of homer i thought him a superior man in real intellectual greatness

shakspeare is the spinosistic deityan omnipresent creativeness milton is the deity of prescience he stands ab extra and drives a fiery chariot and four making the horses feel the iron curb which holds them in shakspeares poetry is characterless that is it does not reflect the individual shakspeare but john milton himself is in every line of the paradise lost shakspeares rhymed verses are excessively condensed epigrams with the point every where but in his blank dramatic verse he is diffused with a linked sweetness long drawn out no one can understand shakspeares superiority fully until he has ascertained by comparison all that which he possessed in common with several other great dramatists of his age and has then calculated the surplus which is entirely shakspeares own his rhythm is so perfect that you may be almost sure that you do not understand the real force of a line if it does not run well as you read it the necessary mental pause after every hemistich or imperfect line is always equal to the time that would have been taken in reading the complete verse                                       i have no doubt whatever that homer is a mere concrete name for the rhapsodies of the iliad1 of course there was a homer and twenty besides i will engage to compile twelve books with characters just as distinct and consistent as those in the iliad from the metrical ballads and other chronicles of england about arthur and the knights of the round table i say nothing about moral dignity but the mere consistency of character the different qualities were traditional tristram is always courteous lancelot invincible and so on the same might be done with the spanish romances of the cid there is no subjectivity whatever in the homeric poetry there is a subjectivity of the poet as of milton who is himself before himself in everything he writes and there is a subjectivity of the persona or dramatic character as in all shakspeares great creations hamlet lear c  footnote 1 mr coleridge was a decided wolfian in the homeric question but he had never read a word of the famous prolegomena and knew nothing of wolfs reasoning but what i told him of it in conversation mr c informed me that he adopted the conclusion contained in the text upon the first perusal of vicos scienza nuova not he said that vico has reasoned it out with such learning and accuracy as you report of wolf but vico struck out all the leading hints and i soon filled up the rest out of my own head ed    may 14 1830  reason and understandingwords and names of things   until

whilst the endless discrepancies between the names of things is very well deserving notice there are nearly a hundred names in the different german dialects for the aldertree i believe many more

tritheismnay rather in terms tridaemonism his opinion about the sinfulness of the humanity of our lord is absurd if considered in one point of view for body is not carcass how can there be a sinful carcass but what he says is capable of a sounder interpretation irving caught many things from me but he would never attend to any thing which he thought he could not use in the pulpit i told him the certain consequence would be that he would fall into grievous errors sometimes he has five or six pages together of the purest eloquence and then an outbreak of almost madmans babble1  footnote 1 the admiration and sympathy which mr coleridge felt and expressed towards the late mr irving at his first appearance in london were great and sincere and his grief at the deplorable change which followed

and the other rhetorical fathers contributed a good deal by their rash use of figurative language to advance the superstitious notion of the eucharist but the beginning had been much earlier 1 in clement indeed the mystery is treated as it was treated by saint john and saint paul but in hermas we see the seeds of the error and more clearly in irenaeus and so it went on till the idea was changed into an idol  footnote 1 mr coleridge made these remarks upon my quoting seldens wellknown saying table talk that transubstantiation was nothing but rhetoric turned into logiced                                       the errors of the sacramentaries on the one hand and of the romanists on the other are equally great the first have volatilized the eucharist into a metaphor the last have condensed it into an idol  jeremy taylor in his zeal against transubstantiation contends that the latter part of the sixth chapter of st johns gospel has no reference to the eucharist if so st john wholly passes over this sacred mystery for he does not include it in his notice of the last supper would not a total silence of this great apostle and evangelist upon this mystery be strange a mystery i say for it is a mystery it is the only mystery in our religious worship when many of the disciples left our lord and apparently on the very ground that this saying was hard he does not attempt to detain them by any explanation but simply adds the comment that his words were spirit if he had really meant that the eucharist should he a mere commemorative celebration of his death is it conceivable that he would let these disciples go away from him upon such a gross misunderstanding would he not have said you need not make a difficulty i only mean so and so                                       arnauld and the other learned romanists are irresistible against the low sacramentary doctrine                                       the sacrament of baptism applies itself and has reference to the faith or conviction and is therefore only to be performed onceit is the light of man the sacrament of the eucharist is a symbol of all our religion it is the life of man it is commensurate with our will and we must therefore want it continually                                       the meaning of the expression greek ei me en soi didomenon anothen except it were given thee from above in the 19th chapter of st john ver 11 seems to me to have been generally and grossly mistaken it is commonly understood as importing that pilate could have no power to deliver jesus to the jews unless it had been given him by god which no doubt is true but if that is the meaning where is the force or connection of the following clause greek dia touto therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin in what respect were the jews more sinful in delivering jesus up because pilate could do nothing except by gods leave the explanation of erasmus and clarke and some others is very dry footed i conceive the meaning of our lord to have been simply this that pilate would have had no power or jurisdictiongreek exousianover him if it had not been given by the sanhedrin the greek ano boule and therefore it was that the jews had the greater sin there was also this further peculiar baseness and malignity in the conduct of the jews the mere assumption of messiahship as such was no crime in the eyes of the jews they hated jesus because he would not be their sort of messiah on the other hand the romans cared not for his declaration that he was the son of god the crime in their eyes was his assuming to be a king now here were the jews accusing jesus before the roman governor of that which in the first place they knew that jesus denied in the sense in which they urged it and which in the next place had the charge been true would have been so far from a crime in their eyes that the very gospel history itself as well as all the history to the destruction of jerusalem shows it would have been popular with the whole nation they wished to destroy him and for that purpose charge him falsely with a crime which yet was no crime in their own eyes if it had been true but only so as against the roman domination which they hated with all their souls and against which they were themselves continually conspiring                                       observe i pray the manner and sense in which the highpriest understands the plain declaration of our lord that he was the son of god footnote matt xxvi v 63 mark xiv 61 i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god or the son of the blessed as it is in mark jesus said i amand hereafter ye shall see the son of man or me sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven does caiaphas take this explicit answer as if jesus meant that he was full of gods spirit or was doing his commands or walking in his ways in which sense moses the prophets nay all good men were and are the sons of god no no he tears his robes in sunder and cries out he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy what blasphemy i should like to know unless the assuming to be the son of god was assuming to be of the divine nature                                       one striking proof of the genuineness of the mosaic books is thisthey contain precise prohibitionsby way of predicting the consequences of disobedienceof all those things which david and solomon actually did and gloried in doingraising cavalry making a treaty with egypt laying up treasure and polygamising now would such prohibitions have been fabricated in those kings reigns or afterwards impossible                                       the manner of the predictions of moses is very remarkable he is like a man standing on an eminence and addressing people below him and pointing to things which he can and they cannot see he does not say you will act in such and such a way and the consequences will be so and so but so and so will take place because you will act in such a way     may 21 1830  talent and geniusmotives and impulses   talent lying in the understanding is often inherited genius being the action of reason and imagination rarely or never                                       motives imply weakness and the existence of evil and temptation the angelic nature would act from impulse alone a due mean of motive and impulse is the only practicable object of our moral philosophy      may 23 1830   constitutional and functional lifehysteriahydrocarbonic gas bitters and tonicsspecific medicines   it is a great error in physiology not to distinguish between what may be called the general or fundamental lifethe principium vitae and the functional lifethe life in the functions organization must presuppose life as anterior to it without life there could not be or remain any organization but then there is also a life in the organs or functions distinct from the other thus a flute presupposesdemands the existence of a musician as anterior to it without whom no flute could ever have existed and yet again without the instrument there can be no music                                       it often happens that on the one hand the principium vitae or constitutional life may be affected without any or the least imaginable affection of the functions as in inoculation where one pustule only has appeared and no other perceptible symptom and yet this has so entered into the constitution as to indispose it to infection under the most accumulated and intense contagion and on the other hand hysteria hydrophobia and gout will disorder the functions to the most dreadful degree and yet often leave the life untouched in hydrophobia the mind is quite sound but the patient feels his muscular and cutaneous life forcibly removed from under the control of his will                                       hysteria may be fitly called mimosa from its counterfeiting so many diseaseseven death itself                                       hydrocarbonic gas produces the most deathlike exhaustion without any previous excitement i think this gas should be inhaled by way of experiment in cases of hydrophobia  there is a great difference between bitters and tonics where weakness proceeds from excess of irritability there bitters act beneficially because all bitters are poisons and operate by stilling and depressing and lethargizing the irritability but where weakness proceeds from the opposite cause of relaxation there tonics are good because they brace up and tighten the loosened string bracing is a correct metaphor bark goes near to be a combination of a bitter and a tonic but no perfect medical combination of the two properties is yet known                                       the study of specific medicines is too much disregarded now no doubt the hunting after specifics is a mark of ignorance and weakness in medicine yet the neglect of them is proof also of immaturity for in fact all medicines will be found specific in the perfection of the science     may 25 1830  epistles to the ephesians and colossiansoaths   the epistle to the ephesians is evidently a catholic epistle addressed to the whole of what might be called st pauls diocese it is one of the divinest compositions of man it embraces every doctrine of christianity first those doctrines peculiar to christianity and then those precepts common to it with natural religion the epistle to the colossians is the overflowing as it were of st pauls mind upon the same subject                                       the present system of taking oaths is horrible it is awfully absurd to make a man invoke gods wrath upon himself if he speaks false it is in my judgment a sin to do so the jews oath is an adjuration by the judge to the witness in the name of god i ask you there is an express instance of it in the highpriests adjuring or exorcising christ by the living god in the twentysixth chapter of matthew and you will observe that our lord answered the appeal1  you may depend upon it the more oathtaking

job   the book of job is an arab poem antecedent to the mosaic dispensation it represents the mind of a good man not enlightened by an actual revelation but seeking about for one in no other book is the desire and necessity for a mediator so intensely expressed the personality of god the i am of the hebrews is most vividly impressed on the book in opposition to pantheism                                       i now think after many doubts that the passage i know that my redeemer liveth c may fairly be taken as a burst of determination a quasi prophecy 1 i know not how this can be but in spite of all my difficulties this i do know that i shall be recompensed  footnote 1 chap xix 25 26                                       it should be observed that all the imagery in the speeches of the men is taken from the east and is no more than a mere representation of the forms of material nature but when god speaks the tone is exalted and almost all the images are taken from egypt the crocodile

satan    may 30 1830  translation of the psalms   i wish the psalms were translated afresh or rather that the present version were revised scores of passages are utterly incoherent as they now stand if the primary visual images had been oftener preserved the connection and force of the sentences would have been better perceived1  footnote 1 mr coleridge like so many of the elder divines of the christian church had an affectionate reverence for the moral and evangelical portion of the book of psalms he told me that after having studied every page of the bible with the deepest attention he had found no other part of scripture come home so closely to his inmost yearnings and necessities during many of his latter years he used to read ten or twelve verses every evening ascertaining for his knowledge of hebrew was enough for that the exact visual image or first radical meaning of every noun substantive and he repeatedly expressed to me his surprise and pleasure at finding that in nine cases out of ten the bare primary sense if literally rendered threw great additional light on the text he was not disposed to allow the prophetic or allusive character so largely as is done by horne and others but he acknowledged it in some instances in the fullest manner in particular he rejected the local and temporary reference which has been given to the 110th psalm and declared his belief in its deep mystical import with regard to the messiah mr c once gave me the following note upon the 22d psalm written by him i believe many years previously but which he said he approved at that time it will find as appropriate a niche here as any where else  i am much delighted and instructed by the hypothesis which i think probable that our lord in repeating eli eli lama sabacthani really recited the whole or a large part of the 22d psalm it is impossible to read that psalm without the liveliest feelings of love gratitude and sympathy it is indeed a wonderful prophecy whatever might or might not have been davids notion when he composed it whether christ did audibly repeat the whole or not it is certain i think that he did it mentally and said aloud what was sufficient to enable his followers to do the same even at this day to repeat in the same manner but the first line of a common hymn would be understood as a reference to the whole above all i am thankful for the thought which suggested itself to my mind whilst i was reading this beautiful psalm namely that we should not exclusively think of christ as the logos united to human nature but likewise as a perfect man united to the logos this distinction is most important in order to conceive much more appropriately to feel the conduct and exertions of jesused      may 31 1830  ancient marinerundinemartinpilgrims progress   mrs barbauld once told me that she admired the ancient mariner very much but that there were two faults in itit was improbable and had no moral as for the probability i owned that that might admit some question but as to the want of a moral i told her that in my own judgment the poem had too much and that the only or chief fault if i might say so was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination it ought to have had no more moral than the arabian nights tale of the merchants sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well and throwing the shells aside and lo a genie starts up and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant because one of the date shells had it seems put out the eye of the genies son1  i took the thought of grinning for joy in that poem from my companions remark to me when we had climbed to the top of plinlimmon and were nearly dead with thirst we could not speak from the constriction till we found a little puddle under a stone he said to meyou grinned like an idiot he had done the same  footnote 1 there he found at the foot of a great walnuttree a fountain of a very clear running water and alighting tied his horse to a branch of a tree and sitting clown by the fountain took some biscuits and dates out of his portmanteau and as he ate his dates threw the shells about on both sides of him when he had done eating being a good mussulman he washed his hands his face and his feet and said his prayers he had not made an end but was still on his knees when he saw a genie appear all white with age and of a monstrous bulk who advancing towards him with a cimetar in his hand spoke to him in a terrible voice thusrise up that i may kill thee with this cimetar as you have killed my son and accompanied these words with a frightful cry the merchant being as much frightened at the hideous shape of the monster as at these threatening words answered him tremblingalas my good lord of what crime can i be guilty towards you that you should take away my lifei will replies the genie kill thee as thou hast killed my sono heaven says the merchant how should i kill your son i did not know him nor ever saw himdid not you sit down when you came hither replies the genie did not you take dates out of your portmanteau and as you ate them did not you throw the shells about on both sidesi did all that you say answers the merchant i cannot deny itif it be so replied the genie i tell thee that thou hast killed my son and the way was thus when you threw the nutshells about my son was passing by and you threw one of them into his eye which killed him therefore i must kill theeah my good lord pardon me cried the merchantno pardon answers the genie no mercy is it not just to kill him that has killed anotheri agree to it says the merchant but certainly i never killed your son and if i have it was unknown to me and i did it innocently therefore i beg you to pardon me and suffer me to liveno no says the genie persisting in his resolution i must kill thee since thou hast killed my son and then taking the merchant by the arm threw him with his face upon the ground and lifted up his cimetar to cut off his headthe merchant and the genie first nighted                                        undine is a most exquisite work it shows the general want of any sense for the fine and the subtle in the public taste that this romance made no deep impression undines character before she receives a soul is marvellously beautiful1  footnote 1 mr coleridges admiration of this little romance was unbounded he read it several times in german and once in the english translation made in america i believe the latter he thought inadequately done mr c said that there was something in undine even beyond scottthat scotts best characters and conceptions were composed by which i understood him to mean that baillie nicol jarvie for example was made up of old particulars and received its individuality from the authors power of fusion being in the result an admirable product as corinthian brass was said to be the conflux of the spoils of a city but undine he said was one and single in projection and had presented to his imagination what scott had never done an absolutely new ideaed                                       it seems to me that martin never looks at nature except through bits of stained glass he is never satisfied with any appearance that is not prodigious he should endeavour to school his imagination into the apprehension of the true idea of the beautiful1  the woodcut of slaygood2 is admirable to be sure but this new edition of the pilgrims progress is too fine a book for it it should be much larger and on sixpenny coarse paper  the pilgrims progress is composed in the lowest style of english without slang or false grammar if you were to polish it you would at once destroy the reality of the vision for works of imagination should be written in very plain language the more purely imaginative they are the more necessary it is to be plain  this wonderful work is one of the few books which may be read over repeatedly at different times and each time with a new and a different pleasure i read it once as a theologianand let me assure you that there is great theological acumen in the workonce with devotional feelingsand once as a poet i could not have believed beforehand that calvinism could be painted in such exquisitely delightful colours3  footnote 1 mr coleridge said this after looking at the engravings of mr martins two pictures of the valley of the shadow of death and the celestial city published in the beautiful edition of the pilgrims progress by messrs murray and major in 1830 i wish mr martin could have heard the poets lecture he would have been flattered and at the same time i believe instructed for in the philosophy of painting coleridge was a mastered

edition of the ps p the following note by mr ci know of no book the bible excepted as above all comparison which i according to my judgment and experience could so safely recommend as teaching and

writer not miraculously inspired june 14 1830ed    june 1 1830  prayerchurchsinginghookerdreams   there are three sorts of prayer1 public 2 domestic 3 solitary each has its peculiar uses and character i think the church ought to publish and authorise a directory of forms for the latter two yet i fear the execution would be inadequate there is a great decay of devotional unction in the numerous books of prayers put out nowadays i really think the hawker was very happy who blundered new form of prayer into new former prayers1  i exceedingly regret that our church pays so little attention to the subject of congregational singing see how it is in that particular part of the public worship in which more than in all the rest the common people might and ought to joinwhich by its association with music is meant to give a fitting vent and expression to the emotionsin that part we all sing as jews or at best as mere men in the abstract without a saviour you know my veneration for the book of psalms or most of it but with some half dozen exceptions the psalms are surely not adequate vehicles of christian thanksgiving and joy upon this deficiency in our service wesley and whitfield seized and you know it is the hearty congregational singing of christian hymns which keeps the humbler methodists together luther did as much for the reformation by his hymns as by his translation of the bible in germany the hymns are known by heart by every peasant they advise they argue from the hymns and every soul in the church praises god like a christian with words which are natural and yet sacred to his mind no doubt this defect in our service proceeded from the dread which the english reformers had of being charged with introducing any thing into the worship of god but the text of scripture  footnote 1 i will add at the risk of appearing to dwell too long on religious topics that on this my first introduction to coleridge he reverted with strong compunction to a sentiment which he had expressed in earlier days upon prayer in one of his youthful poems speaking of god he had said       of whose allseeing eye     aught to demand were impotence of mind  this sentiment he now so utterly condemned that on the contrary he told me as his own peculiar opinion that the act of praying was the very highest energy of which the human heart was capable praying that is with the total concentration of the faculties and the great mass of worldly men and of learned men he pronounced absolutely incapable of prayertaits magazine september 1834 p 515  mr coleridge within two years of his death very solemnly declared to me his conviction upon the same subject i was sitting by his bedside one afternoon and he fell an unusual thing for him into a long account of many passages of his past life lamenting some things condemning others but complaining withal though very gently of the way in which many of his most innocent acts had been cruelly misrepresented but i have no difficulty said he in forgiveness indeed i know not how to say with sincerity the clause in the lords prayer which asks forgiveness as we forgive i feel nothing answering to it in my heart neither do i find or reckon the most solemn faith in god as a real object the most arduous act of the reason and will o no my dear it is to pray to pray as god would have us this is what at times makes me turn cold to my soul believe me to pray with all your heart and strength with the reason and the will to believe vividly that god will listen to your voice through christ and verily do the thing he pleaseth thereuponthis is the last the greatest achievement of the christians warfare upon earth teach us to pray o lord and then he burst into a flood of tears and begged me to pray for him o what a sight was thereed                                       hooker saidthat by looking for that in the bible which it is impossible that any book can have we lose the benefits which we might reap from its being the best of all books                                       you will observe that even in dreams nothing is fancied without an antecedent quasi cause it could not be otherwise      june 4 1830  jeremy taylorenglish reformation   taylors was a great and lovely mind yet how much and injuriously was it perverted by his being a favourite and follower of laud and by his intensely popish feelings of church authority 1 his liberty of prophesying is a work of wonderful eloquence and skill but if we believe the argument what do we come to why to nothing more or less than this thatso much can be said for every opinion and sectso impossible is it to settle any thing by reasoning or authority of scripturewe must appeal to some positive jurisdiction on earth ut sit finis controversiarum in fact the whole book is the precise argument used by the papists to induce men to admit the necessity of a supreme and infallible head of the church on earth it is one of the works which preeminently gives countenance to the saying of charles or james ii i forget whichwhen you of the church of england contend with the catholics you use the arguments of the puritans when you contend with the puritans you immediately adopt all the weapons of the catholics taylor never speaks with the slightest symptom of affection or respect of luther calvin or any other of the great reformersat least not in any of his learned works but he saints every trumpery monk and friar down to the very latest canonizations by the modern popes i fear you will think me harsh when i say that i believe taylor was perhaps unconsciously half a socinian in heart such a strange inconsistency would not be impossible the romish church has produced many such devout socinians the cross of christ is dimly seen in taylors works compare him in this particular with donne and you will feel the difference in a moment why are not donnes volumes of sermons reprinted at oxford2  footnote 1 mr coleridge placed jeremy taylor amongst the four great geniuses of old english literature i think he used to reckon shakspeare and bacon milton and taylor foursquare each against each in mere eloquence he thought the bishop without any fellow he called him chrysostom further he loved the man and was anxious to find excuses for some weak parts in his character but mr coleridges assent to taylors views of many of the fundamental positions of christianity was very limited and indeed he considered him as the least sound in point of doctrine of any of the old divines comprehending within that designation the writers to the middle of charles iis reign he speaks of taylor in the friend in the following termsamong the numerous examples with which i might enforce this warning i refer not without reluctance to the most eloquent and one of the most learned of our divines a rigorist indeed concerning the authority of the church but a latitudinarian in the articles of its faith who stretched the latter almost to the advanced posts of socinianism and strained the former to a hazardous conformity with the assumptions of the roman hierarchy vol ii p 108ed  footnote 2 why not indeed it is really quite unaccountable that the sermons of this great divine of the english church should be so little known as they are even to very literary clergymen of the present day it might have been expected that the sermons of the greatest preacher of his age the admired of ben jonson selden and all that splendid band of poets and scholars would even as curiosities have been reprinted when works which are curious for nothing are every year sent forth afresh under the most authoritative auspices dr donne was educated at both universities at hart hall oxford first and afterwards at cambridge but at what college walton does not mentioned                                       in the reign of edward vi the reformers feared to admit almost any thing on human authority alone they had seen and felt the abuses consequent on the popish theory of christianity and i doubt not they wished and intended to reconstruct the religion and the church as far as was possible upon the plan of the primitive ages but the puritans pushed this bias to an absolute bibliolatry they would not put on a cornplaster without scraping a text over it men of learning however soon felt that this was wrong in the other extreme and indeed united itself to the very abuse it seemed to shun they saw that a knowledge of the fathers and of early tradition was absolutely necessary and unhappily in many instances the excess of the puritans drove the men of learning into the old popish extreme of denying the scriptures to be capable of affording a rule of faith without the dogmas of the church taylor is a striking instance how far a protestant might be driven in this direction     june 6 1830  catholicitygnosistertullianst john   in the first century catholicity was the test of a book or epistle whether it were of the evangelicon or apostoliconbeing canonical this catholic spirit was opposed to the gnostic or peculiar spiritthe humour of fantastical interpretation of the old scriptures into christian meanings it is this gnosis or knowingness which the apostle says puffeth upnot knowledge as we translate it the epistle of barnabas of the genuineness of which i have no sort of doubt is an example of this gnostic spirit the epistle to the hebrews is the only instance of gnosis in the canon it was written evidently by some apostolical man before the destruction of the temple and probably at alexandria for three hundred years and more it was not admitted into the canon especially not by the latin church on account of this difference in it from the other scriptures but its merit was so great and the gnosis in it is so kept within due bounds that its admirers at last succeeded especially by affixing st pauls name to it to have it included in the canon which was first done i think by the council of laodicea in the middle of the fourth century fortunately for us it was so                                       i beg tertullians pardon but amongst his many bravuras he says something about st pauls autograph origen expressly declares the reverse                                       it is delightful to think that the beloved apostle was born a plato to him was left the almost oracular utterance of the mysteries of the christian religion while to st paul was committed the task of explanation defence and assertion of all the doctrines and especially of those metaphysical ones touching the will and grace1 for which purpose his active mind his learned education and his greek logic made him preeminently fit  footnote 1 the imperative and oracular form of the inspired scripture is the form of reason itself in

which should be started upon a published code of principles critical moral political and religious which should announce what sort of books it would review namely works of literature as contradistinguished from all that offspring of the press which in the present age supplies food for the craving caused by the extended ability of reading without any correspondent education of the mind and which formerly was done by conversation and which should really give a fair account of what the author intended to do and in his own words if possible and in addition afford one or two fair specimens of the executionitself never descending for one moment to any personality it should also be provided before the commencement with a dozen powerful articles upon fundamental topics to appear in succession you see the great reviewers are now ashamed of reviewing works in the old style and have taken up essay writing instead hence arose such publications as the literary gazette and others which are set up for the purposenot a useless oneof advertizing new books of all sorts for the circulating libraries a mean between the two extremes still remains to be taken                                       party men always hate a slightly differing friend more than a downright enemy i quite calculate on my being one day or other holden in worse repute by many christians than the unitarians

beautiful i wish he had illustrated that mood of mind which exaggerates and still more mistakes the inward depravation as in bunyan nelson and others by extracts from baxters life of himself what genuine superstition is exemplified in that bandying of texts and half texts and demisemitexts just as memory happened to suggest them or chance brought them before bunyans mind his tract entitled grace abounding to the chief of sinners1 is a study for a philosopher  footnote 1 grace abounding to the chief of sinners in a faithful account of the life and death of john bunyan c is it not however an historical error to call the puritans dissenters before st bartholomews day they were essentially a part of the church and had as determined opinions in favour of a church establishment as the bishops themselves                                       laud was not exactly a papist to be sure but he was on the road with the church with him to a point where declared popery would have been inevitable a wise and vigorous papist king would very soon and very justifiably too in that case have effected a reconciliation between the churches of rome and england when the line of demarcation had become so very faint                                       the faults of the puritans were many but surely their morality will in general bear comparison with that of the cavaliers after the restoration                                       the presbyterians hated the independents much more than they did the bishops which induced them to cooperate in effecting the restoration

about for a hidden meaning in all that he has written you will observe that after any particularly deep thrust as the papimania1 for example rabelais as if to break the blow and to appear unconscious

giotto1 and others in the cemetery at pisa are most noble giotto was a contemporary of dante and it is a curious question whether the painters borrowed from the poet or vice versa certainly m angelo and raffael fed their imaginations highly with these grand drawings especially m angelo who took from them his bold yet graceful lines  footnote 1 giotto or angiolottos birth is fixed by vasari in 1276 but there is some reason to think that he was born a little earlier dante who was his friend was born in 1265 giotto was the pupil of cimabue whom he entirely eclipsed as dante testifies in the wellknown lines in the purgatorio    o vana gloria dellumane posse   com poco verde in su la cima dura   se non e giunta dall etati grosse   credette cirnabue nella pintura   tener lo campo ed ora ha

out by him     july 2 1830  platoaristotle   every man is born an aristotelian or a platonist i do not think it possible that any one born an aristotelian can become a platonist and i am sure no born platonist can ever change into an aristotelian they are the two classes of men beside which it is next to impossible to conceive a third the one considers reason a quality or attribute the other considers it a power i believe that aristotle never could get to understand what plato meant by an idea there is a passage indeed in the eudemian ethics which looks like an exception but i doubt not of its being spurious as that whole work is supposed by some to be with plato ideas are constitutive in themselves1  aristotle was and still is the sovereign lord of the understanding the faculty judging by the senses he was a conceptualist and never could raise himself into that higher state which was natural to plato and has been so to others in which the understanding is distinctly contemplated and as it were looked down upon from the throne of actual ideas or living inborn essential truths  yet what a mind was aristotlesonly not the greatest that ever animated the human formthe parent of science properly so called the master of criticism and the founder or editor of logic but he confounded science with philosophy which is an error philosophy is the middle state between science or knowledge and sophia or wisdom  footnote 1 mr coleridge said the eudemian ethics but i half suspect he must have meant the metaphysics although i do not know that all the fourteen books under that title have been considered nongenuine the greek aethicha eusaemeia are not aristotles to what passage in particular allusion is here made i cannot exactly say many might be alleged but not one seems to express the true platonic idea as mr coleridge used to understand it and as i believe he ultimately considered ideas in his own philosophy fourteen or fifteen years previously he seems to have been undecided upon this point whether he says ideas are regulative only according to aristotle and kant or likewise constitutive and one with the power and life of nature according to plato and

which he governed a highly disciplined army he seems to be unaccustomed to and to despise the inconsistencies the weaknesses the bursts of heroism followed by prostration and cowardice which invariably characterise all popular efforts he forgets that after all it is from such efforts that all the great and noble institutions of the world have come and that on the other hand the discipline

pepysa man with right feelings but always wishing to participate in what is going on be it what it may he has one remark when comparing buonaparte with charlemagne the substance of which i have attempted to express in the friend1 but which bourrienne has condensed into a sentence worthy of tacitus or machiavel or bacon it is this that charlemagne was above his age whilst buonaparte was only above his competitors but under his age bourrienne has done more than any one else to show buonaparte to the world as he really wasalways contemptible except when acting a part and that part not his

extraordinary tone i ever heard at last i was so provoked that i said to him pray why cant you say old clothes in a plain way as i do now the jew stopped and looking very gravely at me said in a clear and even fine accent sir i can say old clothes as well as you can but if you had to say so ten times a minute for an hour together you would say ogh clo as i do now and so he marched off i was so confounded with the justice of his retort that i followed and gave him a shilling the only one i had                                       i have had a good deal to do with jews in the course of my

against the barbarism and ignorance of the times the pope was chief of this confederacy and so long as he retained that character exclusively his power was just and irresistible it was the principal mean of preserving for us and for our posterity all that we now have of the illumination of past ages but as soon as the pope made a separation between his character as premier clerk in christendom and as a secular prince as soon as he began to squabble for towns and castles then he at once broke the charm and gave birth to a revolution from that moment those who remained firm to the cause of truth and knowledge became necessary enemies to the roman see the great british schoolmen led the way then wicliffe rose huss jerome and othersin short every where but especially throughout the north of europe the breach of feeling and sympathy went on wideningso that all germany england scotland and other countries started like giants out of their sleep at the first blast of luthers trumpet in france one half of the peopleand that the most wealthy and enlightened embraced the reformation the seeds of it were deeply and widely spread in spain and in italy and as to the latter if james i had been an elizabeth i have no doubt at all that venice would have publicly declared itself against rome it is a profound question to answer why it is that since the middle of the sixteenth century the reformation has not advanced one step in europe                                       in the time of leo x atheism or infidelity of some sort was almost universal in italy amongst the high dignitaries of the romish church    july 27 1830  thelwallswiftstella   john thelwall had something very good about him we were once sitting in a beautiful recess in the quantocks when i said to him citizen john this is a fine place to talk treason innay citizen samuel replied he it is rather a place to make a man forget that there is any necessity for treason  thelwall thought it very unfair to influence a childs mind by inculcating any opinions before it should have come to years of discretion and be able to choose for itself i showed him my garden and told him it was my botanical garden how so said he it is covered with weedsoh i replied that is only because it has not yet come to its age of discretion and choice the weeds you see have taken the liberty to grow and i thought it unfair in me to prejudice the soil towards roses and strawberries                                       i think swift adopted the name of stella which is a mans name with a feminine termination to denote the mysterious epicene relation in which poor miss johnston stood to him    july 28 1830  iniquitous legislation   that legislation is iniquitous which sets law in conflict with the common and unsophisticated feelings of our nature if i were a clergyman in a smuggling town i would not preach against smuggling i would not be made a sort of clerical revenue officer let the government which by absurd duties fosters smuggling prevent it itself if it can how could i show my hearers the immorality of going twenty miles in a boat and honestly buying with their money a keg of brandy except by a long deduction which they could not understand but were i in a place where wrecking went on see if i would preach on any thing else    july 29 1830  spurzheim and craniolooy   spurzheim is a good man and i like him but he is dense and the most ignorant german i ever knew if he had been content with stating certain remarkable coincidences between the moral qualities and the configuration of the skull it would have been well but when he began to map out the cranium dogmatically he fell into infinite absurdities you know that every intellectual act however you may distinguish it by name in respect of the originating faculties is truly the act of the entire man the notion of distinct material organs therefore in the brain itself is plainly absurd pressed by this spurzheim has at length been guilty of some sheer quackery and ventures to say that he has actually discovered a different material in the different parts or organs of the brain so that he can tell a piece of benevolence from a bit of destructiveness and so forth observe also that it is constantly found that so far from there being a concavity in the interior surface of the cranium answering to the convexity apparent on the exteriorthe interior is convex too dr baillie thought there was something in the system because the notion of the brain being an extendible net helped to explain those cases where the intellect remained after the solid substance of the brain was dissolved in water1  that a greater or less development of the forepart of the head is generally coincidedent with more or less of reasoning power is certain the line across the forehead also denoting musical power is very common  footnote 1 the very marked positive as well as comparative magnitude and prominence of the bump entitled benevolence see spurzheims map of the human skull on the head of the late mr john thurtell has woefully unsettled the faith of many ardent phrenologists and strengthened the previous doubts of a still greater number into utter disbelief on my mind this fact for a fact it is produced the directly contrary effect and inclined me to suspect for the first time that there may be some truth in the spurzheimian scheme whether future craniologists may not see cause to newname this and one or two others of these convex gnomons is quite a different question at present and according to the present use of words any such change would be premature and we must be content to say that mr thurtells benevolence was insufficiently modified by the unprotrusive and unindicated convolutes of the brain that secrete honesty and common sense the organ of destructiveness was indirectly potentiated by the absence or imperfect development of the glands of reason and conscience in this unfortunate gentlemanaids to reflection p 143 n    august 20 1830  french revolution 1830captain r and the americans  the french must have greatly improved under the influence of a free and regular government for such it in general has been since the restoration to have conducted themselves with so much moderation in success as they seem to have done and to be disposed to do                                       i must say i cannot see much in captain b halls account of the americans but weaknessessome of which make me like the yankees all the better how much more amiable is the american fidgettiness and anxiety about the opinion of other nations and especially of the english than the sentiments of the rest of the world1  as to what captain hall says about the english loyalty to the person of the kingi can only say i feel none of it i respect the man while and only while the king is translucent through him i reverence the glass case for the saints sake within except for that it is to me mere glaziers work putty and glass and wood  footnote 1 there exists in england a gentlemanly character a gentlemanly feeling very different even from that which is most like itthe character of a wellborn spaniard and unexampled in the rest of europe this feeling originated in the fortunate circumstance that the titles of our english nobility follow the law of their property and are inherited by the eldest sons only from this source under the influences of our constitution and of our astonishing trade it has diffused itself in different modifications through the whole country the uniformity of our dress among all classes above that of the day labourer while it has authorized all ranks to assume the appearance of gentlemen has at the same time inspired the wish to conform their manners and still more their ordinary actions in social intercourse to their notions of the gentlemanly the most commonly received attribute of which character is a certain generosity in trifles on the other hand the encroachments of the lower classes on the higher occasioned and favoured by this resemblance in exteriors by this absence of any cognizable marks of distinction have rendered each class more reserved and jealous in their general communion and far more than our climate or natural temper have caused that haughtiness and reserve in our outward demeanour which is so generally complained of among foreigners far be it from me to depreciate the value of this gentlemanly feeling i respect it under all its forms and varieties from the house of commons  to the gentleman in the oneshilling gallery it is always the ornament of virtue and oftentimes a support but it is a wretched substitute for it its worth as a moral good is by no means in proportion to its value as a social advantage these observations are not irrelevant for to the want of reflection that this diffusion of gentlemanly feeling among us is not the growth of our moral excellence but the effect of various accidental advantages peculiar to england to our not considering that it is unreasonable and uncharitable to expect the same consequences where the same causes have not existed to produce them and lastly to our prorieness to regard the absence of this character which as i have before said does for the greater part and in the common apprehension consist in a certain frankness and generosity in the detail of action as decisive against the sum total of personal or national worth we must i am convinced attribute a large portion of that conduct which in many instances has left the inhabitants of countries conquered or appropriated by great britain doubtful whether the various solid advantages which they have derived from our protection and just government were not bought dearly by the wounds inflicted on their feelings and prejudices by the contemptuous and insolent demeanour of the english as individualsfriend vol iii p 322  this was written long before the reform acted    september 8 1830  english reformation   the fatal error into which the peculiar character of the english reformation threw our church has borne bitter fruit ever sincei mean that of its clinging to court and state instead of cultivating the people the church ought to be a mediator between the people and the government between the poor and the rich as it is i fear the church has let the hearts of the common people be stolen from it see how differently the church of romewiser in its generationhas always acted in this particular for a long time past the church of england seems to me to have been blighted with prudence as it is called i wish with all my heart we had a little zealous imprudence    september 19 1830  democracyidea of a statechurch   it has never yet been seen or clearly announced that democracy as such is no proper element in the constitution of a state the idea of a state is undoubtedly a government greek ek ton aristouan aristocracy democracy is the healthful lifeblood which circulates through the veins and arteries which supports the system but which ought never to appear externally and as the mere blood itself  a state in idea is the opposite of a church a state regards classes and not individuals and it estimates classes not by internal merit but external accidents as property birth c but a church does the reverse of this and disregards all external accidents and looks at men as individual persons allowing no gradation of ranks but such as greater or less wisdom learning and holiness ought to confer a church is therefore in idea the only pure democracy the church so considered and the state exclusively of the church constitute together the idea of a state in its largest sense     september 20 1830  governmentfrench gendarmerie   all temporal government must rest on a compromise of interests and abstract rights who would listen to the county of bedford if it were to declare itself disannexed from the british empire and to set up for itself                                       the most desirable thing that can happen to france with her immense army of gensdarmes is that the service may at first become very irksome to the men themselves and ultimately by not being called into real service fall into general ridicule like our trained bands the evil in france and throughout europe seems now especially to be the subordination of the legislative power to the direct physical force of the people the french legislature was weak enough before the late revolution now it is absolutely powerless and manifestly depends even for its existence on the will of a popular commander of an irresistible army there is now in france a daily tendency to reduce the legislative body to a mere deputation from the provinces and towns     september 21 1830  philosophy of young men at the present day   i do not know whether i deceive myself but it seems to me that the young men who were my contemporaries fixed certain principles in their minds and followed them out to their legitimate consequences in a way which i rarely witness now no one seems to have any distinct convictions right or wrong the mind is completely at sea rolling and pitching on the waves of facts and personal experiences mr  is i suppose one of the rising young men of the day yet he went on talking the other evening and making remarks with great earnestness some of which were palpably irreconcilable with each other he told me that facts gave birth to and were the absolute ground of principles to which i said that unless he had a principle of selection he would not have taken notice of those facts upon which he grounded his principle you must have a lantern in your hand to give light otherwise all the materials in the world are useless for you cannot find them and if you could you could not arrange them but then said mr  that principle of selection came from factsto be sure i replied but there must have been again an antecedent light to see those antecedent facts the relapse may be carried in imagination backwards for everbut go back as you may you cannot come to a man without a previous aim or principle he then asked me what i had to say to bacons induction i told him i had a good deal to say if need were but that it was perhaps enough for the occasion to remark that what he was evidently taking for the baconian induction was mere deductiona very different thing1  footnote 1 as far as i can judge the most complete and masterly thing ever done by mr coleridge in prose is the analysis and reconcilement of the platonic and baconian methods of philosophy contained in the third volume of the friend from p 176 to 216 no edition of the novum organum should ever be published without a transcript of ited    september 22 1830  thucydides and tacituspoetrymodern metre   the object of thucydides was to show the ills resulting to greece from the separation and conflict of the spirits or elements of democracy and oligarchy the object of tacitus was to demonstrate the desperate consequences of the loss of liberty on the minds and hearts of men                                       a poet ought not to pick natures pocket let him borrow and so borrow as to repay by the very act of borrowing examine nature accurately but write from recollection and trust more to your imagination than to your memory                                       really the metre of some of the modern poems i have read bears about the same relation to metre properly understood that dumb bells do to music both are for exercise and pretty severe too i think                                       nothing ever left a stain on that gentle creatures mind which looked upon the degraded men and things around him like moonshine on a dunghill which shines and takes no pollution all things are shadows to him except those which move his affections    september 23 1830  logic   there are two kinds of logic 1 syllogistic 2 criterional how any one can by any spinning make out more than ten or a dozen pages about the first is inconceivable to me all those absurd forms of syllogisms are one half pure sophisms and the other half mere forms of rhetoric  all syllogistic logic is1 seclusion 2 inclusion 3 conclusion which answer to the understanding the experience and the reason the first says this ought to be the second adds this is and the last pronounces this must be so the criterional logic or logic of premisses is of course much the most important and it has never yet been treated                                       the object of

what a loss we have had in varros mythological and critical works it is said that the works of epicurus are probably amongst the herculanean manuscripts i do not feel much interest about them because by the consent of all antiquity lucretius has preserved a complete view of his system but i regret the loss of the works of the old stoics zeno and others exceedingly                                       socrates as such was only a poetical character to plato who worked upon his own ground the several disciples of socrates caught some particular points from him and made systems of philosophy upon them according to their own views socrates himself had no system                                       i hold all claims set up for egypt having given birth to the greek philosophy to be groundless it sprang up in greece itself and began with physics only  then it took in the idea of a living cause and made pantheism out of the two socrates introduced ethics and taught duties and then finally plato asserted or reasserted the idea of a god the maker of the world the measure of human philosophy was thus full when christianity came to add what before was wantingassurance after this again the neoplatonists joined theurgy with philosophy which ultimately degenerated into magic and mere mysticism  plotinus was a man of wonderful ability and some of the sublimest passages i ever read are in

no one ever requires to be told what it is when drawn this vale is about as large a basin as loch lomond the latter is covered with water but in the former instance we have two lakes with a charming river to connect them and lovely villages at the foot of the mountain and other habitations which give an air of life and cheerfulness to the whole place                                       the land

that it was friendship accidentally combined with desire whence i concluded that he had never been in love for what shall we say of the feeling which a man of sensibility has towards his wife with her

reformers were beset with an almost morbid anxiety not to be considered heretical in point of doctrine they knew that the romanists were on the watch to fasten the brand of heresy upon them whenever a

is no vision in the land where are our statesmen to meet this emergency i see no reformer who asks himself the question what is it that i propose to myself to effect in the result  is the house of commons to be reconstructed on the principle of a representation of interests or of a delegation of men if on the former we may perhaps see our way if on the latter you can never in reason stop short of universal suffrage and in that case i am sure that women have as good a right to vote as men1  footnote 1 in mr coleridges masterly analysis and confutation of the physiocratic system of the early french revolutionists in the friend he has the following passage in the nature of a reductio ad absurdum rousseau indeed asserts that there is an inalienable sovereignty inherent in every human being possessed of reason and from this the framers of the constitution of 1791 deduce that the people itself is its own sole rightful legislator and at most dare only recede so far from its right as to delegate to chosen deputies the power of representing and declaring the general will but this is wholly without proof for it has been already fully shown that according to the principle out of which this consequence is attempted to be drawn it is not the actual man but the abstract reason alone that is the sovereign and rightful lawgiver the confusion of two things so different is so gross an error that the constituent assembly could scarce proceed a step in their declaration of rights without some glaring inconsistency children are excluded from all political power are they not human beings in whom the faculty of reason resides yes butin them the faculty is not yet adequately developed but are not gross ignorance inveterate superstition and the habitual tyranny of passion and sensuality equally preventives of the developement equally impediments to the rightful exercise of the reason as childhood and early youth who would not rely on the judgment of a welleducated english lad bred in a virtuous and enlightened family in preference to that of a brutal russian who believes that he can scourge his wooden idol into good humour or attributes to himself the merit of perpetual prayer when he has fastened the petitions which his priest has written for him on the wings of a windmill again women are likewise excluded a full half and that assuredly the most innocent the most amiable half of the whole human race is excluded and this too by a constitution which boasts to have no other foundations but those of universal reason is reason then an affair of sex no but women are commonly in a state of dependence and are not likely to exercise their reason with freedom well and does not this ground of exclusion apply with equal or greater force to the poor to the infirm to men in embarrassed circumstances to all in short whose maintenance be it scanty or be it ample depends on the will of others how far are we to go where must we stop what classes should we admit whom must we disfranchise the objects concerning whom we are to determine these questions are all human beings and differenced from each other by degrees only these degrees too oftentimes changing yet the principle on which the whole system rests is that reason is not susceptible of degree nothing therefore which subsists wholly in degrees the changes of which do not obey any necessary

thinking of that very pithy and profitable ballad by the laureate wherein is shown how a young man would read unlawful books and how he was punished    the young man he began to read   he knew not what but he would proceed   when there was heard a sound at the door   which as he read on grew more and more    and more and more the knocking grew   the young man knew not what to do   but trembling in fear he sat within   till the door was broke and the devil came in    what wouldst thou with me the wicked one cried   but not a word the young man replied   every hair on his head was standing

nation are1 security to possessors 2 facility to acquirers and 3 hope to all                                        a nation is the unity of a people king and parliament are the unity made visible the king and the peers are as integral portions of this manifested unity as the commons1  in that imperfect state of society in which our system of representation began the interests of the country were pretty exactly commensurate with its municipal divisions the counties the towns and the seaports accurately enough represented the only interests then existing that is saythe landed the shopkeeping or manufacturing and the mercantile but for a century past at least this division has become notoriously imperfect some of the most vital interests of the empire being now totally unconnected with any english localities yet now when the evil and the want are known we are to abandon the accommodations which the necessity of the case had worked out for itself and begin again with a rigidly territorial plan of representation the miserable tendency of all is to destroy our nationality which consists in a principal degree in our representative government and to convert it into a degrading delegation of the populace there is no unity for a people but in a representation of national interests a delegation from the passions or wishes of the individuals themselves is a rope of sand undoubtedly it is a great evil that there should be such an evident discrepancy between the law and the practice of the constitution in the matter of the representation such a direct yet clandestine contravention of solemn resolutions and established laws is immoral and greatly injurious to the cause of legal loyalty and general subordination in the minds of the people but then a statesman should consider that these very contraventions of law in practice point out to him the places in the body politic which need a remodelling of the law you acknowledge a certain necessity for indirect representation in the present day and that such representation has been instinctively obtained by means contrary to law why then do you not approximate the useless law to the useful practice instead of abandoning both law and practice for a completely new system of your own  footnote 1 mr coleridge was very fond of quoting george witherss fine lines    let not your king and parliament in one

the evil precedent of colonel napiers history of the peninsular war it is a specimen of the true french military school not a thought for the justice of the warnot a consideration of the damnable and damning iniquity of the french invasion all is looked at as a mere game of exquisite skill and the praise is regularly awarded to the most successful player how perfectly ridiculous is the prostration of napiers mind apparently a powerful one before the name of buonaparte i declare i know no book more likely to undermine the national sense of right and wrong in matters of foreign interference than this work of napiers  if a has a hundred means of doing a certain thing and b has only one or two is it very wonderful or does it argue very transcendant superiority if a surpasses b buonaparte was the child of circumstances which he neither originated nor controlled he had no chance of preserving his power but by continual warfare no thought of a wise tranquillization of the shaken elements of france seems ever to have passed through his mind and i believe that at no part of his reign could be have survived one years continued peace he never had but one obstacle to contend withphysical

starts from the right point but he is personally fond of the spaniards and in bringing forward their nationality in the prominent manner it deserves he does not in my judgment state with sufficient clearness the truth that the nationality of the spaniards was not founded on any just ground of good government or wise laws but was in fact very little more than a rooted antipathy to all strangers as such  in this sense every thing is national in spain even their so called catholic religion is exclusively national in a genuine spaniards mind he does not regard the religious professions of the frenchman or italian at all in the same light with his own  footnote 1 mr coleridge said that the conclusion of this great work was the finest specimen of historic eulogy he had ever read in

the fine arts than the english government a great musical composer in germany and italy is a great man in society and a real dignity and rank are universally conceded to him so it is with a sculptor or painter or architect without this sort of encouragement and patronage such arts as music and painting will never come into great eminence in this country there is no general reverence for the fine

pictures1   observe the remarkable difference between claude and teniers in their power of painting vacant space claude makes his whole landscape a plenum the air is quite as substantial as any other part of the scene hence there are no true distances and every thing presses at once and equally upon the eye there is something close and almost suffocating in the atmosphere of some of claudes sunsets never did any one paint air the thin air the absolutely apparent vacancy between object and object so admirably as teniers that picture of the archers2 exemplifies this excellence see the distances between those ugly louts how perfectly true to the fact  but oh what a wonderful picture is that triumph of silenus3 it is the very revelry of hell every evil passion is there that could in any way be forced into juxtaposition with joyance mark the lust and hard by the hate every part is pregnant with libidinous nature without one spark of the grace of heaven the animal is triumphingnot over butin the absence in the nonexistence of the spiritual part of man i could fancy that rubens had seen in a vision    all the souls that damned be   leap up at once in anarchy   clap their hands and dance for glee  that landscape4 on the other side is only less magnificent than dear sir george beaumonts now in the national gallery it has the same charm rubens does not take for his subjects grand or novel conformations of objects he has you see no precipices no forests no frowning castles nothing that a poet would take at all times and a painter take in these times no he gets some little ponds old tumbledown cottages that ruinous château two or three peasants a hayrick and other such humble images which looked at in and by themselves convey no pleasure and excite no surprise but heand he peter paul rubens alonehandles these every day ingredients of all common landscapes as they are handled in nature he throws them into a vast and magnificent whole consisting of heaven and earth and all things therein he extracts the latent poetry out of these common objectsthat poetry and harmony which every man of genius perceives in the face of nature and which many men of no genius are taught to perceive and feel after examining such a picture as this in other landscape painters the scene is confined and as it were imprisonedin rubens the landscape dies a natural death it fades away into the apparent infinity of space  so long as rubens confines himself to space and outward figureto the mere animal man with animal passionshe is i may say a god amongst painters his satyrs silenuses lions tigers and dogs are almost godlike but the moment he attempts any thing involving or presuming the spiritual his gods and goddesses his nymphs and heroes become beasts absolute unmitigated beasts  footnote 1 all the following remarks in this section were made at the exhibition of ancient masters at the british gallery in pall mall the recollection of those two hours has made the rooms of that institution a melancholy place for me mr coleridge was in high spirits and seemed to kindle in his mind at the contemplation of the splendid pictures before him he did not examine them all by the catalogue but anchored himself before some three or four great works telling me that he saw the rest of the gallery potentially i can yet distinctly recall him half leaning on his old simple stick and his hat off in one hand whilst with the fingers of the other he went on as was his constant wont figuring in the air a commentary of small diagrams wherewith as he fancied he could translate to the eye those relations of form and space which his words might fail to convey with clearness to the ear his admiration for rubens showed itself in a sort of joy and brotherly fondness he looked as if he would shake hands with his pictures what the company which by degrees formed itself round this silverhaired brighteyed musicbreathing old man took him for i cannot guess there was probably not one there who knew him to be that ancient mariner who held people with his glittering eye and constrained them like three years children to hear his tale in the midst of his speech he turned to the right hand where stood a very lovely young woman whose attention he had involuntarily arrestedto her without apparently any consciousness of her being a stranger to him he addressed many remarks although i must acknowledge they were couched in a somewhat softer tone as if he were soliciting her sympathy he was verily a gentlehearted man at all times but i never was in company with him in my life when the entry of a woman it mattered not who did not provoke a dim gush of emotion which passed like an infants breath over the mirror of his intellected  footnote 2 figures shooting at a target belonging

certainly it seemed to me that his main position that the mere text of the bible is the sole and exclusive ground of christian faith and practice is quite untenable against the romanists it entirely destroys the conditions of a church of an authority residing in a religious community and all that holy sense of brotherhood which is so sublime and consolatory to a meditative christian had i been a papist i should not have wished for a more vanquishable opponent in controversy i certainly believe chillingworth to have been in some sense a socinian lord falkland his friend said so in substance i do not deny his skill in dialectics he was more than a match for knott2 to be sure  i must be bold enough to say that i do not think that even hooker puts the idea of a church on the true foundation  footnote 1 the religion of protestants a safe way to salvation or an answer to a booke entitled mercy and truth or charity maintained by catholicks which pretends to prove the contrary  footnote 2 socinianism or some inclination that way is an old and clinging charge against chillingworth on the one hand it is well known that he subscribed the articles of the church of england in the usual form on the 20th of july 1638 and on the other it is equally certain that within two years immediately previous he wrote the letter to some unnamed correspondent beginning dear harry and printed in all the lives of chillingworth in which letter he sums up his arguments upon the arian doctrine in this passagein a word whosoever shall freely and impartially consider of this thing and how on the other side the ancient fathers weapons against the arrians are in a manner only places of scripture and these now for the most part discarded as importunate and unconcluding and how in the argument drawn from the authority of the ancient fathers they are almost always defendants and scarse ever opponents he shall not choose but confesses or at least be very inclinable to beleeve that the doctrine of arrius is eyther a truth or at least no damnable heresy the truth is however that the socinianism of chillingworth such as it may have been had more reference to the doctrine of the redemption of man than of the being of god  edward knotts real name was matthias wilsoned                                        the superstition of the peasantry and lower orders generally in malta sicily and italy exceeds common belief it is unlike the superstition of spain which is a jealous fanaticism having reference to their catholicism and always glancing on heresy the popular superstition of italy is the offspring of the climate the old associations the manners and the very names of the places it is pure paganism undisturbed by any anxiety about orthodoxy or animosity against heretics hence it is much more goodnatured and pleasing to a travellers feelings and certainly not a whit less like the true religion of our dear lord than the gloomy idolatry of the spaniards                                       i well remember when in valetta in 1805 asking a boy who waited on me what a certain procession then passing was and his answering with great quickness that it was jesus christ who lives here sta di casa qui and when he comes out it is in the shape of a wafer but eccelenza said he smiling and correcting himself non è cristiano1  footnote 1 the following anecdote related by mr coleridge in april 1811 was preserved and communicated to me by mr justice coleridgeas i was descending from mount aetna with a very lively talkative guide we passed through a village i think called nicolozzi when the host happened to be passing through the street every one was prostrate my guide became so and not to be singular i went down also after resuming our journey i observed in my guide an unusual seriousness and long silence which after many hums and hahs was interrupted by a low bow and leave requested to ask a question this was of course granted and the ensuing dialogue took place guide signor are you then a christian coleridge i hope so g what are all englishmen christians c i hope and trust they are g what are you not turks are you not damned eternally c i trust not through christ g what you believe in christ then c certainly this answer produced another long silence at length my guide again spoke still doubting the grand point of my christianity g im thinking signor what is the difference between you and us that you are to be certainly damned c nothing very material nothing that can prevent our both going to heaven i hope we believe in the father the son and the holy ghost g interrupting me oh those damned priests what liars they are but pausing we cant do without them we cant go to heaven without them but tell me signor what are the differences c why for instance we do not worship the virgin g and why not signor c because though holy and pure we think her still a woman and therefore do not pay her the honour due to god g but do you not worship jesus who sits on the right hand of god c we do g then why not worship the virgin who sits on the left c i did not know she did if you can show it me in the scriptures i shall readily agree to worship her oh said my

certainly holland is one of the most important allies that england has and we are doing our utmost to subject it and portugal to french influence or even dominion upon my word the english people at

of excellence to their character at home the best people in the mothercountry will generally be the worst in the colonies the worst at home will be the best abroad or perhaps i may state it less offensively thusthe colonists of a well governedcountry will degenerate those of an illgoverned country will improve i am now considering the natural tendency of such colonists if left to themselves of course a direct act of the legislature of the mothercountry will break in upon this where this tendency is exemplified the cause is obvious in countries well governed and happily conditioned none or very few but those who are desperate through vice or folly or who are mere trading adventurers will be willing to leave their homes and settle in another hemisphere and of those who do go the best and worthiest are always striving to acquire the means of leaving the colony and of returning to their native land in illgoverned and illconditioned countries on the contrary the most respectable of the people are willing and anxious to emigrate for the chance of greater security and enlarged freedom and if they succeed in obtaining these blessings in almost any degree they have little inducement on the average to wish to abandon their second and better country hence in the former case the colonists consider themselves as mere strangers sojourners birds of passage and shift to live from hand to mouth with little regard to lasting improvement of the place of their temporary commerce whilst in the latter case men feel attached to a community to which they are individually indebted for otherwise unattainable benefits and for the most part learn to regard it as their abode and to make themselves as happy and comfortable in it as possible i believe that the internal condition and character of the english and french west india islands of the last century amply verified this distinction the dutch colonists most certainly did and have always done  analogous to this though not founded on precisely the same principle is the fact that the severest naval discipline is always found in the ships of the freest nations and the most lax discipline in the ships of the most oppressed hence the naval discipline of the americans is the sharpest then that of the english1 then that of the french i speak as it used to be and on board a spanish ship there is no discipline at all  at genoa the word liberty is or used to be engraved on the chains of the galleyslaves and the doors of the dungeons  footnote 1 this expression needs explanation it looks as if mr coleridge rated the degree of liberty enjoyed by the english after that of the citizens of the united states but he meant no such thing his meaning was that the form of government of the latter was more democratic and formally assigned more power to each individual the americans as a nation had no better friend in england than coleridge he contemplated their growth with interest and prophesied highly of their destiny whether under their present or other governments but he well knew their besetting faults and their peculiar difficulties and was most deliberately of opinion that the english had for 130 years last past possessed a measure of individual freedom and social dignity which had never been equalled much less surpassed in any other country ancient or modern there is a passage in mr coleridges latest publication church and state which clearly expresses his opinion upon this subject it has been frequently and truly observed that in england where the groundplan the skeleton as it were of the government is a monarchy at once buttressed and limited by the aristocracy the assertions of its popular character finding a better support in the harangues and theories of popular men than in state documents and the records of clear history afar greater degree of liberty is and long has been enjoyed than ever existed in the ostensibly freest that is most democratic commonwealths of ancient or modern times greater indeed and with a more decisive predominance of the spirit of freedom than the wisest and most philanthropic statesmen of antiquity or than the great commonwealths menthe stars of that narrow interspace of blue sky between the black clouds of the first and second charless reignsbelieved compatible the one with the safety of the state the other with the interests of morality yes for little less than a century and a half englishmen have collectively and individually lived and acted with fewer restraints on their freeagency than the citizens of any known republic past or present p 120 upon which he subjoins the following note it will be thought perhaps that the united states of north america should have been excepted but the identity of stock language customs manners and laws scarcely allows us to consider this an exception even though it were quite certain both that it is and that it will continue such it was at all events a remark worth remembering which i once heard from a traveller a prejudiced one i must admit that where every man may take liberties there is little liberty for any man or that where every man takes liberties no man can enjoy any p 121 see also a passage to the like effect in the friend vol i p 129ed    august 15 1831  englandholland and belgium   i cannot contain my indignation at the conduct of our government towards holland they have undoubtedly forgotten the true and wellrecognized policy of this country in regard to portugal in permitting the war faction in france to take possession of the tagus and to bully the portuguese upon so flimsyindeed falsea pretext1 yet in this instance something may be said for them  miguel is such a wretch that i acknowledge a sort of morality in leaving him to be cuffed and insulted though of course this is a poor answer to a statesman who alleges the interest and policy of the country but as to the dutch and king william the first as a nation the most ancient ally the alter idem of england the best deserving of the cause of freedom and religion and morality of any people in europe and the second the very best sovereign now in christendom with perhaps the single exception of the excellent king of sweden2was ever any thing so mean and cowardly as the behaviour of england  the five powers have throughout this conference been actuated exclusively by a selfish desire to preserve peacei should rather say to smother war at the expense of a most valuable but inferior power they have over and over again acknowledged the justice of the dutch claims and the absurdity of the belgian pretences but as the belgians were also as impudent as they were iniquitousas they would not yield their point why thenthat peace may be preservedthe dutch must yield theirs a foreign prince comes into belgium pending these negotiations and takes an unqualified oath to maintain the belgian demandswhat could king william or the dutch do if they ever thereafter meant to call themselves independent but resist and resent this outrage to the uttermost it was a crisis in which every consideration of state became inferior to the strong sense and duty of national honour when indeed the french appear in the field king william retires i now see he may say that the powers of europe are determined to abet the belgians the justice of such a proceeding i leave to their conscience and the decision of history it is now no longer a question whether i am tamely to submit to rebels and a usurper it is no longer a quarrel between holland and belgium it is an alliance of all europe against hollandin which case i yield i have no desire to sacrifice my people  footnote 1 meaning principally the whipping so richly deserved inflicted on a frenchman called bonhomme for committing a disgusting breach of common decency in the cathedral of coimbra during divine service in passion weeked  footnote 2 every thing that i have heard or read of this sovereign has contributed to the impression on my mind that he is a good and a wise man and worthy to be the king of a virtuous people the purest specimen of the gothic racechurch and state p 125 ned                                       when leopold said that he was called to reign over four millions of noble belgians i thought the phrase would have been more germane to the matter if he had said that he was called to rein in four million restive asses    august 20 1831  greatest happiness principlehobbism   o p q in the morning chronicle is a clever fellow he is for the greatest possible happiness for the greatest possible number and for the longest possible time so am i so are you and every one of us i will venture to say round the teatable first however what does o p q mean by the word happiness and secondly how does he propose to make other persons agree in his definition of the term dont you see the ridiculous absurdity of setting up that as a principle or motive of action which is in fact a necessary and essential instinct of our very naturean inborn and inextinguishable desire how can creatures susceptible of pleasure and pain do otherwise than desire happiness but what happiness that is the question the american savage in scalping his fallen enemy pursues his happiness naturally and adequately a chickasaw or pawnee bentham or o p q would necessarily hope for the most frequent opportunities possible of scalping the greatest possible number of savages for the longest possible time there is no escaping this absurdity unless you come back to a standard of reason and duty imperative upon our merely pleasurable sensations oh but says o p q i am for the happiness of others of others are you indeed well i happen to be one of those others and so far as i can judge from what you show me of your habits and views i would rather be excused from your banquet of happiness your mode of happiness would make me miserable to go about doing as much good as possible to as many men as possible is indeed an excellent object for a man to propose to himself but then in order that you may not sacrifice the real good and happiness of others to your particular views which may be quite different from your neighbours you must do that good to others which the reason common to all pronounces to be good for all in this sense your fine maxim is so very true as to be a mere truism                                       so you object with old hobbes that i do good actions for the pleasure of a good conscience and so after all i am only a refined sensualist heaven bless you and mend your logic dont you see that if conscience which is in its nature a consequence were thus anticipated and made an antecedenta party instead of a judgeit would dishonour your draft upon itit would not pay on demand dont you see that in truth the very fact of acting with this motive properly and logically destroys all claim upon conscience to give you any pleasure at all    august 22 1831  the two modes of political action   there are many able and patriotic members in the house of commonssir robert inglis sir robert peel and some others but i grieve that they never have the courage or the wisdomi know not in which the failure is to take their stand upon duty and to appeal to all men as mento the good and the true which exist for all and of which all have an apprehension they always set to workespecially his great eminence considered sir robert peelby addressing themselves to individual interests the measure will be injurious to the linendrapers or to the bricklayers or this clause will bear hard on bobbinnet or poplins and so forth whereas their adversariesthe demagoguesalways work on the opposite principle they always appeal to men as men and as you know the most terrible convulsions in society have been wrought by such phrases as rights of man sovereignty of the people c which no one understands which apply to no one in particular but to all in general1  the devil works precisely in the same way he is a very clever fellow i have no acquaintance with him but i respect his evident talents consistent truth and goodness will assuredly in the end overcome every thing but inconsistent good can never be a match for consistent evil alas i look in vain for some wise and vigorous man to sound the word duty in the ears of this generation  footnote 1 it is with nations as with individuals in tranquil moods and peaceable times we are quite practical facts only and cool common sense are then in fashion but let the winds of passion swell and straightway men begin to generalize to connect by remotest analogies to express the most universal positions of reason in the most glowing figures of fancy in short to feel particular truths and mere facts as poor cold narrow and incommensurate with their feelingsstatesmans manual p 18  it seems a paradox only to the unthinking and it is a fact that none but the unread in history will deny that in periods of popular tumult and innovation the more abstract a notion is the more readily has it been found to combine the closer has appeared its affinity with the feelings of a people and with all their immediate impulses to action at the commencement of the french revolution in the remotest villages every tongue was employed in echoing and enforcing the almost geometrical abstractions of the physiocratic politicians and economists the public roads were crowded with armed enthusiasts disputing on the inalienable sovereignty of the people the imprescriptible laws of the pure reason and the universal constitution which as rising out of the nature and rights of man as man all nations alike were under the obligation of adopting statesmans manual    august 24 1831  truths and maxims   the english public is not yet ripe to comprehend the essential difference between the reason and the understandingbetween a principle and a maxim an eternal truth and a mere conclusion generalized from a great number of facts a man having seen a million moss roses all red concludes from his own experience and that of others that all moss roses are red that is a maxim with himthe greatest amount of his knowledge upon the subject but it is only true until some gardener has produced a white moss rose after which the maxim is good for nothing again suppose adam watching the sun sinking under the western horizon for the first time he is seized with gloom and terror relieved by scarce a ray of hope that he shall ever see the glorious light again the next evening when it declines his hopes are stronger but still mixed with fear and even at the end of a thousand years all that a man can feel is a hope and an expectation so strong as to preclude anxiety now compare this in its highest degree with the assurance which you have that the two sides of any triangle are together greater than the third this demonstrated of one triangle is seen to be eternally true of all imaginable triangles this is a truth perceived at once by the intuitive reason independently of experience it is and must ever be so multiply and vary the shapes and sizes of triangles as you may                                       it used to be said that four and five make nine locke says that four and five are nine now i say that four and five are not nine but that they will make nine when i see four objects which will form a square and five which will form a pentagon i see that they are two different things when combined they will form a third different figure which we call nine when separate they are not it but will make it     september 11 1831  drayton and daniel   drayton is a sweet poet and seldens notes to the early part of the polyolbion are well worth your perusal daniel is a superior man his diction is preeminently pureof that quality which i believe has always existed somewhere in society it is just such english without any alteration as wordsworth or sir george beaumont might have spoken or written in the present day  yet there are instances of sublimity in drayton when deploring the cutting down of some of our old forests he says in language which reminds the reader of lear written subsequently and also of several passages in mr wordsworths poems     our trees so hackd above the ground   that where their lofty tops the neighbouring countries     crownd   their trunks like aged folks now bare and naked stand   as for revenge to heaven each held a witherd hand 1  that is very fine  footnote 1 polyol vii  he drayton was a poet by nature and carefully improved his talent one who sedulously laboured to deserve the approbation of such as were capable of appreciating and cared nothing for the censures which others might pass upon him like me that list he says     my honest rhymes   nor care for critics nor regard the times  and though he is not a poet virum volitarc per ora nor one of those whose better fortune it is to live in the hearts of their devoted admirersyet what he deemed his greatest work will be preserved by its subject some of his minor poems have merit enough in their execution to ensure their preservation and no one who studies poetry as an art will think his time misspent in perusing the whole if he have any real love for the art he is pursuing the youth who enters upon that pursuit without a feeling of respect and gratitude for those elder poets who by their labours have prepared the way for him is not likely to produce any thing himself that will be held in remembrance by posteritythe doctor c c 36 pi  i heartily trust that the author or authors as the case may be of this singularly thoughtful and diverting book will in due time continue it let some people say what they please there has not been the fellow of it published for many a long dayed     september 12 1831  mr coleridges system of philosophy   my system if i may venture to give it so fine a name is the only attempt i know ever made to reduce all knowledges into harmony it opposes no other system but shows what was true in each and how that which was true in the particular in each of them became error because it was only half the truth i have endeavoured to unite the insulated fragments of truth and therewith to frame a perfect mirror i show to each system that i fully understand and rightfully appreciate what that system means but then i lift up that system to a higher point of view from which i enable it to see its former position where it was indeed but under another light and with different relationsso that the fragment of truth is not only acknowledged but explained thus the old astronomers discovered and maintained much that was true but because they were placed on a false ground and looked from a wrong point of view they never did they never could discover the truththat is the whole truth as soon as they left the earth their false centre and took their stand in the sun immediately they saw the whole system in its true light and their former station remaining but remaining as a part of the prospect i wish in short to connect by a moral copula natural history with political history or in other words to make history scientific and science historicalto take from history its accidentality and from science its fatalism                                       i never from a boy could under any circumstances feel the slightest dread of death as such in all my illnesses i have ever had the most intense desire to be released from this life unchecked by any but one wish namely to be able to finish my work on philosophy not that i have any authors vanity on the subject god knows that i should be absolutely glad if i could hear that the thing had already been done before me                                       illness never in the smallest degree affects my intellectual powers i can think with all my ordinary vigour in the midst of pain but i am beset with the most wretched and unmanning reluctance and shrinking from action i could not upon such occasions take the pen in hand to write down my thoughts for all the wide world    october 26 1831  keenness and subtlety   few men of genius are keen but almost every man of genius is subtle if you ask me the difference between keenness and subtlety i answer that it is the difference between a point and an edge to split a hair is no proof of subtlety for subtlety acts in distinguishing differencesin showing that two things apparently one are in fact two whereas to split a hair is to cause division and not to ascertain difference    october 27 1831  duties and needs of an advocate   there is undoubtedly a limit to the exertions of an advocate for his client he has a right it is his bounden duty to do every thing which his client might honestly do and to do it with all the effect which any exercise of skill talent or knowledge of his own may be able to produce but the advocate has no right nor is it his duty to do that for his client which his client in foro conscientiae has no right to do for himself as for a gross example to put in evidence a forged deed or will knowing it to be so forged as to mere confounding of witnesses by skilful crossexamination i own i am not disposed to be very strict the whole thing is perfectly well understood on all hands and it is little more in general than a sort of cudgelplaying between the counsel and the witness in which i speak with submission to you i think i have seen the witness have the best of it as often as his assailant it is of the utmost importance in the administration of justice that knowledge and intellectual power should be as far as possible equalized between the crown and the prisoner or plaintiff and defendant hence especially arises the necessity for an order of advocatesmen whose duty it ought to be to know what the law allows and disallows but whose interests should be wholly indifferent as to the persons or characters of their clients if a certain latitude in examining witnesses is as experience seems to have shown a necessary mean towards the evisceration of the truth of matters of fact i have no doubt as a moralist in saying that such latitude within the bounds now existing is justifiable we must be content with a certain quantum in this life especially in matters of public cognizance the necessities of society demand it we must not be righteous overmuch or wise overmuch and as an old father says in what vein may there not be a plethora when the scripture tells us that there may under circumstances be too much of virtue and of wisdom  still i think that upon the whole the advocate is placed in a position unfavourable to his moral being and indeed to his intellect also in its higher powers therefore i would recommend an advocate to devote a part of his leisure time to some study of the metaphysics of the mind or metaphysics of theology something i mean which shall call forth all his powers and centre his wishes in the investigation of truth alone without reference to a side to be supported no studies give such a power of distinguishing as metaphysical and in their natural and unperverted tendency they are ennobling and exalting some such studies are wanted to counteract the operation of legal studies and practice which sharpen indeed but like a grindingstone narrow whilst they sharpen     november 19 1831  abolition of the french hereditary peerage   i cannot say what the french peers will do but i can tell you what they ought to do so far they might say as our feelings and interests as individuals are concerned in this matterif it really be the prevailing wish of our fellowcountrymen to destroy the hereditary peeragewe shall without regret retire into the ranks of private citizens but we are bound by the provisions of the existing constitution to consider ourselves collectively as essential to the wellbeing of france we have been placed here to defend what france a short time ago at least thought a vital part of its government and if we did not defend it what answer could we make hereafter to france itself if she should come to see what we think to be an error in the light in which we view it we should be justly branded as traitors and cowards who had deserted the post which we were specially appointed to maintain as a house of peers thereforeas one substantive branch of the legislature we can never in honour or in conscience consent to a measure of the impolicy and dangerous consequences of which we are convinced  if therefore this measure is demanded by the country let the king and the deputies form themselves into a constituent assembly and then assuming to act in the name of the total nation let them decree the abolition in that case we yield to a just perhaps but revolutionary act in which we do not participate and against which we are upon the supposition quite powerless if the deputies however consider themselves so completely in the character of delegates as to be at present absolutely pledged to vote without freedom of deliberation let a concise but perspicuous summary of the ablest arguments that can be adduced on either side be drawn up and printed and circulated throughout the country and then after two months let the deputies demand fresh instructions upon this point one thing as men of honour we declare beforehandthat come what will none of us who are now peers will ever accept a peerage created de novo for life    november 20 1831  conduct of ministers on the reform billthe multitude   the present ministers have in my judgment been guilty of two things preeminently wicked sensu politico in their conduct upon this reform bill first they have endeavoured to carry a fundamental change in the material and mode of action of the government of the country by so exciting the passions and playing upon the necessary ignorance of the numerical majority of the nation that all freedom and utility of discussion by competent heads in the proper place should be precluded in doing this they have used or sanctioned the use of arguments which may he applied with equal or even greater force to the carrying of any measure whatever no matter how atrocious in its character or destructive in its consequences they have appealed directly to the argument of the greater number of voices no matter whether the utterers were drunk or sober competent or not competent and they have done the utmost in their power to rase out the sacred principle in politics of a representation of interests and to introduce the mad and barbarizing scheme of a delegation of individuals and they have done all this without one word of thankfulness to god for the manifold blessings of which the constitution as settled at the revolution imperfect as it may be has been the source or vehicle or condition to this great nationwithout one honest statement of the manner in which the anomalies in the practice grew up or any manly declaration of the inevitable necessities of government which those anomalies have met with no humility nor fear nor reverence like ham the accursed they have beckoned with grinning faces to a vulgar mob to come and insult over the nakedness of a parent when it had become them if one spark of filial patriotism had burnt within their breasts to have marched with silent steps and averted faces to lay their robes upon his destitution  secondly they have made the king the prime mover in all this political wickedness they have made the king tell his people that they were deprived of their rights and by direct and necessary implication that they and their ancestors for a century past had been slaves they have made the king vilify the memory of his own brother and father rights there are no rights whatever without corresponding duties look at the history of the growth of our constitution and you will see that our ancestors never upon any occasion stated as a ground for claiming any of their privileges an abstract right inherent in themselves you will nowhere in our parliamentary records find the miserable sophism of the rights of man no they were too wise for that they took good care to refer their claims to custom and prescription and boldlysometimes very impudentlyasserted them upon traditionary and constitutional grounds the bill is bad enough god knows but the arguments of its advocates and the manner of their advocacy are a thousand times worse than the bill itself and you will live to think so  i am far very far from wishing to indulge in any vulgar abuse of the vulgar i believe that the feeling of the multitude will in most cases be in favour of something good but this it is which i perceive that they are always under the domination of some one feeling or viewwhereas truth and above all practical wisdom must be the result of a wide comprehension of the more and the less the balance and the counter balance    december 3 1831  religion   a religion that is a true religion must consist of ideas and facts both not of ideas alone without facts for then it would be mere philosophy nor of facts alone without ideas of which those facts are the symbols or out of which they arise or upon which they are grounded for then it would be mere history    december 17 1831  union with irelandirish church   i am quite sure that no dangers are to be feared by england from the disannexing and independence of ireland at all comparable with the evils which have been and will yet be caused to england by the union we have never received one particle of advantage from our association with ireland whilst we have in many most vital particulars violated the principles of the british constitution solely for the purpose of conciliating the irish agitators and of endeavouringa vain endeavourto find room for them under the same government mr pitt has received great credit for effecting the union but i believe it will sooner or later be discovered that the manner in which and the terms upon which he effected it made it the most fatal blow that ever was levelled against the peace and prosperity of england from it came the catholic bill from the catholic bill has come this reform bill and what next                                       the case of the irish church is certainly anomalous and full of practical difficulties on the one hand it is the only church which the constitution can admit on the other such are the circumstances it is a church that cannot act as a church towards five sixths of the persons nominally and legally within its care    december 18 1831  a statepersons and thingshistory  the difference between an inorganic and an organic body lies in thisin the firsta sheaf of cornthe whole is nothing more than a collection of the individual parts or phenomena in the seconda manthe whole is the effect of or results from the parts itthe wholeis every thing and the parts are nothing  a state is an idea intermediate between the twothe whole being a result from and not a mere total of the parts and yet not so merging the constituent parts in the result but that the individual exists integrally within it extremes especially in politics meet in athens each

sultan seems himself the state but it is an illusion there is in fact in turkey no state at all the whole consists of nothing but a vast collection of neighbourhoods                                       when the government and the aristocracy of this country had subordinated persons to things and treated the one like the otherthe poor with some reason and almost in selfdefence learned to set up rights above duties the code of a christian society is debeo et tu debesof heathens or barbarians teneo teneto et tu si potes1  footnote 1 and this again is evolved out of the yet higher idea of person in contradistinction from thing all social law and justice being grounded on the principle that a person can never but by his own fault become a thing or without grievous wrong be treated as such and the distinction consisting in this that a thing may be used altogether and merely as the means to an end but the person must always be included in the end his interest must always form a part of the objecta mean to which he by consent that is by his own act makes himself we plant a tree and we fell it we breed the sheep and we shear or we kill itin both cases wholly as means to our ends for trees and animals are things the woodcutter and the hind are likewise employed as means but on agreement and that too an agreement of reciprocal advantage which includes them as well as their employer in the end for they are persons and the government under which the contrary takes place is not worthy to be called a state if as in the kingdom of dahomey it be unprogressive or only by anticipation where as in russia it is in advance to a better and more manworthy order of thingschurch and state p 10                                       if men could learn from history what lessons it might teach us but passion and party blind our eyes and the light which experience gives is a lantern on the stern which shines only on the waves behind us   december 27 1831  beautygenius  the old definition of beauty in the roman school of painting was il più nell unomultitude in unity and there is no doubt that such is the principle of beauty and as one of the most characteristic and infallible criteria of the different ranks of mens intellects observe the instinctive habit which all superior minds have of endeavouring to bring and of never resting till they have brought into unity the scattered facts which occur in conversation or in the statements of men of business to attempt to argue any great question upon facts only is absurd you cannot state any fact before a mixed audience which an opponent as clever as yourself cannot with ease twist towards another bearing or at least meet by a contrary fact as it is called i wonder why facts were ever called stubborn things i am sure they have been found pliable enough lately in the house of commons and elsewhere facts you know are not truths they are not conclusions they are not even premisses but in the nature and parts of premisses the truth depends on and is only arrived at by a legitimate deduction from all the facts which are truly material                                         december 28 1831  churchstatedissenters  even to a churchthe only pure democracy because in it persons are alone considered and one person à priori is equal to another personeven to a church discipline is an essential condition but a state regards classes and classes as they represent classified property and to introduce a system of representation which must inevitably render all discipline impossible what is it but madnessthe madness of ignorant vanity and reckless obstinacy                                       i have known and still know many dissenters who profess to have a zeal for christianity and i dare say they have but i have known very few dissenters indeed whose hatred to the church of england was not a much more active principle of action with them than their love for christianity the wesleyans in uncorrupted parts of the country are nearly the only exceptions there never was an age since the days of the apostles in which the catholic spirit of religion was so dead and put aside for love of sects and parties as at present                                       january 1 1832  gracefulness of childrendogs  how inimitably graceful children are in general before they learn to dance                                       there seems a sort of sympathy between the more generous dogs and little children i believe an instance of a little child being attacked by a large dog is very rare indeed    january 28 1832  ideal tory and whig   the ideal tory and the ideal whig and some such there have really been agreed in the necessity and benefit of an exact balance of the three estates but the tory was more jealous of the balance being deranged by the people the whig of its being deranged by the crown but this was a habit a jealousy only they both agreed in the ultimate preservation of the balance and accordingly they might each under certain circumstances without the slightest inconsistency pass from one side to the other as the ultimate object required it this the tories did at the revolution but remained tories as before  i have half a mind to write a critical and philosophical essay on whiggism from drydens achitophel shaftesbury the first whig for with dr johnsons leave the devil is no such cattle down to  who i trust in gods mercy to the interests of peace union and liberty in this nation will be the last in it i would take the last years of queen annes reign as the zenith or palmy state of whiggism in its divinest avatar of common sense or of the understanding vigorously exerted in the right direction on the right and proper objects of the understanding and would then trace the rise the occasion the progress and the necessary degeneration of the whig spirit of compromise even down to the profound ineptitudes of their party in these days a clever fellow might make something of this hint how asgill would have done it    february 22 1832  the church   the church is the last relic of our nationality would to god that the bishops and the clergy in general could once fully understand that the christian church and the national church are as little to be confounded as divided i think the fate of the reform bill in itself of comparatively minor importance the fate of the national church occupies my mind with greater intensity    february 24 1832  ministers and the reform bill   i could not help smiling in reading the report of lord greys speech in the house of lords the other night when he asked lord wicklow whether he seriously believed that he lord grey or any of the ministers intended to subvert the institutions of the country had i been in lord wicklows place i should have been tempted to answer this question something in the following waywaiving the charge in an offensive sense of personal consciousness against the noble earl and all but one or two of his colleagues upon my honour and in the presence of almighty god i answer yes you have destroyed the freedom of parliament you have done your best to shut the door of the house of commons to the property the birth the rank the wisdom of the people and have flung it open to their passions and their follies you have disfranchised the gentry and the real patriotism of the nation you have agitated and exasperated the mob and thrown the balance of political power into the hands of that class the shopkeepers which in all countries and in all ages has been is now and ever will be the least patriotic and the least conservative of any you are now preparing to destroy for ever the constitutional independence of the house of lords you are for ever displacing it from its supremacy as a coordinate estate of the realm and whether you succeed in passing your bill by actually swamping our votes by a batch of new peers or by frightening a sufficient number of us out of our opinions by the threat of oneequally you will have superseded the triple assent which the constitution requires to the enactment of a valid law and have left the king alone with the delegates of the populace    march 3 1832  disfranchisement   i am afraid the conservative party see but one half of the truth the mere extension of the franchise is not the evil i should be glad to see it greatly extendedthere is no harm in that per se the mischief is that the franchise is nominally extended but to such classes and in such a manner that a practical disfranchisement of all above and a discontenting of all below a favoured class are the unavoidable results    march 17 1832  genius femininepirates   s face is almost the only exception i know to the observation that something femininenot effeminate mindis discoverable in the countenances of all men of genius look at that face of old dampier a rough sailor but a man of exquisite mind how soft is the air of his countenance how delicate the shape of his temples                                       i think it very absurd and misplaced to call raleigh and drake and others of our naval heroes of elizabeths age pirates no man is a pirate unless his contemporaries agree to call him so drake saidthe subjects of the king of spain have done their best to ruin my country ergo i will try to ruin the king of spains country would it not be silly to call the argonauts pirates in our sense of the word    march 18 1832  astrologyalchemy   it is curious to mark how instinctively the reason has always pointed out to men the ultimate end of the various sciences and how immediately afterwards they have set to work like children to realize that end by inadequate means now they applied to their appetites now to their passions now to their fancy now to the understanding and lastly to the intuitive reason again there is no doubt but that astrology of some sort or other would be the last achievement of astronomy there must he chemical relations between the planets the difference of their magnitudes compared with that of their distances is not explicable otherwise but this though as it were blindly and unconsciously seen led immediately to fortune telling and other nonsense so alchemy is the theoretic end of chemistry there must be a common law upon which all can become each and each all but then the idea was turned to the coining of gold and silver    march 20 1832  reform billcrisis   i have heard but two arguments of any weight adduced in favour of passing this reform bill and they are in

ver 4dictation and inspirationgnosisnew testament canon  i certainly understand the greek ti emoi kai soi gynai in the second chapter1 of st johns gospel as having a liquid increpationis in it a mild reproof from jesus to mary for interfering in his ministerial acts by requests on her own account  i do not think that greek gynai was ever used by child to parent as a common mode of address between husband and wife it was but i cannot think that greek meter and greek gynai were equivalent terms in the mouth of a son speaking to his mother no part of the christopaedia is found in john or paul and after the baptism there is no recognition of any maternal authority in mary see the two passages where she endeavours to get access to him when he is preachingwhosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and my mother2 and also the recommendation of her to the care of john at the crucifixion  footnote 1 verse 4  footnote 2 mark ch iii ver 35                                       there may be dictation without inspiration and inspiration without dictation they have been and continue to be grievously confounded balaam and his ass were the passive organs of dictation but no one i suppose will venture to call either of those worthies inspired it is my profound conviction that st john and st paul were divinely inspired but i totally disbelieve the dictation of any one word sentence or argument throughout their writings observe there was revelation all religion is revealed revealed religion is in my judgment a mere pleonasm revelations of facts were undoubtedly made to the prophets revelations of doctrines were as undoubtedly made to john and paulbut is it not a mere matter of our very senses that john and paul each dealt with those revelations expounded them insisted on them just exactly according to his own natural strength of intellect habit of reasoning moral and even physical temperament we receive the books ascribed to john and paul as their books on the judgment of men for whom no miraculous discernment is pretended nay whom in their admission and rejection of other books we believe to have erred shall we give less credence to john and paul themselves surely the heart and soul of every christian give him sufficient assurance that in all things that concern him as a man the words that he reads are spirit and truth and could only proceed from him who made both heart and soul understand the matter so and all difficulty vanishes you read without fear lest your faith meet with some shock from a passage here and there which you cannot reconcile with immediate dictation by the holy spirit of god without an absurd violence offered to the text you read the bible as the best of all books but still as a book and make use of all the means and appliances which learning and skill under the blessing of god can afford towards rightly apprehending the general sense of itnot solicitous to find out doctrine in mere epistolary familiarity or facts in clear ad hominem et pro tempore allusions to national traditions                                       tertullian i think says he had seen the autograph copies of some of the apostles writings the truth is the ancient church was not guided by the mere fact of the genuineness of a writing in pronouncing it canonical its catholicity was the test applied to it i have not the smallest doubt that the epistle of barnabas is genuine but it is not catholic it is full of the greek gnosis though of the most simple and pleasing sort i think the same of hermas the church would never admit either into the canon although the alexandrians always read the epistle of barnabas in their churches for three hundred years together it was upwards of three centuries before the epistle to the hebrews was admitted and this on account of its greek gnosis at length by help of the venerable prefix of st pauls name its admirers happily for us succeeded                                       so little did the early bishops and preachers think their christian faith wrapped up in and solely to be learned from the new testamentindeed can it be said that there was any such collection for three hundred years that i remember a letter from 1 to a friend of his a bishop in the east in which he most evidently speaks of the christian scriptures as of works of which the bishop knew little or nothing  footnote 1 i have lost the name which mr coleridge mentioneded    april 4 1832  unitarianismmoral philosophy   i make the greatest difference between ans and isms i should deal insincerely with you if i said that i thought unitarianism was christianity no as i believe and have faith in the doctrine it is not the truth in jesus christ but god forbid that i should doubt that you and many other unitarians as you call yourselves are in a practical sense very good christians we do not win heaven by logic  by the by what do you mean by exclusively assuming the title of unitarians as if triunitarians were not necessarily unitarians as much pardon the illustration as an applepie must of course be a pie the schoolmen would perhaps have called you unicists but your proper name is psilanthropistsbelievers in the mere human nature of christ  upon my word if i may say so without offence i really think many forms of pantheistic atheism more agreeable to an imaginative mind than unitarianism as it is professed in terms in particular i prefer the spinosistic scheme infinitely the early socinians were to be sure most unaccountable logicians but when you had swallowed their bad reasoning you came to a doctrine on which the heart at least might rest for some support they adored jesus christ both laelius and faustus socinus laid down the adorability of jesus in strong terms i have nothing you know to do with their logic but unitarianism is in effect the worst of one kind of atheism joined to the worst of one kind of calvinism like two asses tied tail to tail it has no covenant with god and looks upon prayer as a sort of selfmagnetizinga getting of the body and temper into a certain status desirable per se but having no covenanted reference to the being to whom the prayer is addressed                                       the sum total of moral philosophy is found in this one question is good a superfluous wordor mere lazy synonyme for the pleasurable and its causesat most a mere modification to express degree and comparative duration of pleasureor the question may be more unanswerably stated thus is good superfluous as a word exponent of a kindif it be then moral philosophy is but a subdivision of physics if not then the writings of paley and all his predecessors and disciples are false and most pernicious and there is an emphatic propriety in the superlative and in a sense which of itself would supply and exemplify the difference between most and very    april 5 1832  moral law of polarity  it is curious to trace the operation of the moral law of polarity in the history of politics religion c when the maximum of one tendency has been attained there is no gradual decrease but a direct transition to its minimum till the opposite tendency has attained its maximum and then you see another corresponding revulsion with the restoration came in all at once the mechanicocorpuscular philosophy which with the increase of manufactures trade and arts made every thing in philosophy religion and poetry objective till at length attachment to mere external worldliness and forms got to its maximumwhen out burst the french revolution and with it every thing became immediately subjective without any object at all the rights of man the sovereignty of the people were subject and object both we are now i think on the turning point again this reform seems the ne plus ultra of that tendency of the public mind which substitutes its own undefined notions or passions for real objects and historical actualities there is not one of the

diseasequarantine   there are two grand divisions under which all contagious diseases may be classed1 those which spring from organized living beings and from the life in them and which enter as it were into the life of those in whom they reproduce themselvessuch as smallpox and measles these become so domesticated with the habit and system that they are rarely received twice 2 those which spring from dead organized or unorganized matter and which may be comprehended under the wide term malaria  you may have passed a stagnant pond a hundred times without injury you happen to pass it again in low spirits and chilled precisely at the moment of the explosion of the gas the malaria strikes on the cutaneous or venoglandular system and drives the blood from the surface the shivering fit comes on till the musculoarterial irritability reacts and then the hot fit succeeds and unless bark or arsenicparticularly bark because it is a bitter as well as a tonicbe applied to strengthen the veno glandular and to moderate the musculoarterial system a man may have the ague for thirty years together  but if instead of being exposed to the solitary malaria of a pond a man travelling through the pontine marshes permits his animal energies to flag and surrenders himself to the drowsiness which generally attacks him then blast upon blast strikes upon the cutaneous system and passes through it to the musculoarterial and so completely overpowers the latter that it cannot react and the man dies at once instead of only catching an ague  there are three factors of the operation of an epidemic or atmospheric disease the first and principal one is the predisposed state of the body secondly the specific virus in the atmosphere and thirdly the accidental circumstances of weather locality food occupation c against the second of these we are powerless its nature causes and sympathies are too subtle for our senses to find data to go upon against the first medicine may act profitably against the third a wise and sagacious medical police ought to be adopted but above all let every man act like a christian in all charity and love and brotherly kindness and sincere reliance on gods merciful providence  quarantine cannot keep out an atmospheric disease but it can and does always increase the predisposing causes of its reception    april 10 1832  harmony   all

geometrical figures all as it were depending on some point of sand relatively at rest sound a discord and every grain will whisk about without any order at all in no figures and with no points of rest

professions and thirdly when the press fell off from literature                                       common phrases are as it were so stereotyped now by conventional use that it is really much easier to write on the ordinary politics of the day in the common newspaper style than it is to make a good pair of shoes  an apprentice has as much to learn now to be a shoemaker as ever he had but an ignorant coxcomb with a competent want of honesty may very effectively wield a pen in a newspaper office with infinitely less pains and preparation than were necessary formerly    april 23 1832

subject now remaining for an epic poem a subject which like miltons fall of man should interest all christendom as the homeric war of troy interested all greece there would be difficulties as there are in all subjects and they must he mitigated and thrown into the shade as milton has done with the numerous difficulties in the paradise lost but there would be a greater assemblage of grandeur and splendour than can now be found in any other theme as for the old mythology incredulus odi and yet there must be a mythology or a quasimythology for an epic poem here there would be the completion of the propheciesthe termination of the first revealed national religion under the violent assault of paganism itself the immediate forerunner and condition of the spread of a revealed mundane religion

constitutiondemocracymilton and sidney   professor park talks1 about its being very doubtful whether the constitution described by blackstone ever in fact existed in the same manner i suppose it is doubtful whether the moon is made of green cheese or whether the souls of welchmen do in point of fact go to heaven on the backs of mites blackstones was the age of shallow law monarchy aristocracy and democracy as such exclude each the other but if the elements are to interpenetrate how absurd to call a lump of sugar hydrogen oxygen and carbon nay to take three lumps and call the first hydrogen the second oxygen and the third carbon dont you see that each is in all and all in each  the democracy of england before the reform bill was where it ought to be in the corporations the vestries the jointstock companies c the power in a democracy is in focal points without a centre and in proportion as such democratical power is strong the strength of the central government ought to be intenseotherwise the nation will fall to pieces  we have just now incalculably increased the democratical action of the people and at the same time weakened the executive power of the government  footnote 1 in his dogmas of the constitution four lectures on the theory and practice of the constitution delivered at the kings college london 1832 lecture i there was a stiffness and an occasional uncouthness in professor parks style but his two works the one just mentioned and his contreprojet to the humphreysian code are full of original views and vigorous reasonings to those who wished to see the profession of the law assume a more scientific character than for the most part it has hitherto done in england the early death of john james park was a very great lossed                                       it was the error of milton sidney and others of that age to think it possible to construct a purely aristocratical government defecated of all passion and ignorance and sordid motive the truth is such a government would be weak from its utter want of sympathy with the people to be governed by it    may 25 1832  de vi minimorumhahnemannluther   mercury strongly illustrates the

delightful work the translator should be a man deeply imbued with his bible with the english writers from henry the seventh to edward the sixth the scotch divines of the 16th century and with the old racy german1  hugo de saint victor luthers favourite divine was a wonderful man who in the 12th century the jubilant age of papal dominion nursed the lamp of platonic mysticism in the spirit of the most refined christianity2  footnote 1 mr coleridge was fond of pressing this proposed publicationi can scarcely conceive he says in the friend a more delightful volume than might be made from luthers letters especially those that were written from the warteburg if they were translated in the simple sinewy idiomatic hearty mother tongue of the original a difficult task i admit and scarcely possible

better parts of cicero and so on you may just with two or three exceptions arising out of the different idioms as to cases translate page after page into good mother english word by word without altering the order but you cannot do so with virgil or tibullus if you attempt it you will make nonsense                                       there is a remarkable power of the picturesque in the fragments we have of ennius actius and other very old roman writers this vivid manner was lost in the augustan age                                       much as the romans owed to greece in the beginning whilst their mind was as it were tuning itself to an aftereffort of its own music it suffered more in proportion by the influence of greek literature subsequently when it was already mature and ought to have worked for itself it then became a superfetation upon and not an ingredient in the national character with the exception of the stern pragmatic historian and the moral satirist it left nothing original to the latin muse1  a nation to be great ought to be compressed in its increment by nations more civilized than itselfas greece by persia and rome by etruria the italian states and carthage i remember commodore decatur saying to me at malta that he deplored the occupation of louisiana by the united states and wished that province had been possessed by england he thought that if the united states got hold of canada by conquest or cession the last chance of his country becoming a great compact nation would be lost  footnote 1 perhaps it left letterwriting also even if the platonic epistles are taken as genuine which mr coleridge to my surprise was inclined to believe they can hardly interfere i think with the uniqueness of the truly incomparable collections from the

hoy at the bluecoat school there was a charm for ones foot when asleep and i believe it had been in the school since its foundation in the time of edward the sixth the march of intellect has probably now exploded it it ran thus  foot foot foot is fast asleep thumb thumb thumb in spittle we steep crosses three we make to ease us two for the thieves and one for christ jesus  and the same charm served for a cramp in the leg with the following substitution  the devil is tying a knot in my leg mark luke and john unloose it i beg crosses three c  and really upon getting out of bed where the cramp most frequently occurred pressing the sole of the foot on the cold floor and then repeating this charm with the acts configurative thereupon prescribed i can safely affirm that i do not remember an instance in which the cramp did not go away in a few seconds  i should not wonder if it were equally good for a stitch in the side but i cannot say i ever tried it for that    july 7 1832  greekdual neuter plural and verb singulartheta   it is hardly possible to conceive a language more perfect than the greek if you compare it with the modern european tongues in the points of the position and relative bearing of the vowels and consonants on each other and of the variety of terminations it is incalculably before all in the former particulars and only equalled in the last by german but it is in variety of termination alone that the german surpasses the other modern languages as to sound for as to position nature seems to have dropped an acid into the language when aforming which curdled the vowels and made all the consonants flow together the spanish is excellent for variety of termination the italian in this particular the most deficient italian prose is excessively monotonous                                       it is very natural to have a dual duality being a conception quite distinct from plurality most very primitive languages have a dual as the greek welch and the native chilese as you will see in the abbé raynal  the neuter plural governing as they call it a verb singular is one of the many instances in greek of the inward and metaphysic grammar resisting successfully the tyranny of formal grammar in truth there may be multeity in things but there can only be plurality in persons  observe also that in fact a neuter noun in greek has no real nominative case though it has a formal one that is to say the same word with the accusative the reason isa thing has no subjectivity or nominative case it exists only as an object in the accusative or oblique case  it is extraordinary that the germans should not have retained or assumed the two beautifully discriminated sounds of the soft and hard theta as in thy thoughtsthe thin ether that c how particularly fine the hard theta is in an english termination as in that grand worddeath for which the germans gutturize a sound that puts you in mind of nothing but a loathsome toad

i never did so for the story itself as a story the only thing interesting to me was the principles to be evolved from and illustrated by the facts1 after i had gotten my principles i pretty generally left the facts to take care of themselves i never could remember any passages in books or the particulars of events except in the gross i can refer to them to be sure i must be a different sort of man from herder who once was seriously annoyed with himself because in recounting the pedigree of some german royal or electoral family he missed some one of those worthies and could not recall the name  footnote 1 the true origin of human events is so little susceptible of that kind of evidence which can compel our belief so many are the disturbing forces which in every cycle or ellipse of changes modify the motion given by the first projection and every age has or imagines it has its own circumstances which render past experience no longer applicable to the present case that there will never be wanting answers and explanations and specious flatteries of hope to persuade and perplex its government that the history of the past is inapplicable to their case and no wonder if we read history for the facts instead of reading it for the sake of the general principles which are to the facts as the root and sap of a tree to its leaves and no wonder if history so read should find a dangerous rival in novels nay if the latter should be preferred to the former on the score even of probability i well remember that when the examples of former jacobins as julius caesar cromwell and the like were adduced in france and england at the commencement of the french consulate it was ridiculed as pedantry and pedants ignorance to fear a repetition of usurpation and military despotism at the close of the enlightened eighteenth century even so in the very dawn of the late tempestuous day when the revolutions of corcyra the proscriptions of the reformers marius cæsar c and the direful effects of the levelling tenets in the peasants war in germany differenced from the tenets of the first french constitution only by the mode of wording them the figures of speech being borrowed in the one instance from theology and in the other from modern metaphysics were urged on the convention and its vindicators the magi of the day the true citizens of the world the plusquam perfecti of patriotism

1832  wordsworth   i have often wished that the first two books of the excursion had been published separately under the name of the deserted cottage they would have formed what indeed they are one of the most beautiful poems in the language                                       can dialogues in verse be defended i cannot but think that a great philosophical poet ought always to teach the reader himself as from himself a poem does not admit argumentation though it does admit development of thought in prose there may be a difference though i must confess that even in plato and cicero i am always vexed that the authors do not say what they have to say at once in their own persons the introductions and little urbanities are to be sure very delightful in their way i would not lose them but i have no admiration for the practice of ventriloquizing through another mans mouth                                       i cannot help regretting that wordsworth did not first publish his thirteen books on the growth of an individual mindsuperior as i used to think upon the whole to the excursion you may judge how i felt about them by my own poem upon the occasion1 then the plan laid out and i believe partly suggested by me was that wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose one whose principles were made up and so prepared to deliver upon authority a system of philosophy he was to treat man as man a subject of eye ear touch and taste in contact with external nature and informing the senses from the mind and not compounding a mind out of the senses then he was to describe the pastoral and other states of society assuming something of the juvenalian spirit as he approached the high civilization of cities and towns and opening a melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice thence he was to infer and reveal the proof of and necessity for the whole state of man and society being subject to and illustrative of a redemptive process in operation showing how this idea reconciled all the anomalies and promised future glory and restoration something of this sort was i think agreed on it is in substance what i have been all my life doing in my system of philosophy  footnote 1 poetical works vol i p 206 it is not too much to say of this beautiful poem and yet it is difficult to say more that it is at once worthy of the poet his subject and his object    an orphic song indeed a song divine of high and passionate thoughts to their own music chanteded                                       i think wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great philosophic poet than any man i ever knew or as i believe has existed in england since milton but it seems to me that he ought never to have abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarlyperhaps i might say exclusivelyfitted for him his proper title is spectator ab extra                                       july 23 1832  french revolution  no man was more

being towards man either in time past or future or in the hidden depths where time and space are not this was i believe no more than a vivid expression of what he always maintained that no man had

rooted in the common maltese and is cherished with such a superstitious nationality that the government would run the chance of exciting a tumult if it or its representatives unwarily ridiculed it the supposition itself is quite absurd not to argue the matter at length consider these few conclusive factsthe narrative speaks of the barbarous people and barbarians1 of the island now our malta was at that time fully peopled and highly civilized as we may surely infer from cicero and other writers2 a viper comes out from the sticks upon the fire being lighted the men are not surprised at the appearance of the snake but imagine first a murderer and then a god from the harmless attack now in our malta there are i may say no snakes at all which to be sure the maltese attribute to st pauls having cursed them away melita in the adriatic was a perfectly barbarous island as to its native population and was and is now infested with serpents besides the context shows that the scene is in the adriatic  footnote 1 acts xxviii 2 and 4 mr c seemed to think that the greek words had reference to something more than the fact of the islanders not speaking latin or greek the classical meaning of greek barbaroied  footnote 2 upwards of a century before the reign of nero cicero speaks at considerable length of our malta in one of the verrine orations see act ii lib iv c 46 insula est melita

allthe present product of malta cicero describes an ancient temple of juno situated on a promontory near the town so famous and revered that even in the time of masinissa at least 150 years bc that prince had religiously restored some relics which his admiral had taken from it the plunder of this very temple is an article of accusation against verres and a deputation of maltese legati melitenses came to rome to establish the charge these are all the facts i think which can be gathered from cicero because i consider his expression of nudatae urbes in the working up of this article a piece of rhetoric strabo merely marks the position of melita and says that the lapdogs called greek kunidia melitaia were sent from this island though some writers attribute them to the other melite in the

north hate england with increasing bitterness whilst amongst those of the south who are jacobins the british connection has become popular can there ever be any thorough national fusion of the northern and southern states i think not in fact the union will be shaken almost to dislocation whenever a very serious question between the states arises the american union has no centre and it is impossible now to make one the more they extend their borders into the indians land the weaker will the national cohesion be but i look upon the states as splendid masses to be used by and by in the

be extranational it unhappily became royal instead its proper bearing is intermediate between the crown and the people with an inclination to the latter                                       the present prospects of the church weigh heavily on my soul oh that the words of a statesmanlike philosophy could win their way through the ignorant zealotry and sordid vulgarity of the leaders of the day    february 5 1833  union with ireland   if any modification of the union takes place i trust it will be a total divorce a vinculo matrimonii i am sure we have lived a cat and dog life of it let us have no silly saving of one crown and two legislatures that would be preserving all the mischiefs without any of the goods if there are any of the union  i am deliberately of opinion that england in all its institutions has received injury from its union with ireland my only difficulty is as to the protestants to whom we owe protection but i cannot forget that the protestants themselves have greatly aided in accelerating the present horrible state of things by using that as a remedy and a reward which should have been to them an opportunity1  if the protestant church in ireland is removed of course the romish church must be established in its place there can be no resisting it in common reason  how miserably imbecile and objectless has the english government of ireland been for forty years past oh for a great manbut one really great man who could feel the weight and the power of a principle and unflinchingly put it into act but truly there is no vision in the land and the people accordingly perisheth see how triumphant in debate and in action oconnell is why because he asserts a broad principle and acts up to it rests all his body on it and has faith in it our ministerstrue whigs in that have faith in nothing but expedients de die in diem indeed what principles of government can they have who in the space of a month recanted a life of political opinions and now dare to threaten this and that innovation at the huzza of a mob or in pique at a parliamentary defeat  footnote 1 whatever may be thought of the settlement that followed the battle of the boyne and the extinction of the war in ireland yet when this had been made and submitted to it would have been the far wiser policy i doubt not to have provided for the safety of the constitution by improving the quality of the elective franchise leaving the eligibility open or like the former limited only by considerations of property still however the scheme of exclusion and disqualification had its plausible side the ink was scarcely dry on the parchmentrolls and proscriptionlists of the popish parliament the crimes of the man were generalized into attributes of his faith and the irish catholics collectively were held accomplices in the perfidy and baseness of the king alas his immediate adherents had afforded too great colour to the charge the irish massacre was in the mouth of every protestant not as an event to be remembered but as a thing of recent expectation fear still blending with the sense of deliverance at no time therefore could the disqualifying system have been enforced with so little reclamation of the conquered party or with so little outrage on the general feeling of the country there was no time when it was so capable of being indirectly useful as a sedative in order to the application of the remedies directly indicated or as a counterpower reducing to inactivity whatever disturbing forces might have interfered with their operation and had this use been made of these exclusive laws and had they been enforced as the precursors and negative conditionsbut above all as bonâ fide accompaniments of a process of emancipation properly and worthily so named the code would at this day have been remembered in ireland only as when recalling a dangerous fever of our boyhood we think of the nauseous drugs and drenchinghorn and congratulate ourselves that our doctors nowadays know how to manage these things less coarsely but this angry code was neglected as an opportunity and mistaken for a substitute et hinc illae lacrymaechurch and state p 195                                        i sometimes think it just possible that the dissenters may once more be animated by a wiser and nobler spirit and see their dearest interest in the church of england as the bulwark and glory of protestantism as they did at the revolution but i doubt their being able to resist the low factious malignity to the church which has characterized them as a body for so many years    february 16 1833   faustmichael scott goethe schiller and wordsworth   before i had ever seen any part of goethes faust1 though of course when i was familiar enough with marlowes i conceived and drew up the plan of a work a drama which was to be to my mind what the faust was to goethes my faust was old michael scott a much better and more likely original than faust he appeared in the midst of his college of devoted disciples enthusiastic ebullient shedding around him bright surmises of discoveries fully perfected in aftertimes and inculcating the study of nature and its secrets as the pathway to the acquisition of power he did not love knowledge for itselffor its own exceeding great rewardbut in order to be powerful this poisonspeck infected his mind from the beginning the priests suspect him circumvent him accuse him he is condemned and thrown into solitary confinement this constituted the prologus of the drama a pause of four or five years takes place at the end of which michael escapes from prison a soured gloomy miserable man he will not cannot study of what avail had all his study been to him his knowledge great as it was had failed to preserve him from the cruel fangs of the persecutors he could not command the lightning or the storm to wreak their furies upon the heads of those whom he hated and contemned and yet feared away with learning away with study to the winds with all pretences to knowledge we know nothing we are fools wretches mere beasts anon i began to tempt him i made him dream gave him wine and passed the most exquisite of women before him but out of his reach is there then no knowledge by which these pleasures can be commanded that way lay witchcraft and accordingly to witchcraft michael turns with all his soul he has many failures and some successes he learns the chemistry of exciting drugs and exploding powders and some of the properties of transmitted and reflected light his appetites and his curiosity are both stimulated and his old craving for power and mental domination over others revives at last michael tries to raise the devil and the devil comes at his call my devil was to be like goethes the universal humorist who should make all things vain and nothing worth by a perpetual collation of the great with the little in the presence of the infinite i had many a trick for him to play some better i think than any in the faust in the mean time michael is miserable he has power but no peace and he every day more keenly feels the tyranny of hell surrounding him in vain he seems to himself to assert the most absolute empire over the devil by imposing the most extravagant tasks one thing is as easy as another to the devil what next michael is repeated every day with more imperious servility michael groans in spirit his power is a curse he commands women and wine but the women seem fictitious and devilish and the wine does not make him drunk he now begins to hate the devil and tries to cheat him he studies again and explores the darkest depths of sorcery for a receipt to cozen hell but all in vain sometimes the devils finger turns over the page for him and points out an experiment and michael hears a whispertry that michael the horror increases and michael feels that he is a slave and a condemned criminal lost to hope he throws himself into every sensual excessin the midcareer of which he sees agatha my margaret and immediately endeavours to seduce her agatha loves him and the devil facilitates their meetings but she resists michaels attempts to ruin her and implores him not to act so as to forfeit her esteem long struggles of passion ensue in the result of which his affections are called forth against his appetites and loveborn the idea of a redemption of the lost will dawns upon his mind this is instantaneously perceived by the devil and for the first time the humorist becomes severe and menacing a fearful succession of conflicts between michael and the devil takes place in which agatha helps and suffers in the end after subjecting him to every imaginable horror and agony i made him triumphant and poured peace into his soul in the conviction of a salvation for sinners through gods grace  the intended theme of the faust is the consequences of a misology or hatred and depreciation of knowledge caused by an originally intense thirst for knowledge baffled but a love of knowledge for itself and for pure ends would never produce such a misology but only a love of it for base and unworthy purposes there is neither causation nor progression in the faust he is a readymade conjuror from the very beginning the incredulus odi is felt from the first line the sensuality and the thirst after knowledge are unconnected with each other mephistopheles and margaret are excellent but faust himself is dull and meaningless the scene in auerbachs cellars is one of the best perhaps the very best that on the brocken is also fine and all the songs are beautiful but there is no whole in the poem the scenes are mere magiclantern pictures and a large part of the work is to me very flat the german is very pure and fine  the young men in germany and england who admire lord byron prefer goethe to schiller but you may depend upon it goethe does not nor ever will command the common mind of the people of germany as schiller does schiller had two legitimate phases in his intellectual characterthe first as author of the robbersa piece which must not be considered with reference to shakspeare but as a work of the mere material sublime and in that line it is undoubtedly very powerful indeed it is quite genuine and deeply imbued with schillers own soul after this he outgrew the composition of such plays as the robbers and at once took his true and only rightful stand in the grand historical dramathe wallensteinnot the intense drama of passionhe was not master of thatbut the diffused drama of history in which alone he had ample scope for his varied powers the wallenstein is the greatest of his works it is not unlike shakspeares historical playsa species by itself you may take up any scene and it will please you by itself just as you may in don quixote which you read through once or twice only but which you read in repeatedly after this point it was that goethe and other writers injured by their theories the steadiness and originality of schillers mind and in every one of his works after the wallenstein you may perceive the fluctuations of his taste and principles of composition he got a notion of reintroducing the characterlessness of the greek tragedy with a chorus as in the bride of messina and he was for infusing more lyric verse into it schiller sometimes affected to despise the robbers and the other works of his first youth whereas he ought to have spoken of them as of works not in a right line but full of excellence in their way in his ballads and lighter lyrics goethe is most excellent it is impossible to praise him too highly in this respect i like the wilhelm meister the best of his prose works but neither schillers nor goethes prose style approaches to lessings whose writings for manner are absolutely perfect  although wordsworth and goethe are not much alike to be sure upon the whole yet they both have this peculiarity of utter nonsympathy with the subjects of their poetry they are always both of them spectators ab extrafeeling for but never with their characters schiller is a thousand times more hearty than goethe  i was once pressedmany years agoto translate the faust and i so far entertained the proposal as to read the work through with great attention and to revive in my mind my own former plan of michael scott but then i considered with myself whether the time taken up in executing the translation might not more worthily be devoted to the composition of a work which even if parallel in some points to the faust should be truly original in motive and execution and therefore more interesting and valuable than any version which i could make and secondly i debated with myself whether it became my moral character to render into englishand so far certainly lend my countenance to languagemuch of which i thought vulgar licentious and blasphemous i need not tell you that i never put pen to paper as a translator of faust  i have read a good deal of mr haywards version and i think it done in a very manly style but i do not admit the argument for prose translations i would in general rather see verse attempted in so capable a language as ours the french cannot help themselves of course with such a language as theirs  footnote 1 the poem was first published in 1790 and forms the commencement of the seventh volume of goethes schriften wien und leipzig bey j stahel and g j goschen 1790 this edition is now before me the poem entitled faust ein fragment not doktor faust ein trauerspiel as döring says and contains no prologue or dedication of any sort it commences with the scene in fausts study antè p 17 and is continued as now down to the passage ending antè p 26 line 5 in the original the line    und froh ist wenn er regenwürmer findet  ends the scene  the next scene is one between faust and mephistopheles and begins thus    und was der ganzen menschheit zugetheilt ist  i e with the passage antè  p 70 beginning i will enjoy in my own hearts core all that is parcelled out among mankind c all that intervenes in later editions is wanting it is thenceforth continued as now to the end of the cathedral scene antè p 170 except that the whole scene in which valentine is killed is wanting thus margarets prayer to the virgin and the cathedral scene come together and form the conclusion of the work according to dürings verzeichniss there was no new edition of faust until 1807 according to dr sieglitz the first part of faust first appeared in its present shape in the collected edition of goethes works which was published in 1808haywards translation of faust second edition note p 215    february 17 1833  beaumont and fletcherben jonsonmassinger   in the romantic drama beaumont and fletcher are almost supreme their plays are in general most truly delightful i could read the beggars bush from morning to night how sylvan and sunshiny it is the little french lawyer is excellent lawrit is conceived and executed from first to last in genuine comic humour monsieur thomas is also capital i have no doubt whatever that the first act and the first scene of the second act of the two noble kinsmen are shakspeares beaumont and fletchers plots are to be sure wholly inartificial they only care to pitch a character into a position to make him or her talk you must swallow all their gross improbabilities and taking it all for granted attend only to the dialogue how lamentable it is that no gentleman and scholar can he found to edit these beautiful plays1 did the name of criticism ever descend so low as in the hands of those two fools and knaves seward and simpson there are whole scenes in their edition which i could with certainty put back into their original verse and more that could he replaced in their native prose was there ever such an absolute disregard of literary fame as that displayed by shakspeare and beaumont and fletcher2  footnote 1 i believe mr dyce could edit beaumont and fletcher as well as any man of the present or last generation but the truth is the limited sale of the late editions of ben jonson shirley c has damped the spirit of enterprise amongst the respectable publishers still i marvel that some cheap reprint of b and f is not undertakened  footnote 2 the men of the greatest genius as far as we can judge from their own works or from the accounts of their contemporaries appear to have been of calm and tranquil temper in all that related to themselves in the inward assurance of permanent fame they seem to have been either indifferent or resigned with regard to immediate reputation                                       shakspeares evenness and sweetness of temper were almost proverbial in his own age that this did not arise from ignorance of his own comparative greatness we have abundant proof in his sonnets which could scarcely have been known to mr pope when he asserted that our great bard grew immortal in his own despitebiog lit vol i p 32                                       in ben jonson you have an intense and burning art some of his plots that of the alchemist for example are perfect ben jonson and beaumont and fletcher would if united have made a great dramatist indeed and yet not have come near shakspeare but no doubt ben jonson was the greatest man after shakspeare in that age of dramatic genius   the styles of massingers plays and the sampson agonistes are the two extremes of the arc within which the diction of dramatic poetry may oscillate shakspeare in his great plays is the midpoint in the samson agonistes colloquial language is left at the greatest distance yet something of it is preserved to render the dialogue probable in massinger the style is differenced but differenced in the smallest degree possible from animated conversation by the vein of poetry  theres such a divinity doth hedge our shakspeare round that we cannot even imitate his style i tried to imitate his manner in the remorse and when i had done i found i had been tracking beaumont and fletcher and massinger instead it is really very curious at first sight shakspeare and his contemporary dramatists seem to write in styles much alike nothing so easy as to fall into that of massinger and the others whilst no one has ever yet produced one scene conceived and expressed in the shakspearian idiom i suppose it is because shakspeare is universal and in fact has no manner just as you can so much more readily copy a picture than nature herself    february 20 1833  house of commons appointing the officers of the army and navy   i was just now reading sir john cam hobhouses answer to mr hume i believe upon the point of transferring the patronage of the army and navy from the crown to the house of commons i think if i had been in the house of commons i would have said that ten or fifteen years ago i should have considered sir j c hs speech quite unanswerableit being clear constitutional law that the house of commons has not nor ought to have any share directly or indirectly in the appointment of the officers of the army or navy but now that the king had been reduced by the means and procurement of the honourable baronet and his friends to a puppet which so far from having any independent will of its own could not resist a measure which it hated and condemned it became a matter of grave consideration whether it was not necessary to vest the appointment of such officers in a body like the house of commons rather than in a junta of ministers who were obliged to make common cause with the mob and democratic press for the sake of keeping their places    march 9 1833  penal code in irelandchurchmen   the penal code in ireland in the beginning of the last century was justifiable as a temporary mean of enabling government to take breath and look about them and if right measures had been systematically pursued in a right spirit there can be no doubt that all or the greater part of ireland would have become protestant protestantism under the charter schools was greatly on the increase in the early part of that century and the complaints of the romish priests to that effect are on record but unfortunately the drenchinghorn was itself substituted for the medicine                                       there seems to me at present to be a curse upon the english church and upon the governors of all institutions connected with the orderly advancement of national piety and knowledge it is the curse of prudence as they miscall itin fact of fear  clergymen are now almost afraid to explain in their pulpits the grounds of their being protestants they are completely cowed by the vulgar harassings of the press and of our hectoring sciolists in parliament there should be no party politics in the pulpit to be sure but every church in england ought to resound with national politicsi mean the sacred character of the national church and an exposure of the base robbery from the nation itselffor so indeed it is1about to be committed by these ministers in order to have a sop to throw to the irish agitators who will of course only cut the deeper and come the oftener you cannot buy off a barbarous invader  footnote 1 that the maxims of a pure morality and those sublime truths of the divine unity and attributes which a plato found it hard to learn and more difficult to reveal that these should have become the almost hereditary property of childhood and poverty of the hovel and the workshop that even to the unlettered they sound as commonplace this is a phenomenon which must withhold all but minds of the most vulgar cast from undervaluing the services even of the pulpit and the readingdesk yet he who should confine the efficiency of an established church to these can hardly be placed in a much higher rank of intellect that to every parish throughout the kingdom there is transplanted a germ of civilization that in the remotest villages there is a nucleus round which the capabilities of the place may crystallize and brighten a model sufficiently superior to excite yet sufficiently near to encourage and facilitate imitation this unobtrusive continuous agency of a protestant church establishment this it is which the patriot and the philanthropist who would fain unite the love of peace with the faith in the progressive amelioration of mankind cannot estimate at too high a price it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price of wisdom is above rubiesthe clergyman is with his parishioners and among them he is neither in the cloistered cell nor in the wilderness but a neighbour and family man whose education and rank admit him to the mansion of the rich landholder while his duties make him the frequent visitor of the farmhouse and the cottage he is or he may become connected with the families of his parish or its vicinity by marriage and among the instances of the blindness or at best of the shortsightedness which it is the nature of cupidity to inflict i know few more striking than the clamours of the farmers against church property whatever was not paid to the clergyman would inevitably at the next lease be paid to the landholder while as the case at present stands the revenues of the church are in some sort the reversionary property of every family that may have a member educated for the church or a daughter that may marry a clergyman instead of being foreclosed and immovable it is in fact the only species of landed property that is essentially moving and circulative that there exist no inconveniences who will pretend to assertbut i have yet to expect the proof that the inconveniences are greater in this than in any other species or that either the farmers or the clergy would be benefited by forcing the latter to become either trullibers or salaried placemenchurch and state p 90    march 12 1833  coronation oaths   lord grey has in parliament said two things first that the coronation oaths only bind the king in his executive capacity and secondly that members of the house of commons are bound to represent by their votes the wishes and opinions of their constituents and not their own put these two together and tell me what useful part of the constitutional monarchy of england remains it is clear that the coronation oaths would be no better than highgate oaths for in his executive capacity the king cannot do any thing against the doing of which the oaths bind him it is only in his legislative character that he possesses a free agency capable of being bound the nation meant to bind that    march 14 1833  divinityprofessions and trades   divinity is essentially the first of the professions because it is necessary for all at all times law and physic are only necessary for some at some times i speak of them of course not in their abstract existence but in their applicability to man                                       every true science bears necessarily within itself the germ of a cognate profession and the more you can elevate trades into professions the better    march 17 1833  modern political economy   what solemn humbug this modern political economy is what is there true of the little that is true in their dogmatic books which is not a simple deduction from the moral and religious credenda and agenda of any good man and with which we were not all previously acquainted and upon which every man of common sense instinctively acted i know none but what they truly state they do not truly understand in its ultimate grounds and causes and hence they have sometimes done more mischief by their half ignorant and halfsophistical reasonings about and deductions from well founded positions than they could have done by the promulgation of positive error this particularly applies to their famous ratios of increase between man and the means of his subsistence political economy at the highest can never be a pure science you may demonstrate that certain properties inhere in the arch which yet no bridgebuilder can ever reduce into brick and mortar but an abstract conclusion in a matter of political economy the premisses of which neither exist now nor ever will exist within the range of the wildest imagination is not a truth but a chimeraa practical falsehood for there are no theorems in political economybut problems only certain things being actually so and so the question is how to do so and so with them political philosophy indeed points to ulterior ends but even those ends are all practical and if you desert the conditions of reality or of common probability you may show forth your eloquence or your fancy but the utmost you can produce will be a utopia or oceana  you talk about making this article cheaper by reducing its price in the market from 8d to 6d but suppose in so doing you have rendered your country weaker against a foreign foe suppose you have demoralized thousands of your fellowcountrymen and have sown discontent between one class of society and another your article is tolerably dear i take it after all is not its real price enhanced to every christian and patriot a hundredfold                                       all is an endless fleeting abstraction the whole is a reality    march 31 1833  national debtproperty taxduty of landholders  what evil results now to this country taken at large from the actual existence of the national debt i never could get a plain and practical answer to that question i do not advert to the past loss of capital although it is hard to see how that capital can be said to have been unproductive which produces in the defence of the nation itself the conditions of the permanence and productivity of all other capital as to taxation to pay the interest how can the country suffer by a process under which the money is never one minute out of the pockets of the people you may just as well say that a man is weakened by the circulation of his blood there may certainly be particular local evils and grievances resulting from the mode of taxation or collection but how can that debt be in any proper sense a burthen to the nation which the nation owes to itself and to no one but itself it is a juggle to talk of the nation owing the capital or the interest to the stockholders it owes to itself only suppose the interest to be owing to the emperor of russia and then you would feel the difference of a debt in the proper sense it is really and truly nothing more in effect than so much moneys or moneys worth raised annually by the state for the purpose of quickening industry1  i should like to see a well graduated property tax accompanied by a large loan  one common objection to a property tax is that it tends to diminish the accumulation of capital in my judgment one of the chief sources of the bad economy of the country now is the enormous aggregation of capitals  when shall we return to a sound conception of the right to property namely as being official implying and demanding the performance of commensurate duties nothing but the most horrible perversion of humanity and moral justice under the specious name of political economy could have blinded men to this truth as to the possession of landthe law of god having connected indissolubly the cultivation of every rood of earth with the maintenance and watchful labour of man but money stock riches by credit transferable and convertible at will are under no such obligations and unhappily it is from the selfish autocratic possession of such property that our landholders have learnt their present theory of trading with that which was never meant to be an object of commerce  footnote 1 see the splendid essay in the friend vol ii p 47 on the vulgar errors respecting taxes and taxation  a great statesman lately deceased in one of his antiministerial harangues against some proposed impost said the nation has been already bled in every vein and is faint with loss of blood this blood however was circulating in the mean time through the whole body of the state and what was received into one chamber of the heart was instantly sent out again at the other portal had he wanted a metaphor to convey the possible injuries of taxation he might have found one less opposite to the fact in the known disease of aneurism or relaxation of the coats of particular vessels by a disproportionate accumulation of blood in them which sometimes occurs when the circulation has been suddenly and violently changed and causes helplessness or even mortal stagnation though the total quantity of blood remains the same in the system at large  but a fuller and fairer symbol of taxation both in its possible good and evil effects is to be found in the evaporation of waters from the surface of the earth the sun may draw up the moisture from the river the morass and the ocean to be given back in genial showers to the garden to the pasture and the corn field but it may likewise force away the moisture from the fields of tillage to drop it on the stagnant pool the saturated swamp or the unprofitable sandwaste the gardens in the south of europe supply perhaps a not less apt illustration of a system of finance judiciously conducted where the tanks or reservoirs would represent the capital of a nation and the hundred rills hourly varying their channels and directions under the gardeners spade give a pleasing image of the dispersion of that capital through the whole population by the joint effect of taxation and trade for taxation itself is a part of commerce and the government maybe fairly considered as a great manufacturing house carrying on in different places by means of its partners and overseers the trades of the shipbuilder the clothier the ironfounder c ced    april 5 1833  massingershakspearehieronimo   to please me a poem must be either music or sense if it is neither i confess i cannot interest myself in it                                       the first act of the virgin martyr is as fine an act as i remember in any play the very woman is i think one of the most perfect plays we have there is some good fun in the first scene between don john or antonio and cuculo his master1 and can any thing exceed the skill and sweetness of the scene between him and his mistress in which he relates his story2 the bondman is also a delightful play massinger is always entertaining his plays have the interest of novels  but like most of his contemporaries except shakspeare massinger often deals in exaggerated passion malefort senior in the unnatural combat however he may have had the moral will to be so wicked could never have actually done all that he is represented as guilty of without losing his senses he would have been in fact mad regan and goneril are the only pictures of the unnatural in shakspeare the pure unnaturaland you will observe that shakspeare has left their hideousness unsoftened or diversified by a single line of goodness or common human frailty whereas in edmund for whom passion the sense of shame as a bastard and ambition offer some plausible excuses shakspeare has placed many redeeming traits edmund is what under certain circumstances any man of powerful intellect might be if some other qualities and feelings were cut off hamlet is inclusively an edmund but different from him as a whole on account of the controlling agency of other principles which edmund had not  it is worth while to remark the use which shakspeare always makes of his bold villains as vehicles for expressing opinions and conjectures of a nature too hazardous for a wise man to put forth directly as his own or from any sustained

point out to a half line what is really shakspeares in loves labour lost and some other of the not entirely genuine plays what he wrote in that play is of his earliest manner having the allpervading sweetness which he never lost and that extreme condensation which makes the couplets fall into epigrams as in the venus and adonis and rape of lucrece 1 in the drama alone as shakspeare soon found out could the sublime poet and profound philosopher find the conditions of a compromise in the loves labour lost there are many faint sketches of some of his vigorous portraits in afterlifeas for example in particular of benedict and beatrice2  footnote 1 in shakspeares poems the creative power and the intellectual energy wrestle as in a war embrace each in its excess of strength seems to threaten the extinction of the other at length in the drama they were reconciled and fought each with its shield before the breast of the other or like two rapid streams that at their first meeting within narrow and rocky banks mutually strive to repel each other and intermix reluctantly and in tumult but soon finding a wider channel and more yielding shores blend and dilate and flow on in one current and with one voicebiog lit vol ii p 21  footnote 2 mr coleridge of course alluded to biron and rosaline and there are other obvious prolusions as the scene of the masque with the courtiers compared with the play in a midsummer nights dreamed                                        gifford has done a great deal for the text of massinger but not as much as might easily be done his comparison of shakspeare with his contemporary dramatists is obtuse indeed1  footnote 1 see his introduction to massinger voli p 79 in which amongst other most extraordinary assertions mr gifford pronounces that rhythmical modulation is not one of shakspeares meritsed                                       in shakspeare one sentence begets the next naturally the meaning is all inwoven he goes on kindling like a meteor through the dark atmosphere yet when the creation in its outline is once perfect then he seems to rest from his labour and to smile upon his work and tell himself that it is very good you see many scenes and parts of scenes which are simply shakspeares disporting himself in joyous triumph and vigorous fun after a great achievement of his highest genius                                       the old dramatists took great liberties in respect of bringing parties in scene together and representing one as not recognizing the other under some faint disguise some of their finest scenes are constructed on this ground shakspeare avails himself of this artifice only twice i thinkin twelfth night where the two are with great skill kept apart till the end of the play and in the comedy of errors which is a pure farce and should be so considered the definition of a farce is an improbability or even impossibility granted in the outset see what odd and laughable events will fairly follow from it    april 8 1833  statesmenburke  i never was much subject to violent political humours or accesses of feelings when i was very young i wrote and spoke very enthusiastically but it was always on subjects connected with some grand general principle the violation of which i thought i could point out as to mere details of administration i honestly thought that ministers and men in office must of course know much better than any private person could possibly do and it was not till i went to malta and had to correspond with official characters myself that i fully understood the extreme shallowness and ignorance with which men of some note too were able after a certain fashion to carry on the government of important departments of the empire i then quite assented to oxenstierns saying nescis mi fili quam parva sapientia regitur mundus                                       burke was indeed a great man no one ever read history so philosophically as he seems to have done yet until he could associate his general principles with some sordid interest panic of property jacobinism c he was a mere dinner bell hence you will find so many half truths in his speeches and writings nevertheless let us heartily acknowledge his transcendant greatness he would have been more influential if he had less surpassed his contemporaries as fox and pitt men of much inferior minds in all respects                                       as a telegraph supposes a correspondent telescope so a scientific lecture requires a scientific audience    april 9 1833  prospect of monarchy or democracythe reformed house of commons   i have a deep though paradoxical conviction that most of the european nations are more or less on their way unconsciously indeed to pure monarchy that is to a government in which under circumstances of complicated and subtle control the reason of the people shall become efficient in the apparent will of the king1 as it seems to me the wise and good in every country will in all likelihood become every day more and more disgusted with the representative form of government brutalized as it is and will be by the predominance of democracy in england france and belgium the statesmen of antiquity we know doubted the possibility of the effective and permanent combination of the three elementary forms of government and perhaps they had more reason than we have been accustomed to think  footnote 1 this is backing vico against spinosa it must however be acknowledged that at present the prophet of democracy has a good right to be considered the favouriteed                                       you see how this house of commons has begun to verify all the ill prophecies that were made of itlow vulgar meddling with every thing assuming universal competency flattering every base passion and sneering at every thing noble refined and truly national the direct and personal despotism will come on by and by after the multitude shall have been gratified with the ruin and the spoil of the old institutions of the land as for the house of lords what is the use of ever so much fiery spirit if there be no principle to guide and to sanctify it    april 10 1833  united states of americacaptain b hallnorthern and southern states democracy with slaveryquakers   the possible destiny of the united states of americaas a nation of a hundred millions of freemenstretching from the atlantic to the pacific living under the laws of alfred and speaking the language of shakspeare and milton is an august conception why should we not wish to see it realized america would then be england viewed through a solar microscope great britain in a state of glorious magnification how deeply to be lamented is the spirit of hostility and sneering which some of the popular books of travels have shown in treating of the americans they hate us no doubt just as brothers hate but they respect the opinion of an englishman concerning themselves ten times as much as that of a native of any other country on earth a very little humouring of their prejudices and some courtesy of language and demeanour on the part of englishmen would work wonders even as it is with the public mind of the americans                                       captain basil halls book is certainly very entertaining and instructive but in my judgment his sentiments upon many points and more especially his mode of expression are unwise and uncharitable after all are not most of the things shown up with so much bitterness by him mere national foibles parallels to which every people has and must of necessity have                               what you say about the quarrel in the united states is sophistical no doubt taxation may and perhaps in some cases must press unequally or apparently so on different classes of people in a state in such cases there is a hardship but in the long run the matter is fully compensated to the overtaxed class for example take the householders of london who complain so bitterly of the house and window taxes is it not pretty clear that whether such householder be a tradesman who indemnifies himself in the price of his goodsor a letter of lodgings who does so in his rent or a stockholder who receives it back again in his dividendsor a country gentleman who has saved so much fresh levy on his land or his other propertyone way or other it comes at last pretty nearly to the same thing though the pressure for the time may be unjust and vexatious and fit to be removed but when new england which may be considered a state in itself taxes the admission of foreign manufactures in order to cherish manufactures of its own and thereby forces the carolinians another state of itself with which there is little intercommunion which has no such desire or interest to serve to buy worse articles at a higher price it is altogether a different question and is in fact downright tyranny of the worst because of the most sordid kind what would you think of a law which should tax every person in devonshire for the pecuniary benefit of every person in yorkshire and yet that is a feeble image of the actual usurpation of the new england deputies over the property of the southern states                               there are two possible modes of unity in a state one by absolute coordination of each to all and of all to each the other by subordination of classes and offices now i maintain that there never was an instance of the first nor can there be without slavery as its condition and accompaniment as in athens the poor swiss cantons are no exception  the mistake lies in confounding a state which must be based on classes and interests and unequal property with a church which is founded on the person and has no qualification but personal merit such a community may exist as in the case of the quakers but in order to exist it must be compressed and hedged in by another societymundus mundulus in mundo immundo                                       the free class in a slave state is always in one sense the most patriotic class of people in an empire for their patriotism is not simply the patriotism of other people but an aggregate of lust of power and distinction and supremacy    april 11 1833  land and money   land was the only species of property which in the old time carried any respectability with it money alone apart from some tenure of land not only did not make the possessor great and respectable but actually made him at once the object of plunder and hatred witness the history of the jews in this country in the early reigns after the conquest                               i have no objection to your aspiring to the political principles of our old cavaliers but embrace them all fully and not merely this and that feeling whilst in other points you speak the canting foppery of the benthamite or malthusian schools    april 14 1833  methods of investigation   there are three ways of treating a subject  in the first mode you begin with a definition and that definition is necessarily assumed as the truth as the argument proceeds the conclusion from the first proposition becomes the base of the second and so on now it is quite impossible that you can be sure that you have included all the necessary and none but the necessary terms in your definition as therefore you proceed the original speck of error is multiplied at every remove the same infirmity of knowledge besetting each successive definition hence you may set out like spinosa with all but the truth and end with a conclusion which is altogether monstrous and yet the mere deduction shall be irrefragable warburtons divine legation is also a splendid instance of this mode of discussion and of its inability to lead to the truth in fact it is an attempt to adopt the mathematical series of proof in forgetfulness that the mathematician is sure of the truth of his definition at each remove because he creates it as he can do in pure figure and number but you cannot make any thing true which results from or is connected with real externals you can only find it out the chief use of this first mode of discussion is to sharpen the wit for which purpose it is the best exercitation  2 the historical mode is a very common one in it the author professes to find out the truth by collecting the facts of the case and tracing them downwards but this mode is worse than the other suppose the question is as to the true essence and character of the english constitution first where will you begin your collection of facts where will you end it what facts will you select and how do you know that the class of facts which you select are necessary terms in the premisses and that other classes of facts which you neglect are not necessary and how do you distinguish phenomena which proceed from disease or accident from those which are the genuine fruits of the essence of the constitution what can be more striking in illustration of the utter inadequacy of this line of investigation for arriving at the real truth than the political treatises and constitutional histories which we have in every library a whig proves his case convincingly to the reader who knows nothing beyond his author then comes an old tory carte for instance and ferrets up a hamperful of conflicting documents and notices which proves his case per contra a takes this class of facts b takes that class each proves something true neither proves the truth or any thing like the truth that is the whole truth  3 you must therefore commence with the philosophic idea of the thing the true nature of which you wish to find out and manifest you must carry your rule ready made if you wish to measure aright if you ask me how i can know that this ideamy own inventionis the truth by which the phenomena of history are to be explained i answer in the same way exactly that you know that your eyes were made to see with and that is because you do see with them if i propose to you an idea or selfrealizing theory of the constitution which shall manifest itself as in existence from the earliest times to the presentwhich shall comprehend within it all the facts which history has preserved and shall give them a meaning as interchangeably causals or effectsif i show you that such an event or reign was an obliquity to the right hand and how produced and such other event or reign a deviation to the left and whence originatingthat the growth was stopped here accelerated therethat such a tendency is and always has been corroborative and such other tendency destructive of the main progress of the idea towards realizationif this idea not only like a kaleidoscope shall reduce all the miscellaneous fragments into order but shall also minister strength and knowledge and light to the true patriot and statesmen for working out the bright thought and bringing the glorious embryo to a perfect birththen i think i have a right to say that the idea which led to this is not only true but the truth the only truth to set up for a statesman upon historical knowledge only is as about as wise as to set up for a musician by the purchase of some score flutes fiddles and horns in order to make music you must know how to play in order to make your facts speak truth you must know what the truth is which ought to be provedthe ideal truththe truth which was consciously or unconsciously strongly or weakly wisely or blindly intended at all times1  footnote 1 i have preserved this passage conscious the while how liable it is to be misunderstood or at least not understood the readers of mr coleridges works generally or of his church and state in particular will have no difficulty in entering into his meaning namely that no investigation in the nonmathematical sciences can be carried on in a way deserving to be called philosophical unless the investigator have in himself a mental initiative or what comes to the same thing unless he set out with an intuition of the ultimate aim or idea of the science or aggregation of facts to be explained or interpreted the analysis of the platonic and baconian methods in the friend to which i have before referred and the church and state exhibit respectively a splendid vindication and example of mr coleridges mode of reasoning on this subjected    april 18 1833  church of romecelibacy of the clergy   in my judgment protestants lose a great deal of time in a false attack when they labour to convict the romanists of false doctrines destroy the papacy and help the priests to wives and i am much mistaken if the doctrinal errors such as there really are would not very soon pass away they might remain in terminis but they would lose their sting and body and lapse back into figures of rhetoric and warm devotion from which they most of themsuch as transubstantiation and prayers for the dead and to saintsoriginally sprang but so long as the bishop of rome remains pope and has an army of mamelukes all over the world we shall do very little by fulminating against mere doctrinal errors in the milanese and elsewhere in the north of italy i am told there is a powerful feeling abroad against the papacy that district seems to be something in the state of england in the reign of our henry the eighth  how deep a wound to morals and social purity has that accursed article of the celibacy of the clergy been even the best and most enlightened men in romanist countries attach a notion of impurity to the marriage of a clergyman and can such a feeling be without its effect on the estimation of the wedded life in general impossible and the morals of both sexes in spain italy france c prove it abundantly  the papal church has had three phasesanticaesarean extranational antichristian    april 20 1833  roman conquest of italy   the romans would never have subdued the italian tribes if they had not boldly left italy and conquered foreign nations and so at last crushed their nextdoor neighbours by external pressure    april 24 1833  wedded love in shakspeare and his contemporary dramatiststennysons poems  except in shakspeare you can find no such thing as a pure conception of wedded love in our old dramatists in massinger and beaumont and fletcher it really is on both sides little better than sheer animal desire there is scarcely a suitor in all their plays whose abilities are not discussed by the lady or her waitingwoman in this as in all things how transcendant over his age and his rivals was our sweet shakspeare                               i have not read through all mr tennysons poems which have been sent to me but i think there are some things of a good deal of beauty in what i have seen the misfortune is that he has begun to write verses without very well understanding what metre is even if you write in a known and approved metre the odds are if you are not a metrist yourself that you will not write harmonious verses but to deal in new metres without considering what metre means and requires is preposterous what i would with many wishes for success prescribe to tennysonindeed without it he can never be a poet in actis to write for the next two or three years in none but one or two wellknown and strictly defined metres such as the heroic couplet the octave stanza or the octosyllabic measure of the allegro and penseroso he would probably thus get imbued with a sensation if not a sense of metre without knowing it just as eton boys get to write such good latin verses by conning ovid and tibullus as it is i can scarcely scan some of his verses   may 1 1833  rabelais and lutherwit and madness   i think with some interest upon the fact that rabelais and luther were born in the same year1 glorious spirits glorious spirits            hos utinam inter   heroas natum me  footnote 1 they were both born within twelve months of each other i believe but luthers birth was in november 1484 and that of rabelais is generally placed at the end of the year precedinged                                       great wits are sure to madness near allied  says dryden and true so far as this that genius of the highest kind implies an unusual intensity of the modifying power which detached from the discriminative and reproductive power might conjure a platted straw into a royal diadem but it would be at least as true that great genius is most alien from madnessyea divided from it by an impassable mountain namely the activity of thought and vivacity of the accumulative memory which are no less essential constituents of great wit    may 4 1833  colonizationmachinerycapital   colonization is not only a manifest expedient for but an imperative duty on great britain god seems to hold out his finger to us over the sea but it must be a national colonization such as was that of the scotch to america a colonization of hope and not such as we have alone encouraged and effected for the last fifty years a colonization of despair                                       the wonderful powers of machinery can by multiplied production render the mere arte facta of life actually cheaper thus money and all other things being supposed the same in value a silk gown is five times cheaper now than in queen elizabeths time but machinery cannot cheapen in any thing like an equal degree the immediate growths of nature or the immediate necessaries of man now the arte facta are sought by the higher classes of society in a proportion incalculably beyond that in which they are sought by the lower classes and therefore it is that the vast increase of mechanical powers has not cheapened life and pleasure to the poor as it has done to the rich in some respects no doubt it has done so as in giving cotton dresses to maidservants and penny gin to all a pretty benefit truly                                       i think this country is now suffering grievously under an excessive accumulation of capital which having no field for profitable operation is in a state of fierce civil war with itself    may 6 1833  roman conquestconstantinepapacy and the schoolmen   the romans had no national clerisy their priesthood was entirely a matter of state and as far back as we can trace it an evident stronghold of the patricians against the increasing powers of the plebeians all we know of the early romans is that after an indefinite lapse of years they had conquered some fifty or sixty miles round their city then it is that they go to war with carthage the great maritime power and the result of that war was the occupation of sicily thence they in succession conquered spain macedonia asia minor c and so at last contrived to subjugate italy partly by a tremendous back blow and partly by bribing the italian states with a communication of their privileges which the now enormously enriched conquerors possessed over so large a portion of the civilized world they were ordained by providence to conquer and amalgamate the materials of christendom they were not a national people they were truly    romanos rerum dominos  and thats all                                       under constantine the spiritual power became a complete reflex of the temporal there were four patriarchs and four prefects and so on the clergy and the lawyers the church and the state were opposed                                       the beneficial influence of the papacy upon the whole has been much over rated by some writers and certainly no country in europe received less benefit and more harm from it than england in fact the lawful kings and parliaments of england were always essentially protestant in feeling for a national church though they adhered to the received doctrines of the christianity of the day and it was only the usurpers john henry iv c that went against this policy all the great english schoolmen scotus erigena1 duns scotus ockham and others those morning stars of the reformation were heart and soul opposed to rome and maintained the papacy to be antichrist the popes always persecuted with rancorous hatred the national clerisies the married clergy and disliked the universities which grew out of the old monasteries the papacy was and is essentially extra national and was always so considered in this country although not believed to be antichristian  footnote 1 john scotus or erigena was born according to different authors in wales scotland or ireland but i do not find any account making him an englishman of saxon blood his death is uncertainly placed in the beginning of the ninth century he lived in wellknown intimacy with charles the bald of france who died about a d 874 he resolutely resisted the doctrine of transubstantiation and was publicly accused of heresy on that account but the king of france protected himed    may 8 1833  civil war of the seventeenth centuryhampdens speech   i know no portion of history which a man might write with so much pleasure as that of the great struggle in the time of charles i because he may feel the profoundest respect for both parties the side taken by any particular person was determined by the point of view which such person happened to command at the commencement of the inevitable collision one line seeming straight to this man another line to another no man of that age saw the truth the whole truth there was not light enough for that the consequence of course was a violent exaggeration of each party for the time the king became a martyr and the parliamentarians traitors and vice versâ the great reform brought into act by and under william the third combined the principles truly contended for by charles and his parliament respectively the great revolution of 1831 has certainly to an almost ruinous degree dislocated those principles of government again as to hampdens speech1 no doubt it means a declaration of passive obedience to the sovereign as the creed of an english protestant individual every man cromwell and all would have said as much it was the antipapistical tenet and almost vauntingly asserted on all occasions by protestants up to that time but it implies nothing of hampdens creed as to the duty of parliament  footnote 1 on his impeachment with the other four members 1642 see the letter to john murray esq touching lord nugent 1833 it is extraordinary that lord n should not see the plain distinction taken by hampden between not obeying an unlawful command and rebelling against the king because of it he approves the one and condemns the other his words are to yield obedience to the commands of a king if against the true religion against the ancient and fundamental laws of the land is another sign of an ill subjectto resist the lawful power of the king to raise insurrection against the king admit him adverse in his religion to conspire against his sacred person or any ways to rebel though commanding things against our consciences in exercising religion or against the rights and privileges of the subject is an absolute sign of the disaffected and traitorous subjected    may 10 1833  reformed house of commons   well i think no honest man will deny that the prophetic denunciations of those who seriously and solemnly opposed the reform bill are in a fair way of exact fulfilment for myself i own i did not expect such rapidity of movement i supposed that the first parliament would contain a large number of low factious men who would vulgarize and degrade the debates of the house of commons and considerably impede public business and that the majority would be gentlemen more fond of their property than their politics but really the truth is something more than this think of upwards of 160 members voting away two millions and a half of tax on friday1 at the bidding of whom shall i say and then no less than 70 of those very members rescinding their votes on the tuesday next following nothing whatever having intervened to justify the change except that they had found out that at least seven or eight millions more must go also upon the same principle and that the revenue was cut in two of course i approve the vote of rescission however dangerous a precedent but what a picture of the composition of this house of commons  footnote 1 on friday the 26th of april 1833 sir william ingilby moved and carried a resolution for reducing the duty on malt from 28s 8d to l0s per quarter one hundred and sixtytwo members voted with him on tuesday following the 30th of april seventysix members only voted against the rescission of the same resolutioned

1833  wilsonshakspeares sonnetslove   professor wilsons character of charles lamb in the last blackwood twaddle on tweedside1 is very sweet indeed and gratified me much it does honour to wilson to his head and his heart  footnote 1 charles lamb ought really not to abuse scotland in the pleasant way he so often does in the sylvan shades of enfield for scotland loves charles lamb but he is wayward and wilful in his wisdom and conceits that many a cockney is a better man even than christopher north but what will not christopher forgive to genius and goodness even lamb bleating libels on his native land nay he learns lessons of humanity even from the mild malice of elia and breathes a blessing on him and his household in their bower of rest  some of mr coleridges poems were first published with some of c lambs at bristol in 1797 the remarkable words on the titlepage have been aptly cited in the new monthly magazine for february 1835 p 198 duplex nobis vinculum et amicitiae et similium junctarumque camcoenarumquod utinam neque mors solvat neque temporis longinquitas and even so it came to pass after thirty seven years more had passed over their headsed                                       how can i wish that wilson should cease to write what so often soothes and suspends my bodily miseries and my mental conflicts yet what a waste what a reckless spending of talent ay and of genius too in his i know not how many years management of blackwood if wilson cares for fame for an enduring place and prominence in literature he should now i think hold his hand and say as he well may      militavi non sine gloria       nunc arma defunctumque bello         barbiton hic paries habebit  two or three volumes collected out of the magazine by himself would be very delightful but he must not leave it for others to do for some recasting and much condensation would be required and literary executors make sad work in general with their testators brains                                       i believe it possible that a man may under certain states of the moral feeling entertain something deserving the name of love towards a male objectan affection beyond friendship and wholly aloof from appetite in elizabeths and jamess time it seems to have been almost fashionable to cherish such a feeling and perhaps we may account in some measure for it by considering how very inferior the women of that age taken generally were in education and accomplishment of mind to the men of course there were brilliant exceptions enough but the plays of beaumont and fletcher the most popular dramatists that ever wrote for the english stagewill show us what sort of women it was generally pleasing to represent certainly the language of the two friends musidorus and pyrocles in the arcadia is such as we could not now use except to women and in cervantes the same tone is sometimes adopted as in the novel of the curious impertinent and i think there is a passage in the new atlantis1 of lord bacon in which he speaks of the possibility of such a feeling but hints the extreme danger of entertaining it or allowing it any place in a moral theory i mention this with reference to shakspeares sonnets which have been supposed by some to be addressed to william herbert earl of pembroke whom clarendon calls2 the most beloved man of his age though his licentiousness was equal to his virtues  i doubt this i do not think that shakespeare merely because he was an actor would have thought it necessary to veil his emotions towards pembroke under a disguise though he might probably have done so if the real object had perchance been a laura or a leonora it seems to me that the sonnets could only have come from a man deeply in love and in love with a woman and there is one sonnet which from its incongruity i take to be a purposed blind these extraordinary sonnets form in fact a poem of so many stanzas of fourteen lines each and like the passion which inspired them the sonnets are always the same with a variety of expressioncontinuous if you regard the lovers souldistinct if you listen to him as he heaves them sigh after sigh  these sonnets like the venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece are characterized by boundless fertility and laboured condensation of thought with perfection of sweetness in rhythm and metre these are the essentials in the budding of a great poet afterwards habit and consciousness of power teach more easepraecipitandum liberum spiritum  footnote 1 i cannot fix upon any passage in this work to which it can be supposed that mr coleridge alluded unless it be the speech of joabin the jew but it contains nothing coming up to the meaning in the text the only approach to it seems to beas for masculine love they have no touch of it and yet there are not so faithful and inviolate friendships in the world again as are there and to speak generally as i said before i have not read of any such chastity in any people as theirsed  footnote 2 william earl of pembroke was next a man of another mould and making and of another fame and reputation with all men being the most universally beloved and esteemed of any man of that age he indulged to himself the pleasures of all kinds almost in all excesseshist of the rebellion book i he died in 1630 aged fifty years the dedication by t t thomas thorpe is to the only begetter of these ensuing sonnets mr w h and malone is inclined to think that william hughes is meant as to mr w h being the only begetter of these sonnets it must be observed that at least the last twentyeight are beyond dispute addressed to a woman i suppose the twentieth sonnet was the particular one conceived by mr c to be a blind but it seems to me that many others may be so construed if we set out with a conviction that the real object of the poet was a womaned                                       every one who has been in love knows that the passion is strongest and the appetite weakest in the absence of the beloved object and that the reverse is the case in her presence     may 15 1833  wicliffelutherreverence for ideal truthsjohnson the whig asgilljames i   wicliffes genius was perhaps not equal to luthers but really the more i know of him from vaughan and le bas both of whose books i like i think him as extraordinary a man as luther upon the whole he was much sounder and more truly catholic in his view of the eucharist than luther and i find not without some pleasure that my own view of it which i was afraid was original was maintained in the tenth century that is to say that the body broken had no reference to the human body of christ but to the caro noumenon or symbolical body the rock that followed the israelites  whitaker beautifully says of lutherfelix ille quem dominus eo honore dignatus est ut homines nequissimos suos haberet inimicos                                       there is now no reverence for any thing and the reason is that men possess conceptions only and all their knowledge is conceptional only now as to conceive is a work of the mere understanding and as all that can be conceived may be comprehended it is impossible that a man should reverence that to which he must always feel something in himself superior if it were possible to conceive god in a strict sense that is as we conceive a horse or a tree even god himself could not excite any reverence though he might excite fear or terror or perhaps love as a tiger or a beautiful woman but reverence which is the synthesis of love and fear is only due from man and indeed only excitable in man towards ideal truths which are always mysteries to the understanding for the same reason that the motion of my finger behind my back is a mystery to you nowyour eyes not being made for seeing through my body it is the reason only which has a sense by which ideas can be recognized and from the fontal light of ideas only can a man draw intellectual power

is another instance of king williams discrimination which was so much superior to that of any of his ministers johnson was one of the most formidable advocates for the exclusion bill and he suffered by whipping and imprisonment under james accordingly like asgill he argues with great apparent candour and clearness till he has his opponent within reach and then comes a blow as from a sledgehammer i do not know where i could put my hand upon a book containing so much sense and sound constitutional doctrine as this thin folio of johnsons works and what party in this country would read so severe a lecture in it as our modern whigs  a close reasoner and a good writer in general may be known by his pertinent use of connectives read that page of johnson you cannot alter one conjunction without spoiling the sense it is a linked strain throughout in your modern books for the most part the sentences in a page have the same connection with each other that marbles have in a bag they touch without adhering  asgill evidently formed his style upon johnsons but he only imitates one part of it asgill never rises to johnsons eloquence the latter was a sort of cobbettburke  james the first thought that because all power in the state seemed to proceed from the crown all power therefore remained in the crownas if because the tree sprang from the seed the stem branches leaves and fruit

men who make light of the direct doctrines of the scriptures and turn up their noses at the recommendation of a line of conduct suggested by religious truth will nevertheless stake the tranquillity of an empire the lives and properties of millions of men and women on the faith of a maxim of modern political economy and this too of a maxim true only if at all of england or a part of england or some other countrynamely that the desire of bettering their condition will induce men to labour even more abundantly and profitably than servile compulsionto which maxim the past history and present state of all asia and africa give the lie nay even in england at this day every man in manchester birmingham and in other great manufacturing towns knows that the most skilful artisans who may earn high

utterly condemn your frantic practice of declaiming about their rights to the blacks themselves they ought to be forcibly reminded of the state in which their brethren in africa still are and taught to be thankful for the providence which has placed them within reach of the means of grace i know no right except such as flows from righteousness and as every christian believes his righteousness to be imputed so must his right be an imputed right too it must flow out of a duty and it is under that name that the process of humanization ought to begin and to be conducted throughout

were more heartwhole than they had been for a hundred years previously after i had travelled in sicily and italy countries where there were real grounds for fear i became deeply impressed with the

more virtue the more liberty                                       i think st pauls epistle to the romans the most profound work in existence and i hardly believe that the writings of the old stoics now lost could have been deeper undoubtedly it is and must be very obscure to ordinary readers but some of the difficulty is accidental arising from the form in which the epistle appears if we could now arrange this work in the way in which we may be sure st paul would himself do were he now alive and preparing it for the press his reasoning would stand out clearer his accumulated parentheses would be thrown into notes or extruded to the margin you will smile after this if i say that i think i understand st paul and i think so because really and truly i recognize a cogent consecutiveness in the argumentthe only evidence i know that you understand any book how different is the style of this intensely passionate argument from that of the catholic circular charge called the epistle to the ephesiansand how different that of both from the style of the epistles to timothy and titus which i venture to call greek epistolal panloeideiz  erasmuss paraphrase of the new testament is clear

temperament of genius that carryingon of the spring and freshness of youthful nay boyish feelings into the matured strength of manhood for as mr coleridge had long before expressed the same thoughtto find no contradiction in the union of old and new to contemplate the ancient of days and all his works with feelings as fresh as if all had then sprung forth at the first creative fiat this characterizes the mind that feels the riddle of the world and may help to unravel it to carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood to combine the childs sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which everyday for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar    with sun and moon and stars throughout the year   and man and woman  this is the character and privilege of genius and one of the marks which distinguish genius from talent and therefore is it the prime merit of genius and its most unequivocal mode of manifestation so to represent familiar objects as to awaken in

if i could ever believe that mandeville really meant any thing more by his fable of the bees than a bonne bouche of solemn raillery i should like to ask those manshaped apes who have taken up his suggestions in earnest and seriously maintained them as bases for a rational account of man and the worldhow they explain the very existence of those dexterous cheats those superior charlatans the legislators and philosophers who have known how to play so well upon the peacocklike vanity and follies of their fellow mortals  by the by i wonder some of you lawyers sub rosa of course have not

of sensibility no argument could disprove the bestial theory so convincingly as a quiet contemplation of that fine bust                                       i cannot agree with the solemn abuse which the critics have poured out upon bertram in alls well that ends well he was a young nobleman in feudal times just bursting into manhood with all the feelings of pride of birth and appetite for pleasure and liberty natural to such a character so circumstanced of course he had never regarded helena otherwise than as a dependant in the family and of all that which she possessed of goodness and fidelity and courage which might atone for her inferiority in other respects bertram was necessarily in a great measure ignorant and after all her prima facie merit was the having inherited a prescription from her old father the doctor by which she cures the kinga merit which supposes an extravagance of personal loyalty in bertram to make conclusive to him in such a matter as that of taking a wife bertram had surely good reason to look upon the kings forcing him to marry helena as a very tyrannical act indeed it must be confessed that her character is not very delicate and it required all shakspeares consummate skill to interest us for her and he does this chiefly by the operation of the other charactersthe countess lafeu c we get to like helena from their praising and commending her so much                                       in beaumont and fletchers tragedies the comic scenes are rarely so interfused amidst the tragic as to produce a unity of the tragic on the whole without which the intermixture is a fault in shakspeare this is always managed with transcendant skill the fool in lear contributes in a very sensible manner to the tragic wildness of the whole drama beaumont and fletchers serious plays or tragedies are complete hybridsneither fish nor fleshupon any rules greek roman or gothic and yet they are very delightful notwithstanding no doubt they imitate the ease of gentlemanly conversation better than shakspeare who was unable not to be too much associated to succeed perfectly in this  when i was a boy i was fondest of Æschylus in youth and middle age i preferred euripides now in my declining years i admire sophocles i can now at length see that sophocles is the most perfect yet he never rises to the sublime simplicity of Æschylussimplicity of design i meannor diffuses himself in the passionate outpourings of euripides i understand why the ancients called euripides the most tragic of their dramatists he evidently embraces within the scope of the tragic poet many passions love conjugal affection jealousy and so on which sophocles seems to have considered as incongruous with the ideal statuesqueness of the tragic drama certainly euripides was a greater poet in the abstract than sophocles his choruses may be faulty as choruses but how beautiful and affecting they are as odes and songs i think the famous greek euippoy xene in oedipus coloneus1 cold in comparison with many of the odes of euripides as that song of the chorus in the hippolytusgreek eoos eoos2 and so on and i remember a choric ode in the hecuba which always struck me as exquisitely rich and finished i mean where the chorus speaks of troy and the night of the capture3  there is nothing very surprising in miltons preference of euripides though so unlike himself it is very commonvery naturalfor men to like and even admire an exhibition of power very different in kind from any thing of their own no jealousy arises milton preferred ovid too and i dare say he admired both as a man of sensibility admires a lovely woman with a feeling into which jealousy or envy cannot enter with aeschylus or sophocles he might perchance have matched himself  in euripides you have oftentimes a very near approach to comedy and i hardly know any writer in whom you can find such fine models of serious and dignified conversation  footnote 1 greek

copy   the collocation of words is so artificial in shakspeare and milton that you may as well think of pushing a1 brick out of a wall with your forefinger as attempt to remove a word out of any of their finished passages2  a good lecture upon style might he composed by taking on the one hand the slang of lestrange and perhaps even of roger north3 which became so fashionable after the restoration as a mark of loyalty and on the other the johnsonian magniloquence or the balanced metre of junius and then showing how each extreme is faulty upon different grounds  it is quite curious to remark the prevalence of the cavalier slang style in the divines of charles the seconds time barrow could not of course adopt such a mode of writing throughout because he could not in it have communicated his elaborate thinkings and lofty rhetoric but even barrow not unfrequently lets slip a phrase here and there in the regular roger north waymuch to the delight no doubt of the largest part of his audience and contemporary readers see particularly for instances of this his work on the popes supremacy south is full of it  the style of junius is a sort of metre the law of which is a balance of thesis and antithesis when he gets out of this aphorismic metre into a sentence of five or six lines long nothing can exceed the slovenliness of the english horne tooke and a long sentence seem the only two antagonists that were too much for him still the antithesis of junius is a real antithesis of images or thought but the antithesis of johnson is rarely more than verbal  the definition of good prose isproper words in their proper placesof good versethe most proper words in their proper places the propriety is in either case relative the words in prose ought to express the intended meaning and no more if they attract attention to themselves it is in general a fault in the very best styles as southeys you read page after page understanding the author perfectly without once taking notice of the medium of communicationit is as if he had been speaking to you all the while but in verse you must do morethere the words the media must be beautiful and ought to attract your noticeyet not so much and so perpetually as to destroy the unity which ought to result from the whole poem this is the general rule but of course subject to some modifications according to the different kinds of prose or verse some prose may approach towards verse as oratory and therefore a more studied exhibition of the media may be proper and some verse may border more on mere narrative and there the style should be simpler but the great thing in poetry is quocunque modo to effect a unity of impression upon the whole and a too great fulness and profusion of point in the parts will prevent this who can read with pleasure more than a hundred lines or so of hudibras at one time each couplet or quatrain is so whole in itself that you cant connect them there is no fusionjust as it

between north and the other writers commonly associated with him in speaking of the examen and the life of lord north in the friend mr c calls them two of the most interesting biographical works in our language both for the weight of the matter and the incuriosa felicitas of the style the pages are all alive with the genuine idioms of our mother tongue a fastidious taste it is true will find offence in the occasional vulgarisms or what we now call slang which not a few of our writers shortly after the restoration of charles the second seem to have affected as a mark of loyalty these instances however are but a trifling drawback they are not sought for as is too often and too plainly done by lestrange collyer tom brown and their imitators north never goes out of his way either to seek them or to avoid them and in the main his language gives us the very nerve pulse and sinew of a hearty healthy conversational englishvol ii p 307ed                                       imitation

burke was a great and universal talkeryet now we hear nothing of this except by some chance remarks in boswell the fact is burke like all men of genius who love to talk at all was very discursive and continuous hence he is not reported he seldom said the sharp short things that johnson almost always did which produce a more decided effect at the moment and which are so much more easy to carry off1 besides as to burkes testimony to johnsons powers you must remember that burke was a great courtier and after all burke said and wrote more than once that he thought johnson greater in talking than writing and greater in boswell than in real life2  footnote 1 burke i am persuaded was not so continuous a talker as coleridge madame de stael told a nephew of the latter at coppet that mr c was a master of monologue mais quil ne savait pas le dialogue there was a spice of vindictiveness in this the exact history of which is not worth explaining and if dialogue must be cut down in its meaning to small talk i for one will admit that coleridge amongst his numberless qualifications possessed it not but i am sure that he could when it suited him converse as well as any one else and with women he frequently did converse in a very winning and popular style confining them however as well as he could to the detail of facts or of their spontaneous emotions in general it was certainly otherwise you must not be surprised he said to me at my talking so long to youi pass so much of my time in pain and solitude yet everlastingly thinking that when you or any other persons call on me i can hardly help easing my mind by pouring forth some of the accumulated mass of reflection and feeling upon an apparently interested recipient but the principal reason no doubt was the habit of his intellect which was under a law of discoursing upon all subjects with reference to ideas or ultimate ends you might interrupt him when you pleased and he was patient of every sort of conversation except mere personality which he absolutely hateded  footnote 2 this was said i believe to the late sir james mackintoshed                                       newton was a great man but you must excuse me if i

you start at the likeness of the portrait take almost any daub cut it out of the canvass and place the figure looking into or out of a window and any one may take it for life or take one of mrs salmons wax queens or generals and you will very sensibly feel the difference between a copy as they are and an imitation of the human form as a good portrait ought to be look at that flower vase of van huysum and at these wax or stone peaches and apricots the last are likest to their original but what pleasure do they give none except to children1  some music is above me most music is beneath me i like beethoven and mozartor else some of the aërial compositions of the elder italians as palestrina2 and carissimiand i love purcell  the best sort of music is what it should besacred the next best the military has fallen to the lot of the devil  good music never tires me nor sends me to sleep i feel physically refreshed and strengthened by it as milton says he did  i could write as good verses now as ever i did if i were perfectly free from vexations and were in the ad libitum hearing of fine music which has a sensible effect in harmonizing my thoughts and in animating and as it were lubricating my inventive faculty the reason of my not finishing christabel is not that i dont know how to do itfor i have as i always had the whole plan entire from beginning to end in my mind but i fear i could not carry on with equal success the execution of the idea an extremely subtle and difficult one  besides after this continuation of faust which they tell me is very poor who can have courage to attempt3 a reversal of the judgment of all criticism against continuations let us except don quixote however although the second part of that transcendant work is not exactly uno flatu with the original conception  footnote 1 this passage and those following will evidence what the readers even of this little work must have seen that mr coleridge had an eye almost exclusively for the ideal or universal in painting and music he knew nothing of the details of handling in the one or of rules of composition in the other yet he was to the best of my knowledge an unerring judge of the merits of any serious effort in the fine arts and detected the leading thought or feeling of the artist with a decision which used sometimes to astonish me every picture which i have looked at in company with him seems now to my mind translated into english he would sometimes say after looking for a minute at a picture generally a modern one theres no use in stopping at this for i see the painter had no idea it is mere mechanical drawing come on here the artist meant something for the mind it was just the same with his knowledge of music his appetite for what he thought good was literally inexhaustible he told me he could listen to fine music for twelve hours together and go away refreshed but he required in music either thought or feeling mere addresses to the sensual ear he could not away with hence his utter distaste for rossini and his reverence for beethoven and mozarted  footnote 2 giovanni pierluigi da palestrina was born about 1529 and died in 1594 i believe he may be considered the founder or reformer of the italian church music his masses motets and hymns are tolerably well known amongst lovers of the old composers but mr coleridge used to speak with delight of some of palestrinas madrigals which he heard at rome  giacomo carissimi composed about the years 16401650 his style has been charged with effeminacy but mr c thought it very graceful and chaste

sallustthucydidesherodotusgibbonkey to the decline of the roman empire   i consider the two works of sallust which have come down to us entire as romances founded on facts no adequate causes are stated and there is no real continuity of action in thucydides you are aware from the beginning that you are reading the reflections of a man of great genius and experience upon the character and operation of the two great political principles in conflict in the civilized world in his time his narrative of events is of minor importance and it is evident that he selects for the purpose of illustration it is thucydides himself whom you read throughout under the names of pericles nicias c but in herodotus it is just the reverse he has as little subjectivity as homer and delighting in the great fancied epic of events he narrates them without impressing any thing as of his own mind upon the narrative it is the charm of herodotus that he gives you the spirit of his agethat of thucydides that he reveals to you his own which was above the spirit of his age  the difference between the composition of a history in modern and ancient times is very great still there are certain principles upon which the history of a modern period may be written neither sacrificing all truth and reality like gibbon nor descending into mere biography and anecdote  gibbons style is detestable but his style is not the worst thing about him his history has proved an effectual bar to all real familiarity with the temper and habits of imperial rome few persons read the original authorities even those which are classical and certainly no distinct knowledge of the actual state of the empire can be obtained from gibbons rhetorical sketches he takes notice of nothing but what may produce an effect he skips on from eminence to eminence without ever taking you through the valleys between in fact his work is little else but a disguised collection of all the splendid anecdotes which he could find in any book concerning any persons or nations from the antonines to the capture of constantinople when i read a chapter in gibbon i seem to be looking through a luminous haze or fogfigures come and go i know not how or why all larger than life or distorted or discoloured nothing is real vivid true all is scenical and as it were exhibited by candlelight and then to call it a history of the decline and fall of the roman empire  was there ever a greater misnomer i protest i do not remember a single philosophical attempt made throughout the work to fathom the ultimate causes of the decline or fall of that empire how miserably deficient is the narrative of the important reign of justinian and that poor scepticism which gibbon mistook for socratic philosophy has led him to misstate and mistake the character and influence of christianity in a way which even an avowed infidel or atheist would not and could not have done gibbon was a man of immense reading but he had no philosophy and he never fully understood the principle upon which the best of the old historians wrote he attempted to imitate their artificial construction of the whole worktheir dramatic ordonnance of the partswithout seeing that their histories were intended more as documents illustrative of the truths of political philosophy than as mere chronicles of events  the true key to the declension of the roman empirewhich is not to be found in all gibbons immense workmay be stated in two wordsthe imperial character overlaying and finally destroying the national character rome under trajan was an empire

political pamphlets better than any other parts of his worksparticularly his taxation no tyranny is very clever and spirited though he only sees half of his subject and that not in a very philosophical manner plundertributetaxationare the three gradations of action by the sovereign on the property of the subject the first is mere violence bounded by no law or custom and is properly an act only between conqueror and conquered and that too in the moment of victory the second supposes law but law proceeding only from and dictated by one party the conqueror law by which he consents to forego his right of plunder upon condition of the conquered giving up to him of their own accord a fixed commutation the third implies compact and negatives any right to plundertaxation being professedly for the direct benefit of the party taxed that by paying a part he may through the labours and superintendence of the sovereign be able to enjoy the rest in peace as to the right to tax being only commensurate with direct representation it is a fable falsely and treacherously brought forward by those who know its hollowness well enough you may show its weakness in a moment by observing that not even the universal suffrage of the benthamites avoids the difficultyfor although it may be allowed to be contrary to decorum that women should legislate yet there can be no reason why women should not choose their representatives to legislateand if it be said that they are merged in their husbands let it be allowed where the wife has no separate property but where she has a distinct taxable estate in which her husband has no interest what right can her husband have to choose for her the person whose vote may affect her separate interestbesides at all events an unmarried woman of age possessing one thousand pounds a year has surely as good a moral right to vote if taxation without representation is tyranny as any tenpounder in the kingdom the truth of course is that direct representation is a chimera impracticable in fact and useless or noxious if practicable  johnson had neither eye nor ear for nature therefore he cared as he knew nothing his knowledge of town life was minute but even that was imperfect as not being contrasted with the better life of the country  horne tooke was once holding forth on language when turning to me he asked me if i knew what the meaning of the final ive was in english words i said i thought i could tell what he horne tooke himself thought why what said he vis i replied and he acknowledged i had guessed right i told him however that i could not agree with him but believed that the final ive came from ickvicus greek  atxaq the root denoting collectivity and community and that it was opposed to the final ing which signifies separation particularity and individual property from ingle a hearth or one mans place or seat greek  oixo vicus denoted an aggregation of ingles the alteration of the c and k of the root into the v was evidently the work of the digammate power and hence we find the icus and ivus indifferently as finals in latin the precise difference of the etymologies is apparent in these phrases the lamb is sportive that is has a nature or habit of sporting the lamb is sporting that is the animal is now performing a sport horne tooke upon this said nothing to my etymology but i believe he found that he could not make a fool of me as he did of godwin and some other of his butts    august 17 1833  the lord in the english version of the psalms etcscotch kirk and irving   it is very extraordinary that in our translation of the psalms which professes to be from the hebrew the name jehovahhebrew  o  the being or godshould be omitted and instead of it the hebrew  ktlpio or lord of the septuagint be adopted the alexandrian jews had a superstitious dread of writing the name of god and put greek kurhios not as a translation but as a mere mark or signevery one readily understanding for what it really stood we who have no such superstition ought surely to restore the jehovah and thereby bring out in the true force the overwhelming testimony of the psalms to the divinity of christ the jehovah or manifested god1  footnote 1 i find the same remark in the late most excellent bishop sandfords diary under date 17th december 1827greek chairhete en to kurhio kurhios idem significat

bishop sandford vol i p 207  mr coleridge saw this work for the first time many months after making the observation in the text indeed it was the very last book he ever read he was deeply interested in the picture drawn of the bishop and said that the mental struggles and bodily sufferings indicated in the diary had been his own for years past he conjured me to peruse the memoir and the diary with great carei have received said he much spiritual comfort and strength from the latter o were my faith and devotion like my sufferings equal to that good mans he felt as i do how deep a depth is prayer in faith  in connection with the text i may add here that mr c said that long before he knew that the late bishop middleton was of the same opinion he had deplored the misleading inadequacy of our authorized version of the expression greek prototokos pases ktiseos in the epistle to the colossians i 15 greek hos estin eikon tou theou tou aoratou prototokos pases ktiseos he rendered the verse in these wordswho is the manifestation of god the invisible the begotten antecedently to all creation observing that in greek prototokos there was a double superlative of priority and that the natural meaning of firstborn of every creaturethe language of our versionafforded no premiss for the causal greek hoti in the next verse the same criticism may be found in the statemans manual p 56 n and see bishop sandfords judgment to the same effect vol i p 165ed                                       i cannot understand the conduct of the scotch kirk with regard to poor irving they might with ample reason have visited him for the monstrous indecencies of those exhibitions of the spiritperhaps the kirk would not have been justified in overlooking such disgraceful breaches of decorum but to excommunicate him on account of his language about christs body was very foolish irvings expressions upon this subject are ill judged inconvenient in had taste and in terms false nevertheless his apparent meaning such as it is is orthodox christs bodyas mere body or rather carcass for body is an associated word was no more capable of sin or righteousness than mine or yoursthat his humanity had a capacity of sin follows from its own essence he was of like passions as we and was tempted how could he be tempted if he had no formal capacity of being seduced  it is irvings error to use declamation high and passionate rhetoric not introduced and pioneered by calm and clear logic which isto borrow a simile though with a change in the application from the wittywise but not always wiselywitty fullerlike knocking a nail into a board without wimbling a hole for it and which then either does not enter or turns crooked or splits the wood it pierces    august 18 1833  miltons

than is generally paid to him he is the link between the old classic and the modern way of thinking in verse you will observe in him an oscillation between the objective poetry of the ancients and the subjective mood of the moderns his power of pleasingly reproducing the same thought in different language is remarkable as it is in pope read particularly the phoenix and see how the single image of

sentimental journey is poor sickly stuff there is a great deal of affectation in sterne to be sure but still the characters of trim and the two shandies1 are most individual and delightful sternes morals are bad but i dont think they can do much harm to any one whom they would not find bad enough before besides the oddity and erudite grimaces under which much of his dirt is hidden take away the effect for the most part although to be sure the book is scarcely readable by women  footnote 1 mr coleridge considered the character of the father the elder shandy as by much the finer delineation of the two i fear his low opinion of the sentimental journey will not suit a thorough sterneist but i could never get him to modify his criticism he said the oftener you read sterne the more clearly will you perceive the great difference between tristram shandy and the sentimental journey there is truth and reality in the one and little beyond a clever affectation in the othered    august 20 1833

of genius may amongst other gifts possess wit as shakspeare                                       genius must have talent as its complement and implement just as in like manner imagination must have

vulgar people because they have a power of looking at such persons as objects of amusement of another race altogether                                       i quite agree with strabo as translated by ben jonson in his splendid dedication of the fox1that there can be no great poet who is not a good man though not perhaps a goody man his heart must be pure he must have learned to look into his own heart and sometimes to look at it for how can he who is ignorant of his own heart know any thing of or be able to move the heart of any one else  footnote 1 greek h de arhete poietou synezeyktai te

while to undergo the immense labour of acquiring that or any other oriental tongue except hebrew    august 23 1833  greek accent and quantity   the distinction between accent and quantity is clear and was no doubt observed by the ancients in the recitation of verse but i believe such recitation to have been always an artificial thing and that the common conversation was entirely regulated by accent i do not think it possible to talk any language without confounding the quantity of syllables with their high or low tones1 although you may sing or recitative the difference well enough why should the marks of accent have been considered exclusively necessary for teaching the pronunciation to the asiatic or african hellenist if the knowledge of the acuted syllable did not also carry the stress of time with it if greek anthropos was to be pronounced in common conversation with a perceptible distinction of the length of the penultima as well as of the elevation of the antepenultima why was not that long quantity also marked it was surely as important an ingredient in the pronunciation as the accent and although the letter omega might in such a word show the quantity yet what do you say to such words as greek lelonchasi tupsasa and the likethe quantity of the penultima of which is not marked to the eye at all besides can we altogether disregard the practice of the modern greeks their confusion of accent and quantity in verse is of course a barbarism though a very old one as the versus politici of john tzetzes 2 in the twelfth century and the anacreontics prefixed to proclus will show but these very examples prove a fortiori what the common pronunciation in prose then was  footnote 1 this opinion i need not say is in direct opposition to the conclusion of foster and mitford and scarcely reconcilable with the apparent meaning of the authorities from the old critics and grammarians fosters opponent was for rejecting the accents and attending only to the syllabic quantitymr c would in prose attend to the accents only as indicators of the quantity being unable to conceive any practical distinction between time and tone in common speech yet how can we deal with the authority of dionysius of halicarnassus alone who on the one hand discriminates quantity so exquisitely as to make four degrees of shortness in the penultimates of greek hodos hr odos tz opos and greek stz ophos and this expressly greek eu logois psilois or plain prose as well as in verse and on the other hand declares according to the evidently correct interpretation of the passage that the difference between music and ordinary speech consists in the number only and not in the quality of tonesgreek to poso diallattousa taes su odais kahi oznauois kahi ouchi to poio pezhi sun c 11 the extreme sensibility of the athenian ear to the accent in prose is indeed proved by numerous anecdotes one of the most amusing of which though perhaps not the best authenticated as a fact is that of demosthenes in the speech for the crown asking whether o athenians does aeschines appear to you to be the mercenary greek misthothos of alexander or his guest or friend greek xenos it is said that he pronounced greek misthothos with a false accent on the antepenultima as greek misthotos and that upon the audience immediately crying out by way of correction greek misthothos with an emphasis the orator continued coollygreek achoueis a legousiyou yourself hear what they say demosthenes is also said whether affectedly or in ignorance to have sworn in some speech by greek asklaepios throwing the accent falsely on the antepenultima and that upon being interrupted for it he declared in his justification that the pronunciation was proper for that the divinity was greek aepios mild the

the synthesis of life and death in the gusty winds and falling leaves of an autumnal day    august 25 1833  rosetti on dantelaughter farce and tragedy   rosettis view of dantes meaning is in great part just but he has pushed it beyond all bounds of common sense how could a poetand such a poet as dantehave written the details of the allegory as conjectured by rosetti the boundaries between his allegory and his pure picturesque are plain enough i think at first reading                                       to resolve laughter into an expression of contempt is contrary to fact and laughable enough laughter is a convulsion of the nerves and it seems as if nature cut short the rapid thrill of pleasure on the nerves by a sudden convulsion of them to prevent the sensation becoming painful aristotles definition is as good as can besurprise at perceiving any thing out of its usual place when the unusualness is not accompanied by a sense of serious danger such surprise is always pleasurable and it is observable that surprise accompanied with circumstances of danger becomes tragic hence farce may often border on tragedy indeed farce is nearer tragedy in its essence than comedy

you were here in a political capacity of some sort or other but upon reflection i acquit you for in germany and i believe elsewhere on the continent it is generally understood that the english government in order to divert the envy and jealousy of the world at the power wealth and ingenuity of your nation makes a point as a ruse de guerre of sending out none but fools of gentlemanly birth and connections as diplomatists to the courts abroad an exception is perhaps sometimes made for a clever fellow if sufficiently libertine and unprincipled is the case much altered now do you know                                       what dull coxcombs your diplomatists at home generally are i remember dining at mr freres once in company with canning and a few other interesting men just before dinner lord  called on frere and asked himself to dinner from the moment of his entry he began to talk to the whole party and in frenchall of us being genuine englishand i was told his french was execrable he had followed the russian army into france and seen a good deal of the great men concerned in the war of none of those things did he say a word but went on sometimes in english and sometimes in french gabbling about cookery and dress and the like at last he paused for a littleand i said a few words remarking how a great image may be reduced to the ridiculous and contemptible by bringing the constituent parts into prominent detail and mentioned the grandeur of the deluge and the preservation of life in genesis and the paradise lost 1 and the ludicrous effect produced by draytons description in his noahs flood  and now the beasts are walking from the wood as well of ravine as that chew the cud the king of beasts his fury doth suppress and to the ark leads down the lioness the bull for his beloved mate doth low and to the ark brings on the faireyed cow c  hereupon lord  resumed and spoke in raptures of a picture which he had lately seen of noahs ark and said the animals were all marching two and two the little ones first and that the elephants came last in great majesty and filled up the foreground ah no doubt my lord said canning your elephants wise fellows staid behind to pack up their trunks this floored the ambassador for half an hour  in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries almost all our ambassadors were distinguished men 2 read lloyds state

in mind the importance of the preceding remarkthat their principal business is just to do no mischiefed                                       the sure way to make a foolish ambassador is to bring him

notice how the style of greek oratory so full in the times of political independence of connective particles some of passion some of sensation only and escaping the classification of mere grammatical logic became in the hands of the declaimers and philosophers of the alexandrian era and still later entirely deprived of this peculiarity so it was with homer as compared with nonnus tryphiodorus and the like in the latter there are in the same number of lines fewer words by one half than in the iliad all the appoggiaturas of time are lost  all the greek writers after demosthenes and his contemporaries what are they but the leavings of tyranny in which a few precious things seem sheltered by the mass of rubbish yet whenever liberty began but to hope and strive a polybius appeared theocritus is almost the only instance i know of a man of true poetic genius nourishing under a tyranny  the old latin poets attempted to compound as largely as the greek hence in ennius such words as belligerentes c in nothing did virgil show his judgment more than in rejecting these except just where common usage had sanctioned them as omnipotens and a few more he saw that the latin was too far advanced in its formation and of too rigid a character to admit such composition or agglutination in this particular respect virgils latin is very admirable and deserving preference compare it with the language of lucan or statius and count the number of words used in an equal number of lines and observe how many more short words virgil has                                       i cannot quite understand the grounds of the high admiration which the ancients expressed for propertius and i own that tibullus is rather insipid to me lucan was a man of great powers but what was to be made of such a shapeless fragment of party warfare and so recent too he had fancy rather than imagination and passion rather than fancy his taste was wretched to be sure still the pharsalia is in my judgment a very wonderful work for such a youth as lucan1 was  i think statius a truer poet than lucan though he is very extravagant sometimes valerius flaccus is very pretty in particular passages i am ashamed to say i have never read silius italicus claudian i recommend to your careful perusal in respect of his being properly the first of the moderns or at least the transitional link between the classic and the gothic mode of thought  i call persius hardnot obscure he had a bad style but i dare say if he had lived2 he would have learned to express himself in easier language there are many passages in him of exquisite felicity and his vein of thought is manly and pathetic  prudentius3 is curious for thisthat you see how christianity forced allegory into the place of mythology mr frere

destruction of jerusalemepic poemgerman and englishmodern travelsparadise lost  i have already told you that in my opinion the destruction of jerusalem is the only subject now left for an epic poem of the highest kind yet with all its great capabilities it has this one grand defectthat whereas a poem to be epic must have a personal interestin the destruction of jerusalem no genius or skill could possibly preserve the interest for the hero from being merged in the interest for the event the fact is the event itself is too sublime and overwhelming                                       in my judgment an epic poem must either be national or mundane as to arthur you could not by any means make a poem on him national to englishmen what have we to do with him milton saw this and with a judgment at least equal to his genius took a mundane themeone common to all mankind his adam and eve are all men and women inclusively pope satirizes milton for making god the father talk like a school divine1 pope was hardly the man to criticize milton the truth is the judgment of milton in the conduct of the celestial part of his story is very exquisite wherever god is represented as directly acting as creator without any exhibition of his own essence milton adopts the simplest and sternest language of the scriptures he ventures upon no poetic diction no amplification no pathos no affection it is truly the voice or the word of the lord coming to and acting on the subject chaos but as some personal interest was demanded for the purposes of poetry milton takes advantage of the dramatic representation of gods address to the son the filial alterity and in those addresses slips in as it were by stealth language of affection or thought or sentiment indeed although milton was undoubtedly a high arian in his mature life he does in the necessity of poetry give a greater objectivity to the father and the son than he would have justified in argument he was very wise in adopting the strong anthropomorphism of the hebrew scriptures at once compare the paradise lost with klopstocks messiah and you will learn to appreciate miltons judgment and skill quite as much as his genius  footnote 1  miltons strong pinion now not heavn can bound now serpentlike in prose he sweeps the ground in quibbles angel and archangel join and god the father turns a school divine  1 epist

        it is not that the german can express external imagery more fully than english but that it can flash more images at once on the mind than the english can as to mere power of expression i doubt whether even the greek surpasses the english pray read a very pleasant and acute dialogue in schlegels athenaeum between a german a greek a roman italian and a frenchman on the merits of their respective languages                                       i wish the naval and military officers who write accounts of their travels would just spare us their sentiment the magazines introduced this

palladosgreek and latin pentametermiltons latin poemspoetical filtergray and cotton   elegy is the form of poetry natural to the reflective mind it may treat of any subject but it must treat of no subject for itself but always and exclusively with reference to the poet himself as he will feel regret for the past or desire for the future so sorrow and love become the principal themes of elegy elegy presents every thing as lost and gone or absent and future the elegy is the exact opposite of the homeric epic in which all is purely external and objective and the poet is a mere voice  the true lyric ode is subjective too but then it delights to present things as actually existing and visible although associated with the past or coloured highly by the subject of the ode itself                                       i think the lavacrum pallados of callimachus very beautiful indeed especially that part about the mother of tiresias and minerva1 i have a mind to try how it would bear translation but what metre have we to answer in feeling to the elegiac couplet of the greeks  i greatly prefer the greek rhythm of the short verse to ovids though observe i dont dispute his taste with reference to the genius of his own language augustus schlegel gave me a copy of latin elegiacs on the king of prussias going down the rhine in which he had almost exclusively adopted the manner of

to us as written in the age of tiberius we should not have considered them to be very beautiful                                       i once thought of making a collectionto be called the poetical filterupon the principle of simply omitting from the old pieces of lyrical poetry which we have those parts in which the whim or the bad taste of the author or the fashion of his age prevailed over his genius you would be surprised at the number of exquisite wholes which might be made by this simple operation and perhaps by the insertion of a single line or half a line out of poems which are now utterly disregarded on account of some odd or incongruous passages in themjust as whole volumes of wordsworths poems were formerly neglected or laughed at solely because of some few wilfulnesses if i may so call them of that great manwhilst at the same time five sixths of his poems would have been admired and indeed popular if they had appeared without those drawbacks under the name of byron or moore or campbell or any other of the fashionable favourites of the day but he has won the battle now ay and will wear the crown whilst english is english                                       i think there is something very majestic in grays installation ode but as to the bard and the rest of his lyrics i must say i think them frigid and artificial there is more real lyric feeling in cottons ode on winter1  footnote 1 let me borrow mr wordsworths account of and quotation from this poem  finally i will refer to cottons ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling he retires from the foe into his fortress where                         a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus neer return again  though myself a waterdrinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms  tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gellyd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold  it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast renders our lives misfortune sweet                                       then let the chill scirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar  whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam  well think of all the friends we know and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine  but where friends fail us well supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive  well drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health th afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest  the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty  the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays  thus shall our healths do others good whilst we ourselves do all we would for freed from envy and from care what would we be but what we are  preface to the editions of mr

christthe priest who was to precede and the triumphant messiah the judge who was to followand how jesus always seems to speak of the son of man in a future sense and yet always at the same time as identical with himself i sometimes think that our lord himself in his earthly career was the messenger and that the way is now still preparing for the great and visible advent of the messiah of glory i mention this doubtingly                                       what a beautiful sermon or essay might be written on the growth of prophecyfrom the germ no bigger than a mans hand in genesis till the column of cloud gathers size and height and substance and assumes the shape of a perfect man just like the smoke in the arabian nights tale which comes up and at last takes a genies shape1  footnote 1 the passage in mr coleridges mind was i suppose the followinghe the fisherman set it before him and while he looked upon it attentively there came out a very thick smoke which obliged him to retire two or three paces from it the smoke ascended to the clouds and extending itself along the sea and upon the shore formed a great mist which we may well imagine did mightily astonish the fisherman when the smoke was all out of the vessel it reunited itself and became a solid body of which there was formed a genie twice as high as the greatest of giants story of the fisherman ninth nighted

poetrybeautychronological arrangement of works   what is it that mr landor wants to make him a poet his powers are certainly very considerable but he seems to be totally deficient in that modifying faculty which compresses several units into one whole the truth is he does not possess imagination in its highest formthat of stamping il più nell uno hence his poems taken as wholes are unintelligible you have eminences excessively bright and all the ground around and between them in darkness besides which he has never learned with all his energy how to write simple and lucid english                                       the useful the agreeable the beautiful and the good are distinguishable you are wrong in resolving beauty into expression or interest it is quite distinct indeed it is opposite although not contrary beauty is an immediate presence between inter which and the beholder nihil est it is always one and tranquil whereas the interesting always disturbs and is disturbed i exceedingly regret the loss of those essays on beauty which i wrote in a bristol newspaper i would give much to recover them                                       after all you can say i still think the chronological order the best for arranging a poets works all your divisions are in particular instances inadequate and they destroy the interest which arises from watching the progress maturity and even the decay of genius    january 3 1834  tolerationnorwegians   i have known books written on tolerance the proper title of which would beintolerant or intolerable books on tolerance should not a man who writes a book expressly to inculcate tolerance learn to treat with respect or at least with indulgence articles of faith which tens of thousands ten times told of his fellowsubjects or his fellowcreatures believe with all their souls and upon the truth of which they rest their tranquillity in this world and their hopes of salvation in the nextthose articles being at least maintainable against his arguments and most certainly innocent in themselvesis it fitting to run jesus christ in a silly parallel with socratesthe being whom thousand millions of intellectual creatures of whom i am a humble unit take to be their redeemer with an athenian philosopher of whom we should know nothing except through his glorification in plato and xenophonand then to hitch latimer and servetus together to be sure there was a stake and a fire in each case but where the rest of the resemblance is i cannot see what ground is there for throwing the odium of servetuss death upon calvin alonewhy the mild melancthon wrote to calvin1 expressly to testify his concurrence in the act and no doubt he spoke the sense of the german reformers the swiss churches advised the punishment in formal letters and i rather think there are letters from the english divines approving calvins conduct before a man deals out the slang of the day about the great leaders of the reformation he should learn to throw himself back to the age of the reformation when the two great parties in the church were eagerly on the watch to fasten a charge of heresy on the other besides if ever a poor fanatic thrust himself into the fire it was michael servetus he was a rabid enthusiast and did every thing he could in the way of insult and ribaldry to provoke the feeling of the christian church he called the trinity triceps monstrum et cerberum quendam tripartitum and so on  indeed how should the principle of religious toleration have been acknowledged at firstit would require stronger arguments than any which i have heard as yet to prove that men in authority have not a right involved in an imperative duty to deter those under their control from teaching or countenancing doctrines which they believe to be damnable and even to punish with death those who violate such prohibition i am sure that bellarmine would have had small difficulty in turning locke round his fingers ends upon this ground a right to protection i can understand but a right to toleration seems to me a contradiction in terms some criterion must in any case be adopted by the state otherwise it might be compelled to admit whatever hideous doctrine and practice any man or number of men may assert to be his or their religion and an article of his or their faith it was the same pope who commanded the romanists of england to separate from the national church which previously their own consciences had not dictated nor the decision of any counciland who also commanded them to rebel against queen elizabeth whom they were bound to obey by the laws of the land and if the pope had authority for one he must have had it for the other the only true argument as it seems to me apart from christianity for a discriminating toleration is that it is of no use to attempt to stop heresy or schism by persecution unless perhaps it be conducted upon the plan of direct warfare and massacre you cannot preserve men in the faith by such means though you may stifle for a while any open appearance of dissent the experiment has now been tried and it has failed and that is by a great deal the best argument for the magistrate against a repetition of it  i know thisthat if a parcel of fanatic missionaries were to go to norway and were to attempt to disturb the fervent and undoubting lutheranism of the fine independent inhabitants of the interior of that country i should be right glad to hear that the busy fools had been quietly shipped offany where i dont include the people of the seaports in my praise of the norwegiansi speak of the agricultural population if that country could be brought to maintain a million more of inhabitants norway might defy the world it would be

subscription or rather by assent to which i think a large comprehension might take place my articles would exclude unitarians and i am sorry to say members of the church of rome but with this differencethat the exclusion of unitarians would be necessary and perpetual that of the members of the church of rome depending on each individuals own conscience and intellectual light what i mean is thisthat the romanists hold the faith in christbut unhappily they also hold certain opinions partly ceremonial partly devotional partly speculative which have so fatal a facility of being degraded into base corrupting and even idolatrous practices that if the romanist will make them of the essence of his religion he must of course be excluded as to the quakers i hardly know what to say an article on the sacraments would exclude them my doubt is whether baptism and the eucharist are properly any parts of christianity or not rather christianity itselfthe one the initial conversion or lightthe other the sustaining and invigorating lifeboth together the greek phos ahi zoha which are christianity a line can only begin once hence there can be no repetition of baptism but a line may be endlessly prolonged by continued production hence the sacrament of love and life lasts for ever  but really there is no knowing what the modern quakers are or believe excepting thisthat they are altogether degenerated from their ancestors of the seventeenth century i should call modern quakerism so far as i know it as a scheme of faith a socinian calvinism penn himself was a sabellian and seems to have disbelieved even the historical fact of the life and death of jesusmost certainly jesus of nazareth was not penns christ if he had any it is amusing to see the modern quakers appealing now to history for a confirmation of their tenets and disciplineand by so doing in effect abandoning the strong hold of their founders as an imperium in imperio i think the original quakerism a conception worthy of lycurgus modern quakerism is like one of those gigantic trees which are seen in the forests of north americaapparently flourishing and preserving all its greatest stretch and spread of branches but when you cut through an enormously thick and gnarled bark you find the whole inside hollow and rotten modern quakerism like such a tree stands upright by help of its inveterate bark alone bark a quaker and he is a poor creature                                       how much the devotional spirit of the church has suffered by that necessary evil the reformation and the sects which have sprung up subsequently to it all our modern prayers seem tonguetied we appear to be thinking more of avoiding an heretical expression or thought than of opening ourselves to god we do not pray with that entire unsuspecting unfearing childlike profusion of feeling which so beautifully shines forth in jeremy taylor and andrewes and the writings of some of the older and better saints of the romish church particularly of that remarkable woman st theresa1 and certainly protestants in their anxiety to have the historical argument on their side have brought down the origin of the romish errors too late many of them began no doubt in the apostolic age itselfi say errors not heresies as that dullest of the fathers epiphanius calls them epiphanius is very long and fierce upon the ebionites there may have been real heretics under that name but i believe that in the beginning the name was on account of its hebrew meaning given to or adopted by some poor mistaken menperhaps of the nazarene waywho sold all their goods and lands and were then obliged to beg i think it not improbable that barnabas was one of these chief mendicants and that the collection made by st paul was for them you should read rhenferds account of the early heresies i think he demonstrates about eight of epiphaniuss heretics to be mere nicknames given by the jews to the christians read hermas or the shepherd of the genuineness of which and of the epistle of barnabas i have no doubt it is perfectly orthodox but full of the most ludicrous tricks of gnostic fancythe wish to find the new testament in the old this gnosis is perceptible in the epistle to the hebrews but kept exquisitely within the limit of propriety in the others it is rampant and most truly puffeth up as st paul said of it  what

action is wholly unlike that of ben jonson or beaumont and fletcher the latter see the totality of a sentence or passage and then project it entire shakspeare goes on creating and evolving b out of a and c out of b and so on just as a serpent moves which makes a fulcrum of its own body and seems for ever twisting and untwisting its own strength                                       i think crabbe and southey are something alike but crabbes poems are founded on observation and real lifesoutheys on fancy and books in facility they are equal though crabbes english is of course not upon a level with southeys which is next door to faultless but in crabbe there is an absolute defect of the high imagination he gives me little or no pleasure yet no doubt he has much power of a certain kind and it is good to cultivate even at some pains a catholic taste in literature i read all sorts of books with some pleasure except modern sermons and treatises on political economy                                       i have received a great deal of pleasure from some of the modern novels especially captain marryats peter simple that book is nearer smollett than any i remember and tom cringles log in

to me in my old age1 how exquisitely tender he is and yet how perfectly free from the least touch of sickly melancholy or morbid drooping the sympathy of the poet with the subjects of his poetry is particularly remarkable in shakspeare and chaucer but what the first effects by a strong act of imagination and mental metamorphosis the last does without any effort merely by the inborn kindly joyousness of his nature how well we seem to know chaucer how absolutely nothing do we know of shakspeare  i cannot in the least allow any necessity for chaucers poetry especially the canterbury tales being considered obsolete let a few plain rules be given for sounding the final è of syllables and for expressing the termination of such words as ocëan and natiön c as dissyllables or let the syllables to be sounded in such cases be marked by a competent metrist this simple expedient would with a very few trifling exceptions where the errors are inveterate enable any reader to feel the perfect smoothness and harmony of chaucers verse  footnote 1 eighteen years before mr coleridge entertained the same feelings towards chaucerthrough all the works of chaucer there reigns a cheerfulness a manly hilarity which makes it almost impossible to doubt a correspondent habit of feeling in the author himself biog lit vol i p 32ed                                        as to understanding his language if you read twenty pages with a good glossary you surely can find no further difficulty even as it is but i should have no objection to see this donestrike out those words which are now obsolete and i will venture to say that i will replace every one of them by words still in use out of chaucer himself or gower his disciple i dont want this myself i rather like to see the significant terms which chaucer unsuccessfully offered as candidates for admission into our language but surely so very slight a change of the text may well be pardoned even by blackletterati for the purpose of restoring so great a poet to his ancient and most deserved popularity                                       shakspeare is of no age it is idle to endeavour to support his phrases by quotations from ben jonson beaumont and fletcher c his language is entirely his own and the younger dramatists imitated him the construction of shakspeares sentences whether in verse or prose is the necessary and homogeneous vehicle of his peculiar manner of thinking his is not the style of the age more particularly shakspeares blank verse is an absolutely new creation read daniel1the admirable danielin his civil wars and triumphs of hymen  the style and language are just such as any very pure and manly writer of the present daywordsworth for examplewould use it seems quite modern in comparison with the style of shakspeare ben jonsons blank verse is very masterly and individual and perhaps massingers is even still nobler in beaumont and fletcher it is constantly slipping into lyricisms  i believe shakspeare was not a whit more intelligible in his own day than he is now to an educated man except for a few local allusions of no consequence as i said he is of no agenor i may add of any religion or party or profession the body and substance of his works came out of the unfathomable depths of his own oceanic mind his observation and reading which was considerable supplied him with the drapery of his figures2  footnote 1 this poets wellmerited epithet is that of the welllanguaged daniel but likewise and by the consent of his contemporaries no less than of all succeeding critics the prosaic daniel yet those who thus designate this wise and amiable writer from the frequent incorrespondency of his diction with his metre in the majority of his compositions not only deem them valuable and interesting on other accounts but willingly admit that there are to be found throughout his poems and especially in his epistles and in his hymens triumph many and exquisite specimens of that style which as the neutral ground of prose and verse is common to bothbiog lit vol ii p 82  footnote 2 mr coleridge called shakspeare the myriadminded man greek auaz muzioyous a phrase said he which i have borrowed from a greek monk who applies it to a patriarch of constantinople i might have said that i have reclaimed rather than borrowed it for it seems to belong to shakspeare de jure singulari et ex privilegio naturae see biog lit vol ii p 13ed                                       as for editing beaumont and fletcher the task would be one immensi laboris the confusion is now so great the errors so enormous that the editor must use a boldness quite unallowable in any other case all i can say as to beaumont and fletcher is that i can point out well enough where something has been lost and that something so and so was probably in the original but the law of shakspeares thought and verse is such that i feel convinced that not only could i detect the spurious but supply the genuine word    march 20 1834   lord byron and h walpoles mysterious motherlewiss jamaica journal  lord byron as quoted by lord dover1 says that the mysterious mother raises horace walpole above every author living in his lord byrons time upon which i venture to remark first that i do not believe that lord byron spoke sincerely for i suspect that he made a tacit exception in favour of himself at leastsecondly that it is a miserable mode of comparison which does not rest on difference of kind it proceeds of envy and malice and detraction to say that a is higher than b unless you show that they are in pari materiathirdly that the mysterious mother is the most disgusting vile detestable composition that ever came from the hand of man no one with a spark of true manliness of which horace walpole had none could have written it as to the blank verse it is indeed better than rowes and thomsons which was execrably badany approach therefore to the manner of the

exaggerated by travellers except two thingsthe folly of the government and the wretchedness of the people they did not admit of exaggeration  really you may learn the fundamental principles of political economy in a very compendious way by taking a short tour through sicily and simply reversing in your own mind every law custom and ordinance you meet with i never was in a country in which every thing proceeding from man was so exactly wrong you have peremptory ordinances against making roads taxes on the passage of common vegetables from one miserable village to another and so on  by the by do you know any parallel in modern history to the absurdity of our giving a legislative assembly to the sicilians it exceeds any thing i know this precious legislature passed two bills before it was knocked on the head the first was to render lands inalienable and the second to cancel all debts due before the date of the bill  and then consider the gross ignorance and folly of our laying a tax upon the sicilians taxation in its proper sense can only exist where there is a free circulation of capital labour and commodities throughout the community but to tax the people in countries like sicily and corsica where there is no internal communication is mere robbery and confiscation a crown taken from a corsican living in the sierras would not get back to him again in ten years                                       it is interesting to pass from malta to sicilyfrom the highest specimen of an inferior race the saracenic to the most degraded class of a superior race the european                                       no tongue can describe the moral corruption of the maltese when the island was surrendered to us there was not a family in it in which a wife or a daughter was not a kept mistress a marquis of ancient family applied to sir alexander ball to be appointed his valet my valet said ball what can you mean sir the marquis said he hoped he should then have had the honour of presenting petitions to his excellency oh that is it is it said sir alexander my valet sir brushes my clothes and brings them to me if he dared to meddle with matters of public business i should kick him down stairs  in short malta was an augean stable and ball had all the inclination to be a hercules1 his task was most difficult although his qualifications were most remarkable i remember an english officer of very high rank soliciting him for the renewal of a pension to an abandoned woman who had been notoriously treacherous to us that officer had promised the woman as a matter of courseshe having sacrificed her daughter to him ball was determined as far as he could to prevent malta from being made a nest of home patronage he considered as was the fact that there was a contract between england and the maltese hence the government at home especially dundas disliked him and never allowed him any other title than that of civil commissioner we have i believe nearly succeeded in alienating the hearts of the inhabitants from us every officer in the island ought to be a maltese except those belonging to the immediate executive 100l per annum to a maltese to enable him to keep a gilt carriage will satisfy him where an englishman must have 2000l  footnote 1 i refer the reader to the five concluding essays of the third volume of the friend as a specimen of what mr c might have

cheeks i think must have burned with shame at the degrading patronage and befouling eulogies of the democratic press and at seeing themselves used as the tools of the open and rancorous enemies of the church how miserable to be held up for the purpose of inflicting insult upon men whose worth and ability and sincerity you well knowand this by a faction banded together like obscene dogs and cats and serpents against a church which you profoundly revere the timethe timethe occasion and the motive ought to have been argument enough that even if the measure were right or harmless in itself not now nor with such as these was it to be effected    may 3 1834  corn laws   those who argue that england may safely depend upon a supply of foreign corn if it grow none or an insufficient quantity of its own forget that they are subjugating the necessaries of life itself to the mere luxuries or comforts of society is it not certain that the price of corn abroad will be raised upon us as soon as it is once known that we must buyand when that fact is known in what sort of a situation shall we be besides this the argument supposes that agriculture is not a positive good to the nation taken in and by itself as a mode of existence for the people which supposition is false and pernicious and if we are to become a great horde of manufacturers shall we not even more than at present excite the ill will of all the manufacturers of other nations it has been already shown in evidence which is before all the world that some of our manufacturers have acted upon the accursed principle of deliberately injuring foreign manufactures if they can even to the ultimate disgrace of the country and loss to themselves    may 19 1834  christian sabbath   how grossly misunderstood the genuine character of the christian sabbath or lords day seems to be even by the church to confound it with the jewish sabbath or to rest its observance upon the fourth commandment is in my judgment heretical and would so have been considered in the primitive church that cessation from labour on the lords day could not have been absolutely incumbent on christians for two centuries after christ is apparent because during that period the greater part of the christians were either slaves or in official situations under pagan masters or superiors and had duties to perform for those who did not recognize the day and we know that st paul sent back onesimus to his master and told every christian slave that being a christian he was free in his mind indeed but still must serve his earthly master although he might laudably seek for his personal freedom also if the early christians had refused to work on the lords day rebellion and civil war must have been the immediate consequences but there is no notice of any such cessation  the jewish sabbath was commemorative of the termination of the great act of creation it was to record that the world had not been from eternity nor had arisen as a dream by itself but that god had created it by distinct acts of power and that he had hallowed the day or season in which he rested or desisted from his work when our lord arose from the dead the old creation was as it were superseded and the new creation then began and therefore the first day and not the last day the commencement and not the end of the work of god was solemnized  luther in speaking of the good by itself and the good for its expediency alone instances the observance of the christian day of rest a day of repose from manual labour and of activity in spiritual laboura day of joy and cooperation in the work of christs creation keep it holysays hefor its use sakeboth to body and soul but if any where the day is made holy for the mere days sakeif any where any one sets up its observance upon a jewish foundation then i order you to work on it to ride on it to dance on it to feast on itto do any thing that shall reprove this encroachment on the christian spirit and liberty  the early church distinguished the day of christian rest so strongly from a fast that it was unlawful for a man to bewail even his own sins as such only on that day he was to bewail the sins of all and to pray as one of the whole of christs body  and the english reformers evidently took the same view of the day as luther and the early church but unhappily our church in the reigns of james and charles the first was so identified with the undue advancement of the royal prerogative that the puritanical judaizing of the presbyterians was but too well seconded by the patriots of the nation in resisting the wise efforts of the church to prevent the incipient alteration in the character of the day of rest after the restoration the bishops and clergy in general adopted the view taken and enforced by their enemies  by the by it is curious to observe in this semiinfidel and malthusian parliament how the sabbatarian spirit unites itself with a rancorous hostility to that one institution which alone according to reason and experience can insure the continuance of any general religion at all in the nation at large some of these gentlemen who are for not letting a poor labouring man have a dish of baked potatoes on a sunday religionis gratiagod forgive that audacious blasphemyare foremost among those who seem to live but in vilifying weakening and impoverishing the national church i own my indignation boils over against such contemptible fellows  i sincerely wish to preserve a decent quiet on sunday i would prohibit compulsory labour and put down operas theatres c for this plain reasonthat if the rich be allowed to play the poor will be forced or what comes to the same thing will be induced to work i am not for a paris sunday but to stop coaches and let the gentlemans carriage run is monstrous    may 25 1834  high prizes and revenues of the church   your argument against the high prizes in the church might be put strongly thusadmit that in the beginning it might have been fairly said that some eminent rewards ought to be set apart for the purpose of stimulating and rewarding transcendant merit what have you to say now after centuries of experience to the contraryhave the high prizes been given to the highest genius virtue or learning is it not rather the truth as jortin said that twelve votes in a contested election will do more to make a man a bishop than an admired commentary on the twelve minor prophetsto all which and the like i say again that you ought not to reason from the abuse which may be rectified against the inherent uses of the thing appoint the most deservingand the prize will answer its purpose as to the bishops incomesin the first place the net receiptsthat which the bishops may spendhave been confessedly exaggerated beyond measure but waiving that and allowing the highest estimate to be correct i should like to have the disposition of the episcopal revenue in any one year by the late or the present bishop of durham or the present bishops of london or winchester compared with that of the most benevolent nobleman in england of any party in politics i firmly believe that the former give away in charity of one kind or another public official or private three times as much in proportion as the latter you may have a hunks or two now and then but so you would much more certainly if you were to reduce the incomes to 2000l per annum as a body in my opinion the clergy of england do in truth act as if their property were impressed with a trust to the utmost extent that can be demanded by those who affect to believe ignorantly or not that lying legend of a tripartite or quadripartite division of the tithe by law    may 31 1834  sir c wetherells speechnational churchdissenterspapacy universities   i think sir

church requires and is required by the christian church for the perfection of each for if there were no national church the mere spiritual church would either become like the papacy a dreadful tyranny over mind and bodyor else would fall abroad into a multitude of enthusiastic sects as in england in the seventeenth century it is my deep conviction that in a country of any religion at all liberty of conscience can only be permanently preserved by means and under the shadow of a national churcha political establishment connected with but distinct from the spiritual church                                       i sometimes hope that the undisguised despotism of temper of the dissenters may at last awaken a jealousy in the laity of the church of england but the apathy and inertness are i fear too profoundtoo providential                                       whatever the papacy may have been on the continent it was always an unqualified evil to this country it destroyed what was rising of good and introduced a thousand evils of its own the papacy was and still is essentially extranationalit affects temporally to do that which the spiritual church of christ can alone doto break down the natural distinctions of nations now as the roman papacy is in itself local and peculiar of course this attempt is nothing but a direct attack on the political independence of other nations  the institution of universities was the single check on the papacy the pope always hated and maligned the universities the old coenobitic establishments of england were convertedperverted ratherinto

wellington expressing himself doubtingly on the abominable sophism that the coronation oath only binds the king as the executive powerthereby making a highgate oath of it but the duke is conscious of the ready retort which his language and conduct on the emancipation bill afford to his opponents he is hampered by that affair    june 20 1834  corn lawsmodern political economy   in the argument on the corn laws there is a greek metazasis eis allo gevos it may be admitted that the great principles of commerce require the interchange of commodities to be free but commerce which is barter has no proper range beyond luxuries or conveniencesit is properly the complement to the full existence and development of a state but how can it be shown that the principles applicable to an interchange of conveniences or luxuries apply also to an interchange of necessaries no state can be such properly which is not selfsubsistent at least for no state that is not so is essentially independent the nation that cannot even exist without the commodity of another nation is in effect the slave of that other nation in common times indeed pecuniary interest will prevail and prevent a ruinous exercise of the power which the nation supplying the necessary must have over the nation which has only the convenience or luxury to return but such interest both in individuals and nations will yield to many stronger passions is holland any authority to the contrary if so tyre and sidon and carthage were so would you put england on a footing with a country which can be overrun in a campaign and starved in a year                                       the entire tendency of the modern or malthusian political economy is to denationalize it would dig up the charcoal foundations of the temple of ephesus to

god had given him the power of being omnipresent davidi with a little more acuteness urged that mere audition or creaturely presence could not possibly justify worship from menthat a man how glorified soever was no nearer god in essence than the vulgarest of the race prayer therefore was inapplicable and how could a man be a mediator between god and man how could a man with sins himself offer any compensation for or expiation of sin unless the most arbitrary caprice were admitted into the counsels of godand so at last you see it was discovered by the better logicians amongst the socinians that there was no such thing as sin at all  it is wonderful how any socinian can read the works of philo judæus without some pause of doubt in the truth of his views as to the person of christ whether philo wrote on his own ground as a jew or borrowed from the christians the testimony as to the then jewish expectation and belief is equally strong you know philo calls the logos greek yios theoy the son of god and greek agapathon te non beloved son he calls him greek arhchierheus high priest greek deuterhos thehos second divinity greek ei an theoy image of god and describes him as greek eggutato madenhos ovtos methorhioy diastamatos the nearest possible to god without any intervening separation and there are numerous other remarkable expressions of the same sort  my faith is thisgod is the absolute will it is his name and the meaning of it it is the hypostasis as begetting his own alterity the jehovah the manifestedhe is the father but the love and the lifethe spirit proceeds from both  i think priestley must be considered the author of the modern unitarianism i owe under god my return to the faith to my having gone much further than the unitarians and so having come round to the other side i can truly say i never falsified the scripture i always told them that their interpretations of the scripture were intolerable upon any principles of sound criticism and that if they were to offer to construe the will of a neighbour as they did that of their maker they would be scouted out of society i said then plainly and openly that it was clear enough that john and paul were not unitarians but at that time i had a strong sense of the repugnancy of the doctrine of vicarious atonement to the moral being and i thought nothing could counterbalance that what care i i said for the platonisms of john or the rabbinisms of paul my conscience revolts that was the ground of my unitarianism  always believing in the government of god i was a fervent optimist but as i could not but see that the present state of things was not the best i was necessarily led to look forward to some future state                                       you may conceive the difference in kind between the fancy and the imagination in this waythat if the check of the senses and the reason were withdrawn the first would become delirium and the last mania the   fancy brings together images which have no connection natural or moral but are yoked together by the poet by means of some accidental coincidence as in the wellknown passage in hudibras  the sun had long since in the lap of thetis taken out his nap and like a lobster boyld the morn from black to red began to turn1  the imagination modifies images and gives unity to variety it sees all things in one il più nell uno there is the epic imagination the perfection of which is in milton and the dramatic of which shakspeare is the absolute master the first gives unity by throwing back into the distance as after the magnificent approach of the messiah to battle2 the poet by one touch from himself  far off their coming shone  makes the whole one image  and so at the conclusion of the description of the appearance of the entranced angels in which every sort of image from all the regions of earth and air is introduced to diversify and illustratethe reader is brought back to the single image by  he calld so loud that all the hollow deep of hell resounded3  the dramatic imagination does not throw back but brings close it stamps all nature with one and that its own meaning as in lear throughout  footnote 1 part ii c 2 v29

soundness of this modern system of political economy the direct tendency of every rule of which is to denationalize and to make the love of our country a foolish superstition    june 28 1834  mr coleridges systembiographia literahiadissenters   you may not understand my system or any given part of itor by a determined act of wilfulness you may even though perceiving a ray of light reject it in anger and disgustbut this i will saythat if you once master it or any part of it you cannot hesitate to acknowledge it as the truth you cannot be sceptical about it  the metaphysical disquisition at the end of the first volume of the biographia literaria is unformed and immatureit contains the fragments of the truth but it is not fully thought out it is wonderful to myself to think how infinitely more profound my views now are and yet how much clearer they are withal the circle is completing the idea is coming round to and to be the common sense                                       the generation of the modern worldly dissenter was thus presbyterian arian socinian and last unitarian                                       is it not most extraordinary to see the dissenters calling themselves the descendants of the old nonconformists and yet clamouring for a divorce of church and state whybaxter and the other great leaders would have thought a man an atheist who had proposed such a thing they were rather for merging the state in the church but these our modern gentlemen who are blinded by political passion give the kiss of alliance to the harlot of rome and walk arm in arm with those who deny the god that redeemed them if so they may but wreak their insane antipathies on the national church well i suppose they have counted the cost and know what it is they would have and can keep    july 5 1834  lord brookebarrow and drydenpeter wilkins and stothardfielding and richardsonbishop sandfordroman catholic religion   i do not remember a more beautiful piece of prose in english than the consolation addressed by lord brooke fulke greville to a lady of quality on certain conjugal infelicities the diction is such that it might have been written now if we could find any one combining so thoughtful a head with so tender a heart and so exquisite a taste                                       barrow often debased his language merely to evidence his loyalty it was indeed no easy task for a man of so much genius and such a precise mathematical mode of thinking to adopt even for a moment the slang of lestrange and tom brown but he succeeded in doing so sometimes with the exception of such parts barrow must be considered as closing the first great period of the english language dryden began the second of course there are numerous subdivisions                                       peter wilkins is to my mind a work of uncommon beauty and yet stothards illustrations have added beauties to it if it were not for a certain tendency to affectation scarcely any praise could be too high for stothards designs they give me great pleasure i believe that robinson crusoe and peter wilkins could only have been written by islanders no continentalist could have conceived either tale daviss story is an imitation of peter wilkins but there are many beautiful things in it especially his finding his wife crouching by the firesideshe having in his absence plucked out all her feathersto be like him  it would require a very peculiar genius to add another tale ejusdem generis to robinson crusoe and peter wilkins i once projected such a thing but the difficulty of a preoccupied ground stopped me perhaps la motte fouqué might effect something but i should fear that neither he nor any other german could entirely understand what may be called the desert island feeling i would try the marvellous line of peter wilkins if i attempted it rather than the real fiction of robinson crusoe                                       what a master of composition fielding was upon my word i think the oedipus tyrannus the alchemist and tom jones the three most perfect plots ever planned and how charming how wholesome fielding always is to take him up after richardson is like emerging from a sick room heated by stoves into an open lawn on a breezy day in may                                       i have been very deeply interested in the account of bishop sandfords life published by his son he seems to have been a thorough gentleman upon the model of st paul whose manners were the finest of any mans upon record                                       i think i could have conformed to the then dominant church before the reformation the errors existed but they had not been riveted into peremptory articles of faith before the council of trent if a romanist were to ask me the question put to sir henry wotton 1i should content myself by answering that i could not exactly say when my religion as he was pleased to call it beganbut that it was certainly some sixty or seventy years before his at all eventswhich began at the council of trent  footnote 1 having at his being in rome made acquaintance with a pleasant priest who invited him one evening to hear their vesper music at church the priest seeing sir henry stand obscurely in a corner sends to him by a boy of the choir this question writ in a small piece of paperwhere was your religion to be found before luther to which question sir henry presently underwritmy religion was to be found then where yours is not to be found nowin the written word of godisaak waltons life of sir

like breezes blown from the spiceislands of youth and hope those twin realities of this phantom world i do not add lovefor what is love but youth and hope embracing and so seen as one i say realities

qui tu vere es  hooker wished to live to finish his ecclesiastical polityso i own i wish life and strength had been spared to me to complete my philosophy for as god hears me the originating continuing and sustaining wish and design in my heart were to exalt the glory of his name and which is the same thing in other words to promote the improvement of mankind but visum aliter deo and his will be done                                        this note may well finish the present specimens what followed was for the memory of private friends only mr coleridge was then extremely ill but certainly did not believe his end to be quite so near at hand as it wased  the following recollections of mr coleridge written in may 1811 have been also communicated to me by my brother mr justice coleridge  20th april 1811 at richmond  we got on politics and he related some curious facts of the prince and perceval then adverting to the present state of affairs in portugal he said that he rejoiced not so much in the mere favourable turn as in the end that must now be put to the base reign of opinion respecting the superiority and invincible skill of the french generals brave as sir john moore was he thought him deficient in that greater and more essential manliness of soul which should have made him not hold his enemy in such fearful respect and which should have taught him to care less for the opinion of the world at home  we then got i know not how to german topics he said that the language of their literature was entirely factitious and had been formed by luther from the two dialects high and low german that he had made it grammatically most correct more so perhaps than any other language it was equal to the greek except in harmony and sweetness and yet the germans themselves thought it sweetklopstock had repeated to him an ode of his own to prove it and really had deceived himself by the force of association into a belief that the harsh sounds conveying indeed or being significant of sweet images or thoughts were themselves sweet mr c was asked what he thought of klopstock he answered that his fame was rapidly declining in germany that an englishman might form a correct notion of him by uniting the moral epigram of young the bombast of hervey and the minute description of richardson as to sublimity he had with all germans one rule for producing itit was to take something very great and make it very small in comparison with that which you wish to elevate thus for example klopstock saysas the gardener goes forth and scatters from his basket seed into the garden so does the creator scatter worlds with his right hand here worlds a large object are made small in the hands of the creator consequently the creator is very great in short the germans were not a poetical nation in the very highest sense wieland was their best poet his subject was bad and his thoughts often impure but his language was rich and harmonious and his fancy luxuriant sothebys translation had not at all caught the manner of the original but the germans were good metaphysicians and critics they criticised on principles previously laid down thus though they might be wrong they were in no danger of being selfcontradictory which was too often the case with english critics  young he said was not a poet to be read through at once his love of point and wit had often put an end to his pathos and sublimity but there were parts in him which must be immortal he mr c loved to read a page of young and walk out to think of him  returning to the germans he said that the state of their religion when he was in germany was really shocking he had never met one clergyman a christian and he found professors in the universities lecturing against the most material points in the gospel he instanced i think paulus whose lectures he had attended the object was to resolve the miracles into natural operations and such a disposition evinced was the best road to preferment he severely censured mr taylors book in which the principles of paulus were explained and insisted on with much gratuitous indelicacy he then entered into the question of socinianism and noticed as i recollect the passage in the old testament the people bowed their faces and worshipped god and the king he said that all worship implied the presence of the object worshipped the people worshipped bowing to the sensuous presence of the one and the conceived omnipresence of the other he talked of his having constantly to defend the church against the socinian bishop of llandaff watson the subject then varied to roman catholicism and he gave us an account of a controversy he had had with a very sensible priest in sicily on the worship of saints he had driven the priest from one post to another till the latter took up the ground that though the saints were not omnipresent yet god who was so imparted to them the prayers offered up and then they used their interference with him to grant them that is father said c in replyexcuse my seeming levity for i mean no impietythat is i have a deaf and dumb wife who yet understands me and i her by signs you have a favour to ask of me and want my wifes interference so you communicate your request to me who impart it to her and she by signs back again begs me to grant it the good priest laughed and said populus milt decipi et decipiatur  we then got upon the oxford controversy and he was decidedly of opinion that there could be no doubt of coplestons complete victory he thought the review had chosen its points of attack ill as there must doubtless be in every institution so old much to reprehend and carp at on the other hand he thought that copleston had not been so severe or hard upon them as he might have been but he admired the critical part of his work which he thought very highly valuable independently of the controversy he wished some portion of mathematics was more essential to a degree at oxford as he thought a gentlemans education incomplete without it and had himself found the necessity of getting up a little when he could ill spare the time he every day more and more lamented his neglect of them when at cambridge  then glancing off to aristotle he gave a very high character of him he said that bacon objected to aristotle the grossness of his examples and davy now did precisely the same to bacon both were wrong for each of those philosophers wished to confine the attention of the mind in their works to the form of reasoning only by which other truths might be established or elicited and therefore the most trite and commonplace examples were in fact the best he said that during a long confinement to his room he had taken up the schoolmen and was astonished at the immense learning and acute knowledge displayed by them that there was scarcely any thing which modern philosophers had proudly brought forward as their own which might not be found clearly and systematically laid down by them in some or other of their writings locke had sneered at the schoolmen unfairly and had raised a foolish laugh against them by citations from their quid libet questions which were discussed on the eyes of holydays and in which the greatest latitude was allowed being considered mere exercises of ingenuity we had ridiculed their quiddities and why had we not borrowed their quantity and their quality and why then reject their quiddity when every schoolboy in logic must know that of every thing may be asked quantum est quale est and quid est the last bringing you to the most material of all points its individual being he afterwards stated that in a history of speculative philosophy which he was endeavouring to prepare for publication he had proved and to the satisfaction of sir james mackintosh that there was nothing in locke which his best admirers most admired that might not be found more clearly and better laid down in descartes or the old schoolmen not that he was himself an implicit disciple of descartes though he thought that descartes had been much misinterpreted  when we got on the subject of poetry and southey he gave us a critique of the curse of kehama the fault of which he thought consisted in the association of a plot and a machinery so very wild with feelings so sober and tender but he gave the poem high commendation admired the art displayed in the employment of the hindu monstrosities and begged us to observe the noble feeling excited of the superiority of virtue over vice that kehama went on from the beginning to the end of the poem increasing in power whilst kailyal gradually lost her hopes and her protectors and yet by the time we got to the end we had arrived at an utter contempt and even carelessness of the power of evil as exemplified in the almighty rajah and felt a complete confidence in the safety of the unprotected virtue of the maiden this he thought the very great merit of the poem  when we walked home with him to the inn he got on the subject of the english essay for the year at oxford and thought some consideration of the corruption of language should he introduced into it  footnote on etymology it originated he thought in a desire to abbreviate all expression as much as possible and no doubt if in one word without violating idiom i can express what others have done in more and yet be as fully and easily understood i have manifestly made an improvement but if on the other hand it becomes harder and takes more time to comprehend a thought or image put in one word by apuleius than when expressed in a whole sentence by cicero the saving is merely of pen and ink and the alteration is evidently a corruption    april 21richmond  before breakfast we went into mr mays delightful bookroom where he was again silent in admiration of the prospect after breakfast we walked to church he seemed full of calm piety and said he always felt the most delightful sensations in a sunday churchyardthat it struck him as if god had given to man fiftytwo springs in every year after the service he was vehement against the sermon as commonplace and invidious in its tone towards the poor then he gave many texts from the lessons and gospel of the day as affording fit subjects for discourses he ridiculed the absurdity of refusing to believe every thing that you could not understand and mentioned a rebuke of dr parrs to a man of the name of frith and that of another clergyman to a young man who said he would believe nothing which he could not understandthen young man your creed will be the shortest of any mans i know  as we walked up mr cambridges meadows towards twickenham he criticised johnson and gray as poets and did not seem to allow them high merit the excellence of verse he said was to be untranslatable into any other words without detriment to the beauty of the passagethe position of a single word could not be altered in milton without injury grays personifications he said were mere printers devils personifications persons with a capital letter abstract qualities with a small one he thought collins had more genius than gray who was a singular instance of a man of taste poetic feeling and fancy without imagination he contrasted drydens opening of the 10th satire of juvenal with johnsons    let observation with extensive view   survey mankind from ganges to peru  which was as much as to say    let observation with extensive observation observe mankind  after dinner he told us a humorous story of his enthusiastic fondness for quakerism when he was at cambridge and his attending one of their meetings which had entirely cured him when the little children came in he was in raptures with them and descanted upon the delightful mode of treating them now in comparison with what he had experienced in childhood he lamented the haughtiness with which englishmen treated all foreigners abroad and the facility with which our government had always given up any people which had allied itself to us at the end of a war and he particularly remarked upon our abandonment of minorca these two things he said made us universally disliked on the continent though as a people most highly respected he thought a war with america inevitable and expressed his opinion that the united states were unfortunate in the prematureness of their separation from this country before they had in themselves the materials of moral societybefore they had a gentry and a learned classthe former looking backwards and giving the sense of stabilitythe latter looking forwards and regulating the feelings of the people  afterwards in the drawingroom he sat down by professor rigaud with whom he entered into a discussion of kants system of metaphysics the little knots of the company were speedily silent mr cs voice grew louder and abstruse as the subject was yet his language was so ready so energetic and so eloquent and his illustrations so very neat and apposite that the ladies even paid him the most solicitous and respectful attention they were really entertained with kants metaphysics at last i took one of them a very sweet singer to the pianoforte and when there was a pause she began an italian air she was anxious to please him and he was enraptured his frame quivered with emotion and there was a titter of uncommon delight on his countenance when it was over he praised the singer warmly and prayed she might finish those strains in heaven  this is nearly all except some anecdotes which i recollect of our meeting with this most interesting most wonderful man some of his topics and arguments i have enumerated but the connection and the words are lost and nothing that i can say can give any notion of his eloquence and mannerof the hold which he soon got on his audienceof the variety of his stores of informationor finally of the artlessness of his habits or the modesty and temper with which he listened to and answered arguments contradictory to his ownj t c    the following address has been printed before but it cannot be too widely circulated and it will form an appropriate conclusion to this volume  to adam steinmetz k  my dear godchild  i offer up the same fervent prayer for you now as i did kneeling before the altar when you were baptized into christ and solemnly received as a living member of his spiritual body the church  years must pass before you will be able to read with an understanding heart what i now write but i trust that the allgracious god the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies who by his onlybegotten son all mercies in one sovereign mercy has redeemed you from the evil ground and willed you to be born out of darkness but into lightout of death but into lifeout of sin but into righteousness even into the lord our righteousness i trust that he will graciously hear the prayers of your dear parents and be with you as the spirit of health and growth in body and mind  my dear godchildyou received from christs minister at the baptismal font as your christian name the name of a most dear friend of your fathers and who was to me even as a son the late adam steinmetz whose fervent aspiration and everparamount aim even from early youth was to be a christian in thought word and deedin will mind and affections  i too your godfather have known what the enjoyments and advantages of this life are and what the more refined pleasures which learning and intellectual power can bestow and with all the experience that more than threescore years can give i now on the eve of my departure declare to you and earnestly pray that you may hereafter live and act on the conviction that health is a great blessingcompetence obtained by honourable industry a great blessingand a great blessing it is to have kind faithful and loving friends and relatives but that the greatest of all blessings as it is the most ennobling of all privileges is to be indeed a christian but i have been likewise through a large portion of my later life a sufferer sorely afflicted with bodily pains languors and manifold infirmities and for the last three or four years have with few and brief intervals been confined to a sickroom and at this moment in great weakness and heaviness write from a sickbed hopeless of a recovery yet without prospect of a speedy removal and i thus on the very brink of the grave solemnly bear witness to you that the almighty redeemer most gracious in his promises to them that truly seek him is faithful to perform what he hath promised and has preserved under all my pains and infirmities the inward peace that passeth all understanding with the supporting assurance of a reconciled god who will not withdraw his spirit from me in the conflict and in his own time will deliver me from the evil one  o my dear godchild eminently blessed are those who begin early to seek fear and love their god trusting wholly in the righteousness and mediation of their lord redeemer saviour and
