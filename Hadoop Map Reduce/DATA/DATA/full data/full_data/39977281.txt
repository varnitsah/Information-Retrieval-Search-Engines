by horsecar to boston  a days pleasure  a romance of real life  scene  jubilee days  some lessons from the school of morals  flitting     list of illustrations   she lighted a potent pipe  but i suppose this wine is not made of grapes signor  looking about i saw two women  the young lady in black who alighted at a most ordinary little street  that sweet young blonde who arrives by most trains  frank and lucy stalked ahead with shawls dragging from their arms  they skirmish about him with every sort of query  a gaunt figure of forlorn and curious smartness  the spectacle as we beheld it  vacant and ceremonious zeal     mrs johnson   it was on a morning of the lovely new england may that we left the horse car and spreading our umbrellas walked down the street to our new home in charlesbridge through a storm of snow and rain so finely blent by the influences of this fortunate climate that no flake knew itself from its sister drop or could be better identified by the people against whom they beat in unison a vernal gale from the east fanned our cheeks and pierced our marrow and chilled our blood while the raw cold green of the adventurous grass on the borders of the sopping sidewalks gave as it peered through its veil of melting snow and freezing rain a peculiar cheerfulness to the landscape here and there in the vacant lots abandoned hoopskirts defied decay and near the halffinished wooden houses empty mortarbeds and bits of lath and slate strewn over the scarred and mutilated ground added their interest to the scene a shaggy drift hung upon the trees before our own house which had been built some years earlier while its swollen eaves wept silently and incessantly upon the embankments lifting its base several feet above the common level  this heavenly weather which the pilgrim fathers with the idea of turning their thoughts effectually from earthly pleasures came so far to discover continued with slight amelioration throughout the month of may and far into june and it was a matter of constant amazement with one who had known less austere climates to behold how vegetable life struggled with the hostile skies and in an atmosphere as chill and damp as that of a cellar shot forth the buds and blossoms upon the peartrees called out the sour puritan courage of the currantbushes taught a reckless native grapevine to wander and wanton over the southern side of the fence and decked the banks with violets as fearless and as fragile as new england girls so that about the end of june when the heavens relented and the sun blazed out at last there was little for him to do but to redden and darken the daring fruits that had attained almost their full growth without his countenance  then indeed charlesbridge appeared to us a kind of paradise the wind blew all day from the southwest and all day in the grove across the way the orioles sang to their nestlings the butchers wagon rattled merrily up to our gate every morning and if we had kept no other reckoning we should have known it was thursday by the grocer we were living in the country with the conveniences and luxuries of the city about us the house was almost new and in perfect repair and better than all the kitchen had as yet given no signs of unrest in those volcanic agencies which are constantly at work there and which with sudden explosion make herculaneums and pompeiis of so many smiling households breakfast dinner and tea came up with illusive regularity and were all the most perfect of their kind and we laughed and feasted in our vain security we had out from the city to banquet with us the friends we loved and we were inexpressibly proud before them of the help who first wrought miracles of cookery in our honor and then appeared in a clean white apron and the glossiest black hair to wait upon the table she was young and certainly very pretty she was as gay as a lark and was courted by a young man whose clothes would have been a credit if they had not been a reproach to our lowly basement she joyfully assented to the idea of staying with us till she married  in fact there was much that was extremely pleasant about the little place when the warm weather came and it was not wonderful to us that jenny was willing to remain it was very quiet we called one another to the window if a large dog went by our door and whole days passed without the movement of any wheels but the butchers upon our street which flourished in ragweed and buttercups and daisies and in the autumn burned like the borders of nearly all the streets in charlesbridge with the pallid azure flame of the succory the neighborhood was in all things a frontier between city and country the horsecars the type of such civilization full of imposture discomfort and sublime possibilityas we yet possess went by the head of our street and might perhaps be available to one skilled in calculating the movements of comets while two minutes walk would take us into a wood so wild and thick that no roof was visible through the trees we learned like innocent pastoral people of the golden age to know the several voices of the cows pastured in the vacant lots and like enginedrivers of the iron age to distinguish the different whistles of the locomotives passing on the neighboring railroad the trains shook the house as they thundered along and at night were a kind of company while by day we had the society of the innumerable birds now and then also the little ragged boys in charge of the cowswhich tied by long ropes to trees forever wound themselves tight up against the trunks and had to be unwound with great ado of hooting and hammering came and peered lustfully through the gate at our ripening pears all round us carpenters were at work building new houses but so far from troubling us the strokes of their hammers fell softly upon the sense like ones heartbeats upon ones own consciousness in the lapse from all fear of pain under the blessed charm of an anaesthetic  we played a little at gardening of course and planted tomatoes which the chickens seemed to like for they ate them up as fast as they ripened and we watched with pride the growth of our lawton blackberries which after attaining the most stalwart proportions were still as bitter as the scrubbiest of their savage brethren and which when by advice left on the vines for a week after they turned black were silently gorged by secret and gluttonous flocks of robins and orioles as for our grapes the frost cut them off in the hour of their triumph  so as i have hinted we were not surprised that jenny should be willing to remain with us and were as little prepared for her desertion as for any other change of our moral state but one day in september she came to her nominal mistress with tears in her beautiful eyes and protestations of unexampled devotion upon her tongue and said that she was afraid she must leave us she liked the place and she never had worked for any one that was more of a lady but she had made up her mind to go into the city all this so far was quite in the manner of domestics who in ghost stories give warning to the occupants of haunted houses and jennys mistress listened in suspense for the motive of her desertion expecting to hear no less than that it was something which walked up and down the stairs and dragged iron links after it or something that came and groaned at the front door like populace dissatisfied with a political candidate but it was in fact nothing of this kind simply there were no lamps upon our street and jenny after spending sunday evening with friends in east charlesbridge was always alarmed on her return in walking from the horsecar to our door the case was hopeless and jenny and our household parted with respect and regret  we had not before this thought it a grave disadvantage that our street was unlighted our street was not drained nor graded no municipal cart ever came to carry away our ashes there was not a waterbutt within half a mile to save us from fire nor more than the one thousandth part of a policeman to protect us from theft yet as i paid a heavy tax i somehow felt that we enjoyed the benefits of city government and never looked upon charlesbridge as in any way undesirable for residence but when it became necessary to find help in jennys place the frosty welcome given to application at the intelligence offices renewed a painful doubt awakened by her departure to be sure the heads of the offices were polite enough but when the young housekeeper had stated her case at the first to which she applied and the intelligencer had called out to the invisible expectants in the adjoining room anny wan wants to do ginerl housewark in charlsbrudge there came from the maids invoked so loud so fierce so full a no as shook the ladys heart with an indescribable shame and dread the name that with an innocent pride in its literary and historical associations she had written at the heads of her letters was suddenly become a matter of reproach to her and she was almost tempted to conceal thereafter that she lived in charlesbridge and to pretend that she dwelt upon some wretched little street in boston you see said the head of the office the gairls doesnt like to live so far away from the city now if it was ony in the port  this pen is not graphic enough to give the remote reader an idea of the affront offered to an inhabitant of old charlesbridge in these closing words neither am i of sufficiently tragic mood to report here all the sufferings undergone by an unhappy family in finding servants or to tell how the winter was passed with miserable makeshifts alas is it not the history of a thousand experiences any one who looks upon this page could match it with a tale as full of heartbreak and disaster while i conceive that in hastening to speak of mrs johnson i approach a subject of unique interest  the winter that ensued after jennys departure was the true sister of the bitter and shrewish spring of the same year but indeed it is always with a secret shiver that one must think of winter in our regrettable climate it is a terrible potency robbing us of half our lives and threatening or desolating the moiety left us with rheumatisms and catarrhs there is a much vaster sum of enjoyment possible to man in the more generous latitudes and i have sometimes doubted whether even the energy characteristic of ours is altogether to be praised seeing that it has its spring not so much in pure aspiration as in the instinct of self preservation egyptian greek roman energy was an inner impulse but ours is too often the sting of cold the spur of famine we must endure our winter but let us not be guilty of the hypocrisy of pretending that we like it let us caress it with no more vain compliments but use it with something of its own rude and savage sincerity  i say our last irish girl went with the last snow and on one of those midsummerlike days that sometimes fall in early april to our yet bleak and desolate zone our hearts sang of africa and golden joys a libyan longing took us and we would have chosen if we could to bear a strand of grotesque beads or a handful of brazen gauds and traffic them for some sable maid with crisped locks whom uncoffling from the captive train beside the desert we should make to do our general housework forever through the right of lawful purchase but we knew that this was impossible and that if we desired colored help we must seek it at the intelligence office which is in one of those streets chiefly inhabited by the orphaned children and grandchildren of slavery to tell the truth these orphans do not seem to grieve much for their bereavement but lead a life of joyous and rather indolent oblivion in their quarter of the city they are often to be seen sauntering up and down the street by which the charlesbridge cars arrivethe young with a harmless swagger and the old with the generic limp which our autocrat has already noted as attending advanced years in their race they seem the natural human interest of a street so largely devoted to old clothes and the thoughtful may see a felicity in their presence where the pawnbrokers windows display the forfeited pledges of improvidence and subtly remind us that we have yet to redeem a whole race pawned in our needy and reckless national youth and still held against us by the uncle of injustice who is also the father of lies how gayly are the young ladies of this race attired as they trip up and down the side walks and in and out through the pendent garments at the shop doors they are the black pansies and marigolds and darkblooded dahlias among womankind they try to assume something of our colder races demeanor but even the passer on the horsecar can see that it is not native with them and is better pleased when they forget us and ungenteelly laugh in encountering friends letting their white teeth glitter through the generous lips that open to their ears in the streets branching upwards from this avenue very little colored men and maids play with broken or enfeebled toys or sport on the wooden pavements of the entrances to the inner courts now and then a colored soldier or sailor looking strange in his uniform even after the custom of several years emerges from those passages or more rarely a black gentleman stricken in years and cased in shining broadcloth walks solidly down the brick sidewalk cane in handa vision of serene selfcomplacency and so plainly the expression of virtuous public sentiment that the great colored louts innocent enough till then in their idleness are taken with a sudden sense of depravity and loaf guiltily up against the housewalls at the same moment perhaps a young damsel amorously scuffling with an admirer through one of the low open windows suspends the strife and bids him go along now do more rarely yet than the gentleman described one may see a white girl among the dark neighbors whose frowzy head is uncovered and whose sleeves are rolled up to her elbows and who though no doubt quite at home looks as strange there as that pale anomaly which may sometimes be seen among a crew of blackbirds  an air not so much of decay as of unthrift and yet hardly of unthrift seems to prevail in the neighborhood which has none of the aggressive and impudent squalor of an irish quarter and none of the surly wickedness of a low american street a gayety not born of the things that bring its serious joy to the true new england hearta ragged gayety which comes of summer in the blood and not in the pocket or the conscience and which affects the countenance and the whole demeanor setting the feet to some inward music and at times bursting into a line of song or a childlike and irresponsible laughgives tone to the visible life and wakens a very friendly spirit in the passer who somehow thinks there of a milder climate and is half persuaded that the orangepeel on the sidewalks came from fruit grown in the soft atmosphere of those back courts  it was in this quarter then that we heard of mrs johnson and it was from a colored boardinghouse there that she came out to charlesbridge to look at us bringing her daughter of twelve years with her she was a matron of mature age and portly figure with a complexion like coffee soothed with the richest cream and her manners were so full of a certain tranquillity and grace that she charmed away all out will to ask for references it was only her barbaric laughter and her lawless eye that betrayed how slightly her new england birth and breeding covered her ancestral traits and bridged the gulf of a thousand years of civilization that lay between her race and ours but in fact she was doubly estranged by descent for as we learned later a sylvan wildness mixed with that of the desert in her veins her grandfather was an indian and her ancestors on this side had probably sold their lands for the same value in trinkets that bought the original african pair on the other side  the first day that mrs johnson descended into our kitchen she conjured from the malicious disorder in which it had been left by the flitting irish kobold a dinner that revealed the inspirations of genius and was quite different from a dinner of mere routine and laborious talent something original and authentic mingled with the accustomed flavors and though vague reminiscences of canalboat travel and woodland camps arose from the relish of certain of the dishes there was yet the assurance of such power in the preparation of the whole that we knew her to be merely running over the chords of our appetite with preliminary savors as a musician acquaints his touch with the keys of an unfamiliar piano before breaking into brilliant and triumphant execution within a week she had mastered her instrument and thereafter there was no faltering in her performances which she varied constantly through inspiration or from suggestion she was so quick to receive new ideas in her art that when the roman statuary who stayed a few weeks with us explained the mystery of various purely latin dishes she caught their principle at once and visions of the great white cathedral the coliseum and the dome of brunelleschi floated before us in the exhalations of the milanese risotto roman stufadino and florentine stracotto that smoked upon our board but after all it was in puddings that mrs johnson chiefly excelled she was one of those cooksrare as men of genius in literaturewho love their own dishes and she had in her personally childlike simplicity of taste and the inherited appetites of her savage forefathers a dominant passion for sweets so far as we could learn she subsisted principally upon puddings and tea through the same primitive instincts no doubt she loved praise she openly exulted in our artless flatteries of her skill she waited jealously at the head of the kitchen stairs to hear what was said of her work especially if there were guests and she was never too weary to attempt emprises of cookery  while engaged in these she wore a species of sightly handkerchief like a turban upon her head and about her person those mystical swathings in which old ladies of the african race delight but she most pleasured our sense of beauty and moral fitness when after the last pan was washed and the last pot was scraped she lighted a potent pipe and taking her stand at the kitchen door laded the soft evening air with its pungent odors if we surprised her at these supreme moments she took the pipe from her lips and put it behind her with a low mellow chuckle and a look of halfdefiant consciousness never guessing that none of her merits took us half so much as the cheerful vice which she only feigned to conceal  some things she could not do so perfectly as cooking because of her failing eyesight and we persuaded her that spectacles would both become and befriend a lady of her years and so bought her a pair of steelbowed glasses she wore them in some great emergencies at first but had clearly no pride in them before long she laid them aside altogether and they had passed from our thoughts when one day we heard her mellow note of laughter and her daughters harsher cackle outside our door and opening it beheld mrs johnson in goldbowed spectacles of massive frame we then learned that their purchase was in fulfillment of a vow made long ago in the lifetime of mr johnson that if ever she wore glasses they should be goldbowed and i hope the manes of the dead were half as happy in these votive spectacles as the simple soul that offered them  she and her late partner were the parents of eleven children some of whom were dead and some of whom were wanderers in unknown parts during his lifetime she had kept a little shop in her native town and it was only within a few years that she had gone into service she cherished a natural haughtiness of spirit and resented control although disposed to do all she could of her own motion being told to say when she wanted an afternoon she explained that when she wanted an afternoon she always took it without asking but always planned so as not to discommode the ladies with whom she lived these she said had numbered twentyseven within three years which made us doubt the success of her system in all cases though she merely held out the fact as an assurance of her faith in the future and a proof of the ease with which places were to be found she contended moreover that a lady who had for thirty years had a house of her own was in nowise bound to ask permission to receive visits from friends where she might be living but that they ought freely to come and go like other guests in this spirit she once invited her soninlaw professor jones of providence to dine with her and her defied mistress on entering the diningroom found the professor at pudding and tea therean impressively respectable figure in black clothes with a black face rendered yet more effective by a pair of green goggles it appeared that this dark professor was a light of phrenology in rhode island and that he was believed to have uncommon virtue in his science by reason of being blind as well as black  i am loath to confess that mrs johnson had not a flattering opinion of the caucasian race in all respects in fact she had very good philosophical and scriptural reasons for looking upon us as an upstart people of new blood who had come into their whiteness by no creditable or pleasant process the late mr johnson who had died in the west indies whither he voyaged for his health in quality of cook upon a downeast schooner was a man of letters and had written a book to show the superiority of the black over the white branches of the human family in this he held that as all islands have been at their discovery found peopled by blacks we must needs believe that humanity was first created of that color mrs johnson could not show us her husbands work a sole copy in the library of an english gentleman at port au prince is not to be bought for money but she often developed its arguments to the lady of the house and one day with a great show of reluctance and many protests that no personal slight was meant let fall the fact that mr johnson believed the white race descended from gehazi the leper upon whom the leprosy of naaman fell when the latter returned by divine favor to his original blackness and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow said mrs johnson quoting irrefutable scripture leprosy leprosy she added thoughtfullynothing but leprosy bleached you out  it seems to me much in her praise that she did not exult in our taint and degradation as some white philosophers used to do in the opposite idea that a part of the human family were cursed to lasting blackness and slavery in ham and his children but even told us of a remarkable approach to whiteness in many of her own offspring in a kindred spirit of charity no doubt she refused ever to attend church with people of her elder and wholesomer blood when she went to church she said she always went to a white church though while with us i am bound to say she never went to any she professed to read her bible in her bedroom on sundays but we suspected from certain sounds and odors which used to steal out of this sanctuary that her piety more commonly found expression in dozing and smoking  i would not make a wanton jest here of mrs johnsons anxiety to claim honor for the african color while denying this color in many of her own family it afforded a glimpse of the pain which all her people must endure however proudly they hide it or lightheartedly forget it from the despite and contumely to which they are guiltlessly born and when i thought how irreparable was this disgrace and calamity of a black skin and how irreparable it must be for ages yet in this world where every other shame and all manner of wilful guilt and wickedness may hope for covert and pardon i had little heart to laugh indeed it was so pathetic to hear this poor old soul talk of her dead and lost ones and try in spite of all mr johnsons theories and her own arrogant generalizations to establish their whiteness that we must have been very cruel and silly people to turn her sacred fables even into matter of question i have no doubt that her antoinette anastasia and her thomas jefferson wilberforce it is impossible to give a full idea of the splendor and scope of the baptismal names in mrs johnsons familyhave as light skins and as golden hair in heaven as her reverend maternal fancy painted for them in our world there certainly they would not be subject to tanning which had ruined the delicate complexion and had knotted into black woolly tangles the once wavy blonde locks of our little maidservant naomi and i would fain believe that toussaint washington johnson who ran away to sea so many years ago has found some fortunate zone where his hair and skin keep the same sunny and rosy tints they wore to his mothers eyes in infancy but i have no means of knowing this or of telling whether he was the prodigy of intellect that he was declared to be naomi could no more be taken in proof of the one assertion than of the other when she came to us it was agreed that she should go to school but she overruled her mother in this as in everything else and never went except sundayschool lessons she had no other instruction than that her mistress gave her in the evenings when a heavy days play and the natural influences of the hour conspired with original causes to render her powerless before words of one syllable  the first week of her service she was obedient and faithful to her duties but relaxing in the atmosphere of a house which seems to demoralize all menials she shortly fell into disorderly ways of lying in wait for callers out of doors and when people rang of running up the front steps and letting them in from the outside as the season expanded and the fine weather became confirmed she modified even this form of service and spent her time in the fields appearing at the house only when nature importunately craved molasses she had a parrotlike quickness so far as music was concerned and learned from the roman statuary to make the groves and halffinished houses resound    camicia rossa    ove t ascondi    t appella italia    tu non respondi  she taught the garibaldi song moreover to all the neighboring children so that i sometimes wondered if our street were not about to march upon rome in a body  in her untamable disobedience naomi alone betrayed her sylvan blood for she was in all other respects negro and not indian but it was of her aboriginal ancestry that mrs johnson chiefly boastedwhen not engaged in argument to maintain the superiority of the african race she loved to descant upon it as the cause and explanation of her own arrogant habit of feeling and she seemed indeed to have inherited something of the indians hauteur along with the ethiops supple cunning and abundant amiability she gave many instances in which her pride had met and overcome the insolence of employers and the kindly old creature was by no means singular in her pride of being reputed proud  she could never have been a woman of strong logical faculties but she had in some things a very surprising and awful astuteness she seldom introduced any purpose directly but bore all about it and then suddenly sprung it upon her unprepared antagonist at other times she obscurely hinted a reason and left a conclusion to be inferred as when she warded off reproach for some delinquency by saying in a general way that she had lived with ladies who used to come scolding into the kitchen after they had taken their bitters quality ladies took their bitters regular she added to remove any sting of personality from her remark for from many things she had let fall we knew that she did not regard us as quality on the contrary she often tried to overbear us with the gentility of her former places and would tell the lady over whom she reigned that she had lived with folks worth their three and four hundred thousand dollars who never complained as she did of the ironing yet she had a sufficient regard for the literary occupations of the family mr johnson having been an author she even professed to have herself written a book which was still in manuscript and preserved somewhere among her best clothes  it was well on many accounts to be in contact with a mind so original and suggestive as mrs johnsons we loved to trace its intricate yet often transparent operations and were perhaps too fond of explaining its peculiarities by facts of ancestryof finding hints of the powwow or the grand custom in each grotesque development we were conscious of something warmer in this old soul than in ourselves and something wilder and we chose to think it the tropic and the untracked forest she had scarcely any being apart from her affection she had no morality but was good because she neither hated nor envied and she might have been a saint far more easily than far more civilized people  there was that also in her sinuous yet malleable nature so full of guile and so full of goodness that reminded us pleasantly of lowly folk in elder lands where relaxing oppressions have lifted the restraints of fear between master and servant without disturbing the familiarity of their relation she advised freely with us upon all household matters and took a motherly interest in whatever concerned us she could be flattered or caressed into almost any service but no threat or command could move her when she erred she never acknowledged her wrong in words but handsomely expressed her regrets in a pudding or sent up her apologies in a favorite dish secretly prepared we grew so well used to this form of exculpation that whenever mrs johnson took an afternoon at an inconvenient season we knew that for a week afterwards we should be feasted like princes she owned frankly that she loved us that she never had done half so much for people before and that she never had been nearly so well suited in any other place and for a brief and happy time we thought that we never should part  one day however our dividing destiny appeared in the basement and was presented to us as hippolyto thucydides the son of mrs johnson who had just arrived on a visit to his mother from the state of new hampshire he was a heavy and loutish youth standing upon the borders of boyhood and looking forward to the future with a vacant and listless eye i mean that this was his figurative attitude his actual manner as he lolled upon a chair beside the kitchen window was so eccentric that we felt a little uncertain how to regard him and mrs johnson openly described him as peculiar he was so deeply tanned by the fervid suns of the new hampshire winter and his hair had so far suffered from the example of the sheep lately under his charge that he could not be classed by any stretch of compassion with the blonde and straighthaired members of mrs johnsons family  he remained with us all the first day until late in the afternoon when his mother took him out to get him a boardinghouse then he departed in the van of her and naomi pausing at the gate to collect his spirits and after he had sufficiently animated himself by clapping his palms together starting off down the street at a handgallop to the manifest terror of the cows in the pastures and the confusion of the less demonstrative people of our household other characteristic traits appeared in hippolyto thucydides within no very long period of time and he ran away from his lodgings so often during the summer that he might be said to board round among the outlying cornfields and turnippatches of charlesbridge as a check upon this habit mrs johnson seemed to have invited him to spend his whole time in our basement for whenever we went below we found him there balancedperhaps in homage to us and perhaps as a token of extreme sensibility in himselfupon the low windowsill the bottoms of his boots touching the floor inside and his face buried in the grass without  we could formulate no very tenable objection to all this and yet the presence of thucydides in our kitchen unaccountably oppressed our imaginations we beheld him all over the house a monstrous eidolon balanced upon every windowsill and he certainly attracted unpleasant notice to our place no less by his furtive and hangdog manner of arrival than by the bold displays with which he celebrated his departures we hinted this to mrs johnson but she could not enter into our feeling indeed all the wild poetry of her maternal and primitive nature seemed to cast itself about this hapless boy and if we had listened to her we should have believed there was no one so agreeable in society or so quickwitted in affairs as hippolyto when he chose she used to rehearse us long epics concerning his industry his courage and his talent and she put fine speeches in his mouth with no more regard to the truth than if she had been a historian and not a poet perhaps she believed that he really said and did the things she attributed to him it is the destiny of those who repeatedly tell great things either of themselves or others and i think we may readily forgive the illusion to her zeal and fondness in fact she was not a wise woman and she spoiled her children as if she had been a rich one  at last when we said positively that thucydides should come to us no more and then qualified the prohibition by allowing him to come every sunday she answered that she never would hurt the childs feelings by telling him not to come where his mother was that people who did not love her children did not love her and that if hippy went she went we thought it a masterstroke of firmness to rejoin that hippolyto must go in any event but i am bound to own that he did not go and that his mother stayed and so fed us with every cunning propitiatory dainty that we must have been pagans to renew our threat in fact we begged mrs johnson to go into the country with us and she after long reluctation on hippys account consented agreeing to send him away to friends during her absence  we made every preparation and on the eve of our departure mrs johnson went into the city to engage her sons passage to bangor while we awaited her return in untroubled security  but she did not appear till midnight and then responded with but a sad well sah to the cheerful well mrs johnson that greeted her  all right mrs johnson  mrs johnson made a strange noise half chuckle and half deathrattle in her throat all wrong sah hippys off again and ive been all over the city after him  then you cant go with us in the morning  how can i sah  mrs johnson went sadly out of the room then she came back to the door again and opening it uttered for the first time in our service words of apology and regret i hope i hant put you out any i wanted to go with you but i ought to knowed i couldnt all is i loved you too much     doorstep acquaintance   vagabonds the world would no doubt call many of my doorstep acquaintance and i do not attempt to defend them altogether against the world which paints but black and white and in general terms yet i would fain veil what is only halftruth under another name for i know that the service of their gay science is not one of such disgraceful ease as we associate with ideas of vagrancy though i must own that they lead the life they do because they love it they always protest that nothing but their ignorance of our tongue prevents them from practicing some mechanical trade what work could be harder they ask than carrying this organ about all day but while i answer with honesty that nothing can be more irksome i feel that they only pretend a disgust with it and that they really like organ grinding if for no other reason than that they are the children of the summer and it takes them into the beloved open weather one of my friends at least who in the warmer months is to all appearance a blithesome troubadour living    a merry life in sun and shade  as a coalheaver in winter and though this more honorable and useful occupation is doubtless open to him the whole year round yet he does not devote himself to it but prefers with the expanding spring to lay aside his grimy basket and shouldering his organ to quit the dismal wharves and carts and cellars and to wander forth into the suburbs with his lazy softeyed boy at his heels who does nothing with his tambourine but take up a collection and who meeting me the other day in a chance passage of ferry street knew me and gave me so much of his fathers personal history  it was winter even there in ferry street in which so many italians live that one might think to find it under a softer sky and in a gentler air and which i had always figured in a wide unlikeness to all other streets in bostonwith houses stuccoed outside and with gratings at their groundfloor windows with mouldering archways between the buildings and at the corners feeble lamps glimmering before pictures of the madonna with weatherbeaten shutters flapping overhead and many balconies from which hung the linen swathings of young infants and lovemaking maidens furtively lured the velvetjacketed leisurely youth below a place haunted by windy voices of blessing and cursing with the perpetual clack of woodenheeled shoes upon the stones and what perfume from the blossom of vines and almondtrees mingling with less delicate smells the travelled reader pleases to imagine i do not say that i found ferry street actually different from this vision in most respects but as for the vines and almondtrees they were not in bloom at the moment of my encounter with the little tambourineboy as we stood and talked the snow fell as heavily and thickly around us as elsewhere in boston with a vague painthe envy of a race toward another born to a happier climei heard from him that his whole family was going back to italy in a month the father had at last got together money enough and the mother who had long been an invalid must be taken home and so far as i know the population of ferry street exists but in the hope of a return soon or late to the native or the ancestral land  more than one of my doorstep acquaintance in fact seemed to have no other stock in trade than this fond desire and to thrive with it in our sympathetic community it is scarcely possible but the reader has met the widow of giovanni cascamatto a vesuvian lunatic who has long set fire to their home on the slopes of the volcano and perished in the flames she was our first italian acquaintance in charlesbridge presenting herself with a little subscriptionbook which she sent in for inspection with a printed certificate to the facts of her history signed with the somewhat conventionally saxon names of william tompkins and john johnson these gentlemen set forth in terms vaguer than can be reproduced that her object in coming to america was to get money to go back to italy and the whole document had so fictitious an air that it made us doubt even the nationality of the bearer but we were put to shame by the decent joy she manifested in an italian salutation there was no longer a question of imposture in anybodys mind we gladly paid tribute to her poetic fiction and she thanked us with a tranquil courtesy that placed the obligation where it belonged as she turned to go with many good wishes we pressed her to have some dinner but she answered with a compliment insurpassably flattering she had just dinedin another palace the truth is there is not a single palace on benicia street and our little box of pine and paper would hardly have passed for a palace on the stage where these things are often contrived with great simplicity but as we had made a little italy together she touched it with the exquisite politeness of her race and it became for the instant a lordly mansion standing on the chiaja or the via nuovissima or the canalazzo  i say this woman seemed glad to be greeted in italian but not so far as i could see surprised and altogether the most amazing thing about my doorstep acquaintance of her nation is that they are never surprised to be spoken to in their own tongue or if they are never show it a chestnutroaster who has sold me twice the chestnuts the same money would have bought of him in english has not otherwise recognized the fact that tuscan is not the dialect of charlesbridge and the mortifying nonchalance with which my advances have always been received has long since persuaded me that to the grinder at the gate it is not remarkable that a man should open the door of his wooden house on benicia street and welcome him in his native language after the first shock of this indifference is past it is not to be questioned but it flatters with an illusion which a stare of amazement would forbid reducing the encounter to a vulgar reality at once and i could almost believe it in those wily and amiable folk to intend the sweeter effect of their unconcern which tacitly implies that there is no other tongue in the world but italian and which makes all the earth and air italian for the time nothing else could have been the purpose of that imagedealer whom i saw on a summers day lying at the foot of one of our meetinghouses and doing his best to make it a cathedral and really giving a sentiment of medieval art to the noble sculptures of the facade which the carpenters had just nailed up freshly painted and newly repaired this poet was stretched upon his back eating in that convenient posture his dinner out of an earthen pot plucking the viand from it whatever it was with his thumb and forefinger and dropping it piecemeal into his mouth when the passer asked him where are you from he held a morsel in air long enough to answer da lucca signore and then let it fall into his throat and sank deeper into a reverie in which that crude accent even must have sounded like a gossips or a kinsmans voice but never otherwise moved muscle nor looked to see who passed or lingered there could have been little else in his circumstances to remind him of home and if he was really in the sort of daydream attributed to him he was wise not to look about him i have not myself been in lucca but i conceive that its piazza is not like our square with a pump and horsetrough in the midst but that it has probably a fountain and statuary though not possibly so magnificent an elm towering above the bronze or marble groups as spreads its boughs of benison over our pump and the horsecar switchman loitering near it to set the switch for the arriving cars or lift the brimming buckets to the smoking nostrils of the horses while out from the stable comes clanging and banging with a fresh team that famous african who has turned white or if he is off duty one of his brethren who has not yet begun to turn figure besides an expressman watering his horse at the trough a provisioncart backed up against the curb in front of one of the stores various people looking from the caroffice windows and a conductor appearing at the door long enough to call out ready for bostonand you have a scene of such gayety as lucca could never have witnessed in her piazza at high noon on a summers day even our campo santo if the lucchese had cared to look round the corner of the meetinghouse at its mossgrown head stones could have had little to remind him of home though it has antiquity and a proper quaintness but not for him not for them of his clime and faith is the pathos of those simple memorial slates with their winged skulls changing upon many later stones as if by the softening of creeds and customs to cherubs headsnot for him is the pang i feel because of those who died in our countrys youth exiles or exiles children heirs of the wilderness and toil and hardship could they rise from their restful beds and look on this wandering italian with his plaster statuettes of apollo and canovan dancers and deities they would hold his wares little better than romish saints and idolatries and would scarcely have the sentimental interest in him felt by the modern citizen of charlesbridge but i think that even they must have respected that lombard scissorsgrinder who used to come to us and put an edge to all the cutlery in the house  he has since gone back to milan whence he came eighteen years ago and whither he has returnedas he told me one acute day in the fall when all the winter hinted itself and the painted leaves shuddered earthward in the grove across the wayto enjoy a little climate before he died per goder un po di dima prima di morire our climate was the only thing he had against us in every other respect he was a new englander even to the early stages of consumption he told me the story of his whole life and of how in his adventurous youth he had left milan and sojourned some years in naples vainly seeking his fortune there afterwards he went to greece and set up his ancestral business of greengrocer in athens faring there no better but rather worse than in naples because of the deeper wickedness of the athenians who cheated him right and left and whose laws gave him no redress the neapolitans were bad enough he said making a wry face but the greeksand he spat the greeks out in the grass at last after much misfortune in europe he bethought him of coming to america and he had never regretted it but for the climate you spent a good deal herenearly all you earnedbut then a poor man was a man and the people were honest it was wonderful to him that they all knew how to read and write and he viewed with inexpressible scorn those irish who came to this country and were so little sensible of the benefits it conferred upon them boston he believed the best city in america and tell me said he is there such a thing anywhere else in the world as that public library he a poor man and almost unknown had taken books from it to his own room and was master to do so whenever he liked he had thus been enabled to read bottas history of the united states an enormous compliment both to the country and the work which i doubt ever to have been paid before and he knew more about washington than i did and desired to know more than i could tell him of the financial question among us so we came to national politics and then to european affairs it appears that garibaldi will not go to rome this year remarks my scissorsgrinder who is very red in his sympathies the emperor forbids well patience and that blessed pope what does he want that pope he will be king find priest both he will wear two pairs of shoes at once i must confess that no other of my doorstep acquaintance had so clear an idea as this one of the difference between things here and at home to the minds of most we seemed divided here as there into rich and poorsignori persone eivili and povera genteand their thoughts about us did not go beyond a speculation as to our individual willingness or ability to pay for organgrinding but this lombard was worthy of his adopted country and i forgive him the frank expression of a doubt that one day occurred to him when offered a glass of italian wine he held it daintily between him and the sun for a smiling moment and then said as if our wine must needs be as ungenuine as our italianwas perhaps some expression from the surrounding currantbushes harsh as that from the northern tongues which could never give his language the true life and tonic charmbut i suppose this wine is not made of grapes signor yet he was a very courteous old man elaborate in greeting and leavetaking and with a quicker sense than usual it was accounted delicacy in him that when he had bidden us a final adieu he should never come near us again though the date of his departure was postponed some weeks and we heard him tinkling down the street and stopping at the neighbors houses he was a keenfaced thoughtfullooking man and he wore a blouse of blue cotton from the pocket of which always dangled the leaves of some wild salad culled from our wasteful vacant lots or prodigal waysides  illustration but i suppose this wine is not made of grapes signor  altogether different in character was that triestine who came one evening to be helped home at the close of a very disastrous career in mexico he was a person of innumerable bows and fluttered his brightcolored compliments about till it appeared that never before had such amiable people been asked charity by such a worthy and generous sufferer in trieste he had been a journalist and it was evident enough from his speech that he was of a good education he was vain of his italian accent which was peculiarly good for his heterogeneously peopled native city and he made a show of that marvelous facility of the triestines in languages by taking me down french books spanish books german books and reading from them all with the properest accent yet with this boyish pride and selfsatisfaction there was mixed a tone of bitter and worldly cynicism a belief in fortune as the sole providence as nearly as i could make out he was a johnson man in american politics upon the mexican question he was independent disdaining french and mexicans alike he was with the former from the first and had continued in the service of maximilian after their withdrawal till the execution of that prince made mexico no place for adventurous merit he was now going back to his native country an ungrateful land enough which had ill treated him long ago but to which he nevertheless returned in a perfect gayety of temper what a lighthearted rogue he waswith such merry eyes and such a pleasant smile shaping his neatly trimmed beard and mustache after he had supped and he stood with us at the door taking leave something happened to be said of italian songs whereupon this blithe exile whom the compassion of strangers was enabling to go home after many years of unprofitable toil and danger to a country that had loved him not fell to caroling a venetian barcarole and went sweetly away in its cadence i bore him company as far as the gate of another italianspeaking signor and was there bidden adieu with great effusion so that i forgot till he had left me to charge him not to be in fear of the housedog which barked but did not bite in calling this after him i had the misfortune to blunder in my verb a man of another nationperhaps another man of his own nation would have cared rather for what i said than how i said it but he as if too zealous for the honor of his beautiful language to endure a hurt to it even in that moment of grief lifting his hat and bowing for the last time responded with a morde non morsica signore and passed in under the pines and next day to italy  there is a little old genoese lady comes to sell us pins needles thread tape and the like roba whom i regard as leading quite an ideal life in some respects her traffic is limited to a certain number of families who speak more or less italian and her days so far as they are concerned must be passed in an atmosphere of sympathy and kindliness the truth is we northern and new world folk cannot help but cast a little romance about whoever comes to us from italy whether we have actually known the beauty and charm of that land or not then this old lady is in herself a very gentle and lovable kind of person with a tender mother face which is also the face of a child a smile plays always upon her wrinkled visage and her quick and restless eyes are full of friendliness there is never much stuff in her basket however and it is something of a mystery how she manages to live from it none but an italian could i am sure and her experience must test the full virtue of the national genius for cheap salads and muchextenuated soupmeat i do not know whether it is native in her or whether it is a grace acquired from long dealing with those kindlyhearted customers of hers in charlesbridge but she is of a most munificent spirit and returns every smallest benefit with some present from her basket she makes me ashamed of things i have written about the sordidness of her race but i shall vainly seek to atone for them by openhandedness to her she will give favor for favor she will not even count the money she receives our bargaining is a contest of the courtliest civilities ending in many an adieu to meet again remain well and finally not surpassed if rivaled in any italian street in her ineffectual way she brings us news of her different customers breaking up their stout saxon names into tinkling polysyllables which suggest them only to the practiced sense and is perfectly patient and contented if we mistake one for another she loves them all but she pities them as living in a terrible climate and doubtless in her heart she purposes one day to go back to italy there to die in the mean time she is very cheerful she too has had her troubleswhat troubles i do not remember but those that come by sickness and by death and that really seem no sorrows until they come to usyet she never complains it is hard to make a living and the houserent alone is six dollars a month but still one lives and does not fare so ill either as it does not seem to be in her to dislike any one it must be out of a harmless guile felt to be comforting to servantridden householders that she always speaks of those irish her neighbors with a bated breath a shaken head a hand lifted to the cheek and an averted countenance  swarthiest of the organgrinding tribe is he who peers up at my window out of infinitesimal black eyes perceives me louts low and for forms sake grinds me out a tune before he begins to talk as we parley together say it is eleven oclock in the forenoon and a sober tranquillity reigns upon the dust and nodding weeds of benicia street at that hour the organ grinder and i are the only persons of our sex in the whole suburban population all other husbands and fathers having eaten their breakfasts at seven oclock and stood up in the early horsecars to boston whence they will return with aching backs and quivering calves halfpendant by leathern straps from the roofs of the same luxurious conveyances in the evening the italian might go and grind his organ upon the front stoop of any one of a hundred frenchroof houses around and there would be no arm within strong enough to thrust him thence but he is a gentleman in his way and as he prettily explains he never stops to play except where the window smiles on him a frowning lattice he will pass in silence i behold in him a disappointed mana man broken in health and of a liver baked by long sojourn in a tropical clime in large and dim outline made all the dimmer by his dialect he sketches me the story of his life how in his youth he ran away from the milanese for love of a girl in france who dying left him with so little purpose in the world that after working at his trade of plasterer for some years in lyons he listened to a certain gentleman going out upon government service to a french colony in south america this gentleman wanted a manservant and he said to my organ grinder go with me and i make your fortune so he who cared not whither he went went and found himself in the tropics it was a hard life he led there and of the wages that had seemed so great in france he paid nearly half to his laundress alone being forced to be neat in his masters house the service was not so irksome indoors but it was the hunting beasts in the forest all day that broke his patience at last  beasts in the forest i ask forgetful of the familiar sense of bestie and figuring cougars at least by the word  yes those little beasts for the naturalistsflies bugs beetles heaven knows what  but this brought you money  it brought my master money but me aches and pains as many as you will and at last the fever when that was burnt out i made up my mind to ask for more pay and not getting it to quit that service i think the signor would have given itbut the signora so i left empty as i came and was cook on a vessel to new york  this was the black and white of the mans story i lose the color and atmosphere which his manner as well as his words bestowed upon it he told it in a cheerful impersonal kind of way as the romance of a poor devil which had interested him and might possibly amuse me leaving out no touch of character in his portrait of the fat selfish masteryielding enough however but for his grasping wife who with all her avarice and greed he yet confessed to be very handsome by the wave of a hand he housed them in a tropic residence dim cool close shut kept by servants in white linen moving with mute slippered feet over stone floors and by another gesture he indicated the fierce thorny growths of the forest in which he hunted those vivid insectsthe luxuriant savannas the gigantic ferns and palms the hush and shining desolation the presence of the invisible fever and death there was a touch too of inexpressible sadness in his halfignorant mention of the exiles at cayenne who were forbidden the wide ocean of escape about them by those swift gunboats keeping their coasts and swooping down upon every craft that left the shore he himself had seen one such capture and he made me see it and the mortal despair of the fugitives standing upright in their boat with the idle oars in their unconscious hands while the corvette swept toward them  for all his misfortunes he was not cast down he had that lightness of temper which seems proper to most northern italians whereas those from the south are usually darkmooded sadfaced men nothing surpasses for unstudied misanthropy of expression the visages of different neapolitan harpers who have visited us but they have some right to their dejected countenances as being of a yet halfcivilized stock and as real artists and men of genius nearly all wandering violinists as well as harpers are of their race and they are of every age from that of mere children to men in their prime they are very rarely old as many of the organ grinders are they are not so handsome as the italians of the north though they have invariably fine eyes they arrive in twos and threes the violinist briefly tunes his fiddle and the harper unslings his instrument and with faces of profound gloom they go through their repertorypieces from the great composers airs from the opera not unmingled with such efforts of anglosaxon genius as champagne charley and captain jenks of the horse marines which like the language of shakespeare and milton hold us and our english cousins in tender bonds of mutual affection beyond the fact that they come dal basilicat or dal principat one gets very little out of these neapolitans though i dare say they are not so surly at heart as they look money does not brighten them to the eye but yet it touches them and they are good in playing or leaving off to him that pays long time two of them stood between the gateway firs on a pleasant summers afternoon and twanged and scraped their harmonious strings till all the idle boys of the neighborhood gathered about them listening with a grave and still delight it was a most serious company the neapolitans with their cloudy brows rapt in their music and the yankee children with their impassive faces warily guarding against the faintest expression of enjoyment and when at last the minstrels played a brisk measure and the music began to work in the blood of the boys and one of them shuffling his reluctant feet upon the gravel broke into a sudden and resistless dance the spectacle became too sad for contemplation the boy danced only from the hips down no expression of his face gave the levity sanction nor did any of his comrades they beheld him with a silent fascination but none was infected by the solemn indecorum and when the legs and music ceased their play together no comment was made and the dancer turned unheated away a chance passer asked for what he called the gearybaldeye hymn but the neapolitans apparently did not know what this was  my doorstep acquaintance were not all of one race now and then an alien to the common italian tribe appearedan irish soldier on his way to salem and willing to show me more of his mutilation than i cared to buy the sight of for twentyfive cents and more rarely yet an american also formerly of the army but with something besides his wretchedness to sell on the hottest day of last summer such a one rang the bell and was discovered on the threshold wiping with his poor sole hand the sweat that stood upon his forehead there was still enough of the independent citizen in his maimed and emaciated person to inspire him with deliberation and a show of that indifference with which we americans like to encounter each other but his voice was rather faint when he asked if i supposed we wanted any starch today  yes certainly answered what heart there was within taking note willfully but i hope not wantonly what an absurdly limp figure he was for a peddler of starchcertainly from you brave fellow and the package being taken from his basket the man turned to go away so very wearily that a cheap philanthropy protested for shame ask him to sit down indoors and drink a glass of water  no answered the poor fellow when this indignant voice had been obeyed and he had been taken at a disadvantage and as it were surprised into the confession my family hadnt any breakfast this morning and ive got to hurry back to them  havent you had any breakfast  well i want rightly hungry when i left the house  here now popped in the virtue before named is an opportunity to discharge the debt we all owe to the brave fellows who gave us back our country make it beer  so it was made beer and bread and cold meat and after a little pressing the honest soul consented to the refreshment he sat down in a cool doorway and began to eat and to tell of the fight before vicksburg and if you have never seen a onearmed soldier making a meal i can assure you the sight is a pathetic one and is rendered none the cheerfuller by his memories of the fights that mutilated him this man had no very susceptible audience but before he was carried off the field shot through the body and in the arm and foot he had sold every package of starch in his basket i am ashamed to say this now for i suspect that a man with one arm who indulged himself in going about under that broiling sun of july peddling starch was very probably an impostor he computed a good days profits of seventyfive cents and when asked if that was not very little for the support of a sick wife and three children he answered with a quaint effort at impressiveness and with a trick as i imagined from the manner of the regimental chaplain youve done your duty my friend and moren your duty if every one did their duty like that we should get along so he took leave and shambled out into the furnace heat the sun beating upon his pale face and his linen coat hugging him close but with his basket lighter and i hope his heart also at any rate this was the sentiment which cheap philanthropy offered in self gratulation as he passed out of sight there you are quits with those maimed soldiers at last and you have a country which you have paid for with cold victuals as they with blood  we have been a good deal visited by one disbanded volunteer not to the naked eye maimed nor apparently suffering from any lingering illness yet who bears as he tells me a secret disabling wound in his side from a spent shell and who is certainly a prey to the most acute form of shiftlessness i do not recall with exactness the date of our acquaintance but it was one of those pleasant august afternoons when a dinner eaten in peace fills the digester with a millennial tenderness for the race too rarely felt in the nineteenth century at such a moment it is a more natural action to loosen than to tighten the pursestrings and when a very neatly dressed young man presented himself at the gate and in a note of indescribable plaintiveness asked if i had any little job for him to do that he might pay for a nights lodging i looked about the small domain with a vague longing to find some part of it in disrepair and experienced a moments absurd relief when he hinted that he would be willing to accept fifty cents in pledge of future service yet this was not the right principle some work real or apparent must be done for the money and the veteran was told that he might weed the strawberry bed though as matters then stood it was clean enough for a strawberry bed that never bore anything the veteran was neatly dressed as i have said his coat which was good was buttoned to the throat for reasons that shall be sacred against curiosity and he had on a perfectly clean paper collar he was a handsome young fellow with regular features and a solicitously kept imperial and mustache his hair when he lifted his hat appeared elegantly oiled and brushed i did not hope from this figure that the work done would be worth the money paid and as nearly as i can compute the weeds he took from that bed cost me a cent apiece to say nothing of a cup of tea given him in grace at the end of his labors  my acquaintance was as the reader will be glad to learn a native american though it is to be regretted for the sake of facts which his case went far to establish that he was not a newenglander by birth the most that could be claimed was that he came to boston from delaware when very young and that there on that brinewashed granite he had grown as perfect a flower of helplessness and indolence as fine a fruit of maturing civilization as ever expanded or ripened in latin lands he lived not only a protest in flesh and blood against the tendency of democracy to exclude mere beauty from our system but a refutation of those old world observers who deny to our vulgar and bustling communities the refining and elevating grace of repose there was something very curious and original in his character from which the sentiment of shame was absent but which was not lacking in the fine instincts of personal cleanliness of dress of style there was nothing of the rowdy in him he was gentle as an italian noble in his manners what other traits they may have had in common i do not know perhaps an amiable habit of illusion he was always going to bring me his discharge papers but he never did though he came often and had many a pleasant nights sleep at my cost if sometimes he did a little work he spent great part of the time contracted to me in the kitchen where it was understood quite upon his own agency that his wages included board at other times he called for money too late in the evening to work it out that day and it has happened that a new second girl deceived by his genteel appearance in the uncertain light has shown him into the parlor where i have found him to his and my own great amusement as the gentleman who wanted to see me nothing else seemed to raise his ordinarily dejected spirits so much we all know how pleasant it is to laugh at people behind their backs but this veteran afforded me at a very low rate the luxury of a fellowbeing whom one might laugh at to his face as much as one liked  yet with all his shamelessness his pensiveness his elegance i felt that somehow our national triumph was not complete in himthat there were yet more finished forms of selfabasement in the old world till one day i looked out of the window and saw at a little distance my veteran digging a cellar for an irishman i own that the spectacle gave me a shock of pleasure and that i ran down to have a nearer view of what human eyes have seldom if ever beheldan american pure blood handling the pick the shovel and the wheelbarrow while an irishman directed his labors upon inspection it appeared that none of the trees grew with their roots in the air in recognition of this great reversal of the natural law all the frenchroof houses stood right side up the phenomenon may become more common in future unless the american race accomplishes its destiny of dying out before the more populatory foreigner but as yet it graced the veteran with an exquisite and signal distinction he however seemed to feel unpleasantly the anomaly of his case and opened the conversation by saying that he should not work at that job tomorrow it hurt his side and went on to complain of the inhumanity of americans to americans why said he theyd rather give out their jobs to a nigger than to one of their own kind i was beatin carpets for a gentleman on the avenue and the first thing i know he give most of em to a nigger i beat seven of em in one day and got two dollars and the nigger beat em by the piece and he got a dollar an a half apiece my luck  here the irishman glanced at his hireling and the rueful veteran hastened to pile up another wheelbarrow with earth if ever we come to reverse positions generally with our irish brethren there is no doubt but they will get more work out of us than we do from them at present  it was shortly after this that the veteran offered to do second girls work in my house if i would take him the place was not vacant and as the summer was now drawing to a close and i feared to be left with him on my hands for the winter it seemed well to speak to him upon the subject of economy the next time he called i had not about me the exact sum for a nights lodgingfifty cents namelyand asked him if he thought a dollar would do he smiled sadly as if he did not like jesting upon such a very serious subject but said he allowed to work it out and took it  now i hope you wont think i am interfering with your affairs said his benefactor but i really think you are a very poor financier according to your own account you have been going on from year to year for a long time trusting to luck for a nights lodging sometimes i suppose you have to sleep outofdoors  no never answered the veteran with something like scorn i never sleep outdoors i wouldnt do it  well at any rate some one has to pay for your lodging dont you think youd come cheaper to your friends if instead of going to a hotel every night youd take a room somewhere and pay for it by the month  ive thought of that if i could get a good bed id try it awhile anyhow you see the hotels have raised i used to get a lodgin and a nice breakfast for a half a dollar but now it is as much as you can do to get a lodgin for the money and its just as dear in the port as it is in the city ive tried hotels pretty much everywhere and ones about as bad as another  if he had been a travelled englishman writing a book he could not have spoken of hotels with greater disdain  you see the trouble with me is i aint got any relations around here now he added with the life and eagerness of an inspiration if i had a mother and sister livin down at the port say i wouldnt go hunting about for these mean little jobs everywheres id just lay round home and wait till something come up big what i want is a home  at the instigation of a malignant spirit i asked the homeless orphan why dont you get married then  he gave me another smile sadder fainter sweeter than before and said when would you like to see me again so i could work out this dollar  a sudden and unreasonable disgust for the character which had given me so much entertainment succeeded to my past delight i felt moreover that i had bought the right to use some frankness with the veteran and i said to him do you know now i shouldnt care if i never saw you again  i can only conjecture that he took the confidence in good part for he did not appear again after that     a pedestrian tour   walking for walkings sake i do not like the diversion appears to me one of the most factitious of modern enjoyments and i cannot help looking upon those who pace their five miles in the teeth of a north wind and profess to come home all the livelier and better for it as guilty of a venial hypocrisy it is in nature that after such an exercise the bones should ache and the flesh tremble and i suspect that these harmless pretenders are all the while paying a secret penalty for their bravado with a pleasant end in view or with cheerful companionship walking is far from being the worst thing in life though doubtless a truly candid person must confess that he would rather ride under the same circumstances yet it is certain that some sort of recreation is necessary after a day spent within doors and one is really obliged nowadays to take a little walk instead of medicine for ones doctor is sure to have a mania on the subject and there is no more getting pills or powders out of him for a slight indigestion than if they had all been shot away at the rebels during the war for this reason i sometimes go upon a pedestrian tour which is of no great extent in itself and which i moreover modify by keeping always within sound of the horsecar bells or easy reach of some steamcar station  i fear that i should find these rambles dull but that their utter lack of interest amuses me i will be honest with the reader though and any master pliable is free to forsake me at this point for i cannot promise to be really livelier than my walk there is a slough of despond in full view and not a delectable mountain to be seen unless you choose so to call the high lands about waltham which we shall behold dark blue against the western sky presently as i sally forth upon benicia street the whole suburb of charlesbridge stretches about mea vast space upon which i can embroider any fancy i like as i saunter along i have no associations with it or memories of it and at some seasons i might wander for days in the most frequented parts of it and meet hardly any one i know it is not however to these parts that i commonly turn but northward up a street upon which a flight of frenchroof houses suddenly settled a year or two since with families in them and many outward signs of permanence though their precipitate arrival might cast some doubt upon this i have to admire their uniform neatness and prettiness and i look at their dormerwindows with the envy of one to whose weak sentimentality dormer windows long appeared the supreme architectural happiness but for all my admiration of the houses i find a variety that is pleasanter in the landscape when i reach beyond them a little bridge which appears to span a small stream it unites banks lined with a growth of trees and briers nodding their heads above the neighboring levels and suggesting a quiet watercourse though in fact it is the fitchburg railroad that purls between them with rippling freight and passenger trains and evergurgling locomotives the banks take the earliest green of spring upon their southward slope and on a sunday morning of may when the bells are lamenting the sabbaths of the past i find their sunny tranquillity sufficient to give me a slight heartache for i know not what if i descend them and follow the railroad westward half a mile i come to vast brickyards which are not in themselves exciting to the imagination and which yet from an irresistible association of ideas remind me of egypt and are forever newly forsaken of those who made bricks without straw so that i have no trouble in erecting temples and dynastic tombs out of the kilns while the mills for grinding the clay serve me very well for those sadvoiced sakias or wheelpumps which the howadji curtis heard wailing at their work of drawing water from the nile a little farther on i come to the boardinghouse built at the railroad side for the french canadians who have by this time succeeded the hebrews in the toil of the brickyards and who as they loiter in windyvoiced goodhumored groups about the doors of their lodgings insist upon bringing before me the town of st michel at the mouth of the great mont cenis tunnel where so many peasant folk like them are always amiably quarreling before the cabarets when the diligence comes and goes somewhere there must be a gendarme with a cocked hat and a sword on standing with folded arms to represent the empire and peace among that rural population if i looked indoors i am sure i should see the neatest of landladies and landladies daughters and nieces in high black silk caps bearing hither and thither smoking bowls of bouillon and caféaulait well it takes as little to make one happy as miserable thank heaven and i derive a cheerfulness from this scene which quite atones to me for the fleeting desolation suffered from the sunny verdure on the railroad bank with repaired spirits i take my way up through the brickyards towards the irish settlement on the north passing under the long sheds that shelter the kilns the ashes lie cold about the mouths of most and the bricks are burnt to the proper complexion in others these are freshly arranged over flues in which the fire has not been kindled but in whatever state i see them i am reminded of brickkilns of boyhood they were then such palaces of enchantment as any architect should now vainly attempt to rival with bricks upon the most desirable corner lot of the back bay and were the homes of men truly to be envied men privileged to stay up all night to sleep as it were out of doors to hear the wild geese as they flew over in the darkness to be waking in time to shoot the early ducks that visited the neighboring ponds to roast corn upon the ends of sticks to tell and to listen to stories that never ended save in some sudden impulse to rise and dance a happy hoedown in the ruddy light of the kiln fires if by day they were seen to have the redness of eyes of men that looked upon the whiskey when it was yellow and gave its color in the flask if now and then the fragments of a broken bottle strewed the scene of their vigils and a head broken to match appeared among those good comrades the boyish imagination was not shocked by these things but accepted them merely as the symbols of a free virile life some such life no doubt is still to be found in the dublin to which i am come by the time my repertory of associations with brickkilns is exhausted but oddly enough i no longer care to encounter it  it is perhaps in a pious recognition of our mortality that dublin is built around the irish graveyard most of its windows look out upon the sepulchral monuments and the pretty constant arrival of the funeral trains with their long lines of carriages bringing to the celebration of the sad ultimate rites those gay companies of irish mourners i suppose that the spectacle of such obsequies is not at all depressing to the inhabitants of dublin but that on the contrary it must beget in them a feeling which if not resignation to death is at least a sort of subacute cheerfulness in his presence none but a dubliner however would have been greatly animated by a scene which i witnessed during a stroll through this cemetery one afternoon of early spring the fact that a marble slab or shaft more or less sculptured and inscribed with words more or less helpless is the utmost that we can give to one whom once we could caress with every tenderness of speech and touch and that after all the memorial we raise is rather to our own grief and is a decency a mere conventionalitythis is a dreadful fact on which the heart breaks itself with such a pang that it always seems a desolation never recognized an anguish never felt before whilst i stood revolving this thought in my mind and reading the irish names upon the stones and the black head boardsthe latter adorned with pictures of angels once gilt but now weatherworn down to the yellow painta wail of intolerable pathos filled the air o my darling o my darling ooo with sobs and groans and sighs and looking about i saw two women one standing upright beside another that had cast herself upon a grave and lay clasping it with her comfortless arms uttering these cries the grave was a year old at least but the grief seemed of yesterday or of that morning at times the friend that stood beside the prostrate woman stooped and spoke a soothing word to her while she wailed out her woe and in the midst some little ribald irish boys came scuffling and quarreling up the pathway singing snatches of an obscene song and when both the wailing and the singing had died away an old woman decently clad and with her manywrinkled face softened by the oldfashioned frill running round the inside of her cap dropped down upon her knees beside a very old grave and clasped her hands in a silent prayer above it  illustration looking about i saw two women  if i had beheld all this in some village campo santo in italy i should have been much more vividly impressed by it as an aesthetical observer whereas i was now merely touched as a human being and had little desire to turn the scene to literary account i could not help feeling that it wanted the atmosphere of sentimental association the whole background was a blank or worse than a blank yet i have not been able to hide from myself so much as i would like certain points of resemblance between our irish and the poorer classes of italians the likeness is one of the first things that strikes an american in italy and i am always reminded of it in dublin so much of the local life appears upon the street there is so much gossip from house to house and the talk is always such a resonant clamoring the women bareheaded or with a shawl folded over the head and caught beneath the chin with the hand have such a contented downatheel aspect shuffling from door to door or lounging arms akimbo among the cats and poultry at their own thresholds that one beholding it all might well fancy himself upon some italian calle or vicolo of course the illusion does not hold good on a sunday when the dubliners are coming home from church in their besttheir extraordinary best bonnets and their prodigious silk hats it does not hold good in any way or at any time except upon the surface for there is beneath all this resemblance the difference that must exist between a race immemorially civilized and one which has lately emerged from barbarism after six centuries of oppression you are likely to find a polite pagan under the mask of the modern italian you feel pretty sure that any of his race would with a little washing and skillful manipulation restore like a neglected painting into something genuinely graceful and pleasing but if one of these yankeefied celts were scraped it is but too possible that you might find a kern a whiteboy or a pikeman the chance of discovering a scholar or a saint of the period when ireland was the centre of learning and the favorite seat of the church is scarcely one in three  among the houses fronting on the main street of dublin every other onei speak in all moderationis a grocery if i may judge by a tin case of cornballs a jar of candy and a card of shirtbuttons with an under layer of primers and ballads in the windows you descend from the street by several steps into these haunts which are contrived to secure the greatest possible dampness and darkness and if you have made an errand inside you doubtless find a lady before the counter in the act of putting down a guiltylooking tumbler with one hand while she neatly wipes her mouth on the back of the other she has that effect observable in all tippling women of low degree of having no upper garment on but a shawl which hangs about her in statuesque folds and lines she slinks out directly but the lady behind the counter gives you good evening with    the affectation of a brighteyed ease  intended to deceive if you chance to be a state constable in disguise and to propitiate if you are a veritable customer who was that woman lamenting so over in the graveyard o i dont know sir answered the lady making change for the price of a ballad some irish folks they ginerally cries that way  in yet earlier spring walks through dublin i found a depth of mud appalling even to one who had lived three years in charlesbridge the streets were passable only to pedestrians skilled in shifting themselves along the sides of fences and alert to take advantage of every projecting doorstep there were no dry places except in front of the groceries where the ground was beaten hard by the broad feet of loafing geese and the coming and going of admirably small children making purchases there the number of the little ones was quite as remarkable as their size and ought to have been even more interesting if as sometimes appears probable such increase shalltogether with the wellknown ambition of dubliners to rule the landone day make an end of us poor yankees as a dominant plurality  the town was somewhat tainted with our architectural respectability unless the newness of some of the buildings gave illusion of this and though the streets of dublin were not at all cared for and though every house on the main thoroughfare stood upon the brink of a slough without yard or any attempt at garden or shrubbery there were many cottages in the less aristocratic quarters inclosed in palings and embowered in the usual suburban peartrees and currantbushes these indeed were dwellings of an elder sort and had clearly been inherited from a population now as extinct in that region as the pequots and they were not always carefully cherished on the border of the hamlet is to be seen an old farmhouse of the poorer sort built about the beginning of this century and now thickly peopled by dubliners its gate is thrown down and the great wildgrown lilac hedge no longer protected by a fence shows skirts bedabbled by the familiarity of lawless poultry as little like the steadyhabited poultry of other times as the people of the house are like the former inmates long since dead or gone west i offer the poor place a sentiment of regret as i pass thinking of its better days i think of its decorous hardworking cleanly schoolgoing church attending life which was full of the pleasure of duty done and was not without its own quaint beauty and grace what long sabbaths were kept in that old house what scanty holidays yet from this and such as this came the dominion of the whole wild continent the freedom of a race the greatness of the greatest people it may be that i regretted a little too exultantly and that out of this particular house came only peddling of innumerable clocks and multitudinous tinware but as yet it is pretty certain that the general character of the population has not gained by the change what is in the future let the prophets say any one can see that something not quite agreeable is in the present something that takes the wrong side as by instinct in politics something that mainly helps to prop up tottering priestcraft among us something that one thinks of with dismay as destined to control so largely the civil and religious interests of the country this however is only the aggregate aspect mrs clannahans kitchen as it may be seen by the desperate philosopher when he goes to engage her for the spring housecleaning is a strong argument against his fears if mrs clannahan lately of an irish cabin can show a kitchen so capably appointed and so neatly kept as that the country may yet be an inch or two from the brink of ruin and the race which we trust as little as we love may turn out no more spendthrift than most heirs it is encouraging moreover when any people can flatter themselves upon a superior prosperity and virtue and we may take heart from the fact that the french canadians many of whom have lodgings in dublin are not well seen by the higher classes of the citizens there mrs clannahan whose house stands over against the main gate of the graveyard and who may therefore be considered as moving in the best dublin society hints that though good catholics the french are not thought perfectly honest things have been missed since they came to blight with their crimes and vices the once happy seat of integrity it is amusing to find dublin fearful of the encroachment of the french as we in our turn dread the advance of the irish we must make a jest of our own alarms and even smilesince we cannot help ourselvesat the spiritual desolation occasioned by the settlement of an irish family in one of our suburban neighborhoods the householders view with fear and jealousy the erection of any dwelling of less than a stated cost as portending a possible advent of irish and when the calamitous race actually appears a mortal pang strikes to the bottom of every pocket values tremble throughout that neighborhood to which the newcomers communicate a species of moral dry rot none but the irish will build near the irish and the infection of fear spreads to the elder yankee homes about and the owners prepare to abandon themnot always however let us hope without turning at the expense of the invaders a parthian penny in their flight in my walk from dublin to north charlesbridge i saw more than one token of the encroachment of the celtic army which had here and there invested a yankee house with besieging shanties on every side and thus given to its essential and otherwise quite hopeless ugliness a touch of the poetry that attends failing fortunes and hallows decayed gentility of however poor a sort originally the fortunes of such a house are of course not to be retrieved where the celt sets his foot there the yankee and it is perhaps wholesome if not agreeable to know that the irish citizen whom we do not always honor as our equal in civilization loves to speak of us scornfully as yankees rarely if ever returns the place remains to the intruder and his heirs forever we gracefully retire before him even in politics as the metropolisif it is the metropoliscan witness and we wait with an anxious curiosity the encounter of the irish and the chinese now rapidly approaching each other from opposite shores of the continent shall we be crushed in the collision of these superior races every intelligenceoffice will soon be ringing with the cries of combat and all our kitchens strewn with pigtails and bark chignons as yet we have gay hopes of our buddhistic brethren but how will it be when they begin to quarter the dragon upon the stars and stripes and buy up all the best sites for temples and burn their josssticks as it were under our very noses our grasp upon the great problem grows a little lax perhaps is it true that when we look so anxiously for help from others the virtue has gone out of ourselves i should hope not  as i leave dublin the houses grow larger and handsomer and as i draw near the avenue the mansardroofs look down upon me with their dormer windows and welcome me back to the american community there are fences about all the houses inclosing ampler and ampler dooryards the children which had swarmed in the thriftless and unenlightened purlieus of dublin diminish in number and finally disappear the chickens have vanished and i heari hear the pensive music of the horsecar bells which in some alien land i am sure would be as pathetic to me as the ranz des vaches to the swiss or the bagpipes to the highlander in the desert where the traveller seems to hear the familiar bells of his faroff church this tinkle would haunt the absolute silence and recall the exiles fancy to charlesbridge and perhaps in the mocking mirage he would behold an airy horsecar track and a phantasmagoric horsecar moving slowly along the edge of the horizon with spectral passengers closely packed inside and overflowing either platform  but before i reach the avenue dublin calls to me yet again in the figure of an old old man wearing the clothes of other times and a sort of ancestral round hat in the act of striking a match he asks me the time of day and applying the fire to his pipe he returns me his thanks in a volume of words and smoke what a wrinkled and unshorn old man can age and neglect do so much for any of us this ruinous person was associated with a handcart as decrepit as himself but not nearly so cheerful for though he spoke up briskly with a spirit uttered from far within the wrinkles and the stubble the cart had preceded him with a very lugubrious creak it groaned in fact under a load of tin cans and i was to learn from the old man that there was and had been in his person for thirteen years such a thing in the world as a peddler of buttermilk and that these cans were now filled with that pleasant drink they did not invite me to prove their contents being cans that apparently passed their vacant moments in stables and even manureheaps and that looked somehow emulous of that old mans stubble and wrinkles i bought nothing but i left the old peddler well content seated upon a thill of his cart smoking tranquilly and filling the keen spring evening air with fumes which it dispersed abroad and made to itself a pleasant incense of  i left him a whole epoch behind as i entered the avenue and lounged homeward along the stately street above the station it is far more picturesque than it is below and the magnificent elms that shadow it might well have looked in their saplinghood upon the british straggling down the country road from the concord fight and there are some ancient houses yet standing that must have been filled with exultation at the same spectacle poor old revolutionaries they would never have believed that their descendants would come to love the english as we do  the season has advanced rapidly during my progress from dublin to the avenue and by the time i reach the famous old tavern not far from the station it is a sunday morning of early summer and the yellow sunlight falls upon a body of good comrades who are grooming a marvelous number of piebald steeds about the stabledoors by token of these beastswhich always look so much more like works of art than of naturei know that there is to be a circus somewhere very soon and the gay bills pasted all over the stablefront tell me that there are to be two performances at the port on the morrow the grooms talk nothing and joke nothing but horse at their labor and their life seems such a low ignorant happy life that the secret nomad lurking in every respectable and stationary personality stirs within me and struggles to strike hands of fellowship with them they lead a sort of pastoral existence in our age of railroads they wander over the continent with their great caravan and everywhere pursue the summer from south to north and from north to south again in the mild forenoons they groom their herds and in the afternoons they doze under their wagons indifferent to the tumult of the crowd within and without the mighty canvas near themdoze face downwards on the bruised sweet smelling grass and in the starry midnight rise and strike their tents and set forth again over the still country roads to take the next village on the morrow with the blaze and splendor of their grand entree the triumphal chariot in which the musicians are borne at the head of the procession is composed as i perceive by the bills of four colossal gilt swans set tail to tail with lifted wings and curving necks but the chariot as i behold it beside the stable is mysteriously draped in white canvas through which its gilding glitters only here and there and does it move thus shrouded in the companys wanderings from place to place and is the precious spottiness of the piebalds then hidden under envious drapery o happy groomsnot clean as to shirts nor especially neat in your conversation but displaying a wealth of art in indiaink upon your manly chests and the swelling muscles of your arms and speaking in every movement your freedom from all conventional gyves and shackles seid umschlungenin spirit for the rest you are rather too damp and seem to have applied your sudsy sponges too impartially to your own trousers and the horses legs to receive an actual embrace from a dilettante vagabond  the old tavern is old only comparatively but in our new and changeful life it is already quaint it is very long and lowstudded in either story with a row of windows in the roof and a great porch furnished with benches running the whole length of the groundfloor perhaps because they take the dust of the street too freely or because the guests find it more social and comfortable to gather indoors in the wide low ceiled office the benches are not worn nor particularly whittled the room has the desolate air characteristic of offices which have once been barrooms but no doubt on a winters night there is talk worth listening to there of flocks and herds and horsetrades from the drovers and cattlemarket men who patronize the tavern and the artistic temperament at least could feel no regret if that sepulchrally penitent barroom then developed a secret capacity for the wickedness that once boldly glittered behind the counter in rows of decanters  the house was formerly renowned for its suppers of which all that was learned or gifted in the old college town of charlesbridge used to partake and i have heard lips which breathe the loftiest song and the sweetest humorlet alone being dewy with the greek of platosmacked regretfully over the memory of those suppers roast and broiled no such suppers they say are cooked in the world any more and i am somehow made to feel that their passing away is connected with the decay of good literature  i hope it may be very long before the predestined frenchroof villa occupies the taverns site and turns into lawns and gardens its wide spreading cattlepens and removes the great barn that now shows its broad low gable to the street this is yet older and quainterlooking than the tavern itself it is mighty capacious and gives a still profounder impression of vastness with its shed of which the roof slopes southward down almost to a mans height from the ground and shelters a row of mangers running back half the length of the stable and serving in former times for the baiting of such beasts as could not be provided for within but the halcyon days of the cattlemarket are past though you may still see the white horns tossing above the fences of the pens when a newly arrived herd lands from the train to be driven afoot to brighton and the place looks now so empty and forsaken spite of the circus baggagewagons that it were hard to believe these mangers could ever have been in request but for the fact that they are all gnawed down to the quick as it were by generations of horsesvanished forever on the deserted highways of the pastimpatient for their oats or hungering for more  the day must come of course when the mangers will all be taken from the stableshed and exposed for sale at that wonderful secondhand shop which stands over against the tavern i am no more surprised than one in a dream to find it a weekday afternoon by the time i have crossed thither from the circusmen grooming their piebalds it is an enchanted place to me and i am a frequent and unprofitable customer there buying only just enough to make good my footing with the custodian of its marvels who is of course too true an american to show any desire to sell without on either side of the doorway i am pretty sure to find among other articles of furniture a mahogany and haircloth sofa a family portrait a landscape painting a bathtub and a flowerstand with now and then the variety of a boat and a doghouse while under an adjoining shed is heaped a mass of miscellaneous movables of a heavier sort and fearlessly left there night and day being on all accounts undesirable to steal the door of the shop rings a bell in opening and ushers the customer into a room which chaos herself might have planned in one of her happier moments carpets blankets shawls pictures mirrors rockingchairs and blue overalls hang from the ceiling and devious pathways wind amidst piles of readymade clothing showcases filled with every sort of knickknack and half hidden under heaps of hats and boots and shoes bookcases secretaries chests of drawers mattresses lounges and bedsteads to the stairway of a loft similarly appointed and to a back room overflowing with glassware and crockery these things are not all secondhand but they are all old and equally pathetic the melancholy of ruinous auction sales of changing tastes or changing fashions clings to them whether they are things that have never had a home and have been on sale ever since they were made or things that have been associated with every phase of human life  among other objects certain large glass vases ornamented by the polite art of potichomanie have long appealed to my fancy wherein they capriciously allied themselves to the history of aging single women in lonely new england village housespathetic sisters lingering upon the neutral ground between the faded hopes of marriage and the yet unrisen prospects of consumption the work implies an imperfect yet real love of beauty the leisure for it a degree of pecuniary ease the thoughts of the sisters rise above the pickling and preserving that occupied their heartier and happier mother they are in fact in that aesthetic social and intellectual mean in which single women are thought soonest to wither and decline with a little more power and in our later era they would be writing stories full of ambitious unintelligible selfdevoted and sudden collapsing young girls and amazing doctors but as they are and in their time they must do what they can a sentimentalist may discern on these vases not only the gay designs with which they ornamented them but their own dim faces looking wan from the windows of some huge old homestead a world too wide for the shrunken family all april long the dooryard trees crouch and shudder in the sour east all june they rain cankerworms upon the roof and then in autumn choke the eaves with a fall of tattered and hectic foliage from the window the fading sisters gaze upon the unnatural liveliness of the summer streets through which the summer boarders are driving or upon the deathwhite drifts of the intolerable winter their father the captain is dead he died with the calcutta trade having survived their mother and left them a hopeless competency and yonder bamboo chairs their only brother is in california one though she loved had never a lover her sisters betrothed married west whither he went to make a home for herand ah is it vases for the desolate parlor mantel they decorate or funeral urns and when in time they being gone the californian brother sends to sell out at auction the old place with the household and kitchen furniture is it withered roseleaves or ashes that the purchaser finds in these jars  they are empty now and i wonder how came they here how came the show case of dr merrifield surgeonchiropodist here how came here yon italian paintinga poor silly little affected madonna simpering at me from her dingy gilt frame till i buy her a great bargain at a dollar from what country church or family oratory in what revolution or stress of private fortunesthen from what various cabinets of antiquities in what dear vicenza or ferrara or mantua earnest thou o madonna whose likeness are you poor girl with your everyday prettiness of brows and chin and your raphaelesque crick in the neck i think i know a part of your story you were once the property of that ruined advocate whose sensibilities would sometimes consent that a valet de place of uncommon delicacy should bring to his ancestral palace some singularly meritorious foreigner desirous of purchasing from his rare collectiona collection of rubbish scarcely to be equaled elsewhere in italy you hung in that familyroom reached after passage through stately vestibules and grand stairways and o i would be cheated to the bone if only i might look out again from some such windows as were there upon some such damp mouldy brokenstatued ruinous enchanted garden as lay below in that room sat the advocates mother and hunchback sister with their smoky scaldini and their snuffy priest and there the wife of the foreigner selfelected the taste of his party inflicted the pang courted by the advocate and asked if you were for sale and then the ruined advocate clasped his hands rubbed them set his head heartbrokenly on one side took you down heaved a sigh shrugged his shoulders and sold youyou a family heirloom well at least you are old and you represent to me acres of dim religious canvas in that beloved land and here is the dollar now asked for you i could not have bought you for so little at home  the madonna is neighbored by several paintings if the kind called grecian for a reason never revealed by the inventor of an art as old as potichomanie itself it was an art by which ordinary lithographs were given a ghastly transparency and a tone as disagreeable as chromos and i doubt if it could have been known to the greeks in their best age but i remember very well when it passed over whole neighborhoods in some parts of this country wasting the time of many young women and disfiguring parlor walls with the fruit of their accomplishment it was always taught by professors a class of learned young men who acquired their title by abandoning the plough and anvil and in a suit of readymade clothing travelling about the country with portfolios under their arms it was an experience to make loafers for life of them and i fancy the girls who learnt their art never afterwards made so good butter and cheese    nonragioniam di lor ma guarda e passa  besides the grecian paintings there are some mezzotints full length pictures of presidents and statesmen chiefly general jackson henry clay and daniel webster which have hung their day in the offices or parlors of country politicians they are all statesmanlike and presidential in attitude and i know that if the mighty websters lips had language he would take his hand out of his waistcoat front and say to his fellow mezzotints venerable men you have come down to us from a former generation bringing your household furniture and miscellaneous trumpery of all kinds with you  some oldfashioned entry lanterns divide my interest with certain old willow chairs of an hourglass pattern which never stood upright probably and have now all a confirmed droop to one side as from having been fallen heavily asleep in upon breezy porches of hot summer afternoons in the windows are small vases of alabaster flyspecked parian and plaster figures and dolls with stiff wooden limbs and papier maché heads a sort of dolls no longer to be bought in these days of modish blueeyed blondes of biscuit and sturdy indiarubber brunettes the showcase is full of an incredible variety as photograph albums fishinghooks socks suspenders steel pens cutlery of all sorts and curious old colored prints of adelaide and kate and ellen a rocking horse is stabled near amid pendent lengths of secondhand carpeting hat racks and mirrors and standing cheekbyjowl with painted washstands and bureaus are some plaster statues aptly colored and varnished to represent bronze  there is nothing here but has a marked character of its own some distinct yet intangible trait acquired from former circumstances and doubtless all these things have that lurking likeness to former owners which clothes and furniture are apt to take on from long association and which we should instantly recognize could they be confronted with their late proprietors it seems in very imaginative moments as if the strange assemblage of incongruities must have a consciousness of these latent resemblances which the individual pieces betray when their present keeper turns the key upon them and abandons them to themselves at night and i have sometimes fancied such an effect in the late twilight when i have wandered into their restingplace and have beheld them in the unnatural glare of a kerosene lamp burning before a brightly polished reflector and casting every manner of grotesque shadow upon the floor and walls but this may have been an illusion at any rate i am satisfied that the bargaindriving capacity of the storekeeper is not in the least affected by a weird quality in his wares though they have not failed to impart to him something of their own desultory character he sometimes leaves a neighbor in charge when he goes to meals and then if i enter i am watchfully followed about from corner to corner and from room to room lest i pocket a mattress or slip a bookcase under my coat the storekeeper himself never watches me perhaps he knows that it is a purely professional interest i take in the collection that i am in the trade and have a secondhand shop of my own full of poetical rubbish and every sort of literary odds and ends picked up at random and all cast higgledy piggledy into the same chaotic receptacle his customers are as little like ordinary shoppers as he is like common tradesmen they are in part the canadians who work in the brickyards and it is surprising to find how much business can be transacted and how many sharp bargains struck without the help of a common language i am in the belief which may be erroneous that nobody is wronged in these trades the taciturn storekeeper who regards his customers with a stare of solemn amusement as critturs born by some extraordinary vicissitude of nature to the use of a language that practically amounts to deafness and dumbness never suffers his philosophical interest in them to affect his commercial efficiency he drops them now and then a curt english phrase or expressive yankee idiom he knows very well when they mean to buy and when they do not and they equally wary and equally silent unswayed by the glib allurements of a salesman judge of price and quality for themselves make their solitary offer and stand or fall by it  i am seldom able to conclude a pedestrian tour without a glance at the wonderful interior of this cheap store and i know all its contents familiarly i recognize wares that have now been on sale there for years i miss at first glance such accustomed objects as have been parted with between my frequent visits and hail with pleasure the additions to that extraordinary variety i can hardly i suppose expect the reader to sympathize with the joy i felt the other night in discovering among the latter an adventurous and universally applicable signboard advertising this house and lot for sale and intertwined with the castoff suspenders which long garlanded a coffeemill pendent from the roof a newly added secondhand indiarubber eartrumpet here and there however i hope a finer soul will relish as i do the poetry of thus buying and offering for sale the very most recondite as well as the commonest articles of commerce in the faith that one day the predestined purchaser will appear and carry off the article appointed him from the beginning of time this faith is all the more touching because the collector cannot expect to live until the whole stock is disposed of and because in the order of nature much must at last fall to rein unbought unless the reporters devouring element appears and gives a sudden tragical turn to the poem  it is the whistle of a train drawing up at the neighboring station that calls me away from the secondhand store for i never find myself able to resist the hackneyed prodigy of such an arrival it cannot cease to be impressive i stand beside the track while the familiar monster writhes up to the station and disgorges its passengerssuburbanly packaged and bundled and bagged and even when emptyhanded somehow proclaiming the jaded character of men that hurry their work all day to catch the evening train out and their dreams all night to catch the morning train inand then i climb the stationstairs and hang with grooms and porters on the bridge that i may not lose my everrepeated sensation of having the train pass under my feet and of seeing it rush away westward to the pretty blue hills beyondhills not too big for a man born in a plain country to love twisting and trembling along the track it dwindles rapidly in the perspective and is presently out of sight it has left the city and the suburbs behind and has sought the woods and meadows but nature never in the least accepts it and rarely makes its path a part of her landscapes loveliness the train passes alien through all her moods and aspects the wounds made in her face by the roads sharp cuts and excavations are slowest of all wounds to heal and the iron rails remain to the last as shackles upon her yet when the rails are removed as has happened with a nonpaying track in charlesbridge the road inspires a real tenderness in her then she bids it take or the grace that belongs to all ruin the grass creeps stealthily over the scarified sides of the embankments the goldenrod and the purpletopped ironweed and the ladysslipper spring up in the hollows on either side andi am still thinking of that deserted railroad which runs through charlesbridgehide with their leafage the empty tomatocans and broken bottles and old boots on the ashheaps dumped there nature sets her velvety willows a waving near and lower than their airy tops plans a vista of trees arching above the track which is as wild and pretty and illusive a vista as the sunset ever cared to look through and gild a board fence beyond  most of our people come from boston on the horsecars and it is only the dwellers on the avenue and the neighboring streets whom hurrying homeward i follow away from the steamcar station the avenue is our handsomest street and if it were in the cosmopolitan citizen of charlesbridge to feel any local interest i should be proud of it as matters are i perceive its beauty and i often reflect with a pardonable satisfaction that it is not only handsome but probably the very dullest street in the world it is magnificently long and broad and is flanked nearly the whole way from the station to the colleges by pine palaces rising from spacious lawns or from the green of trees or the brightness of gardens the splendor is all very new but newness is not a fault that much affects architectural beauty while it is the only one that time is certain to repair and i find an honest and unceasing pleasure in the graceful lines of those palaces which is not surpassed even by my appreciation of the vast quiet and monotony of the street itself commonly when i emerge upon it from the grassybordered succoryblossomed walks of benicia street i behold looking northward a monumental horsecar standingit appears for ages if i wish to take it for bostonat the head of pliny street and looking southward i see that other emblem of suburban life an express wagon fading rapidly in the distance haply the top of a buggy nods round the bend under the elms near the station and if fortune is so lavish a lady appears from a side street and while tarrying for the car thrusts the point of her sunumbrella into the sandy sidewalk this is the mid afternoon effect of the avenue but later in the day and well into the dusk it remembers its former gayety as a trottingcoursewith here and there a spiderwagon a twinklingfooted mare and a guttural driver on marketdays its superb breadth is taken up by flocks of bleating sheep and a pastoral tone is thus given to its tranquillity anon a herd of beefcattle appears under the elms or a drove of pigs many pausing inquisitive of the gutters and quarrelsome as if they were the heirs of prosperity instead of doom is slowly urged on toward the shambles in the spring or the autumn the avenue is exceptionally enlivened by the progress of a brace or so of students who in training for one of the university courses of baseball or boating trot slowly and earnestly along the sidewalk fists up elbows down mouths shut and a sense of immense responsibility visible in their faces  the summer is waning with the day as i turn from the avenue into benicia street this is the hour when the fly cedes to the mosquito as the tuscan poet says and as one may add the frying grasshopper yields to the shrilly cricket in noisiness the embrowning air rings with the sad music made by these innumerable little violinists hid in all the gardens round and the pedestrian feels a sinking of the spirits not to be accounted for upon the theory that the street is duller than the avenue for it really is not so  quick now the cheerful lamps of kerosenewithout their light the cry of those crickets dominated for an instant but not stilled by the bellowing of a nearpassing locomotive and the baying of a distant dog were too much if it were the last autumn that ever was to be it could not be heralded with notes of dismaller effect this is in fact the hour of supreme trial everywhere and doubtless no one but a newlyaccepted lover can be happy at twilight in the city even it is oppressive in the country it is desolate in the suburbs it is a miracle that it is ever lived through the nightwinds have not risen yet to stir the languid foliage of the sidewalk maples the lamps are not yet lighted to take away the gloom from the blank staring windows of the houses near it is too late for letters too early for a book in town your fancy would turn to the theatres in the country you would occupy yourself with cares of poultry or of stock in the suburbs you can but sit upon your threshold and fight the predatory mosquito     by horsecar to boston   at a former period the writer of this had the fortune to serve his country in an italian city whose great claim upon the worlds sentimental interest is the fact that    the sea is in her broad her narrow streets    ebbing and flowing  and that she has no ways whatever for hoofs or wheels in his quality of united states official he was naturally called upon for information concerning the estates of italians believed to have emigrated early in the century to buenos ayres and was commissioned to learn why certain persons in mexico and brazil and the parts of peru had not if they were still living written home to their friends on the other hand he was intrusted with business nearly as pertinent and hopeful by some of his own countrymen and it was not quite with surprise that he one day received a neatly lithographed circular with his name and address written in it signed by a famous projector of such enterprises asking him to cooperate for the introduction of horserailroads in venice the obstacles to the scheme were of such a nature that it seemed hardly worth while even to reply to the circular but the proposal was one of those bold flights of imagination which forever lift objects out of vulgar association it has cast an enduring poetic charm even about the horsecar in my mind and i naturally look for many unprosaic aspects of humanity there i have an acquaintance who insists that it is the place above all others suited to see life in every striking phase he pretends to have witnessed there the reunion of friends who had not met in many years the embrace figurative of course of long lost brothers the reconciliation of lovers i do not know but also some scenes of lovemaking and acceptance or rejection but my friend is an imaginative man and may make himself romances i myself profess to have beheld for the most part only mysteries and i think it not the least of these that riding on the same cars day after day one finds so many strange faces with so little variety whether or not that dull jarring motion shakes inward and settles about the centres of mental life the sprightliness that should inform the visage i do not know but it is certain that the emptiness of the average passengers countenance is something wonderful considered with reference to natures abhorrence of a vacuum and the intellectual repute which boston enjoys among envious new yorkers it is seldom that a journey out of our cold metropolis is enlivened by a mystery so positive in character as the young lady in black who alighted at a most ordinary little street in old charlesbridge and heightened her effect by going into a frenchroof house there that had no more right than a dry goods box to receive a mystery she was tall and her lovely arms showed through the black gauze of her dress with an exquisite roundness and morbidezza upon her beautiful wrists she had heavy bracelets of dead gold fashioned after some etruscan device and from her dainty ears hung great hoops of the same metal and design which had the singular privilege of touching now and then her white columnar neck a massive chain or necklace also etruscan and also gold rose and fell at her throat and on one little ungloved hand glittered a multitude of rings this hand was very expressive and took a principal part in the talk which the lady held with her companion and was as alert and quick as if trained in the gesticulation of southern or latin life somewhere her features on the contrary were rather insipid being too small and fine but they were redeemed by the liquid splendor of her beautiful eyes and the mortal pallor of her complexion she was altogether so startling an apparition that all of us jaded commonplace spectres turned and fastened our weary lacklustre eyes upon her looks with an utter inability to remove them there was one fat unctuous person seated opposite to whom his interest was a torture for he would have gone to sleep except for her remarkable presence as it was his heavy eyelids fell halfway shut and drooped there at an agonizing angle while his eyes remained immovably fixed upon that strange deathwhite face how it could have come of that colorlessnesswhether through long sickness or long residence in a tropical climatewas a question that perplexed another of the passengers who would have expected to hear the lady speak any language in the world rather than english and to whom her companion or attendant was hardly less than herself a mysterybeing a dragonlike elderish female clearly a yankee by birth but apparently of many years absence from home the propriety of extracting these people from the horsecars and transferring them bodily to the first chapter of a romance was a thing about which there could be no manner of doubt and nothing prevented the abduction but the unexpected voluntary exit of the pale lady as she passed out everybody else awoke as from a dream or as if freed from a potent fascination it is part of the mystery that this lady should never have reappeared in that theatre of life the horsecar but i cannot regret having never seen her more she was so inestimably precious to wonder that it would have been a kind of loss to learn anything about her  illustration the young lady in black who alighted at a most ordinary little street  on the other hand i should be glad if two young men who once presented themselves as mysteries upon the same stage could be so distinctly and sharply identified that all mankind should recognize them at the day of judgment they were not so remarkable in the nature as in the degree of their offense for the mystery that any man should keep his seat in a horsecar and let a woman stand is but too sadly common they say that this public unkindness to the sex has come about through the ingratitude of women who have failed to return thanks for places offered them and that it is a just and noble revenge we take upon them there might be something advanced in favor of the idea that we lawmaking men who do not oblige the companies to provide seats for every one deserve no thanks from voteless helpless women when we offer them places nay that we ought to be glad if they do not reproach us for making that a personal favor which ought to be a common right i would prefer on the whole to believe that this selfishness is not a concerted act on our part but a flower of advanced civilization it is a ripe fruit in european countries and it is more noticeable in boston than anywhere else in america it is in fact one of the points of our high polish which people from the interior say first strikes them on coming among us for they declareno doubt too modestlythat in their boeotian wilds our athenian habit is almost unknown yet it would not be fair to credit our whole population with it i have seen a laborer or artisan rise from his place and offer it to a lady while a dozen welldressed men kept theirs and i know several conservative young gentlemen who are still so oldfashioned as always to respect the weakness and weariness of women one of them i hear has settled it in his own mind that if the family cook appears in a car where he is seated he must rise and give her his place this perhaps is a trifle idealistic but it is magnificent it is princely from his difficult height we declinethrough ranks that sacrifice themselves for women with bundles or children in arms for old ladies or for very young and pretty onesto the men who give no odds to the most helpless creature alive these are the men who do not act upon the promptings of human nature like the laborer and who do not refine upon their duty like my young gentlemen and make it their privilege to befriend the idea of womanhood they are men who have paid for their seats and are going to keep them they have been at work very probably all day and no doubt they are tired they look so and try hard not to look ashamed of publicly considering themselves before a sex which is born tired and from which our climate and customs have drained so much health that society sometimes seems little better than a hospital for invalid woman where every courtesy is likely to be a mercy done to a sufferer yet the two young men of whom i began to speak were not apparently of this class and let us hope they were foreignerssay englishmen since we hate englishmen the most they were the only men seated in a car full of people and when four or five ladies came in and occupied the aisle before them they might have been puzzled which to offer their places to if one of the ladies had not plainly been infirm they settled the questionif there was any in their mindsby remaining seated while the lady in front of them swung uneasily to and fro with the car and appeared ready to sink at their feet in another moment she had actually done so and too weary to rise she continued to crouch upon the floor of the car for the course of a mile the young men resolutely keeping their places and not rising till they were ready to leave the car it was a horrible scene and incrediblethat welldressed woman sitting on the floor and those two welldressed men keeping their places it was as much out of keeping with our smug respectabilities as a hanging and was a spectacle so paralyzing that public opinion took no action concerning it a shabby person standing upon the platform outside swore about it between expectorations even the conductors heart was touched and he said he had seen a good many hard things aboard horsecars but that was a little the hardest he had never expected to come to that these were simple people enough and could not interest me a great deal but i should have liked to have a glimpse of the complex minds of those young men and i should still like to know something of the previous life that could have made their behavior possible to them they ought to make public the philosophic methods by which they reached that pass of unshamable selfishness the information would be useful to a race which knows the sweetness of self indulgence and would fain know the art of so drugging or besotting the sensibilities that it shall no feel disgraced by any sort of meanness they might really have much to say for themselves as that the lady being conscious she could no longer keep her feet had no right to crouch at theirs and put them to so severe a test or that having suffered her to sink there they fell no further in the ignorant public opinion by suffering her to continue there  but i doubt if that other young man could say anything for himself who when a pale trembling woman was about to drop into the vacant place at his side stretched his arm across it with this seats engaged till a robust young fellow his friend appeared and took it and kept it all the way out from boston the commission of such a tragical wrong involving a violation of common usage as well as the infliction of a positive cruelty would embitter the life of an ordinary man if any ordinary man were capable of it but let us trust that nature has provided fortitude of every kind for the offender and that he is not wrung by keener remorse than most would feel for a petty larceny i dare say he would be eager at the first opportunity to rebuke the ingratitude of women who do not thank their benefactors for giving them seats it seems a little odd by the way and perhaps it is through the peculiar blessing of providence that since men have determined by a savage egotism to teach the offending sex manners their own comfort should be in the infliction of the penalty and that it should be as much a pleasure as a duty to keep ones place  perhaps when the ladies come to vote they will abate with other nuisances the whole business of overloaded public conveyances in the mean time the kindness of women to each other is a notable feature of all horsecar journeys it is touching to see the smiling eagerness with which the poor things gather close their volumed skirts and make room for a weary sister the tender looks of compassion which they bend upon the sufferers obliged to stand the sweetness with which they rise if they are young and strong to offer their place to any infirm or heavily burdened person of their sex  but a journey to boston is not entirely an experience of bitterness on the contrary there are many things besides the mutual amiability of these beautiful martyrs which relieve its tedium and horrors a whole carfull of people brought into the closest contact with one another yet in the absence of introductions never exchanging a word each being so sufficient to himself as to need no social stimulus whatever is certainly an impressive and stately spectacle it is a beautiful day say but far be it from me to intimate as much to my neighbor who plainly would rather die than thus commit himself with me and who in fact would wellnigh strike me speechless with surprise if he did so if there is any necessity for communication as with the conductor we essay first to express ourselves by gesture and then utter our desires with a certain hollow and remote effect which is not otherwise to be described i have sometimes tried to speak above my breath when being about to leave the car i have made a virtue of offering my place to the prettiest young woman standing but i have found it impossible the genius loci whatever it was suppressed me and i have gasped out my sham politeness as in a courteous nightmare the silencing influence is quite successfully resisted by none but the tipsy people who occasionally ride out with us and call up a smile sad as a gleam of winter sunshine to our faces by their artless prattle i remember one eventful afternoon that we were all but moved to laughter by the gayeties of such a one who even after he had ceased to talk continued to amuse us by falling asleep and reposing himself against the shoulder of the lady next him perhaps it is in acknowledgment of the agreeable variety they contribute to horsecar life that the conductor treats his inebriate passengers with such unfailing tenderness and forbearance i have never seen them molested though i have noticed them in the indulgence of many eccentricities and happened once even to see one of them sit down in a ladys lap but that was on the night of saint patricks day generally all avoidable indecorums are rare in the horsecars though during the late forenoon and early afternoon in the period of lighter travel i have found curious figures thereamong others two old women in the oldclothes business one of whom was dressed not very fortunately in a gown with short sleeves and inferentially a low neck a mender of umbrellas with many unwholesome whitybrown wrecks of umbrellas about him a peddler of soap who offered cakes of it to his fellowpassengers at a discount apparently for friendships sake and a certain gentleman with a pockmarked face and a beard dyed an unscrupulous purple who sang himself a hymn all the way to boston and who gave me no sufficient reason for thinking him a sea captain not far from the end of the long bridge there is apt to be a number of colored ladies waiting to get into the car or to get out of itusually one solemn mother in ethiopia and two or three mirthful daughters who find it hard to suppress a sense of adventure and to keep in the laughter that struggles out through their glittering teeth and eyes and who place each other at a disadvantage by divers accidental and intentional bumps and blows if they are to get out the old lady is not certain of the place where and after making the car stop and parleying with the conductor returns to her seat and is mutely held up to public scorn by one taciturn wink of the conductors eye  among horsecar types i am almost ashamed to note one so common and observable as that middleaged lady who gets aboard and will not see the one vacant seat left but stands tottering at the door blind and deaf to all the modest beckonings and benevolent gasps of her fellowpassengers an air as of better days clings about her she seems a person who has known sickness and sorrow but so far from pitying her you view her with inexpressible rancor for it is plain that she ought to sit down and that she will not but for a point of honor the conductor would show her the vacant place this forbidding however how can he there she stands and sniffs drearily when you glance at her as you must from time to time and no wild turkey caught in a trap was ever more incapable of looking down than this middleaged shall i say also unmarried lady  of course every one knows the ladies and gentlemen who sit cater cornered and who will not move up and equally familiar is that large and ponderous person who feigning to sit down beside you practically sits down upon you and is not incommoded by having your knee under him he implies by this brutal conduct that you are taking up more space than belongs to you and that you are justly made an example of  i had the pleasure one day to meet on the horsecar an advocate of one of the great reforms of the day he held a green bag upon his knees and without any notice passed from a question of crops to a discussion of suffrage for the negro and so to womanhood suffrage let the women vote said helet em vote if they want to i dont care fact is i should like to see em do it the first time theyre excitable you know theyre excitable and he enforced his analysis of female character by thrusting his elbow sharply into my side now theres my wife id like to see her vote be fun i tell you and the girlslord the girls circus wouldnt be anywhere enchanted with the picture which he appeared to have conjured up for himself he laughed with the utmost relish and then patting the green bag in his lap which plainly contained a violin you see he went on i go out playing for dancingparties work all day at my tradeim a carpenterand play in the evening take my little old ten dollars a night and i notice the women a good deal and i tell you theyre all excitable and i shd like to see em vote vote right and vote oftenthats the ticket eh this friend of womanhood suffragewhose attitude of curiosity and expectation seemed to me representative of that of a great many thinkers on the subjectno doubt was otherwise a reformer and held that the coming man would not drink wineif he could find whiskey at least i should have said so guessing from the odors he breathed along with his liberal sentiments  something of the character of a collegetown is observable nearly always in the presence of the students who confound certain traditional ideas of students by their quietude of costume and manner and whom padua or heidelberg would hardly know but who nevertheless betray that they are banded to    scorn delights and live laborious days  by a uniformity in the cut of their trousers or a clannishness of cane or scarf or a talk of boats and baseball held among themselves one cannot see them without pleasure and kindness and it is no wonder that their younglady acquaintances brighten so to recognize them on the horsecars there is much good fortune in the world but none better than being an undergraduate twenty years old hale handsome fashionably dressed with the whole promise of life before its a state of things to disarm even envy with so much youth forever in her heart it must be hard for our charlesbridge to grow old the generations arise and pass away but in her veins is still this tide of warm blood century in and century out so much the same from one age to another that it would be hardy to say it was not still one youthfulness there is a print of the village as it was a cycle since showing the oldest of the college buildings and upon the street in front a scholar in his scholarscap and gown giving his arm to a very stylish girl of that period who is dressed wonderfully like the girl of ours so that but for the students antique formality of costume one might believe that he was handing her out to take the horsecar there is no horsecar in the picturethat is the only real difference between then and now in our charlesbridge perennially young and gay have there not ever been here the same grand ambitions the same high hopesand is not the unbroken succession of youth in these  as for other life on the horsecar it shows to little or no effect as i have said you can of course detect certain classes as in the morning the businessmen going in to their counters or their desks and in the afternoon the shoppers coming out laden with paper parcels but i think no one can truly claim to know the regular from the occasional passengers by any greater cheerfulness in the faces of the latter the horsecar will suffer no such inequality as this but reduces us all to the same level of melancholy it would be but a very unworthy kind of art which should seek to describe people by such merely external traits as a habit of carrying baskets or large travellingbags in the car and the present muse scorns it but is not above speaking of the frequent presence of those lovely young girls in which boston and the suburban towns abound and who whether they appear with rolls of music in their hands or books from the circulatinglibraries or pretty parcels or handbags would brighten even the horsecar if fresh young looks and gay and brilliant costumes could do so much but they only add perplexity to the anomaly which was already sufficiently trying with its contrasts of splendor and shabbiness and such intimate association of velvets and patches as you see in the churches of catholic countries but nowhere else in the world except in our coaches of the sovereign people  in winter the journey to or from boston cannot appear otherwise than very dreary to the fondest imagination coming out nothing can look more arctic and forlorn than the river doubleshrouded in ice and snow or sadder than the contrast offered to the same prospect in summer then all is laughing and it is a joy in every nerve to ride out over the long bridge at high tide and looking southward to see the wide crinkle and glitter of that beautiful expanse of water which laps on one hand the granite quays of the city and on the other washes among the reeds and wild grasses of the saltmeadows a ship coming slowly up the channel or a dingy tug violently darting athwart it gives an additional pleasure to the eye and adds something dreamy or vivid to the beauty of the scene it is hard to say at what hour of the summersday the prospect is loveliest and i am certainly not going to speak of the sunset as the least of its delights when this exquisite spectacle is presented the horsecar passenger happy to cling with one foot to the rear platformsteps looks out over the shoulder next him into fairyland crimson and purple the bay stretches westward till its waves darken into the grassy levels where here and there a hayrick shows perfectly black against the light afar off southeastward and westward the uplands wear a tinge of tenderest blue and in the nearer distance on the low shores of the river hover the white plumes of arriving and departing trains the windows of the stately houses that overlook the water take the sunset from it evanescently and begin to chill and darken before the crimson burns out of the sky the windows are in fact best after nightfall when they are brilliantly lighted from within and when if it is a dark warm night and the briny fragrance comes up strong from the falling tide the lights reflected far down in the still water bring a dream as i have heard travelled bostonians say of venice and her magical effects in the same kind but for me the beauty of the scene needs the help of no such association i am content with it for what it is i enjoy also the hints of spring which one gets in riding over the long bridge at low tide in the first open days then there is not only a vernal beating of carpets on the piers of the drawbridge but the piles and walls left bare by the receding water show green patches of seaweeds and mosses and flatter the willing eye with a dim hint of summer this reeking and saturated herbagewhich always seems to me in contrast with dry land growths what the water logged life of seafaring folk is to that which we happier men lead on shoretaking so kindly the deceitful warmth and brightness of the sun has then a charm which it loses when summer really comes nor does one later have so keen an interest in the men wading about in the shallows below the bridge who as in the distance they stoop over to gather whatever shellfish they seek make a very fair show of being some ungainlier sort of storks and are as near as we can hope to come to the springprophesying storks of song and story a sentiment of the drowsiness that goes before the awakening of the year and is so different from the drowsiness that precedes the great autumnal slumber is in the air but is gone when we leave the river behind and strike into the straggling village beyond  i maintain that boston as one approaches it and passingly takes in the line of bunker hill monument soaring preëminent among the emulous foundrychimneys of the sister city is fine enough to need no comparison with other fine sights thanks to the mansard curves and dormerwindows of the newer houses there is a singularly picturesque variety among the roofs that stretch along the bay and rise one above another on the citys three hills grouping themselves about the state house and surmounted by its indiarubber dome but after all does human weakness crave some legendary charm some grace of uncertain antiquity in the picturesqueness it sees i own that the future to which we are often referred for the stuff that dreams are made of is more difficult for the fancy than the past that the airy amplitude of its possibilities is somewhat chilly and that we naturally long for the snug quarters of old made warm by many generations of life besides europe spoils us ingenuous americans and flatters our sentimentality into ruinous extravagances looking at her manystoried former times we forget our own past neat compact and convenient for the poorest memory to dwell in yet an american not infected with the discontent of travel could hardly approach this superb city without feeling something of the coveted pleasure in her without a reverie of her puritan and revolutionary times and the great names and deeds of her heroic annals i think however we were well to be rid of this yearning for a native american antiquity for in its indulgence one cannot but regard himself and his contemporaries as cumberers of the ground delaying the consummation of that hoary past which will be so fascinating to a semichinese posterity and will be ages hence the inspiration of pigeonenglish poetry and romance let us make much of our two hundred and fifty years and cherish the present as our golden age we healthyminded people in the horsecars are loath to lose a moment of it and are aggrieved that the draw of the bridge should be up naturally looking on what is constantly liable to happen as an especial malice of the fates all the drivers of the vehicles that clog the draw on either side have a like sense of personal injury and apparently it would go hard with the captain of that leisurely vessel below if he were delivered into our hands but this impatience and anger are entirely illusive  we are really the most patient people in the world especially as regards any incorporated nonpolitical oppressions a lively gaul who travelled among us some thirty years ago found that in the absence of political control we gratified the human instinct of obedience by submitting to small tyrannies unknown abroad and were subject to the steamboatcaptain the hotelclerk the stagedriver and the waiter who all bullied us fearlessly but though some vestiges of this bondage remain it is probably passing away the abusive frenchmans assertion would not at least hold good concerning the horsecar conductors who in spite of a lingering preference for touching or punching passengers for their fare instead of asking for it are commonly mildmannered and goodtempered and disposed to molest us as little as possible i have even received from one of them a mark of such kindly familiarity as the offer of a check which he held between his lips and thrust out his face to give me both his hands being otherwise occupied and their lives are in nowise such luxurious careers as we should expect in public despots the oppression of the horsecar passenger is not from them and the passenger himself is finally to blame for it when the draw closes at last and we rumble forward into the city street a certain stir of expectation is felt among us the long and eventful journey is nearly ended and now we who are to get out of the cars can philosophically amuse ourselves with the passions and sufferings of those who are to return in our places you must choose the time between five and six oclock in the afternoon if you would make this grand study of the national character in its perfection then the spectacle offered in any arriving horsecar will serve your purpose at nearly every corner of the street up which it climbs stands an experienced suburban who darts out upon the car and seizes a vacant place in it presently all the places are taken and before we reach temple street where helpless groups of women are gathered to avail themselves of the first seats vacated an alert citizen is stationed before each passenger who is to retire at the summons please pass out forrad when this is heard in bowdoin square we rise and push forward knuckling one anothers backs in our eagerness and perhaps glancing behind us at the tumult within not only are all our places occupied but the aisle is left full of passengers precariously supporting themselves by the straps in the roof the rear platform is stormed and carried by a party with bundles the driver is instantly surrounded by another detachment and as the car moves away from the office the platform steps are filled  is it possible i asked myself when i had written as far as this in the present noble history that i am not exaggerating it cant be that this and the other enormities i have been describing are of daily occurrence in boston let me go verify at least my picture of the evening horsecar so i take my way to bowdoin square and in the conscientious spirit of modern inquiry i get aboard the first car that comes up like every other car it is meant to seat twenty passengers it does this and besides it carries in the aisle and on the platform forty passengers standing the air is what you may imagine if you know that not only is the place so indecently crowded but that in the centre of the car are two adopted citizens far gone in drink who have the aspect and the smell of having passed the day in an ashheap these citizens being quite helpless themselves are supported by the public and repose in singular comfort upon all the passengers near them i myself contribute an aching back to the common charity and a genteelly dressed young lady takes one of them from time to time on her knee but they are comparatively an ornament to society till the conductor objects to the amount they offer him for fare for after that they wish to fight him during the journey and invite him at short intervals to step out and be shown what manner of men they are the conductor passes it off for a joke and so it is and a very good one  in that unhappy mass it would be an audacious spirit who should say of any particular arm or leg it is mine and all the breath is in common nothing it would seem could add to our misery but we discover our error when the conductor squeezes a tortuous path through us and collects the money for our transportation i never can tell during the performance of this feat whether he or the passengers are more to be pitied  the people who are thus indecorously huddled and jammed together without regard to age or sex otherwise lead lives of at least comfort and a good half of them cherish themselves in every physical way with unparalleled zeal they are handsomely clothed they are delicately neat in linen they eat well or if not well as well as their cooks will let them and at all events expensively they house in dwellings appointed in a manner undreamt of elsewhere in the worlddwellings wherein furnaces make a summerheat where fountains of hot and cold water flow at a touch where light is created or quenched by the turning of a key where all is luxurious upholstery and magical ministry to real or fancied needs they carry the same tastes with them to their places of business and when they attend divine service it is with the understanding that god is to receive them in a richly carpeted house deliciously warmed and perfectly ventilated where they may adore him at their ease upon cushioned seats secured seats yet these spoiled children of comfort when they ride to or from business or church fail to assert rights that the benighted cockney who never heard of our plumbing and registers or even the oppressed parisian who is believed not to change his linen from one revolution to another having paid for enjoys when they enter the full horsecar they find themselves in a place inexorable as the grave to their greenbacks where not only is their adventitious consequence stripped from them but the courtesies of life are impossible the inherent dignity of the person is denied and they are reduced below the level of the most uncomfortable nations of the old world the philosopher accustomed to draw consolation from the sufferings of his richer fellowmen and to infer an overruling providence from their disgraces might well bless heaven for the spectacle of such degradation if his thanksgiving were not prevented by his knowledge that this is quite voluntary and now consider that on every car leaving the city at this time the scene is much the same reflect that the horror is enacting not only in boston but in new york philadelphia baltimore st louis chicago cincinnatiwherever the horsecar that tinkles wellnigh round the continent is known remember that the same victims are thus daily sacrificed without an effort to right themselves and then you will begin to realizedimly and imperfectly of coursethe unfathomable meekness of the american character the full horsecar is a prodigy whose likeness is absolutely unknown elsewhere since the neapolitan gig went out and i suppose it will be incredible to the future in our own country when i see such a horsecar as i have sketched move away from its station i feel that it is something not only emblematic and interpretative but monumental and i know that when art becomes truly national the overloaded horsecar will be celebrated in painting and sculpture and in after ages when the obliqueeyed swarthy american of that time pausing before some commemorative bronze or historical picture of our epoch contemplates this stupendous spectacle of human endurance i hope he will be able to philosophize more satisfactorily than we can now concerning the mystery of our strength as a nation and our weakness as a public     a days pleasure   ithe morning   they were not a large family and their pursuits and habits were very simple yet the summer was lapsing toward the first pathos of autumn before they found themselves all in such case as to be able to take the days pleasure they had planned so long they had agreed often and often that nothing could be more charming than an excursion down the harbor either to gloucester or to nahant or to nantasket beach or to hull and hingham or to any point within the fatal bound beyond which is seasickness they had studied the steamboat advertisements day after day for a long time without making up their minds which of these charming excursions would be the most delightful and when they had at last fixed upon one and chosen some day for it that day was sure to be heralded by a long train of obstacles or it dawned upon weather that was simply impossible besides in the suburbs you are apt to sleep late unless the solitary icewagon of the neighborhood makes a very uncommon rumbling in going by and i believe that the excursion was several times postponed by the tardy return of the pleasurers from dreamland which after all is not the worst resort or the least interestingor profitable for the matter of that but at last the great day camea blameless thursday alike removed from the cares of washing and ironing days and from the fatigues with which every week closes one of the family chose deliberately to stay at home but the severest scrutiny could not detect a hindrance in the health or circumstances of any of the rest and the weather was delicious everything in fact was so fair and so full of promise that they could almost fancy a calamity of some sort hanging over its perfection and possibly bred of it for i suppose that we never have anything made perfectly easy for us without a certain reluctance and foreboding that morning they all got up so early that they had time to waste over breakfast before taking the 730 train for boston and they naturally wasted so much of it that they reached the station only in season for the 800 but there is a difference between reaching the station and quietly taking the cars especially if one of your company has been left at home hoping to cut across and take the cars at a station which they reach some minutes later and you the head of the party are obliged at a loss of breath and personal comfort and dignity to run down to that station and see that the belated member has arrived there and then hurry back to your own and embody the rest with their accompanying handbags and wraps and sunumbrellas into some compact shape for removal into the cars during the very scant minute that the train stops at charlesbridge then when you are all aboard and the tardy member has been duly taken up at the next station and you would be glad to spend the time in looking about on the familiar variety of life which every car presents in every train on every road in this vast american world you are oppressed and distracted by the cares which must attend the pleasure seeker and which the more thickly beset him the more deeply he plunges into enjoyment  i can learn very little from the notebook of the friend whose adventures i am relating in regard to the scenery of somerville and the region generally through which the railroad passes between charlesbridge and boston but so much knowledge of it may be safely assumed on the part of the reader as to relieve me of the grave responsibility of describing it still i may say that it is not unpicturesque and that i have a pleasure which i hope the reader shares in anything like salt meadows and all spaces subject to the tide whether flooded by it or left bare with their saturated grasses by its going down i think also there is something fine in the manyroofed manychimneyed highlands of chelsea if it is chelsea as you draw near the railroad bridge and there is a pretty stone church on a hillside there which has the good fortune so rare with modern architecture and so common with the old of seeming a natural outgrowth of the spot where it stands and which is as purely an object of aesthetic interest to me who know nothing of its sect or doctrine as any church in a picture could be and there is also the marine hospital on the heights if it is the marine hospital from which i hope the inmates can behold the ocean and exult in whatever misery keeps them ashore  but let me not so hasten over this part of my friends journey as to omit all mention of the amphibious irish houses which stand about on the low lands along the railroadsides and which you half expect to see plunge into the tidal mud of the neighborhood with a series of hoarse croaks as the train approaches perhaps twentyfour trains pass those houses every twentyfour hours and it is a wonder that the inhabitants keep their interest in them or have leisure to bestow upon any of them yet as you dash along so bravely you can see that you arrest the occupations of all these villagers as by a kind of enchantment the children pause and turn their heads toward you from their mudpies to the production of which there is literally no limit in that region the matron rests one parboiled hand on her hip letting the other still linger listlessly upon the washboard while she lifts her eyes from the suds to look at you the boys who all summer long are forever just going into the water or just coming out of it cease their buttoning or unbuttoning the baby which has been run after and caught and suitably posed turns its anguished eyes upon you where also falls the mothers gaze while her descending palm is arrested in mid air i forbear to comment upon the surprising populousness of these villages where in obedience to all the laws of health the inhabitants ought to be wasting miserably away but where they flourish in spite of them even accident here seems to be robbed of half her malevolence and that baby who will presently be chastised with terrific uproar passes an infancy of intrepid enjoyment amidst the local perils and is no more affected by the engines and the cars than by so many fretful hens with their attendant broods of chickens  illustration that sweet young blonde who arrives by most trains  when sometimes i long for the excitement and variety of travel which for no merit of mine i knew in other days i reproach myself and silence all my repinings with some such question as where could you find more variety or greater excitement than abounds in and near the fitchburg depot when a train arrives and to tell the truth there is something very inspiring in the fine eagerness with which all the passengers rise as soon as the locomotive begins to slow and huddle forward to the door in their impatience to get out while the suppressed vehemence of the hackmen is also thrilling in its way not to mention the instant clamor of the baggagemen as they read and repeat the numbers of the checks in strident tones it would be ever so interesting to depict all these people but it would require volumes for the work and i reluctantly let them all pass out without a wordall but that sweet young blonde who arrives by most trains and who putting up her eyeglass with a ravishing air bewitchingly peers round among the bearded faces with little tender looks of hope and trepidation for the face which she wants and which presently bursts through the circle of strange visages the owner of the face then hurries forward to meet that sweet blonde who gives him a little drooping hand as if it were a delicate flower she laid in his there is a brief mutual hesitation long enough merely for an electrical thrill to run from heart to heart through the clasping hands and then he stoops toward her and distractingly kisses her and i say that there is no law of conscience or propriety worthy the name of lawbarbarity absurdity call it rather to prevent any one from availing himself of that providential near sightedness and beatifying himself upon those lipsnothing to prevent it but that young fellow whom one might not of course care to provoke  among the people who now rush forward and heap themselves into the two horsecars and one omnibus placed before the depot by a wise forethought for the public comfort to accommodate the trainload of two hundred passengers i always note a type that is both pleasing and interesting to me it is a lady just passing middle life from her kindly eyes the envious crow whose footprints are just traceable at their corners has not yet drunk the brightness but she looks just a thought sadly if very serenely from them i know nothing in the world of her i may have seen her twice or a hundred times but i must always be making bits of romances about her that is she in faultless gray with the neat leather bag in her lap and a bouquet of the first autumnal blooms perched in her shapely hands which are prettily yet substantially gloved in some sort of gauntlets she can be easy and dignified my dear middleaged heroine even in one of our horsecars where people are for the most part packed like cattle in a pen she shows no trace of dust or fatigue from the thirty or forty miles which i choose to fancy she has ridden from the handsome elmshaded new england town of five or ten thousand people where i choose to think she lives from a vague horticultural association with those gauntlets as well as from the autumnal blooms i take it she loves flowers and gardens a good deal with her own hands and keeps house plants in the winter and of course a canary her dress neither rich nor vulgar makes me believe her fortunes modest and not recent her gentle face has just so much intellectual character as it is good to see in a womans face i suspect that she reads pretty regularly the new poems and histories and i know that she is the life and soul of the local book club is she married or widowed or one of the superfluous forty thousand that is what i never can tell but i think that most probably she is married and that her husband is very much in business and does not share so much as he respects her tastes i have no particular reason for thinking that she has no children now and that the sorrow for the one she lost so long ago has become only a pensive silence which however a long summer twilight can yet deepen to tears upon my word am i then one to give way to this sort of thing madam i ask pardon i have no right to be sentimentalizing you yet your face is one to make people dream kind things of you and i cannot keep my reveries away from it  but in the mean time i neglect the momentous history which i have proposed to write and leave my days pleasurers to fade into the background of a fantastic portrait the truth is i cannot look without pain upon the discomforts which they suffer at this stage of their joyous enterprise at the best the portables of such a party are apt to be grievous embarrassments a package of shawls and parasols and umbrellas and india rubbers however neatly made up at first quickly degenerates into a shapeless mass which has finally to be carried with as great tenderness as an ailing child and the lunch is pretty sure to overflow the handbags and to eddy about you in paper parcels while the bottle of claret that bulges the side of one of the bags and    that will show itself without  defying your attempts to look as it were cold tea gives a crushing touch of disreputability to the whole affair add to this the fact that but half the party have seats and that the others have to sway and totter about the car in that sudden contact with all varieties of fellowmen to which we are accustomed in the cars and you must allow that these poor merrymakers have reasons enough to rejoice when this part of their days pleasure is over they are so plainly bent upon a sail down the harbor that before they leave the car they become objects of public interest and are at last made to give some account of themselves  going for a sail i presume says a person hitherto in conversation with the conductor well i wouldnt mind a sail myself today  yes answers the head of the party going to gloucester  guess not says very coldly and decidedly one of the passengers who is reading that mornings advertiser and when the subject of this surmise looks at him for explanations he adds the city council has chartered the boat for today  upon this the excursionists fall into great dismay and bitterness and upbraid the city council and wonder why last nights transcript said nothing about its oppressive action and generally bewail their fate but at last they resolve to go somewhere and being set down they make up their warring minds upon nahant for the nahant boat leaves the wharf nearest them and so they hurry away to india wharf amidst barrels and bales and boxes and hacks and trucks with interminable stringteams passing before them at every crossing  at any rate says the leader of the expedition we shall see the gardens of maolisthose enchanted gardens which have fairly been advertised into my dreams and where ive been told he continues with an effort to make the prospect an attractive one yet not without a sense of the meagreness of the materials they have a grotto and a wooden bull  of course there is no reason in nature why a wooden bull should be more pleasing than a fleshandblood bull but it seems to encourage the company and they set off again with renewed speed and at last reach india wharf in time to see the nahant steamer packed full of excursionists with a crowd of people still waiting to go aboard it does not look inviting and they hesitate in a minute or two their spirits sink so low that if they should see the wooden bull step out of a grotto on the deck of the steamer the spectacle could not revive them at that instant they think with a surprising singleness of nantasket beach and the bright colors in which the gardens of maolis but now appeared fade away and they seem to see themselves sauntering along the beautiful shore while the whitecrested breakers crash upon the sand and run up    in tendercurving lines of creamy spray  quite to the feet of that lotuseating party  nahant is all rocks says the leader to aunt melissa who hears him with a sweet and tranquil patience and who would enjoy or suffer anything with the same expression and as youve never yet seen the open sea its fortunate that we go to nantasket for of course a beach is more characteristic but now the object is to get there the boat will be starting in a few moments and i doubt whether we can walk it how far is it he asks turning toward a respectablelooking man to liverpool wharf  well its considable ways says the man smiling  then we must take a hack says the pleasurer to his party come on  ive got a hack observes the man in a casual way as if the fact might possibly interest  o you have have you well then put us into it and drive to liverpool wharf and hurry  either the distance was less than the hackman fancied or else he drove thither with unheardof speed for two minutes later he set them down on liverpool wharf but swiftly as they had come the steamer had been even more prompt and she now turned toward them a beautiful wake as she pushed farther and farther out into the harbor  the hackman took his two dollars for his four passengers and was rapidly mounting his boxprobably to avoid idle reproaches wait said the chief pleasurer then when does the next boat leave he asked of the agent who had emerged with a compassionate face from the waitingrooms on the wharf  at half past two  and its now five minutes past nine moaned the merrymakers  why ill tell you what you can do said the agent you can go to hingham by the old colony cars and so come back by the hull and hingham boat  thats it chorused his listeners well go and now said their spokesman to the driver i dare say you didnt know that liverpool wharf was so near but i dont think youve earned your money and you ought to take us on to the old colony depot for halffares at the most  the driver looked pained as if some small tatters and shreds of conscience were flapping uncomfortably about his otherwise dismantled spirit then he seemed to think of his wife and family for he put on the air of a man who had already made great sacrifices and i couldnt really i couldnt afford it said he and as the victims turned from him in disgust he chirruped to his horses and drove off  well said the pleasurers we wont give it up we will have our days pleasure after all but what can we do to kill five hours and a half its miles away from everything and besides theres nothing even if we were there at this image of their remoteness and the inherent desolation of boston they could not suppress some sighs and in the mean time aunt melissa stepped into the waitingroom which opened on the farther side upon the water and sat contentedly down on one of the benches the rest from sheer vacuity and irresolution followed and thus without debate it was settled that they should wait there till the boat left the agent who was a kind man did what he could to alleviate the situation he gave them each the advertisement of his line of boats neatly printed upon a card and then he went away  all this prospect of waiting would do well enough for the ladies of the party but there is an impatience in the masculine fibre which does not brook the notion of such prolonged repose and the leader of the excursion presently pretended an important errand up townnothing less in fact than to buy a tumbler out of which to drink their claret on the beach a holiday is never like any other day to the man who takes it and a festive halo seemed to enwrap the excursionist as he pushed on through the busy streets in the cool shadow of the vast granite palaces wherein the genius of business loves to house itself in this moneymaking land and inhaled the odors of great heaps of leather and spices and dry goods as he passed the open doorwaysodors that mixed pleasantly with the smell of the freshly watered streets when he stepped into a crockery store to make his purchase a sense of pleasuretaking did not fail him and he fell naturally into talk with the clerk about the weather and such pastoral topics even when he reached the establishment where his own business days were passed some glamour seemed to be cast upon familiar objects to the disenchanted eye all things were as they were on all other dullish days of summer even to the accustomed bore leaning up against his favorite desk and transfixing his habitual victim with his usual theme yet to the gaze of this pleasuretaker all was subtly changed and he shook hands right and left as he entered to the marked surprise of the objects of his effusion he had merely come to get some newspapers to help pass away the long moments on the wharf and when he had found these he hurried back thither to hear what had happened during his absence  it seemed that there had hardly ever been such an eventful period in the lives of the family before and he listened to a minute account of it from cousin lucy you know frank says she that sallies one idea in life is to keep the baby from getting the whoopingcough and i declare that these premises have done nothing but reëcho with the most dolorous whoops ever since youve been gone so that at times in my fear that sallie would think id been careless about the boy ive been ready to throw myself into the water and nothings prevented me but the doubt whether it wouldnt be better to throw in the whoopers instead  at this moment a pale little girl with a face wan and sad through all its dirt came and stood in the doorway nearest the baby and in another instant she had burst into a whoop so terrific that if she had meant to have his scalp next it could not have been more dreadful then she subsided into a deep and pathetic quiet with that air peculiar to the victims of her disorder of having done nothing noticeable but her outburst had set at work the mysterious machinery of half a dozen other whoopingcoughers lurking about the building and all unseen they wound themselves up with appalling rapidity and in the utter silence which followed left one to think they had died at the climax  why its a perfect whoopingcough factory this place cries cousin lucy in a desperation go away do please from the baby you poor little dreadful object you she continues turning upon the only visible operative in the establishment here take this and she bribes her with a bit of spongecake on which the child runs lightly off along the edge of the wharf thats been another of their projects for driving me wild says cousin lucytrying to take their own lives in a hundred ways before my face and eyes why will their mothers let them come here to play  really they were very melancholy little figures and might have gone near to make one sad even if they had not been constantly imperilling their lives thanks to its being summertime it did not much matter about the scantiness of their clothing but their squalor was depressing it seemed even to themselves for they were a mournfullooking set of children and in their dangerous sports trifled silently and almost gloomily with death there were none of them above eight or nine years of age and most of them had the care of smaller brothers or even babes in arms whom they were thus early inuring to the perils of the situation the boys were dressed in pantaloons and shirts which no excess of rolling up in the legs and arms could make small enough and the incorrigible toobigness of which rendered the favorite amusements still more hazardous from their liability to trip and entangle the wearers the little girls had on each a solitary garment which hung about her gaunt person with antique severity of outline while the babies were multitudinously swathed in whatever fragments of dress could be tied or pinned or plastered on their faces were strikingly and almost ingeniously dirty and their distractions among the coalheaps and cordwood constantly added to the variety and advantage of these effects  why do their mothers let them come here muses frank aloud why because its so safe cousin lucy at home you know theyd have to be playing upon the sills of fourthfloor windows and here theyre out of the way and cant hurt themselves why cousin lucy this is their park their public garden their bois de boulogne their cascine and look at their gloomy little faces arent they taking their pleasure in the spirit of the very highest fashion i was at newport last summer and saw the famous driving on the avenue in those pony phaetons dogcarts and tubs and threestory carriages with a pair of footmen perching like storks upon each gable and i assure you that all those ornate and costly phantasms it seems to me now like a sad sweet vision had just the expression of these poor children were taking a days pleasure ourselves cousin but nobody would know it from our looks and has nothing but whoopingcough happened since ive been gone  yes we seem to be so cut off from everyday associations that ive imagined myself a sort of tourist and ive been to that catholic church over yonder in hopes of seeing the murillos and raphaelsbut i found it locked up and so i trudged back without a sight of the masterpieces but whats the reason that all the shops hereabouts have nothing but luxuries for sale the windows are perfect tropics of oranges and lemons and belated bananas and tobacco and peanuts  well the poor really seem to use more of those luxuries than anybody else i dont blame them i shouldnt care for the necessaries of life myself if i found them so hard to get  when i came back here says cousin lucy without heeding these flippant and heartless words i found an old gentleman who has something to do with the boats and he sat down as if it were a part of his business and told me nearly the whole history of his life isnt it nice of them keeping an autobiographer it makes the time pass so swiftly when youre waiting this old gentleman was bornwhod ever think itup there in pearl street where those pitiless big granite stores are now and i dont know why but the idea of any human baby being born in pearl street seemed to me one of the saddest things id ever heard of  here cousin lucy went to the rescue of the nurse and the baby who had got into one of their periodical difficulties and her interlocutor turned to aunt melissa  i think franklin says aunt melissa that it was wrong to let that nurse come and bring the baby  yes i know aunty you have those oldestablished ideas and theyre very right answers her nephew but just consider how much she enjoys it and how vastly the baby adds to the pleasure of this charming excursion  aunt melissa made no reply but sat thoughtfully out upon the bay i presume you think the excursion is a failure she said after a while but ive been enjoying every minute of the time here of course ive never seen the open sea and i dont know about it but i feel here just as if i were spending a day at the seaside  well said her nephew i shouldnt call this exactly a wateringplace it lacks the splendor and gayety of newport in a certain degree and it hasnt the illustrious seclusion of nahant the surf isnt very fine nor the beach particularly adapted to bathing and yet i must confess the outlook from here is as lovely as anything one need have  and to tell the truth it was very pretty and interesting the landward environment was as commonplace and mean as it could be a yardful of dismal sheds for coal and lumber and shanties for offices with each office its safe and its desk its whittled armchair and its spittoon its fly that shooed not but buzzed desperately against the grimy pane which if it had really had that boasted microscopic eye it never would have mistaken for the unblemished daylight outside of this yard was the usual wharfish neighborhood with its turmoil of trucks and carts and fleet expresswagons its building up and pulling down its discomfort and clamor of every sort and its shops for the sale not only of those luxuries which lucy had mentioned but of such domestic refreshments as lemonpie and hulledcorn  when however you turned your thoughts and eyes away from this aspect of it and looked out upon the water the neighborhood gloriously retrieved itself there its poverty and vulgarity ceased there its beauty and grace abounded a light breeze ruffled the face of the bay and the innumerable little sailboats that dotted it took the sun and wind upon their wings which they dipped almost into the sparkle of the water and flew lightly hither and thither like gulls that loved the brine too well to rise wholly from it larger ships farther or nearer puffed or shrank their sails as they came and went on the errands of commerce but always moved as if bent upon some dreamy affair of pleasure the steamboats that shot vehemently across their tranquil courses seemed only gayer and vivider visions but not more substantial yonder a black seagoing steamer passed out between the faroff islands and at last left in the sky above those reveries of fortification a whiff of sombre smoke dark and unreal as a memory of battle to the right on some line of railroad longplumed trains arrived and departed like pictures passed through the slide of a magiclantern even a piledriver at work in the same direction seemed to have no malice in the blows which after a loud clucking it dealt the pile and one understood that it was mere conventional violence like that of a punch to his baby  why what a lotuseating life this is said frank at last aunt melissa i dont wonder you think its like the seaside its a great deal better than the seaside and now just as weve entered into the spirit of it the times up for the rose standish to come and bear us from its delights when will the boat be in he asked of the autobiographer whom lucy had pointed out to him  well shes ben in half an hour now there she lays just outside the john romer  there to be sure she lay and those pleasuretakers had been so lost in the rapture of waiting and the beauty of the scene as never to have noticed her arrival   iithe afternoon   it is noticeable how many people there are in the world that seem bent always upon the same purpose of amusement or business as ones self if you keep quietly about your accustomed affairs there are all your neighbors and acquaintance hard at it too if you go on a journey choose what train you will the cars are filled with travellers in your direction you take a days pleasure and everybody abandons his usual occupation to crowd upon your boat whether it is to gloucester or nahant or to nantasket beach you go it is very hard to believe that from whatever channel of life you abstract yourself still the great sum of it presses forward as before that business is carried on though you are idle that men amuse themselves though you toil that every train is as crowded as that you travel on that the theatre or the church fills its boxes or pews without you perfectly well i suppose it would not be quite agreeable to believe all this the opposite illusion is far more flattering for if each one of us did not take the world with him now at every turn should he not have to leave it behind him when he died and that it must be owned would not be agreeable nor is the fact quite conceivable though ever so many myriads in so many million years have proved it  when our friends first went aboard the rose standish that day they were almost the sole passengers and they had a feeling of ownership and privacy which was pleasant enough in its way but which they lost afterwards though to lose it was also pleasant for enjoyment no more likes to be solitary than sin does which is notoriously gregarious and i dare say would hardly exist if it could not be committed in company the preacher indeed little knows the comfortable sensation we have in being called fellowsinners and what an effective shield for his guilt each makes of his neighbors hardheartedness  cousin frank never felt how strange was a lonely transgression till that day when in the silence of the little cabin he took the bottle of claret from the handbag and prepared to moisten the family lunch with it i think aunt melissa he said we had better lunch now for its a quarter past two and we shall not get to the beach before four lets improvise a beach of these chairs and that waterurn yonder can stand for the breakers now this is truly like newport and nahant he added after the little arrangement was complete and he was about to strip away the bottles jacket of brown paper when a lady much wrapped up came in and reclining upon one of the opposite seats began to take them all in with a severe serenity of gaze that made them feel for a moment like a party of low foreignerslike a set of german atheists say frank kept on the bottles paper jacket and as the single tumbler of the party circled from mouth to mouth each of them tried to give the honest drink the false air of a medicinal potion of some sort and to see aunt melissa sipping it no one could have put his hand on his heart and sworn it was not elderberry wine at the worst in spite of these efforts they all knew that they had suffered a hopeless loss of repute yet after the loss was confessed i am not sure that they were not the gayer and happier through this freedom of a broken law at any rate the lunch passed off very merrily and when they had put back the fragments of the feast into the bags they went forward to the bow of the boat to get good places for seeing the various people as they came aboard and for an outlook upon the bay when the boat should start  i suppose that these were not very remarkable people and that nothing but the indomitable interest our friends took in the human race could have enabled them to feel any concern in their companions it was no doubt just such a company as goes down to nantasket beach every pleasant day in summer certain ones among them were distinguishable as sojourners at the beach by an air of familiarity with the business of getting there an indifference to the prospect and an indefinable touch of superiority these read their newspapers in quiet corners or if they were not of the newspaper sex made themselves comfortable in the cabins and looked about them at the other passengers with looks of lazy surprise and just a hint of scorn for their interest in the boats departure our days pleasurers took it that the lady whose steady gaze had reduced them when at lunch to such a low ebb of shabbiness was a regular boarder at the least in one of the beach hotels a few other passengers were like themselves mere idlers for a day and were eager to see all that the boat or the voyage offered of novelty there were clerks and men who had bookkeeping written in a neat mercantile hand upon their faces and who had evidently been given that afternoon for a breathingtime and there were strangers who were going down to the beach for the sake of the charming view of the harbor which the trip afforded here and there were people who were not to be classed with any certaintyas a pale young man handsome in his undesirable way who looked like a steamboat pantry boy not yet risen to be bartender but rapidly rising and who sat carefully balanced upon the railing of the boat chatting with two young girls who heard his broad sallies with continual snickers and interchanged saucy comments with that prompt upandcoming manner which is so large a part of nonhumorous humor as mr lowell calls it and now and then pulled and pushed each other it was a scene worth study for in no other country could anything so bad have been without being vastly worse but here it was evident that there was nothing worse than you saw and indeed these persons formed a sort of relief to the other passengers who were nearly all monotonously wellbehaved amongst a few there seemed to be acquaintance but the far greater part were unknown to one another and there were no words wasted by any one i believe the english traveller who has taxed our nation with inquisitiveness for half a century is at last beginning to find out that we do not ask questions because we have the still more vicious custom of not opening our mouths at all when with strangers  it was a good hour after our friends got aboard before the boat left her moorings and then it was not without some secret dreads of seasickness that aunt melissa saw the seething brine widen between her and the familiar wharfhouse where she now seemed to have spent so large a part of her life but the multitude of really charming and interesting objects that presently fell under her eye soon distracted her from those gloomy thoughts  there is always a shabbiness about the wharves of seaports but i must own that as soon as you get a reasonable distance from them in boston they turn wholly beautiful they no longer present that imposing array of mighty ships which they could show in the days of consul plancus when the commerce of the world sought chiefly our port yet the docks are still filled with the modester kinds of shipping and if there is not that wilderness of spars and rigging which you see at new york let us believe that there is an aspect of selection and refinement in the scene so that one should describe it not as a forest but less conventionally as a gentlemans park of masts the steamships of many coastwise freight lines gloom with their black capacious hulks among the lighter sailingcraft and among the white greenshuttered passengerboats and behind them those desperate and grimy sheds assume a picturesqueness their sagging roofs and crooked gables harmonizing agreeably with the shipping and then growing up from all rises the mellowtinted brickbuilt city roof and spire and domea fair and noble sight indeed and one not surpassed for a certain quiet and cleanly beauty by any that i know  our friends lingered long upon this pretty prospect and as inland people of light heart and easy fancy will the ladies made imagined voyages in each of the more notable vessels they passedall cheap and safe trips occupying half a second apiece then they came forward to the bow that they might not lose any part of the harbors beauty and variety and informed themselves of the names of each of the fortressed islands as they passed and forgot them being passed so that to this day aunt melissa has the fort warren rebel prisoners languishing in fort independence but they made sure of the air of soft repose that hung about each of that exquisite military neatness which distinguishes them and which went to aunt melissas housekeeping heart of the green thick turf covering the escarpments of the great guns loafing on the crests of the ramparts and looking out over the water sleepily of the sentries pacing slowly up and down with their gleaming muskets  i never see one of those fellows says cousin frank without setting him to the music of that saddest and subtlest of heines poems you know it lucy and he repeats    mein herz mein herz is traurig      doch lustig leuchtet der mai    ich stehe gelehnt an der linde      hoch auf der alten bastei                                         am alten grauen thurme      ein schilderhäuschen steht    ein rothgeröckter bursche      dort auf und nieder geht    er spielt mit seiner flinte      sie funkelt im sonnenroth    er präsentirt und schultert      ich wollt er schösse mich todt  o says cousin lucy either because the poignant melancholy of the sentiment has suddenly pierced her or because she does not quite understand the germanyou never can tell about women while frank smiles down upon her in this amiable doubt their party is approached by the tipsy man who has been making the excursion so merry for the other passengers in spite of the fact that there is very much to make one sad in him he is an old man sweltering in rusty black a two days gray beard and a narrowbrimmed livid silk hat set well back upon the nape of his neck he explains to our friends as he does to every one whose acquaintance he makes that he was in former days a seafaring man and that he has brought his two little grandsons here to show them something about a ship and the poor old soul helplessly saturates his phrase with the rankest profanity the boys are somewhat amused by their grandsires state being no doubt familiar with it but a very grimlooking old lady who sits against the pilothouse and keeps a sharp eye upon all three and who is also doubtless familiar with the unhappy spectacle seems not to find it a joke her stout matronly umbrella trembles in her hand when her husband draws near and her eye flashes but he gives her as wide a berth as he can returning her glare with a propitiatory drunken smile and a wink to the passengers to let them into the fun in fact he is full of humor in his tipsy way and one after another falls the prey of his free sarcasm which does not spare the boat or any feature of the excursion he holds for a long time by swiftly successive stories of his seafaring days a very quiet gentleman who dares neither laugh too loudly nor show indifference for fear of rousing that terrible wit at his expense and finds his account in looking down at his boots  well sir says the deplorable old sinner we was forty days out from liverpool with a cargo of salt and iron and we got caught on the banks in a calm capn says ii us secn mates they any man aboard this ship knows how to pray no says the capn blast yer prayers well says i capn im no hand at all to pray but im goin to see if prayin wont git us out n this and i down on my knees and i made a firstclass prayer and a breeze sprung up in a minute and carried us smack into boston  at this bit of truculent burlesque the quiet man made a bold push and walked away with a somewhat sickened face and as no one now intervened between them the inebriate laid a familiar hand upon cousin franks collar and said with a wink at his late listener looks like a lerigious man dont he i guess i give him a good dose if he does think himself the headdeacon of this boat and he went on to state his ideas of religion from which it seemed that he was a person of the most advanced thinking and believed in nothing worth mentioning  it is perhaps no worse for an infidel to be drunk than a christian but my friend found this tipsy blasphemers case so revolting that he went to the handbag took out the empty claretbottle and seeking a solitary corner of the boat cast the bottle into the water and felt a thrill of uncommon selfapproval as this scapegoat of all the wine at his grocers bobbed off upon the little waves besides it saves carrying the bottle home he thought not without a halfconscious reserve that if his penitence were ever too much for him he could easily abandon it and without the reflection that the gate is always open behind him who could consent to enter upon any course of perfect behavior if good resolutions could not be broken who would ever have the courage to form them would it not be intolerable to be made as good as we ought to be then admirable reader thank heaven even for your lapses since it is so wholesome and saving to be well ashamed of yourself from time to time  what an outrage said cousin frank in the glow of virtue as he rejoined the ladies that that tipsy rascal should be allowed to go on with his ribaldry he seems to pervade the whole boat and to subject everybody to his sway hes a perfect despot to us helpless sober people i wouldnt openly disagree with him on any account we ought to send a round robin to the captain and ask him to put that religious liberal in irons during the rest of the voyage  in the mean time however the object of his indignation had used up all the conversible material in that part of the boat and had deviously started for the other end the elderly woman with the umbrella rose and followed him somewhat wearily and with a sadness that appeared more in her movement than in her face and as the two went down the cabin did the comical affair look after all something like tragedy my reader who expects a little novelty in tragedy and not these stale and common effects will never think so  youll not pretend frank says lucy that in such an intellectual place as boston a crowd as large as this can be got together and no distinguished literary people in it i know there are some notables aboard do point them out to me pretty near everybody has a literary look  why thats what we call our boston look cousin lucy you neednt have written anything to have itits as general as tubercular consumption and is the effect of our universal culture and habits of reading i heard a newyorker say once that if you went into a corner grocery in boston to buy a codfish the man would ask you how you liked lucille whilst he was tying it up no no you mustnt be taken in by that literary look im afraid the real literary men dont always have it but i do see a literary man aboard yonder he added craning his neck to one side and then furtively pointingthe most literary man i ever knew one of the most literary men that ever lived his whole existence is really bound up in books he never talks of anything else and never thinks of anything else i believe look at himwhat kind and pleasant eyes hes got there he sees me cries cousin frank with a pleasurable excitement how dye do he calls out  o cousin frank introduce us sighs lucy  not i he wouldnt thank me he doesnt care for pretty girls outside of books hed be afraid of em hes the bashfullest man alive and all his heroines are fifty years old at the least but before i go any further tell me solemnly lucy youre not interviewing me youre not going to write it to a new york newspaper no well i think its best to ask always our friend therehes everybodys friend if you mean nobodys enemy by that not even his ownis really what i saythe most literary man i ever knew he loves all epochs and phases of literature but his passion is the charles lamb period and all lambs friends he loves them as if they were living men and lamb would have loved him if he could have known him he speaks rapidly and rather indistinctly and when you meet him and say good day and you suppose he answers with something about the weather ten to one hes asking you what you think of hazlitts essays on shakespeare or leigh hunts italian poets or lambs roast pig or barry cornwalls songs he couldnt get by a bookstall without stoppingfor half an hour at any rate he knows just when all the new books in town are to be published and when each bookseller is to get his invoice of old english books he has no particular address but if you leave your card for him at any bookstore in boston hes sure to get it within two days and in the summertime youre apt to meet him on these excursions of course he writes about books and very tastefully and modestly theres hardly any of the brandnew immortal english poets who die off so rapidly but has had a good word from him but his heart is with the older fellows from chaucer down and after the charles lamb epoch i dont know whether he loves better the elizabethan age or that of queen anne think of him making me stop the other day at a bookstall and read through an essay out of the spectator i did it all for love of him though money couldnt have persuaded me that i had time and im always telling him lies and pretending to be as well acquainted as he is with authors i hardly know by namehe seems so fondly to expect it hes really almost a disembodied spirit as concerns most mundane interestshis soul is in literature as a lovers in his mistresss beauty and in the next world where as the swedenborgians believe spirits seen at a distance appear like the things they most resemble in disposition as doves hawks goats lambs swine and so on im sure that i shall see his true and kindly soul in the guise of a noble old folio quaintly lettered across his back in old english text tom i  while our friends talked and looked about them a sudden change had come over the brightness and warmth of the day the blue heaven had turned a chilly gray and the water looked harsh and cold now too they noted that they were drawing near a wooden pier built into the water and that they had been winding about in a crooked channel between muddy shallows and that their course was overrun with long disheveled seaweed the shawls had been unstrapped and the ladies made comfortable in them  ho for the beach cried cousin frank with a vehement show of enthusiasm now then aunt melissa prepare for the great enjoyment of the day in a few moments we shall be of the elves        that on the sand with printless foot   do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him   when he comes back  come we shall have three hours on the beach and that will bring us well into the cool of the evening and we can return by the last boat  as to the cool of the evening said aunt melissa i dont know its quite cool enough for comfort at present and im sure that anything more wouldnt be wholesome whats become of our beautiful weather she asked deeply plotting to gain time  its one of our boston peculiarities not to say merits answered frank which you must have noticed already that we can get rid of a fine day sooner than any other region while youre saying how lovely it is a subtle change is wrought and under skies still blue and a sun still warm the keen spirit of the east wind pierces every nerve and all the fine weather within you is chilled and extinguished the gray atmosphere follows but the day first languishes in yourself but for this life in boston would be insupportably perfect if this is indeed a drawback youd find bostonians to defend it i dare say but this isnt a regular east wind today its merely our nearness to the sea  i think franklin said aunt melissa that we wont go down to the beach this afternoon as if she had been there yesterday and would go tomorrow its too late in the day and it wouldnt be good for the child im sure  well aunty it was you determined us to wait for the boat and its your right to say whether we shall leave it or not im very willing not to go ashore i always find that after working up to an object with great effort its surpassingly sweet to leave it unaccomplished at last then it remains forever in the region of the ideal amongst the songs that never were sung the pictures that never were painted why in fact should we force this pleasure weve eaten our lunch weve lost the warm heart of the day why should we poorly drag over to that damp and sullen beach where we should find three hours very long when by going back now we can keep intact that glorious image of a day by the sea which weve been cherishing all summer youre right aunt melissa we wont go ashore we will stay here and respect our illusions  at heart perhaps lucy did not quite like this retreat it was not in harmony with the youthful spirit of her sex but she reflected that she could come againo beneficent cheat of another time how much thou sparest us in our overworked overenjoyed worldshe was very comfortable where she was in a seat commanding a perfect view for the return trip and she submitted without a murmur besides now that the boat had drawn up to the pier and discharged part of her passengers and was waiting to take on others lucy was interested in a mass of fluttering dresses and widerimmed straw hats that drew down toward the rose standish and gracefully thronged the pier and prettily hesitated about and finally came aboard with laughter and little false cries of terror attended through all by the new england disproportion of that sex which is so foolish when it is silly it was a large picnic party which had been spending the day upon the beach as each of the ladies showed in her face where if the roses upon her cheeks were somewhat obscured by the imbrowning seaside sun a bright pink had been compensatingly bestowed upon the point of her nose a mysterious quiet fell upon them all when they were got aboard and had taken conspicuous places which was accounted for presently when a loud shout was heard from the shore and a man beside an ambulant photographic machine was seen wildly waving his hat it is impossible to resist a temptation of this kind and our party all yielded and posed themselves in striking and characteristic attitudeseven aunt melissa sharing the ambition to appear in a picture which she should never see and the nurse coming out strong from the abeyance in which she had been held and lifting the baby high into the air for a good likeness the frantic gesticulator on the shore gave an impressive wave with both hands took the cap from the instrument turned his back as photographers always do with that air of hiding their tears for the brief space that seems so long and then clapped on the cap again while a great sigh of relief went up from the whole boatload of passengers they were taken  but the interval had been a luckless one for the rose standish and when she stirred her wheels clouds of mud rose to the top of the water and there was no responsive movement of the boat she was aground in the falling tide  there seems a pretty fair prospect of our spending some time here after all said frank while the ladies who had reluctantly given up the idea of staying were now in a quiver of impatience to be off the picnic was shifted from side to side the engine groaned and tugged captain miles standish and his crew bestirred themselves vigorously and at last the boat swung loose and strode down the seaweedy channels while our friends who had already done the great sights of the harbor now settled themselves to the enjoyment of its minor traits and beauties here and there they passed small parties on the shore which with their yachts anchored near or their boats drawn up from the water were cooking an outdoor meal by a fire that burned bright red upon the sands in the late afternoon air in such cases people willingly indulge themselves in saluting whatever craft goes by and the ladies of these small picnics as they sat round the fires kept up a great waving of handkerchiefs and sometimes cheered the rose standish though i believe the bostonians are ordinarily not a demonstrative race of course the large picnic on board fluttered multitudinous handkerchiefs in response both to these people ashore and to those who hailed them from vessels which they met they did not refuse the politeness even to the passengers on a rival boat when she passed them though at heart they must have felt some natural pangs at being passed the water was peopled everywhere by all sorts of sail lagging slowly homeward in the light evening breeze and on some of the larger vessels there were family groups to be seen and a graceful smoke suggestive of supper curled from the cooks galley i suppose these ships were chiefly coasting craft of one kind or another come from the provinces at farthest but to the ignorance and the fancy of our friends they arrived from all remote and romantic parts of the worldfrom india from china and from the south seas with cargoes of spices and gums and tropical fruits and i see no reason why one should ever deny himself the easy pleasure they felt in painting the unknown in such lively hues the truth is a strange ship if you will let her always brings you precious freight always arrives from wonderland under the command of captain sinbad how like a beautiful sprite she looks afar off as if she came from some finer and fairer world than ours nay we will not go out to meet her we will not go on board captain sinbad shall bring us the invoice of golddust slaves and rocs eggs tonight and we will have some of the eggs for breakfast or if he never comes are we not just as rich but i think these friends of ours got a yet keener pleasure out of the spectacle of a large and stately ship that with all sails spread moved silently and steadily out toward the open sea it is yet grander and sweeter to sail toward the unknown than to come from it and every vessel that leaves port has this destination and will bear you thither if you will    it may be that the gulf shall wash us down    it may be we shall touch the happy isles    and see the great achilles whom we knew  absently murmured lucy looking on this beautiful apparition  but i cant help thinking of ulysses cabinboy yonder said cousin frank after a pause can you aunt melissa  i dont understand what youre talking about franklin answered aunt melissa somewhat severely  why i mean that there is a poor wretch of a boy on board there whos run away and whose heart must be aching just now at the thought of the home he has left i hope ulysses will be good to him and not swear at him for a day or two or knock him about with a belayingpin just about this time his mother up in the country is getting ready his supper and wondering whats become of him and torturing herself with hopes that break one by one and tonight when she goes up to his empty room having tried to persuade herself that the truants come back and climbed in at the window  why franklin this isnt true is it asks aunt melissa  well no lets pray heaven it isnt in this case its been true often enough to be false for once  what a great ugly black object a ship is said cousin lucy  slowly the city rose up against the distance sharpening all its outlines and filling in all its familiar detailslike a fact which one dreams is a dream and which as the mists of sleep break away shows itself for reality  the air grows closer and warmerit is the breath of the hot and toil worn land  the boat makes her way up through the shipping seeks her landing and presently rubs herself affectionately against the wharf the passengers quickly disperse themselves upon shore dismissed each with an appropriate sarcasm by the tipsy man who has had the means of keeping himself drunk throughout and who now looks to the discharge of the boats cargo  as our friends leave the wharfhouse behind them and straggle uneasily and very conscious of sunburn up the now silent length of pearl street to seek the nearest horsecars they are aware of a curious fidgeting of the nurse who flies from one side of the pavement to the other and violently shifts the baby from one arm to the other  whats the matter asks frank but before the nurse can answer thim little divils he perceives that the whoopingcoughers of the morning have taken the occasion to renew a pleasant acquaintance and are surrounding the baby and nurse with an atmosphere of whoopingcough  i say friends we cant stand this you know says the anxious father we must part some time and this is a favorable moment now ill give you all this if you dont come another step and he empties out to them from the handbags he carries the fragments of lunch which the frugal mind of aunt melissa had caused her to store there upon these the whoopingcoughers hurl themselves in a body and are soon left round the corner yet they would have been no disgrace to our party whose appearance was now most disreputable frank and lucy stalked ahead with shawls dragging from their arms the former loaded down with handbags and the latter with indiarubbers aunt melissa came next under a burden of bloated umbrellas the nurse last with her hat awry and the baby a caricature of its morning trimness in her embrace a days pleasure is so demoralizing that no party can stand it and come out neat and orderly  illustration frank and lucy stalked ahead with shawls dragging from their arms  cousin frank asked lucy awfully what if we should meet the mayflowers nowthe mayflowers being a very ancient and noble boston family whose acquaintance was the great pride and terror of our friends lives  i should cut them dead said frank and scarcely spoke again till his party dragged slowly up the steps of their minute suburban villa  at the door his wife met them with a troubled and anxious face  calamities asked frank desperately  o calamities upon calamities weve got a lost child in the kitchen answered mrs sallie  o good heavens cried her husband adieu my dreams of repose so desirable after the quantity of active enjoyment ive had well where is the lost child   iiithe evening   where is the lost child repeats frank desperately where have you got him  in the kitchen  why in the kitchen  hows baby demands mrs sallie with the incoherent suddenness of her sex and running halfway down the steps to meet the nurse um um umm mm sounds which may stand for smothered kisses of rapture and thanksgiving that baby is not a lost child has he been good lucy take him off and give him some cocoa mrs ogonegal she adds in her businesslike way and with a little push to the combined nurse and baby while lucy answers o beautiful and from that moment being warned through all her being by something in the others tone casts aside the matronly manner which she has worn during the day and lapses into the comfortable irresponsibility of youngladyhood  what kind of a time did you have  splendid answers lucy delightful i think she adds as if she thought others might not think so  i suppose you found gloucester a quaint old place  o says frank we didnt go to gloucester we found that the city fathers had chartered the boat for the day so we thought wed go to nahant  then youve seen your favorite gardens of maolis what in the world are they like  well we didnt see the gardens of maolis the nahant boat was so crowded that we couldnt think of going on her and so we decided wed drive over to the liverpool wharf and go down to nantasket beach  that was nice im so glad on aunt melissas account its much better to see the ocean from a long beach than from those nahant rocks  thats what i said but you know when we got to the wharf the boat had just left  you dont mean it well then what under the canopy did you do  why we sat down in the wharfhouse and waited from nine oclock till halfpast two for the next boat  well im glad you didnt back out at any rate you did show pluck you poor things i hope you enjoyed the beach after you did get there  why says frank looking down we never got there  never got there gasps mrs sallie didnt you go down on the afternoon boat  yes  why didnt you get to the beach then  we didnt go ashore  well thats like you frank  its a great deal more like aunt melissa answers frank the air felt so raw and chilly by the time we reached the pier that she declared the baby would perish if it was taken to the beach besides nothing would persuade her that nantasket beach was at all different from liverpool wharf  never mind never mind says mrs sallie i dont wish to hear anything more thats your idea of a days pleasure is it i call it a days disgrace a days miserable givingup there go in go in im ashamed of you all dont let the neighbors see you for pitys sakewe keep him in the kitchen she continues recurring to franks longunanswered question concerning the lost child because he prefers it as being the room nearest to the closet where the cookies are hes taken advantage of our sympathies to refuse everything but cookies  i suppose thats one of the rights of lost childhood comments frank languidly theres no law that can compel him to touch even cracker  well youd better go down and see what you can make of him hes driven us all wild  so frank descends to the region now redolent of the preparing tea and finds upon a chair in the middle of the kitchen floor a very forlorn little figure of a boy mutely munching a sweetcake while now and then a tear steals down his cheeks and moistens the grimy traces of former tears he and baby are in the mean time regarding each other with a steadfast glare the cook and the nurse supporting baby in this rite of hospitality  well my little man says his host how did you get here  the little man perhaps because he is heartily sick of the question is somewhat slow to answer that there was a fire and that he ran after the steamer and a girl found him and brought him up here  and thats all the blessed thing you can get out of him says cook and the lost boy looks as if he felt cook to be perfectly right  in spite of the wellmeant endeavors of the household to wash him and brush him he is still a dreadfully travelstained little boy and he is powdered in every secret crease and wrinkle by that dust of old charlesbridge of which we always speak with an air of affected disgust and a feeling of illconcealed pride in an abomination so strikingly and peculiarly our own he looks very much as if he had been following fire engines about the streets of our learned and pulverous suburb ever since he could walk and he certainly seems to feel himself in trouble to a certain degree but there is easily imaginable in his bearing a conviction that after all the chief care is with others and that though unhappy he is not responsible the principal victim of his sorrows is also penetrated by this opinion and after gazing forlornly upon him for a while asks mechanically whats your name  freddy is the laconic answer  freddy trying with an artful inflection to lead him on to his surname  freddy decidedly and conclusively  o bless me whats the name of the street your papa lives on  this problem is far too deep for freddy and he takes a bite of sweetcake in sign that he does not think of solving it frank looks at him gloomily for a moment and then determines that he can grapple with the difficulty more successfully after he has had tea send up the supper bridget i think my dear he says after they have sat down wed better all question our lost child when weve finished  so when they have finished they have him up in the sittingroom and the inquisition begins  now freddy his host says with a cheerful air of lifelong friendship and confidence you know that everybody has got two names of course your first name is freddy and its a very pretty name well i want you to think real hard and then tell me what your other name is so i can take you back to your mamma  at this allusion the child looks round on the circle of eager and compassionate faces and begins to shed tears and to wring all hearts  whats your name asks frank cheerfullyyour other name you know  freddy sobbed the forlorn creature  o good heaven thisll never do groaned the chief inquisitor now freddy try not to cry what is your papas namemr with the leading inflection as before  papa says freddy  illustration they skirmish about him with every sort of query  o thatll never do not mr papa  yes persists freddy  but freddy interposes mrs sallie as her husband falls back baffled when ladies come to see your mamma what do they call her mrs adopting franks alluring inflection  mrs mamma answers freddy confirmed in his error by this course and a secret dismay possesses his questioners they skirmish about him with every sort of query they try to entrap him into some kind of revelation by apparently irrelevant remarks they plan ambuscades and surprises but freddy looks vigilantly round upon them and guards his personal history from every approach and seems in every way so to have the best of it that it is almost exasperating  kindness has proved futile observes frank and i think we ought as a last resort before yielding ourselves to despair to use intimidation now fred he says with sudden and terrible severity whats your fathers name  the hapless little soul is really moved to an effort of memory by this and blubbers out something that proves in the end to resemble the family name though for the present it is merely a puzzle of unintelligible sounds  blackman cries aunt melissa catching desperately at these sounds  on this all the man and brother is roused in freddys bosom and he roars fiercely no he aint a black man hes white  i give it up says frank who has been looking for his hat im afraid we cant make anything out of him and ill have to go and report the case to the police but put him to bed do sallie hes dropping with sleep  so he went out of course supported morally by a sense of duty but i am afraid also by a sense of adventure in some degree it is not every day that in so quiet a place as charlesbridge you can have a lost child cast upon your sympathies and i believe that when an appeal is not really agonizing we like so well to have our sympathies touched we favorites of the prosperous commonplace that most of us would enter eagerly into a pathetic case of this kind even after a days pleasure such was certainly the mood of my friend and he unconsciously prepared himself for an equal interest on the part of the police but this was an error the police heard his statement with all proper attention and wrote it in full upon the stationslate but they showed no feeling whatever and behaved as if they valued a lost child no more than a child snug at home in his own crib they said that no doubt his parents would be asking at the policestations for him during the night and as if my friend would otherwise have thought of putting him into the street they suggested that he should just keep the lost child till he was sent for modestly enough frank proposed that they should make some inquiry for his parents and was answered by the question whether they could take a man off his beat for that purpose and remembering that beats in charlesbridge were of such vastness that during his whole residence there he had never yet seen a policeman on his street he was obliged to own to himself that his proposal was absurd he felt the need of reinstating himself by something more sensible and so he said he thought he would go down to the port and leave word at the station there and the police tacitly assenting to this he went  i who have sometimes hinted that the square is not a centre of gayety or a scene of the greatest activity by day feel it right to say that it has some modest charms of its own on a summers night about the hour when frank passed through it when the postoffice has just been shut and when the different groups that haunt the place in front of the closing shops have dwindled to the loungers fit though few who will keep it well into the night and may there be found by the passenger on the last horsecar out from boston wrapt in a kind of social silence and honorably attended by the policeman whose favored beat is in that neighborhood they seem a feature of the bygone village life of charlesbridge and accord pleasantly with the townpump and the public horsetrough and the noble elm that by night droops its boughs so pensively and probably dreams of its happy younger days when there were no cankerworms in the world sometimes this choice company sits on the curbing that goes round the terrace at the elm trees foot and then i envy every soul in itso tranquil it seems so cool so careless so morrowless i cannot see the faces of that luxurious society but there i imagine is the local albino and a certain blind man who resorts thither much by day and makes a strange kind of jest of his own with a flicker of humor upon his sightless face and a faith that others less unkindly treated by nature will be able to see the point apparently not always discernible to himself late at night i have a fancy that the darkness puts him on an equality with other wits and that he enjoys his own brilliancy as well as any one  at the port station frank was pleased and soothed by the tranquil air of the policeman who sat in his shirtsleeves outside the door and seemed to announce by his attitude of final disoccupation that crimes and misdemeanors were no more this officer at once showed a desirable interest in the case he put on his blue coat that he might listen to the whole story in a proper figure and then he took down the main points on the slate and said that they would send word round to the other stations in the city and the boys parents could hardly help hearing of him that night  returned home frank gave his news and then he and mrs sallie went up to look at the lost child as he slept the sumptuous diet to which he had confined himself from the first seemed to agree with him perfectly for he slept unbrokenly and apparently without a consciousness of his woes on a chair lay his clothes in a dusty little pathetic heap they were well kept clothes except for the wrong his wanderings had done them and they showed a motherly care here and there which it was not easy to look at with composure the spectators of his sleep both thought of the curious chance that had thrown this little one into their charge and considered that he was almost as completely a gift of the unknown as if he had been following a steamer in another planet and had thence dropped into their yard his helplessness in accounting for himself was as affecting as that of the sublimest metaphysician and no learned man no superior intellect no subtle inquirer among us lost children of the divine forgotten home could have been less able to say how or whence he came to be just where he found himself we wander away and away the dust of the roadside gathers upon us and when some strange shelter receives us we lie down to our sleep inarticulate and haunted with dreams of memory or the memory of dreams knowing scarcely more of the past than of the future  what a strange world sighed mrs sallie and then as this was a mood far too speculative for her she recalled herself to practical life suddenly if we should have to adopt this child frank  why bless my soul were not obliged to adopt him even a lost child cant demand that  we shall adopt him if they dont come for him and now i want to know mrs sallie spoke as if the adoption had been effected whether we shall give him our name or some other  well i dont know its the first child ive ever adopted said frank and upon my word i cant say whether you have to give him a new name or not in fact if id thought of this affair of a name id never have adopted him its the greatest part of the burden and if his father will only come for him ill give him up without a murmur  in the interval that followed the proposal of this alarming difficulty and while he sat and waited vaguely for whatever should be going to happen next frank was not able to repress a sense of personal resentment towards the little vagrant sleeping so carelessly there though at the bottom of his heart there was all imaginable tenderness for him in the fantastic character which to his weariness the days pleasure took on it seemed an extraordinary unkindness of fate that this lost child should have been kept in reserve for him after all the rest and he had so small consciousness of bestowing shelter and charity and so profound a feeling of having himself been turned out of house and home by some surprising and potent agency that if the lost child had been a regiment of fenians billeted upon him it could not have oppressed him more while he remained perplexed in this perverse sentiment of invasion and dispossession hark said mrs sallie whats that  it was a noise of dragging and shuffling on the walk in front of the house and a low hoarse whispering  i dont know said frank but from the kind of pleasure ive got out of it so far i should say that this holiday was capable of an earthquake before midnight  listen  they listened as they must and heard the outer darkness rehearse a raucous dialogue between an unseen bill and jim who were the more terrible to the imagination from being so realistically named and who seemed to have in charge some nameless third person a mute actor in the invisible scene there was doubt which he uttered in the mind of jim whether they could get this silent comrade along much farther without carrying him and there was a growling assent from bill that he was pretty far gone that was a fact and that maybe jim had better go for the wagon then there were quick retreating steps and then there was a profound silence in which the audience of this strange drama sat thrilled and speechless the effect was not less dreadful when there rose a dull sound as of a helpless body rubbing against the fence and at last lowered heavily to the ground  o cried mrs sallie do go out and help hes dying  but even as she spoke the noise of wheels was heard a wagon stopped before the door there came a tugging and lifting with a sound as of crunching gravel and then a there of great relief  frank said mrs sallie very solemnly if you dont go out and help those men ill never forgive you  really the drama had grown very impressive it was a mystery to say the least and so it must remain forever for when frank infected at last by mrs sallies faith in tragedy opened the door and offered his tardy services the wagon was driven rapidly away without reply they never learned what it had all been and i think that if one actually honors mysteries it is best not to look into them how much finer after all if you have such a thing as this happen before your door at midnight not to throw any light upon it then your probable tipsy man cannot be proved other than a tragical presence which you can match with any inscrutable creation of fiction and if you should ever come to write a romance as one is very liable to do in this age there is your unknown a figure of strange and fearful interest made to your hand and capable of being used in or out of the body with a very gloomy effect  while our friends yet trembled with this sensation quick steps ascended to their door and then followed a sharp anxious tug at the bell  ah cried frank prophetically heres the father of our adopted son and he opened the door  the gentleman who appeared there could scarcely frame the question to which frank replied so cheerfully o yes hes here and snug in bed and fast asleep come upstairs and look at him better let him be till morning and then come after him he added as they looked down a moment on the little sleeper  o no i couldnt said the father con expressione and then he told how he had heard of this childs whereabouts at the port station and had hurried to get him and how his mother did not know he was found yet and was almost wild about him they had no idea how he had got lost and his own blind story was the only tale of his adventure that ever became known  by this time his father had got the child partly awake and the two men were dressing him in mens clumsy fashion and finally they gave it up and rolled him in a shawl the father lifted the slight burden and two small arms fell about his neck the weary child slept again  how has he behaved asked the father  like a little hero said frank but hes been a cormorant for cookies i think it right to tell you in case he shouldnt be very brilliant to morrow that he wouldnt eat a bit of anything else  the father said he was the life of their house and frank said he knew how that wasthat he had a life of the house of his own and then the father thanked him very simply and touchingly and with the decent new england selfrestraint which is doubtless so much better than any sort of effusion say goodnight to the gentleman freddy he said at the door and freddy with closed eyes murmured a goodnight from far within the land of dreams and then was borne away to the house out of which the life had wandered with his little feet  i dont know sallie said frank when he had given all the eagerly demanded particulars about the childs fatheri dont know whether i should want many such holidays as this in the course of the summer on the whole i think id better overwork myself and not take any relaxation if i mean to live long and yet im not sure that the days been altogether a failure though all our purposes of enjoyment have miscarried i didnt plan to find a lost child here when i got home and im afraid i havent had always the most christian feeling towards him but hes really the saving grace of the affair and if this were a little comedy i had been playing i should turn him to account with the jaded audience and advancing to the footlights should say with my hand on my waistcoat and a neat bow that although every hope of the day had been disappointed and nothing i had meant to do had been done yet the man who had ended at midnight by restoring a lost child to the arms of its father must own that in spite of adverse fortune he had enjoyed a days pleasure  illustration a gaunt figure of forlorn and curious smartness     a romance of real life   it was long past the twilight hour which has been already mentioned as so oppressive in suburban places and it was even too late for visitors when a resident whom i shall briefly describe as a contributor to the magazines was startled by a ring at his door as any thoughtful person would have done upon the like occasion he ran over his acquaintance in his mind speculating whether it were such or such a one and dismissing the whole list of improbabilities before he laid down the book he was reading and answered the bell when at last he did this he was rewarded by the apparition of an utter stranger on his thresholda gaunt figure of forlorn and curious smartness towering far above him that jerked him a nod of the head and asked if mr hapford lived there the face which the lamplight revealed was remarkable for a harsh two days growth of beard and a single bloodshot eye yet it was not otherwise a sinister countenance and there was something in the strange presence that appealed and touched the contributor revolving the facts vaguely in his mind was not sure after all that it was not the mans clothes rather than his expression that softened him toward the rugged visage they were so tragically cheap and the misery of helpless needlewomen and the poverty and ignorance of the purchaser were so apparent in their shabby newness of which they appeared still conscious enough to have led the way to the very window in the semitic quarter of the city where they had lain ticketed this nobby suit for 15  but the strangers manner put both his face and his clothes out of mind and claimed a deeper interest when being answered that the person for whom he asked did not live there he set his bristling lips hard together and sighed heavily  they told me he said in a hopeless way that he lived on this street and ive been to every other house im very anxious to find him capn the contributor of course had no claim to the title with which he was thus decoratedfor ive a daughter living with him and i want to see her ive just got home from a two years voyage andthere was a struggle of the adamsapple in the mans gaunt throati find shes about all there is left of my family  how complex is every human motive this contributor had been lately thinking whenever he turned the pages of some foolish travellersome empty prattler of southern or eastern lands where all sensation was long ago exhausted and the oxygen has perished from every sentiment so has it been breathed and breathed againthat nowadays the wise adventurer sat down beside his own register and waited for incidents to seek him out it seemed to him that the cultivation of a patient and receptive spirit was the sole condition needed to insure the occurrence of all manner of surprising facts within the range of ones own personal knowledge that not only the greeks were at our doors but the fairies and the genii and all the people of romance who had but to be hospitably treated in order to develop the deepest interest of fiction and to become the characters of plots so ingenious that the most cunning invention were poor beside them i myself am not so confident of this and would rather trust mr charles reade say for my amusement than any chance combination of events but i should be afraid to say how much his pride in the character of the strangers sorrows as proof of the correctness of his theory prevailed with the contributor to ask him to come in and sit down though i hope that some abstract impulse of humanity some compassionate and unselfish care for the mans misfortunes as misfortunes was not wholly wanting indeed the helpless simplicity with which he had confided his case might have touched a harder heart thank you said the poor fellow after a moments hesitation i believe i will come in ive been on foot all day and after such a long voyage it makes a man dreadfully sore to walk about so much perhaps you can think of a mr hapford living somewhere in the neighborhood  he sat down and after a pondering silence in which he had remained with his head fallen upon his breast my name is jonathan tinker he said with the unaffected air which had already impressed the contributor and as if he felt that some form of introduction was necessary and the girl that i want to find is julia tinker then he added resuming the eventful personal history which the listener exulted while he regretted to hear you see i shipped first to liverpool and there i heard from my family and then i shipped again for hongkong and after that i never heard a word i seemed to miss the letters everywhere this morning at four oclock i left my ship as soon as she had hauled into the dock and hurried up home the house was shut and not a soul in it and i didnt know what to do and i sat down on the doorstep to wait till the neighbors woke up to ask them what had become of my family and the first one come out he told me my wife had been dead a year and a half and the baby id never seen with her and one of my boys was dead and he didnt know where the rest of the children was but hed heard two of the little ones was with a family in the city  the man mentioned these things with the halfapologetic air observable in a certain kind of americans when some accident obliges them to confess the infirmity of the natural feelings they do not ask your sympathy and you offer it quite at your own risk with a chance of having it thrown back upon your hands the contributor assumed the risk so far as to say pretty rough when the stranger caused and perhaps these homely words were best suited to reach the homely heart the mans quavering lips closed hard again a kind of spasm passed over his dark face and then two very small drops of brine shone upon his weatherworn cheeks this demonstration into which he had been surprised seemed to stand for the passion of tears into which the emotional races fall at such times he opened his lips with a kind of dry click and went on  i hunted about the whole forenoon in the city and at last i found the children id been gone so long they didnt know me and somehow i thought the people they were with werent overglad id turned up finally the oldest child told me that julia was living with a mr hapford on this street and i started out here tonight to look her up if i can find her im all right i can get the family together then and start new  it seems rather odd mused the listener aloud that the neighbors let them break up so and that they should all scatter as they did  well it aint so curious as it seems capn there was money for them at the owners all the time id left part of my wages when i sailed but they didnt know how to get at it and what could a parcel of children do julias a good girl and when i find her im all right  the writer could only repeat that there was no mr hapford living on that street and never had been so far as he knew yet there might be such a person in the neighborhood and they would go out together and ask at some of the houses about but the stranger must first take a glass of wine for he looked used up  the sailor awkwardly but civilly enough protested that he did not want to give so much trouble but took the glass and as he put it to his lips said formally as if it were a toast or a kind of grace i hope i may have the opportunity of returning the compliment the contributor thanked him though as he thought of all the circumstances of the case and considered the cost at which the stranger had come to enjoy his politeness he felt little eagerness to secure the return of the compliment at the same price and added with the consequence of another set phrase not at all but the thought had made him the more anxious to befriend the luckless soul fortune had cast in his way and so the two sallied out together and rang doorbells wherever lights were still seen burning in the windows and asked the astonished people who answered their summons whether any mr hapford were known to live in the neighborhood  and although the search for this gentleman proved vain the contributor could not feel that an expedition which set familiar objects in such novel light was altogether a failure he entered so intimately into the cares and anxieties of his protege that at times he felt himself in some inexplicable sort a shipmate of jonathan tinker and almost personally a partner of his calamities the estrangement of all things which takes place within doors and without about midnight may have helped to cast this doubt upon his identityhe seemed to be visiting now for the first time the streets and neighborhoods nearest his own and his feet stumbled over the accustomed walks in his quality of houseless wanderer andso far as appeared to otherspossibly worthless vagabond he also got a new and instructive effect upon the faces which in his real character he knew so well by their looks of neighborly greeting and it is his belief that the first hospitable prompting of the human heart is to shut the door in the eyes of homeless strangers who present themselves after eleven oclock by that time the servants are all abed and the gentleman of the house answers the bell and looks out with a loath and bewildered face which gradually changes to one of suspicion and of wonder as to what those fellows can possibly want of him till at last the prevailing expression is one of contrite desire to atone for the first reluctance by any sort of service the contributor professes to have observed these changing phases in the visages of those whom he that night called from their dreams or arrested in the act of going to bed and he drew the conclusionvery proper for his imaginable connection with the garroting and other adventurous brotherhoodsthat the most flattering moment for knocking on the head people who answer a late ring at night is either in their first selfish bewilderment or their final selfabandonment to their better impulses it does not seem to have occurred to him that he would himself have been a much more favorable subject for the predatory arts that any of his neighbors if his shipmate the unknown companion of his researches for mr hapford had been at all so minded but the faith of the gaunt giant upon which he reposed was good and the contributor continued to wander about with him in perfect safety not a soul among those they asked had ever heard of a mr hapfordfar less of a julia tinker living with him but they all listened to the contributors explanation with interest and eventual sympathy and in truthbriefly told with a word now and then thrown in by jonathan tinker who kept at the bottom of the steps showing like a gloomy spectre in the night or in his grotesque length and gauntness like the others shadow cast there by the lamplightit was a story which could hardly fail to awaken pity  at last after ringing several bells where there were no lights in the mere wantonness of goodwill and going away before they could be answered it would be entertaining to know what dreams they caused the sleepers within there seemed to be nothing for it but to give up the search till morning and go to the main street and wait for the last horsecar to the city  there seated upon the curbstone jonathan tinker being plied with a few leading questions told in hints and scraps the story of his hard life which was at present that of a second mate and had been that of a cabin boy and of a seaman before the mast the second mates place he held to be the hardest aboard ship you got only a few dollars more than the men and you did not rank with the officers you took your meals alone and in every thing you belonged by yourself the men did not respect you and sometimes the captain abused you awfully before the passengers the hardest captain that jonathan tinker ever sailed with was captain gooding of the cape it had got to be so that no man would ship second mate under captain gooding and jonathan tinker was with him only one voyage when he had been home awhile he saw an advertisement for a second mate and he went round to the owners they had kept it secret who the captain was but there was captain gooding in the owners office why heres the man now that i want for a second mate said he when jonathan tinker entered he knows mecaptain gooding i know you most too well to want to sail under you answered jonathan i might go if i hadnt been with you one voyage too many already  and then the men said jonathan the men coming aboard drunk and having to be pounded sober and the hardest of the fight falls on the second mate why there isnt an inch of me that hasnt been cut over or smashed into a jell ive had three ribs broken ive got a scar from a knife on my cheek and ive been stabbed bad enough half a dozen times to lay me up  here he gave a sort of desperate laugh as if the notion of so much misery and such various mutilation were too grotesque not to be amusing well what can you do he went on if you dont strike the men think youre afraid of them and so you have to begin hard and go on hard i always tell a man now my man i always begin with a man the way i mean to keep on you do your duty and youre all right but if you dontwell the men aint americans any moredutch spaniards chinese portugueeand it aint like abusing a white man  jonathan tinker was plainly part of the horrible tyranny which we all know exists on shipboard and his listener respected him the more that though he had heart enough to be ashamed of it he was too honest not to own it  why did he still follow the sea because he did not know what else to do when he was younger he used to love it but now he hated it yet there was not a prettier life in the world if you got to be captain he used to hope for that once but not now though he thought he could navigate a ship only let him get his family together again and he would yes he wouldtry to do something ashore  no car had yet come in sight and so the contributor suggested that they should walk to the caroffice and look in the directory which is kept there for the name of hapford in search of whom it had already been arranged that they should renew their acquaintance on the morrow jonathan tinker when they had reached the office heard with constitutional phlegm that the name of the hapford for whom he inquired was not in the directory never mind said the other come round to my house in the morning well find him yet so they parted with a shake of the hand the second mate saying that he believed he should go down to the vessel and sleep aboardif he could sleepand murmuring at the last moment the hope of returning the compliment while the other walked homeward weary as to the flesh but in spite of his sympathy for jonathan tinker very elate in spirit the truth isand however disgraceful to human nature let the truth still be toldhe had recurred to his primal satisfaction in the man as calamity capable of being used for such and such literary ends and while he pitied him rejoiced in him as an episode of real life quite as striking and complete as anything in fiction it was literature made to his hand nothing could be better he mused and once more he passed the details of the story in review and beheld all those pictures which the poor fellows artless words had so vividly conjured up he saw him leaping ashore in the gray summer dawn as soon as the ship hauled into the dock and making his way with his vague sealegs unaccustomed to the pavements up through the silent and empty city streets he imagined the tumult of fear and hope which the sight of the mans home must have caused in him and the benumbing shock of finding it blind and deaf to all his appeals he saw him sitting down upon what had been his own threshold and waiting in a sort of bewildered patience till the neighbors should be awake while the noises of the streets gradually arose and the wheels began to rattle over the stones and the milkman and the iceman came and went and the waiting figure began to be stared at and to challenge the curiosity of the passing policeman he fancied the opening of the neighbors door and the slow cold understanding of the case the manner whatever it was in which the sailor was told that one year before his wife had died with her babe and that his children were scattered none knew where as the contributor dwelt pityingly upon these things but at the same time estimated their aesthetic value one by one he drew near the head of his street and found himself a few paces behind a boy slouching onward through the night to whom he called out adventurously and with no real hope of information  do you happen to know anybody on this street by the name of hapford  why no not in this town said the boy but he added that there was a street of the same name in a neighboring suburb and that there was a hapford living on it  by jove thought the contributor this is more like literature than ever and he hardly knew whether to be more provoked at his own stupidity in not thinking of a street of the same name in the next village or delighted at the element of fatality which the fact introduced into the story for tinker according to his own account must have landed from the cars a few rods from the very door he was seeking and so walked farther and farther from it every moment he thought the case so curious that he laid it briefly before the boy who however he might have been inwardly affected was sufficiently true to the national traditions not to make the smallest conceivable outward sign of concern in it  at home however the contributor related his adventures and the story of tinkers life adding the fact that he had just found out where mr hapford lived it was the only touch wanting said he the whole thing is now perfect  its too perfect was answered from a sad enthusiasm dont speak of it i cant take it in  but the question is said the contributor penitently taking himself to task for forgetting the hero of these excellent misfortunes in his delight at their perfection how am i to sleep tonight thinking of that poor souls suspense and uncertainty never mindill be up early and run over and make sure that it is tinkers hapford before he gets out here and have a pleasant surprise for him would it not be a justifiable coup de théâtre to fetch his daughter here and let her answer his ring at the door when he comes in the morning  this plan was discouraged no no let them meet in their own way just take him to hapfords house and leave him  very well but hes too good a character to lose sight of hes got to come back here and tell us what he intends to do  the birds next morning not having had the second mate on their minds either as an unhappy man or a most fortunate episode but having slept long and soundly were singing in a very sprightly way in the wayside trees and the sweetness of their notes made the contributors heart light as he climbed the hill and rang at mr hapfords door  the door was opened by a young girl of fifteen or sixteen whom he knew at a glance for the second mates daughter but of whom for forms sake he asked if there were a girl named julia tinker living there  my names julia tinker answered the maid who had rather a disappointing face  well said the contributor your fathers got back from his hongkong voyage  hongkong voyage echoed the girl with a stare of helpless inquiry but no other visible emotion  yes he had never heard of your mothers death he came home yesterday morning and was looking for you all day  julia tinker remained openmouthed but mute and the other was puzzled at the want of feeling shown which he could not account for even as a national trait perhaps theres some mistake he said  there must be answered julia my father hasnt been to sea for a good many years my father she added with a diffidence indescribably mingled with a sense of distinctionmy fathers in states prison what kind of looking man was this  the contributor mechanically described him  julia tinker broke into a loud hoarse laugh yes its him sure enough and then as if the joke were too good to keep miss hapford miss hapford fathers got out do come here she called into a back room  when mrs hapford appeared julia fell back and having deftly caught a fly on the doorpost occupied herself in plucking it to pieces while she listened to the conversation of the others  its all true enough said mrs hapford when the writer had recounted the moving story of jonathan tinker so far as the death of his wife and baby goes but he hasnt been to sea for a good many years and he must have just come out of states prison where he was put for bigamy theres always two sides to a story you know but they say it broke his first wifes heart and she died his friends dont want him to find his children and this girl especially  hes found his children in the city said the contributor gloomily being at a loss what to do or say in view of the wreck of his romance  o hes found em has he cried julia with heightened amusement then hell have me next if i dont pack and go  im very very sorry said the contributor secretly resolved never to do another good deed no matter how temptingly the opportunity presented itself but you may depend he wont find out from me where you are of course i had no earthly reason for supposing his story was not true  of course said kindhearted mrs hapford mingling a drop of honey with the gall in the contributors soul you only did your duty  and indeed as he turned away he did not feel altogether without compensation however jonathan tinker had fallen in his esteem as a man he had even risen as literature the episode which had appeared so perfect in its pathetic phases did not seem less finished as a farce and this person to whom all things of everyday life presented themselves in periods more or less rounded and capable of use as facts or illustrations could not but rejoice in these new incidents as dramatically fashioned as the rest it occurred to him that wrought into a story even better use might be made of the facts now than before for they had developed questions of character and of human nature which could not fail to interest the more he pondered upon his acquaintance with jonathan tinker the more fascinating the erring mariner became in his complex truth and falsehood his delicately blending shades of artifice and naïveté he must it was felt have believed to a certain point in his own inventions nay starting with that groundwork of truththe fact that his wife was really dead and that he had not seen his family for two yearswhy should he not place implicit faith in all the fictions reared upon it it was probable that he felt a real sorrow for her loss and that he found a fantastic consolation in depicting the circumstances of her death so that they should look like his inevitable misfortunes rather than his faults he might well have repented his offense during those two years of prison and why should he not now cast their dreariness and shame out of his memory and replace them with the freedom and adventure of a two years voyage to chinaso probable in all respects that the fact should appear an impossible nightmare in the experiences of his life he had abundant material to furnish forth the facts of such a voyage and in the weariness and lassitude that should follow a days walking equally after a two years voyage and two years imprisonment he had as much physical proof in favor of one hypothesis as the other it was doubtless true also as he said that he had gone to his house at dawn and sat down on the threshold of his ruined home and perhaps he felt the desire he had expressed to see his daughter with a purpose of beginning life anew and it may have cost him a veritable pang when he found that his little ones did not know him all the sentiments of the situation were such as might persuade a lively fancy of the truth of its own inventions and as he heard these continually repeated by the contributor in their search for mr hapford they must have acquired an objective force and repute scarcely to be resisted at the same time there were touches of nature throughout jonathan tinkers narrative which could not fail to take the faith of another the contributor in reviewing it thought it particularly charming that his mariner had not overdrawn himself or attempted to paint his character otherwise than as it probably was that he had shown his ideas and practices of life to be those of a second mate nor more nor less without the gloss of regret or the pretenses to refinement that might be pleasing to the supposed philanthropist with whom he had fallen in captain gooding was of course a true portrait and there was nothing in jonathan tinkers statement of the relations of a second mate to his superiors and his inferiors which did not agree perfectly with what the contributor had just read in two years before the masta book which had possibly cast its glamour upon the adventure he admired also the just and perfectly characteristic air of grief in the bereaved husband and fatherthose occasional escapes from the sense of loss into a brief hilarity and forgetfulness and those relapses into the hovering gloom which every one has observed in this poor crazy human nature when oppressed by sorrow and which it would have been hard to simulate but above all he exulted in that supreme stroke of the imagination given by the second mate when at parting he said he believed he would go down and sleep on board the vessel in view of this the states prison theory almost appeared a malign and foolish scandal  yet even if this theory were correct was the second mate wholly answerable for beginning his life again with the imposture he had practiced the contributor had either so fallen in love with the literary advantages of his forlorn deceiver that he would see no moral obliquity in him or he had touched a subtler verity at last in pondering the affair it seemed now no longer a farce but had a pathos which though very different from that of its first aspect was hardly less tragical knowing with what coldness or at the best uncandor he representing society in its attitude toward convicted error would have met the fact had it been owned to him at first he had not virtue enough to condemn the illusory stranger who must have been helpless to make at once evident any repentance he felt or good purpose he cherished was it not one of the saddest consequences of the mans pasta dark necessity of misdoing that even with the best will in the world to retrieve himself his first endeavor must involve a wrong might he not indeed be considered a martyr in some sort to his own admirable impulses i can see clearly enough where the contributor was astray in this reasoning but i can also understand how one accustomed to value realities only as they resembled fables should be won with such pensive sophistry and i can certainly sympathize with his feeling that the mariners failure to reappear according to appointment added its final and most agreeable charm to the whole affair and completed the mystery from which the man emerged and which swallowed him up again     scene   on that loveliest autumn morning the swollen tide had spread over all the russet levels and gleamed in the sunlight a mile away as the contributor moved onward down the street luminous on either hand with crimsoning and yellowing maples he was so filled with the tender serenity of the scene as not to be troubled by the spectacle of small irish houses standing miserably about on the flats ankle deep as it were in little pools of the tide or to be aware at first of a strange stir of people upon the streets a fluttering to and fro and lively encounter and separation of groups of bareheaded women a flying of children through the broken fences of the neighborhood and across the vacant lots on which the insulted signboards forbade them to trespass a sluggish movement of men through all and a pause of different vehicles along the sidewalks when a sense of these facts had penetrated his enjoyment he asked a matron whose snowy arms freshly taken from the washtub were folded across a mighty chest what is the matter  a girl drowned herself sirrr over there on the flats last saturday and theyre looking for her  it was the best thing she could do said another matron grimly  upon this answer that literary soul fell at once to patching himself up a romantic story for the suicide after the pitiful fashion of this fiction ridden age when we must relate everything we see to something we have read he was the less to blame for it because he could not help it but certainly he is not to be praised for his associations with the tragic fact brought to his notice nothing could have been more trite or obvious and he felt his intellectual poverty so keenly that he might almost have believed his discomfort a sympathy for the girl who had drowned herself last saturday but of course this could not be for he had but lately been thinking what a very tiresome figure to the imagination the fallen woman had become as a fact of christian civilization she was a spectacle to wring ones heart he owned but he wished she were well out of the romances and it really seemed a fatality that she should be the principal personage of this little scene the preparation for it whatever it was to be was so deliberate and the reality had so slight relation to the french roofs and modern improvements of the comfortable charlesbridge which he knew that he could not consider himself other than as a spectator awaiting some entertainment with a faint inclination to be critical  in the mean time there passed through the motley crowd not so much a cry as a sensation of theyve found her theyve found her and then the one terrible picturesque fact she was standing upright  upon this there was wilder and wilder clamor among the people dropping by degrees and almost dying away before a flight of boys came down the street with the tidings they are bringing herbringing her in a wagon  the contributor knew that she whom they were bringing in the wagon had had the poetry of love to her dismal and otherwise squalid death but the history was of fancy not of fact in his mind of course he reflected her lot must have been obscure and hard the aspect of those concerned about her death implied that but of her hopes and her fears who could tell him anything to be sure he could imagine the lovers and how they first met and where and who he was that was doomed to work her shame and death but here his fancy came upon something coarse and common a man of her own race and grade handsome after that manner of beauty which is so much more hateful than ugliness is or worse still another kind of man whose deceit must have been subtler and wickeder but whatever the person a presence defiant of sympathy or even interest and simply horrible then there were the details of the affair in great degree common to all love affairs and not varying so widely in any condition of life for the passion which is so rich and infinite to those within its charm is apt to seem a little tedious and monotonous in its character and poor in resources to the cold lookeron  then finally there was the crazy purpose and its fulfillment the headlong plunge from bank or bridge the eddy and the bubbles on the current that calmed itself above the suicide the tide that rose and stretched itself abroad in the sunshine carrying hither and thither the burden with which it knew not what to do the arrest as by some ghastly caprice of fate of the dead girl in that upright posture in which she should meet the quest for her as it were defiantly  and now they were bringing her in a wagon  involuntarily all stood aside and waited till the funeral car which they saw should come up toward them through the long vista of the mapleshaded street a noiseless riot stirring the legs and arms of the boys into frantic demonstration while the women remained quiet with arms folded or akimbo before and behind the wagon driven slowly went a guard of ragged urchins while on the raised seat above sat two americans unperturbed by anything and concerned merely with the business of the affair  the vehicle was a grocers cart which had perhaps been pressed into the service and inevitably the contributor thought of zenobia and of miles coverdales belief that if she could have foreboded all the post mortem ugliness and grotesqueness of suicide she never would have drowned herself this girl too had doubtless had her own ideas of the effect that her death was to make her conviction that it was to wring one heart at least and to strike awe and pity to every other and her womans soul must have been shocked from death could she have known in what a ghastly comedy the body she put off was to play a part  in the bottom of the cart lay something long and straight and terrible covered with a red shawl that drooped over the end of the wagon and on this thing were piled the baskets in which the grocers had delivered their orders for sugar and flour and coffee and tea as the cart jolted through their lines the boys could no longer be restrained they broke out with wild yells and danced madly about it while the red shawl hanging from the rigid feet nodded to their frantic mirth and the sun dropped its light through the maples and shone bright upon the flooded date     jubilee days   i believe i have no good reason for including among these suburban sketches my recollections of the peace jubilee celebrated by a monster musical entertainment at boston in june 1869 and i do not know if it will serve as excuse for their intrusion to say that the exhibition was not urban in character and that i attended it in a feeling of curiosity and amusement which the bostonians did not seem to feel and which i suspect was a strictly suburban if not rural sentiment  i thought on that tuesday morning as our horsecar drew near the long bridge and we saw the coliseum spectral through the rain that boston was going to show people representing other parts of the country her notion of weather i looked forward to a forenoon of clammy warmth and an afternoon of clammy cold and of east wind with a misty nightfall soaking men to the bones but the day really turned out well enough it was showery but not shrewish and it smiled pleasantly at sunset as if content with the opening ceremonies of the great peace jubilee  the city as we entered it gave due token of excitement and we felt the celebration even in the air which had a holiday quality very different from that of ordinary workday air the crowds filled the decorous streets and the trim pathways of the common and the public garden and flowed in an orderly course towards the vast edifice on the back bay presenting the interesting points which always distinguish a crowd come to town from a city crowd you get so used to the boston face and the boston dress that a coat from new york or a visage from chicago is at once conspicuous to you and in these people there was not only this strangeness but the different oddities that lurk in outofway corners of society everywhere had started suddenly into notice longhaired men popularly supposed to have perished with the institution of slavery appeared before me and men with various causes and manias looking from their wild eyes confronted each other let alone such charlatans as had clothed themselves quaintly or grotesquely to add a charm to the virtue of whatever nostrum they peddled it was however for the most part a remarkably welldressed crowd and therein it probably differed more than in any other respect from the crowd which a holiday would have assembled in former times there was little rusticity to be noted anywhere and the uncouthness which has already disappeared from the national face seemed to be passing from the national wardrobe nearly all the visitors seemed to be americans but neither the yankee type nor the hoosier was to be found they were apparently very happy too the ancestral solemnity of the race that amuses itself sadly was not to be seen in them and if they were not making it a duty to be gay they were really taking their pleasure in a cheerful spirit  there was in fact something in the sight of the coliseum as we approached it which was a sufficient cause of elation to whoever is buoyed up by the flutter of bright flags and the movement in and about holiday booths as i think we all are apt to be one may not have the stomach of happier days for the swing or the whirligig he may not drink sodawater intemperately popcorn may not tempt him nor tropical fruits allure but he beholds them without gloomnay a grin inevitably lights up his countenance at the sight of a great show of these amusements and refreshments and any bostonian might have felt proud that morning that his city did not hide the light of her mercantile merit under a bushel but blazoned it about on the booths and walls in every variety of printed and painted advertisement to the mere aesthetic observer these vast placards gave the delight of brilliant color and blended prettily enough in effect with the flags and at first glance i received quite as much pleasure from the frescoes that advised me where to buy my summer clothing as from any bunting i saw  i had the good fortune on the morning of this first jubilee day to view the interior of the coliseum when there was scarcely anybody therea trifle of ten thousand singers at one end and a few thousand other people scattered about over the wide expanses of parquet and galleries the decorations within as without were a pleasure to the eyes that love gayety of color and the interior was certainly magnificent with those long lines of white and blue drapery roofing the balconies the slim lofty columns festooned with flags and drooping banners the arms of the states decking the fronts of the galleries and the arabesques of painted muslin everywhere i do not know that my taste concerned itself with the decorations or that i have any taste in such things but i testify that these tints and draperies gave no small part of the comfort of being where all things conspired for ones pleasure the airy amplitude of the building the perfect order and the perfect freedom of movement the ease of access and exit the completeness of the arrangements that in the afternoon gave all of us thirty thousand spectators a chance to behold the great spectacle as well as to hear the music were felt i am sure as personal favors by every one these minor particulars in fact served greatly to assist you in identifying yourself when the vast hive swarmed with humanity and you became a mere sentient atom of the mass  it was rumored in the morning that the ceremonies were to begin with prayer by a hundred ministers but i missed this striking feature of the exhibition for i did not arrive in the afternoon till the last speech was being made by a gentleman whom i saw gesticulating effectively and whom i suppose to have been intelligible to a matter of twenty thousand people in his vicinity but who was to me of the remote outlying thirty thousand a voice merely one word only i caught and i report it here that posterity may know as much as we thirty thousand contemporaries did of  the presidents speech         sensation           cheers    refinement           great applause  i do not know if i shall be able to give an idea of the immensity of this scene but if such a reader as has the dimensions of the coliseum accurately fixed in his mind will in imagination densely hide all that interminable array of benching in the parquet and the galleries and the slopes at either end of the edifice with human heads showing here crowns there occiputs and yonder faces he will perhaps have some notion of the spectacle as we beheld it from the northern hillside some thousands of heads nearest were recognizable as attached by the usual neck to the customary human body but for the rest we seemed to have entered a world of cherubim especially did the multitudinous singers seated far opposite encourage this illusion and their fluttering fans and handkerchiefs wonderfully mocked the movement of those cravatlike pinions which the fancy attributed to them they rose or sank at the wave of the directors baton and still looked like an innumerable flock of cherubs drifting over some slope of paradise or settling upon itif cherubs can settle  illustration the spectacle as we beheld it  the immensity was quite as striking to the mind as to the eye and an absolute democracy was appreciable in it not only did all artificial distinctions cease but those of nature were practically obliterated and you felt for once the full meaning of unanimity no one was at a disadvantage one was as wise as good as handsome as another in most public assemblages the foolish eye roves in search of the vanity of female beauty and rests upon some lovely visage or pretty figure but here it seemed to matter nothing whether ladies were well or illlooking and one might have been perfectly ascetic without selfdenial a blue eye or a blackwhat of it a mass of blonde or chestnut hair this sort of walkingdress or thatyou might note the difference casually in a few hundred around you but a sense of those myriads of other eyes and chignons and walkingdresses absorbed the impression in an instant and left a dim strange sense of loss as if all women had suddenly become woman for the time one would have been preposterously conceited to have felt his littleness in that crowd you never thought of yourself in an individual capacity at all it was as if you were a private in an army or a very ordinary billow of the sea feeling the battle or the storm in a collective sort of way but unable to distinguish your sensations from those of the mass if a rafter had fallen and crushed you and your unimportant row of people you could scarcely have regarded it as a personal calamity but might have found it disagreeable as a shock to that great body of humanity recall then how astonished you were to be recognized by some one and to have your hand shaken in your individual character of smith smith my dear whatsyourname i am for the present the fiftythousandth part of an enormous emotion  it was as difficult to distribute the various facts of the whole effect as to identify ones self i had only a public and general consciousness of the delight given by the harmony of hues in the parquet below and concerning the orchestra i had at first no distinct impression save of the three hundred and thirty violinbows held erect like standing wheat at one motion of the directors wand and then falling as if with the next he swept them down afterwards files of men with horns and other files of men with drums and cymbals discovered themselves while far above all certain laborious figures pumped or ground with incessant obeisance at the apparatus supplying the organ with wind  what helped more than anything else to restore you your dispersed and wandering individuality was the singing of pareparosa as she triumphed over the harmonious rivalry of the orchestra there was something in the generous amplitude and robust cheerfulness of this great artist that accorded well with the ideal of the occasion she was in herself a great musical festival and one felt as she floated down the stage with her farspreading white draperies and swept the audience a colossal courtesy that here was the embodied genius of the jubilee i do not trust myself to speak particularly of her singing for i have the natural modesty of people who know nothing about music and i have not at command the phraseology of those who pretend to understand it but i say that her voice filled the whole edifice with delicious melody that it soothed and composed and utterly enchanted that though two hundred violins accompanied her the greater sweetness of her note prevailed over all like a mighty will commanding many what a sublime ovation for her when a hundred thousand hands thundered their acclaim a victorious general an accepted lover a successful young authorthese know a measure of bliss i dare say but in one throb the singers heart as it leaps in exultation at the loud delight of her applausive thousands must outenjoy them all let me lay these poor little artificial flowers of rhetoric at the feet of the divine singer as a faint token of gratitude and eloquent intention  when parepa or prepper as i have heard her name popularly pronounced had sung the revived consciousness of an individual life rose in rebellion against the oppression of that dominant vastness in fact human nature can stand only so much of any one thing to a certain degree you accept and conceive of facts truthfully but beyond this a mere fantasticality rules and having got enough of grandeur the senses played themselves false that array of fluttering and tuning people on the southern slope began to look minute like the myriad heads assembled in the infinitesimal photograph which you view through one of those little halfinch lorgnettes and you had the satisfaction of knowing that to any lovely infinitesimality yonder you showed no bigger than a carpettack the whole performance now seemed to be worked by those tireless figures pumping at the organ in obedience to signals from a very alert figure on the platform below the choral and orchestral thousands sang and piped and played and at a given point in the scena from verdi a hundred fairies in red shirts marched down through the sombre mass of puppets and beat upon as many invisible anvils  this was the stroke of anticlimax and the droll sound of those anvils so far above all the voices and instruments in its pitch thoroughly disillusioned you and restored you finally to your proper entity and proportions it was the great error of the great jubilee and where almost everything else was noble and impressivewhere the direction was faultless and the singing and instrumentation as perfectly controlled as if they were the result of one volitionthis anvilbeating was alone ignoble and discordanttrivial and huge merely not even the artillery accompaniment in which the cannon were made to pronounce words of two syllables was so bad  the dimensions of this sketch bear so little proportion to those of the jubilee that i must perforce leave most of its features unnoticed but i wish to express the sense of enjoyment which prevailed whenever the anvils were not beaten over every other feeling even over wonder to the ear as to the eye it was a delight and it was an assured success in the popular affections from the performance of the first piece for my own part if one pleasurable sensation besides that received from parepas singing distinguished itself from the rest it was that given by the performance of the exquisite coronation march from meyerbeers prophet but i say this under protest of the pleasure taken in the choral rendering of the starspangled banner closely allying themselves to these great raptures were the minor joys of wandering freely about from point to point of receiving fresh sensations from the varying lights and aspects in which the novel scene presented itself with its strange fascinations and of noting half consciously the incessant movement of the crowd as it revealed itself in changing effects of color then the gay tumult of the fifteen minutes of intermission between the parts when all rose with a susurrus of innumerable silks and the thousands of pretty singers fluttered about and gossiped tremulously and delightedly over the glory of the performance revealing themselves as charming feminine personalities each with her share in the difficulty and the achievement each with her pique or pride and each her something to tell her friend of the conduct agreeable or displeasing of some particular him even the quick dispersion of the mass at the close was a marvel of orderliness and grace as the melting and separating parts falling asunder radiated from the centre and flowed and rippled rapidly away and left the great hall empty and bare at last  and as you emerged from the building what bizarre and perverse feeling was that you knew something as if alloutdoors were cramped and small and it were better to return to the freedom and amplitude of the interior  on the second day much that was wonderful in a first experience of the festival was gone but though the novelty had passed away the cause for wonder was even greater if on the first day the crowd was immense it was now something which the imperfect state of the language will not permit me to describe perhaps awful will serve the purpose as well as any other word now in use as you looked round from the centre of the building on that restless fanning fluttering multitude to right and left and north and south all comparisons and similitudes abandoned you if you were to write of the scene you felt that your effort at the best must be a meagre sketch suggesting something to those who had seen the fact but conveying no intelligible impression of it to any one else the galleries swarmed the vast slopes were packed in the pampalike parquet even the aisles were half filled with chairs while a cloud of placeless wanderers moved ceaselessly on the borders of the mass under the balconies  when that commonlooking uncommon little man whom we have called to rule over us entered the house and walked quietly down to his seat in the centre of it a wild inarticulate clamor like no other noise in the world swelled from every side till general grant rose and showed himself when it grew louder than ever and then gradully subsided into silence then a voice which might be uttering some mortal alarm broke repeatedly across the stillness from one of the balconies and a thousand glasses were leveled in that direction while everywhere else the mass hushed itself with a mute sense of peril the capacity of such an assemblage for selfdestruction was in fact but too evident from fire in an edifice of which the sides could be knocked out in a moment there could have been little danger the fabrics strength had been perfectly tested the day before and its fall was not to be apprehended but we had ourselves greatly to dread a panic could have been caused by any mad or wanton person in which thousands might have been instantly trampled to death and it seemed long till that foolish voice was stilled and the house lapsed back into tranquillity and the enjoyment of the music in the performance i recall nothing disagreeable nothing that to my ignorance seemed imperfect though i leave it to the wise in music to say how far the great concert was a success i saw a flourish of the directors wand and i heard the voices or the instruments or both respond and i knew by my programme that i was enjoying an unprecedented quantity of haydn or handel or meyerbeer or rossini or mozart afforded with an unquestionable precision and promptness but i own that i liked better to stroll about the threeacre house and that for me the music was at best only one of the joys of the festival  there was good hearing outside for those that desired to listen to the music with seats to let in the surrounding tents and booths and there was unlimited seeing for the mere lookeron at least fifty thousand people seemed to have come to the jubilee with no other purpose than to gaze upon the outside of the building the crowd was incomparably greater than that of the day before all the main thoroughfares of the city roared with a tide of feet that swept through the side streets and swelled aimlessly up the places and eddied there and poured out again over the pavements the carriageways were packed with every sort of vehicle with footpassengers crowded from the sidewalks and with the fragments of the military parade in honor of the president with infantry with straggling cavalrymen with artillery all the paths of the common and the garden were filled and near the coliseum the throngs densified on every side into an almost impenetrable mass that made the doors of the building difficult to approach and at times inaccessible  the crowd differed from that of the first day chiefly in size there were more country faces and country garbs to be seen though it was still on the whole a regularfeatured and welldressed crowd with still very few but american visages it seemed to be also a very frugalminded crowd and to spend little upon the refreshments and amusements provided for it in these oddly enough there was nothing of the march of mind to be observed they were the refreshments and amusements of a former generation i think it would not be extravagant to say that there were tons of pie for sale in a multitude of booths with lemonade sodawater and icecream in proportion but i doubt if there was a ton of pie sold and towards the last the venerable pastry was quite covered with dust neither did people seem to care much for oranges or bananas or peanuts or even popcornfive cents a package and a prize in each package many booths stood unlet and in others the pulverous ladies and gentlemen their proprietors were in the enjoyment of a leisure which would have been elegant if it had not been forced there was one shanty not otherwise distinguished from the rest in which french soups were declared to be for sale but these alien pottages seemed to be no more favored than the most poisonous of our national viands but perhaps they were not french soups or perhaps the vicinage of the shanty was not such as to impress a belief in their genuineness upon people who like french soups let us not be too easily disheartened by the popular neglect of them if the daring reformer who inscribed french soups upon his sign will reappear ten years hence we shall all flock to his standard slavery is abolished pie must follow doubtless in the year 1900 the managers of a jubilee would even let the refreshmentrooms within their coliseum to a cook who would offer the public something not so much worse than the worst that could be found in the vilest shanty restaurant on the ground at the jubilee of which i am writing the unhappy person who went into the coliseum rooms to refresh himself was offered for coffee a salty and unctuous wash in one of those thick cups which are supposed to be proof against the hard usage of guests and scullions in humble eatinghouses and which are always so indescribably nicked and cracked and had pushed towards him a bowl of veteran sugar and a tin spoon that had never been cleaned in the world while a young person stood by and watched him asking have you paid for that coffee  the sideshows and the other amusements seemed to have addressed themselves to the crowd with the same mistaken notion of its character and requirements though i confess that i witnessed their neglect with regret whether from a feeling that they were at least harmless or an unconscious sympathy with any quite idle and unprofitable thing those rotary legless horses on which children love to ride in a perpetual sickening circle the type of all our effortwere nearly always mounted but those other whirligigs or whatever the dreadful circles with their swinging seats are called were often so empty that they must have been distressing from their want of balance to the muscles as well as the spirits of their proprietors the society of monsters was also generally shunned and a cow with five legs gave milk from the top of her back to an audience of not more than six persons the public apathy had visibly wrought upon the temper of the gentleman who lectured upon this gifted animal and he took inquiries in an ironical manner that contrasted disadvantageously with the philosophical serenity of the person who had a weighingmachine outside and whom i saw sitting in the chair and weighing himself by the hour with an expression of profound enjoyment perhaps a man of less bulk could not have entered so keenly into that simple pleasure  there was a large tent on the grounds for dramatical entertainments with six performances a day into which i was lured by a profusion of high colored posters and some such announcement as that the beautiful serio comic danseuse and worldrenowned cloggist mile brown would appear about a dozen people were assembled within and we waited a halfhour beyond the time announced for the curtain to rise during which the spectacle of a young man in black broadcloth eating a cocoanut with his penknife had a strange and painful fascination at the end of this half hour our number was increased to eighteen when the orchestra appeared a snaredrummer and two buglers these took their place at the back of the tent the buglers who were germans blew seriously and industriously at their horns but the nativeborn citizen who played the drum beat it very much at random and in the mean time smoked a cigar while his humorous friend kept time upon his shoulders by striking him there with a cane how long this might have lasted i cannot tell but after another delay i suddenly bethought me whether it were not better not to see mile brown after all i rose and stole softly out behind the rhythmic back of the drummer and the worldrenowned cloggist is to me at this moment only a beautiful dreaman airy shape fashioned upon a hint supplied by the engraver of the posters  what then did the public desire if it would not smile upon the swings or monsters or dramatic amusements that had pleased so long was the music as it floated out from the coliseum a sufficient delight or did the crowd averse to the shows provided for it crave something higher and more intellectuallike for example a course of the lowell lectures its general expression had changed it had no longer that entire gayety of the first day but had taken on something of the sarcastic pathos with which we americans bear most oppressive and fatiguing things as a good joke the dust was blown about in clouds and here and there sitting upon the vacant steps that led up and down among the booths were dejected and motionless men and women passively gathering dust and apparently awaiting burial under the accumulating sandthe mute melancholy sphinxes of the jubilee with their unsolved riddle why did we come at intervals the heavens shook out fierce sudden showers of rain that scattered the surging masses and sent them flying impotently hither and thither for shelter where no shelter was only to gather again and move aimlessly and comfortlessly to and fro like a lost child  so the multitude roared within and without the coliseum as i turned homeward and yet i found it wandering with weary feet through the garden and the common and all the streets and it dragged its innumerable aching legs with me to the railroad station and entering the train stood up on themhaving paid for the tickets with which the companies professed to sell seats  how still and cool and fresh it was at our suburban station when the train speeding away with a sardonic yell over the misery of the passengers yet standing up in it left us to walk across the quiet fields and pleasant lanes to benicia street through groups of little idyllic irish boys playing baseball with milchgoats here and there pastorally cropping the herbage  in this pleasant seclusion i let all bunker hill day thunder by with its cannons and processions and speeches and patriotic musical uproar hearing only through my open window the note of the birds singing in a leafy coliseum across the street and making very fair music without an anvil among them ah signer said one of my doorstep acquaintance who came next morning and played me captain jenksthe new air he has had added to his instrumentnever in my life neither at torino nor at milano nor even at genoa never did i see such a crowd or hear such a noise as at that colosseo yesterday the carriages the horses the feet and the dust o dio mio all those millions of people were as white as so many millers  on the afternoon of the fourth day the city looked quite like the mill in which these millers had been grinding and even those unpromisingly elegant streets of the back bay showed mansions powdered with dust enough for sentiment to strike root in and so soften them with its tender green against the time when they shall be ruinous and sentiment shall swallow them up the crowd had perceptibly diminished but it was still great and on the common it was allured by a greater variety of recreations and bargains than i had yet seen there there were of course all sorts of useful and instructive amusementsat least a halfdozen telescopes and as many galvanic batteries with numerous patented inventions and i fancied that most of the peddlers and charlatans addressed themselves to a utilitarian spirit supposed to exist in us a man that sold whistles capable of reproducing exactly the notes of the mockingbird and the guineapig set forth the durability of the invention now you see this whistle gentlemen it is rubber all rubber and rubber you know enters into the composition of a great many valuable articles this whistle then is entirely of rubberno worthless or flimsy material that drops to pieces the moment you put it to your lipsas if it were not utterly desirable that it should now ill give you the mockingbird gentlemen and then ill give you the guineapig upon this pure indiarubber whistle and he did so with a great animationthis young man with a perfectly intelligent and very handsome face try your strength and renovate your system cried the proprietor of a piston padded at one end and working into a cylinder when you struck it a blow with your fist and the owners of lungtesting machines called upon you from every side to try their consumption cure while the galvanicbattery men sat still and mutely appealed with inscriptions attached to their capvisors declaring that electricity taken from their batteries would rid you of every ache and pain known to suffering humanity yet they were themselves as a class in a state of sad physical disrepair and one of them was the visible prey of rheumatism which he might have sent flying from his joints with a single shock the only person whom i saw improving his health with the battery was a rosyfaced schoolboy who was taking ten cents worth of electricity and i hope it did not disagree with his popcorn and soda water  farther on was a picturesque group of streetmusiciansviolinists and harpers a brother and four sisters by their lookswho afforded almost the only unpractical amusement to be enjoyed on the common though not far from them was a blind old negro playing upon an accordion and singing to it in the faintest and thinnest of black voices who could hardly have profited any listener no one appeared to mind him till a jolly jacktar with both arms cut off but dressed in full sailors togs lurched heavily towards him this mariner had got quite a good effect of sealegs by some means and looked rather drunker than a man with both arms ought to be but he was very affectionate and putting his face close to the others at once entered into talk with the blind man forming with him a picture curiously pathetic and grotesque he was the only tipsy person i saw during the jubilee daysif he was tipsy for after all they may have been real sealegs he had on  if the throng upon the streets was thinner it was greater in the coliseum than on the second day and matters had settled there into regular working order the limits of individual liberty had been better ascertained there was no longer any movement in the aisles but a constant passing to and fro between the pieces in the promenades the house presented as before that appearance in which reality forsook it and it became merely an amazing picture the audience supported the notion of its unreality by having exactly the character of the former audiences and impressed you despite its restlessness and incessant agitation with the feeling that it had remained there from the first day and would always continue there and it was only in wandering upon its borders through the promenades that you regained possession of facts concerning it in no other way was its vastness more observable than in the perfect indifference of persons one to another each found himself as it were in a solitude and sequestered in that wilderness of strangers each was freed of his bashfulness and trepidation young people lounged at ease upon the floors about the windows on the upper promenades and in this seclusion i saw such betrayals of tenderness as melt the heart of the traveller on our desolate railway trainsfellows moving to and fro or standing careless of other eyes with their arms around the waists of their girls these were of course people who had only attained a certain grade of civilization and were not characteristic of the crowd or indeed worthy of notice except as expressions of its unconsciousness i fancied that i saw a number of their class outside listening to the address of the agent of a patent liniment proclaimed to be an unfailing specific for neuralgia and headacheif used in the right spirit for said the orator we like to cure people who treat us and our medicine with respect folks say what is there about that mansome magnetism or electricity and the other day at new britain connecticut a young man he come up to the carriage sneering like and he tried the cure and it didnt have the least effect upon him there seemed reason in this and it produced a visible sensation in the fellows and girls who grinned sheepishly at each other  why will the young man with long hair force himself at this point into a history which is striving to devote itself to graver interests there he stood with the other people gazing up at the gay line of streamers on the summit of the coliseum and taking in the anvil chorus with the resta young man wellenough dressed and of a pretty sensible face with his long black locks falling from under his cylinder hat and covering his shoulders what awful spell was on him obliging him to make that figure before his fellowcreatures he had nothing to sell he was not apparently an advertisement of any kind was he in the performance of a vow was he in his right mind for shame a person may wear his hair long if he will but why not then in a topknot this young mans long hair was not in keeping with his frockcoat and his cylinder hat and he had not at all the excuse of the old gentleman who sold salve in the costume of washingtons time one could not take pleasure in him as in the negro advertiser who paraded the grounds in a costume compounded of a consular chapeau bras and a foxhunters topbootsthe american diplomatic uniform of the futureand offered every one a printed billet he had not even the attraction of the cabalistic herald of hunkidori who was he what was he why was he the mind played forever around these questions in a maze of hopeless conjecture  had all those quacks and peddlers been bawling ever since tuesday to the same listeners had all those swings and whirligigs incessantly performed their rounds the cow that gave milk from the top of her back had she never changed her small circle of admirers or ceased her flow and the gentleman who sat in the chair of his own balance how much did he weigh by this time one could scarcely rid ones self of the illusion of perpetuity concerning these things and i could not believe that if i went back to the coliseum grounds at any future time i should not behold all that vast machinery in motion  it was curious to see amid this holiday turmoil men pursuing the ordinary business of their lives and one was strangely rescued and consoled by the spectacle of the irish hodcarriers and the bricklayers at work on a firstclass swellfront residence in the very heart of the city of tents and booths even the locomotive being associated with quieter days and scenes appealed as it whistled to and fro upon the providence railroad to some soft bucolic sentiment in the listener and sending its note ordinarily so discordant across that human uproar seemed to babble of green fields and at last it wooed us away and the jubilee was again swallowed up by night  there was yet another jubilee day on the morning of which the thousands of publicschool children clustered in gauzy pink and white in the place of the mighty chorus while the coliseum swarmed once more with people who listened to those shrill sweet pipes blending in unison but i leave the reader to imagine what he will about it a week later after all was over i was minded to walk down towards the coliseum and behold it in its desertion the city streets were restored to their wonted summerafternoon tranquillity the public garden presented its customary phases of two people sitting under a tree and talking intimately together on some theme of common interest    bees bees was it your hydromel  of the swans sailing in full view upon the little lake of half a dozen idlers hanging upon the bridge to look at them of children gayly dotting the paths here and there and to heighten the peacefulness of the effect a pretty pale invalid lady sat half in shade and half in sun reading in an easychair far down the broad avenue a single horsecar tinkled slowly on the steps of one of the mansions charming little girls stood in a picturesque group full of the bright color which abounds in the lovely dresses of this time as i drew near the coliseum i could perceive the desolation which had fallen upon the festival scene the white tents were gone the place where the worldrenowned cloggist gave her seriocomic dances was as lonely and silent as the site of carthage in the middle distance two men were dismantling a motionless whirligig the hut for the sale of french soups was closed farther away a solitary policeman moved gloomily across the deserted spaces showing his darkblue figure against the sky the vast fabric of the coliseum reared itself hushed and deserted within and without and a boy in his shirtsleeves pressed his nose against one of the painted windowpanes in the vain effort to behold the nothing inside but sadder than this loneliness surrounding the coliseum sadder than the festooned and knotted banners that drooped funereally upon its facade was the fact that some of those luckless refreshmentsaloons were still open displaying viands as little edible now as carnival confetti it was as if the proprietors in an unavailing remorse had condemned themselves to spend the rest of their days there and slowly consuming their own cake and popcorn washed down with their own sodawater and lemonade to perish of dyspepsia and despair     some lessons from the school of morals   any study of suburban life would be very imperfect without some glance at that larger part of it which is spent in the painful pursuit of pleasures such as are offered at the ordinary places of public amusement and for this reason i excuse myself for rehearsing certain impressions here which are not more directly suburban to say the least than those recounted in the foregoing chapter  it became shortly after life in charlesbridge began a question whether any entertainment that boston could offer were worth the trouble of going to it or still worse coming from it for if it was misery to hurry from tea to catch the inward horsecar at the head of the street what sullen lexicon will afford a name for the experience of getting home again by the last car out from the city you have watched the clock much more closely than the stage during the last act and have left your play incomplete by its final marriage or death and have rushed up to bowdoin square where you achieve a standing place in the car and utterly spent as you are with the enjoyment of the evening you endure for the next hour all that is horrible in riding or walking at the end of this time you declare that you will never go to the theatre again and after years of suffering you come at last to keep your word  while yet however in the state of formation as regards this resolution i went frequently to the theatreor school of morals as its friends have humorously called it i will not say whether any desired amelioration took place or not in my own morals through the agency of the stage but if not enlightened and refined by everything i saw there i sometimes was certainly very much surprised now that i go no more or very very rarely i avail myself of the resulting leisure to set down for the instruction of posterity some account of performances i witnessed in the years 186869 which i am persuaded will grow all the more curious if not incredible with the lapse of time  there is this satisfaction in living namely that whatever we do will one day wear an air of picturesqueness and romance and will win the fancy of people coming after us this stupid and commonplace present shall yet appear the fascinating past and is it not a pleasure to think how our rogues of descendantswho are to enjoy us aestheticallywill be taken in with us when they read in the files of old newspapers of the quantity of entertainment offered us at the theatres during the years mentioned and judge us by it i imagine them two hundred years hence looking back at us and sighing ah there was a touch of the old greek life in those athenians how they loved the drama in the jolly boston of that day that was the golden age of the theatre in the winter of 186869 they had dramatic performances in seven places of every degree of excellence and the managers coined money as we always figure our ancestors going to and from church they will probably figure us thronging the doors of theatres and no doubt there will be some historical gossiper among them to sketch a boston audience in 1869 with all our famous poets and politicians grouped together in the orchestra seats and several now dead introduced with the pleasant inaccuracy and uncertainty of historical gossipers on this night when the beautiful tostée reappeared the whole house rose to greet her if mr alcott was on one of his winter visits to boston no doubt he stepped in from the marlborough houseit was a famous temperance hotel then in the height of its reputenot only to welcome back the great actress but to enjoy a chat between the acts with his many friends here doubtless was seen the broad forehead of webster there the courtly everett conversing in studied tones with the gifted soandso did not the lovely suchaone grace the evening with her presence the brilliant and versatile edmund kirke was dead but the humorous artemas ward and his friend nasby may have attracted many eyes having come hither at the close of their lectures to testify their love of the beautiful in nature and art while perhaps mr sumner in the intervals of state cares relaxed into the enjoyment etc vous voyez bien le tableau  that faroff posterity learning that all our theatres are filled every night will never understand but we were a theatregoing people in the sense that it is the highest fashion to be seen at the play and yet we are sensible that it is not so and that the boston which makes itself known in civilizationin letters politics reformgoes as little to the theatre as fashionable boston  the stage is not an institution with us i should say yet it affords recreation to a very large and increasing number of persons and while it would be easy to overestimate its influence for good or evil even with these there is no doubt that the stage if not the drama is popular fortunately an inquiry like this into a now waning taste in theatricals concerns the fact rather than the effect of the taste otherwise the task might become indefinitely hard alike for writer and for reader no one can lay his hand on his heart and declare that he is the worse for having seen la belle hélène for example or say more than that it is a thing which ought not to be seen by any one else yet i suppose there is no one ready to deny that la belle hélène was the motive of those performances that have most pleased the most people during recent years there was something fascinating in the circumstances and auspices under which the united irma and tostée troupes appeared in bostonopéra bouffe led gayly forward by finance bouffe and suggesting erie shares by its watered music and morals but there is no doubt that tostées grand reception was owing mainly to the personal favor which she enjoyed here and which we do not vouchsafe to every one ristori did not win it we did our duty by her following her carefully with the libretto and in her most intense effects turning the leaves of a thousand pamphlets with a rustle that must have shattered every delicate nerve in her but we were always cold to her greatness it was not for tosteés singing which was but a little thing in itself it was not for her beauty for that was no more than a reminiscence if it was not always an illusion was it because she rendered the spirit of m offenbachs operas so perfectly that we liked her so much ah that movement cried an enthusiast that swing thatthatwriggle she was undoubtedly a great actress full of subtle surprises and with an audacious appearance of unconsciousness in those exigencies where consciousness would summon the policeor should she was so near yet so far from the worst that could be intended in tones in gestures in attitudes she was to the libretto just as the music was now making it appear insolently and unjustly coarse now feebly inadequate in its explicit immodesty  to see this famous lady in la grande duchesse or la belle hélène was an experience never to be forgotten and certainly not to be described the former opera has undoubtedly its proper and blameless charm there is something pretty and arch in the notion of the duchesss falling in love with the impregnably faithful and innocent fritz and the extravagance of the whole with the satire upon the typical little german court is delightful but la belle helene is a wittier play than la grande duchesse and it is the vividest expression of the spirit of opéra bouffe it is full of such lively mockeries as that of helen when she gazes upon the picture of leda and the swan jaime á me recueiller devant ce tableau de famille mon père ma mère les voici tous les deux o mon père tourne vers ton enfant un bec favorableor of paris when he represses the zeal of calchas who desires to present him at once to helen soit mais sans lui dire qui je suisje désire garder le plus strict incognito jusqau moment où la situation sera favorable á un coup de théâtre but it must be owned that our audiences seemed not to take much pleasure in these and other witticisms though they obliged mademoiselle tostée to sing un mari sage three times with all those actions and postures which seem incredible the moment they have ceased they possibly understood this song no better than the strokes of wit and encored it merely for the musics sake the effect was nevertheless unfortunate and calculated to give those french ladies but a bad opinion of our morals how could they comprehend that the taste was like themselves imported and that its indulgence here did not characterize us it was only in appearance that while we did not enjoy the wit we delighted in the coarseness and how coarse this travesty of the old fable mainly is that priest calchas with his unspeakable snicker his avarice his infidelity his hypocrisy is alone infamy enough to provoke the destruction of a city then that scene interrupted by menelaus it is indisputably witty and since all those people are so purely creatures of fable and dwell so entirely in an unmoral atmosphere it appears as absurd to blame it as the murders in a pantomime to be sure there is something about murder some inherent grace or refinement perhaps that makes its actual representation upon the stage more tolerable than the most diffident suggestion of adultery not that la belle hélène is open to the reproach of overdelicacy in this scene or any other for the matter of that though there is a strain of real poetry in the conception of this whole episode of helens intention to pass all pariss lovemaking off upon herself for a dreampoetry such as might have been inspired by a muse that had taken too much nectar there is excellent character also as well as caricature in the drama not only calchas is admirably done but agamemnon and achilles and helen and menelaus pas un mari ordinaire  un mari épiqueand the burlesque is good of its kind it is artistic as it seems french dramatic effort must almost necessarily be it could scarcely be called the fault of the opéra bouffe that the english burlesque should have come of its success nor could the public blame it for the great favor the burlesque won in those faroff winters if indeed the public wishes to bestow blame for this no one however could see one of these curious travesties without being reminded in an awkward way of the morale of the opéra bouffe and of the personnelas i may sayof the black crook the white fawn and the devils auction there was the same intention of merriment at the cost of what may be called the marital prejudices though it cannot be claimed that the wit was the same as in la belle hélène there was the same physical unreserve as in the ballets of a former season while in its dramatic form the burlesque discovered very marked parental traits  this english burlesque this child of m offenbachs genius and the now somewhat faded spectacular muse flourished at the time of which i write in three of our seven theatres for monthsfive from the highest to the lowest being in turn open to itand had begun in a tentative way to invade the deserted stage even so long ago as the previous summer and i have sometimes flattered myself that it was my fortune to witness the first exhibition of its most characteristic feature in a theatre into which i wandered one sultry night because it was the nearest theatre they were giving a play called the three fast men which had a moral of such powerful virtue that it ought to have reformed everybody in the neighborhood three ladies being in love with the three fast men and resolved to win them back to regular hours and the paths of sobriety by every device of the female heart dress themselves in mens clothessuch is the subtlety of the female heart in the bosoms of modern young ladies of fashionand follow their lovers about from one haunt of dissipation to another and become themselves exemplarily viciousdrunkards gamblers and the like the first lady who was a star in her lowly orbit was very great in all her different rôles appearing now as a sailor with the hornpipe of his calling now as an organgrinder and now as a dissolute young gentlemanwhatever was the exigency of good morals the dramatist seemed to have had an eye to her peculiar capabilities and to have expressly invented edifying characters and situations that her talents might enforce them the second young lady had also a personal didactic gift rivaling and even surpassing in some respects that of the star and was very rowdy indeed in due time the devoted conduct of the young ladies has its just effect the three fast men begin to reflect upon the folly of their wild courses and at this point the dramatist delivers his great stroke the first lady gives a soirée dansante et chantante and the three fast men have invitations the guests seat themselves as at a fashionable party in a semicircle and the gayety of the evening begins with conundrums and playing upon the banjo the gentlemen are in their morningcoats and the ladies in a display of hosiery which is now no longer surprising and which need not have been mentioned at all except for the fact that in the case of the first lady it seemed not to have been freshly put on for that party in this instance an element comical beyond intention was present in three young gentlemen an amateur musical trio who had kindly consented to sing their favorite song of the rolling zuyder zee as they now kindly did with flushed faces unmanageable hands and much repetition of    the roooo   the roooo   the rooooll   ing zuyder zee   zuyder zee   zuyder zeeee  then the turn of the three guardian angels of the fast men being come again they get up and dance each one a breakdown which seems to establish their lovers now at last in the secret of the generous ruse played upon them firmly in their resolution to lead a better life they are in nowise shaken from it by the displeasure which soon shows itself in the manner of the first and second ladies the former is greatest in the socalled protean parts of the play and is obscured somewhat by the dancing of the latter but she has a daughter who now comes on and sings a song the pensive occasion the favorable mood of the audience the sympathetic attitude of the players invite her to sing the maidens prayer and so we have the maidens prayer we may be a low set and the song may be affected and insipid enough but the purity of its intention touches and the little girl is vehemently applauded she is such a pretty child with her innocent face and her artless white dress and blue ribbons to her waist and hair that we will have her back again whereupon she runs out upon the stage strikes up a rowdy rowdy air dances a shocking little dance and vanishes from the dismayed vision leaving us a considerably lower set than we were at first and glad of our lowness this is the second ladys own ground however and now she comes outin a way that banishes far from our fickle minds all thoughts of the first lady and her mistaken childwith a medley of singing and dancing a bit of breakdown of cancan of jig a bit of le sabre de mon père and of all memorable slang songs given with the most grotesque and clownish spirit that ever inspired a woman each member of the company follows in his or her pas seul and then they all dance together to the plain confusion of the amateur trio whose eyes roll like so many zuyder zees as they sit lonely and motionless in the midst all stiffness and formality are overcome the evening party in fact disappears entirely and we are suffered to see the artists in their moments of social relaxation sitting as it were around the theatrical fireside they appear to forget us altogether they exchange winks and nods and jests of quite personal application they call each other by name by their christian names their nicknames it is not an evening party it is a family party and the suggestion of home enjoyment completes the reformation of the three fast men we see them marry the three fast women before we leave the house  on another occasion two suburban friends of the drama beheld a more explicit precursor of the coming burlesque at one of the minor theatres last summer the great actress whom they had come to see on another scene was ill and in their disappointment they embraced the hope of entertainment offered them at the smaller playhouse the drama itself was neither here nor there as to intent but the public appetite or the managers conception of itfor i am by no means sure that this whole business was not a misunderstandinghad exacted that the actresses should appear in so much stocking and so little else that it was a horror to look upon them there was no such exigency of dialogue situation or character as asked the indecorum and the effect upon the unprepared spectator was all the more stupefying from the fact that most of the ladies were not dancers and had not countenances that consorted with impropriety their faces had merely the conventional yankee sharpness and wanness of feature and such difference of air and character as should say for one and another shopgirl shoebinder seamstress and it seemed an absurdity and an injustice to refer to them in any way the disclosures of the ruthlessly scant drapery a grotesque fancy would sport with their identity did not this or that one write poetry for her local newspaper so much she looked the average culture and crudeness and when such a one coldly yielding to the managers ideas of the public taste stretched herself on a green baize bank with her feet towards us or did a similar grossness it was hard to keep from crying aloud in protest that she need not do it that nobody really expected or wanted it of her nobody alas there were people therepoor souls who had the appearance of coming every nightwho plainly did expect it and who were loud in their applauses of the chief actress this was a young person of a powerful physical expression quite unlike the restwho were dyspeptic and consumptive in the range of their charmsand she triumphed and wantoned through the scenes with a fierce excess of animal vigor she was all stocking as one may say being habited to represent a prince she had a raucous voice an insolent twist of the mouth and a terrible trick of defying her enemies by standing erect chin up hand on hip and right foot advanced patting the floor it was impossible even in the orchestra seats to look at her in this attitude and not shrink before her and on the stage she visibly tyrannized over the invalid sisterhood with her fullblown fascinations these unhappy girls personated with a pathetic effect not to be described such arch and fantastic creations of the poets mind as bewitchingcreature and exquisitelittlepet and the play was a kind of fairy burlesque in rhyme of the most melancholy stupidity that ever was yet there was something very comical in the conditions of its performance and in the possibility that public and manager were playing at cross purposes there we were in the pit an assemblage of hardworking yankees of decently moral lives and simple traditions countrybred many of us and of plebeian stock and training vulgar enough perhaps but probably not depraved and excepting the first ladys friends certainly not educated to the critical enjoyment of such spectacles and there on the stage were those mistaken women in such sad variety of boniness and flabbiness as i have tried to hint addressing their pitiable exposure to a supposed vileness in us and wrenching from all original intent the innocent dullness of the drama which for the most part could have been as well played in walkingdresses to say the least  the scene was not less amusing as regarded the audiences the ensuing winter when the english burlesque troupes which london sent us arrived but it was not quite so pathetic as regarded the performers of their beauty and their abandon the historical gossiper whom i descry far down the future waiting to refer to me as a scandalous writer of the period shall learn very little to his purpose of warming his sketch with a color from mine but i hope i may describe these ladies as very pretty very blonde and very unscrupulously clever and still disappoint the historical gossiper they seemed in all cases to be english no yankee faces voices or accents were to be detected among them where they were associated with people of another race as happened with one troupe the advantage of beauty was upon the anglosaxon side while that of some small shreds of propriety was with the latins these appeared at times almost modest perhaps because they were the conventional ballerine and wore the oldfashioned balletskirt with its volumed gauzea coyness which the englishry had greatly modified through an exigency of the burlesqueperhaps because indecorum seems like blasphemy and untruth somehow more graceful and becoming in southern than in northern races  as for the burlesques themselves they were nothing the performers personally everything m offenbach had opened lemprières dictionary to the authors with la belle hélène and there was commonly a flimsy raveling of parodied myth that held together the different dances and songs though sometimes it was a novel or an opera burlesqued but there was always a song and always a dance for each lady song and dance being equally slangy and depending for their effect mainly upon the natural or simulated personal charms of the performer  it was also an indispensable condition of the burlesques success that the characters should be reversed in their representationthat the mens rôles should be played by women and that at least one female part should be done by a man it must be owned that the fun all came from this character the ladies being too much occupied with the more serious business of bewitching us with their pretty figures to be very amusing whereas this wholesome man and brother with his blonde wig his panier his dainty feminine simperings and languishings his falsetto tones and his general air of extreme fashion was always exceedingly droll he was the saving grace of these stupid plays and i cannot help thinking that the cancan as danced in ivanhoe by isaac of york and the masculine rebecca was a moral spectacle it was the cancan made forever absurd and harmless but otherwise the burlesques were as little cheerful as profitable the playwrights who had adapted them to the american stagefor they were all of english authorshiphad been good enough to throw in some political allusions which were supposed to be effective with us but which it was sad to see received with apathy it was conceivable from a certain air with which the actors delivered these that they were in the habit of stirring london audiences greatly with like strokes of satire but except where rebecca offered a bottle of medford rum to cedric the saxon who appeared in the figure of expresident johnson they had no effect upon us we were cold very cold to suggestions of mr reverdy johnsons now historical speech making and dining general butlers spoons moved us just a little at the name of grant we roared and stamped of course though in a perfectly mechanical fashion and without thought of any meaning offered us those lovely women might have coupled the heros name with whatever insult they chose and still his name would have made us cheer them we seemed not to care for points that were intended to flatter us nationally i am not aware that anybody signified consciousness when the burlesque supported our side of the alabama controversy or acknowledged the selfdevotion with which a threat that england should be made to pay was delivered by these english performers with an equal impassiveness we greeted allusions to erie shares and to the late mr fiske  the burlesque chiefly betrayed its descent from the spectacular ballet in its undressing but that ballet while it demanded personal exposure had something very observable in its scenic splendors and all that marching and processioning in it was rather pretty while in the burlesque there seemed nothing of innocent intent no matter what the plot it led always to a final great scene of breakdownwhich was doubtless most impressive in that particular burlesque where this scene represented the infernal world and the ladies gave the dances of the country with a happy conception of the deportment of lost souls there after some vague and inconsequent dialogue the wit springing from a perennial source of humor not to specify the violation of the seventh commandment the dancing commenced each performer beginning with the walkround of the negro minstrels rendering its grotesqueness with a wonderful frankness of movement and then plunging into the mysteries of her dance with a kind of infuriate grace and a fierce delight very curious to look upon i am aware of the historical gossiper still on the alert for me and i dare not say how sketchily these ladies were dressed or indeed more than that they were dressed to resemble circusriders of the other sex but as to their own deceived nobodypossibly did not intend deceit one of them was so good a player that it seemed needless for her to go so far as she did in the dance but she spared herself nothing and it remained for her merely stalwart friends to surpass her if possible this inspired each who succeeded her to wantoner excesses to wilder insolences of hose to fiercer bravadoes of corsage while those not dancing responded to the sentiment of the music by singing shrill glees in tune with it clapping their hands and patting juba as the act is calleda peculiarly graceful and modest thing in woman the frenzy grew with every moment and as in another vision of sin    then they started from their places      moved with violence changed in hue    caught each other with wild grimaces      halfinvisible to the view    wheeling with precipitate paces      to the melody till they flew    hair and eyes and limbs and faces    twisted hard in fierce embraces    like to furies like to graces  with an occasional exchange of cuffs and kicks perfectly human the spectator found now himself and now the scene incredible and indeed they were hardly conceivable in relation to each other a melancholy sense of the absurdity of the incongruity of the whole absorbed at last even a sense of the indecency the audience was much the same in appearance as other audiences witnessing like displays at the other theatres and did not differ greatly from the usual theatrical house not so much fashion smiled upon the efforts of these young ladies as upon the cancan of the signorina morlacchi a winter earlier but there was a most fair appearance of honestlooking handsomely dressed men and women and you could pick out all over the parquet faces of one descent from the deaconship which you wondered were not afraid to behold one another there the truth is we spectators like the performers themselves lacked that tradition of error of transgression which casts its romance about the people of a lighter race we had not yet set off one corner of the common for a jardin mabille we had not even the concertcellars of the gay and elegant new yorker and nothing really had happened in boston to educate us to this new taste in theatricals since the fair quakers felt moved to testify in the streets and churches against our spiritual nakedness yet it was to be noted with regret that our innocence our respectability had no restraining influence upon the performance and the fatuity of the hope cherished by some courageous people that the presence of virtuous persons would reform the stage was but too painfully evident the doubt whether they were not nearer right who have denounced the theatre as essentially and incorrigibly bad would force itself upon the mind though there was a little comfort in the thought that if virtue had been actually allowed to frown upon these burlesques the burlesques might have been abashed into propriety the caressing arm of the law was cast very tenderly about the performers and in the only case where a spectator presumed to hissit was at a pas seul of the indescribablea policeman descended upon him and with the succor of two friends of the free ballet rent him from his place and triumphed forth with him here was an end of ungenial criticism we all applauded zealously after that  the peculiar character of the drama to which they devoted themselves had produced in these ladies some effects doubtless more interesting than profitable to observe one of them whose unhappiness it was to take the part of soubrette in the laughable commedietta preceding the burlesque was so ill at ease in drapery so full of awkward jerks and twitches that she seemed quite another being when she came on later as a radiant young gentleman in pink silk hose and nothing of feminine modesty in her dress excepting the very low corsage a strange and compassionable satisfaction beamed from her face it was evident that this sad business was the poor things forte in another company was a lady who had conquered all the easy attitudes of young men of the second or third fashion and who must have been at something of a loss to identify herself when personating a woman off the stage but nature asserted herself in a way that gave a curious and scarcely explicable shock in the case of that dancer whose impudent song required the action of fondling a child and who rendered the passage with an instinctive tenderness and grace all the more pathetic for the profaning boldness of her super masculine dress or undress commonly however the members of these burlesque troupes though they were not like men were in most things as unlike women and seemed creatures of a kind of alien sex parodying both it was certainly a shocking thing to look at them with their horrible prettiness their archness in which was no charm their grace which put to shame yet whoever beheld these burlesque sisters must have fallen into perplexing question in his own mind as to whose was the wrong involved it was not the fault of the publicall of us felt that was it the fault of the hardworking sisterhood bred to this as to any other business and not necessarily conscious of the indecorum which pains my readerobliged to please somehow and aiming doubtless at nothing but applause la belle hélène suggests the only reasonable explanation cest la fatalité     flitting   i would not willingly repose upon the friendship of a man whose local attachments are weak i should not demand of my intimate that he have a yearning for the homes of his ancestors or even the scenes of his own boyhood that is not in american nature on the contrary he is but a poor creature who does not hate the village where he was born yet a sentiment for the place where one has lived two or three years the hotel where one has spent a week the sleeping car in which one has ridden from albany to buffaloso much i should think it well to exact from my friend in proof of that sensibility and constancy without which true friendship does not exist so much i am ready to yield on my own part to a friends demand and i profess to have all the possible regrets for benicia street now i have left it over its deficiencies i cast a veil of decent oblivion and shall always try to look upon its worthy and consoling aspects which were far the more numerous it was never otherwise i imagine than an ideal region in very great measure and if the reader whom i have sometimes seemed to direct thither should seek it out he would hardly find my benicia street by the city signboard yet this is not wholly because it was an ideal locality but because much of its reality has now become merely historical a portion of the tragical poetry of the past many of the vacant lots abutting upon benicia and the intersecting streets flourished up during the four years we knew it into freshpainted wooden houses and the time came to be when one might have looked in vain for the abandoned hoopskirts which used to decorate the desirable buildingsites the lessening pasturage also reduced the herds which formerly fed in the vicinity and at last we caught the tinkle of the cowbells only as the cattle were driven past to remoter meadows and one autumn afternoon two laborers hired by the city came and threw up an earthwork on the opposite side of the street which they said was a sidewalk and would add to the value of property in the neighborhood not being dressed with coal ashes however during the winter the sidewalk vanished next summer under a growth of ragweed and hid the increased values with it and it is now an even question whether this monument of municipal grandeur will finally be held by art or resumed by naturewho indeed has a perpetual motherly longing for her own and may be seen in all outlying and suburban places pathetically striving to steal back any neglected bits of ground and conceal them under her skirts of tattered and shabby verdure but whatever is the event of this contest and whatever the other changes wrought in the locality it has not yet been quite stripped of the characteristic charms which first took our hearts and which have been duly celebrated in these pages  when the new house was chosen we made preparations to leave the old one but preparations so gradual that if we had cared much more than we did we might have suffered greatly by the prolongation of the agony we proposed to ourselves to escape the miseries of moving by transferring the contents of one room at a time and if we did not laugh incredulously at people who said we had better have it over at once and be done with it it was because we respected their feelings and not because we believed them we took up one carpet after another one wall after another we stripped of its pictures we sent away all the books to begin with and by this subtle and ingenious process we reduced ourselves to the discomfort of living in no house at all as it were and of being at home in neither one place nor the other yet the logic of our scheme remained perfect and i do not regret its failure in practice for if we had been ever so loath to quit the old house its inhospitable barrenness would finally have hurried us forth in fact does not life itself in some such fashion dismantle its tenement until it is at last forced out of the uninhabitable place are not the poor little comforts and pleasures and ornaments removed one by one till life if it would be saved must go too we took a lesson from the teachings of mortality which are so rarely heeded and we lingered over our moving we made the process so gradual indeed that i do not feel myself all gone yet from the familiar workroom and for aught i can say i still write there and as to the guestchamber it is so densely peopled by those it has lodged that it will never quite be emptied of them friends also are yet in the habit of calling in the parlor and talking with us and will the children never come off the stairs does life our high exemplar leave so much behind as we did is this what fills the world with ghosts  in the getting ready to go nothing hurt half so much as the sight of the little girl packing her dolls things for removal the trousseaux of all those elegant creatures the wooden the waxen the biscuit the india rubber were carefully assorted and arranged in various small drawers and boxes their house was thoughtfully put in order and locked for transportation their innumerable broken sets of dishes were packed in paper and set out upon the floor a heartbreaking little basketful nothing real in this world is so affecting as some image of reality and this travesty of our own flitting was almost intolerable i will not pretend to sentiment about anything else for everything else had in it the element of selfsupport belonging to all actual afflictions when the day of moving finally came and the furniture wagon which ought to have been only a shade less dreadful to us than a hearse drew up at our door our hearts were of a neronian hardness  were i diogenes says wrathful charles lamb in one of his letters i would not move out of a kilderkin into a hogshead though the first had nothing but small beer in it and the second reeked claret i fancy this loathing of the transitionary state came in great part from the rude and elemental nature of the means of moving in lambs day in our own time in charlesbridge at least everything is so perfectly contrived that it is in some ways a pleasant excitement to move though i do not commend the diversion to any but people of entire leisure for it cannot be denied that it is at any rate an interruption to work but little is broken little is defaced nothing is heedlessly outraged or put to shame of course there are in every house certain objects of comfort and even ornament which in a state of repose derive a sort of dignity from being cracked or scratched or organically debilitated and give an idea of ancestral possession and of long descent to the actual owner and you must not hope that this venerable quality will survive their public exposure upon the furniture wagon there it instantly perishes like the consequence of some country notable huddled and hustled about in the graceless and ignorant tumult of a great city to tell the truth the number of things that turn shabby under the ordeal of moving strikes a pang of unaccustomed poverty to the heart which loving all manner of makeshifts is rich even in its dilapidations for the time you feel degraded by the spectacle of that forlornness and if you are a man of spirit you try to sneak out of association with it in the mind of the passerby you keep scrupulously indoors or if a fancied exigency obliges you to go back and forth between the old house and the new you seek obscure byways remote from the great street down which the wagon flaunts your ruin and decay and time your arrivals and departures so as to have the air of merely dropping in at either place this consoles you but it deceives no one for the man who is moving is unmistakably stamped with transition  yet the momentary eclipse of these things is not the worst it is momentary for if you will but plant them in kindly corners and favorable exposures of the new house a mould of respectability will gradually overspread them again and they will once more account for their presence by the air of having been a long time in the family but there is danger that in the first moments of mortification you will be tempted to replace them with new and costly articles even the best of the old things are nothing to boast of in the hard unpitying light to which they are exposed and a difficult and indocile spirit of extravagance is evoked in the least profuse because of this fact alone i should not commend the diversion of moving save to people of very ample means as well as perfect leisure there are more reasons than the misery of flitting why the dweller in the kilderkin should not covet the hogshead reeking of claret  but the grosser misery of moving is as i have hinted vastly mitigated by modern science and what remains of it one may use himself to with no tremendous effort i have found that in the dentists chairthat ironically luxurious seat cushioned in satirical suggestion of impossible reposeafter a certain initial period of clawing filing scraping and punching ones nerves accommodate themselves to the torment and one takes almost an objective interest in the operation of toothfilling and in like manner after two or three wagonloads of your household stuff have passed down the public street and all your morbid associations with them have been desecrated you begin almost to like it yet i cannot regard this abandon as a perfectly healthy emotion and i do not counsel my reader to mount himself upon the wagon and ride to and fro even once for afterwards the remembrance of such an excess will grieve him  of course i meant to imply by this that moving sometimes comes to an end though it is not easy to believe so while moving the time really arrives when you sit down in your new house and amid whatever disorder take your first meal there this meal is pretty sure to be that gloomy tea that loathly repast of butter and toast and some kind of cake with which the soul of the earlydining american is daily cast down between the hours of six and seven in the evening and instinctively you compare it with the last meal you took in your old house seeking in vain to decide whether this is more dispiriting than that at any rate that was not at all the meal which the last meal in any house which has been a home ought to be in fact and is in books it was hurriedly cooked it was served upon fugitive and irregular crockery and it was eaten in deplorable disorder with the professional movers waiting for the table outside the dining room it ought to have been an act of serious devotion it was nothing but an expiation it should have been a solemn commemoration of all past dinners in the place an invocation to their pleasant apparitions but i for my part could not recall these at all though now i think of them with the requisite pathos and i know they were perfectly worthy of remembrance i salute mournfully the companies that have sat down at dinner there for they are sadly scattered now some beyond seas some beyond the narrow gulf so impassably deeper to our longing and tenderness than the seas but more sadly still i hail the host himself and desire to know of him if literature was not somehow a gayer science in those days and if his peculiar kind of drolling had not rather more heart in it then in an odd not quite expressible fashion something of him seems dispersed abroad and perished in the guests he loved i trust of course that all will be restored to him when he turnsas every man past thirty feels he may when he likes and has the timeand resumes his youth or if this feeling is only a part of the great tacit promise of eternity i am all the more certain of his getting back his losses  i say that now these apposite reflections occur to me with a sufficient ease but that upon the true occasion for them they were absent so too at the first meal in the new house there was none of that desirable sense of setting up a family altar but a calamitous impression of irretrievable upheaval in honor of which sackcloth and ashes seemed the only wear yet even the next day the lares and penates had regained something of their wonted cheerfulness and life had begun again with the first breakfast in fact i found myself already so firmly established that meeting the furniture cart which had moved me the day before i had the face to ask the driver whom they were turning out of house and home as if my own flitting were a memory of the faroff past  not that i think the professional mover expects to be addressed in a joking mood i have a fancy that he cultivates a serious spirit himself in which he finds it easy to sympathize with any melancholy on the part of the moving family there is a slight flavor of undertaking in his manner which is nevertheless full of a subdued firmness very consoling and supporting though the life that he leads must be a troubled and uncheerful one trying alike to the muscles and the nerves how often must he have been charged by anxious and fluttered ladies to be very careful of that basket of china and those vases how often must he have been vexed by the ignorant terrors of gentlemen asking if he thinks that the library table poised upon the top of his load will hold his planning is not infallible and when he breaks something uncommonly precious what does a man of his sensibility do is the demolition of old homes really distressing to him or is he inwardly buoyed up by hopes of other and better homes for the people he moves can there be any ideal of moving does he perhaps feel a pride in an artfully constructed load and has he something like an artists pang in unloading it is there a choice in families to be moved and are some worse or better than others next to the lawyer and the doctor it appears to me that the professional mover holds the most confidential relations towards his fellowmen he is let into all manner of little domestic secrets and subterfuges i dare say he knows where half the people in town keep their skeleton and what manner of skeleton it is as for me when i saw him making towards a certain closet door i planted myself firmly against it he smiled intelligence he knew the skeleton was there and that it would be carried to the new house after dark  i began by saying that i should wish my friend to have some sort of local attachment but i suppose it must be owned that this sentiment like pity and the modern lovepassion is a thing so largely produced by culture that nature seems to have little or nothing to do with it the first men were homeless wanderers the patriarchs dwelt in tents and shifted their place to follow the pasturage without a sigh and for childrenthe pre historic the antique people of our daymoving is a rapture the last dinner in the old house the first tea in the new so doleful to their elders are partaken of by them with joyous riot their shrill trebles echo gleefully from the naked walls and floors they race up and down the carpetless stairs they menace the dislocated mirrors and crockery through all the chambers of desolation they frolic with a gayety indomitable save by bodily exhaustion if the reader is of a moving familyand so he is as he is an americanhe can recall the zest he found during childhood in the moving which had for his elderspoor victims of a factitious and conventional sentimentonly the salt and bitterness of tears his spirits never fell till the carpets were down no sorrow touched him till order returned if heaven so blessed him that his bed was made upon the floor for one night the angels visited his dreams why then is the mature soul however sincere and humble not only grieved but mortified by flitting why cannot one move without feeling the great public eye fixed in pitying contempt upon him this sense of abasement seems to be something quite inseparable from the act which is often laudable and in every way wise and desirable and he whom it has afflicted is the first to turn after his own establishment and look with scornful compassion upon the overflowing furniture wagon as it passes but i imagine that abrahams neighbors when he struck his tent and packed his parlor and kitchen furniture upon his camels and started off with mrs sarah to seek a new campingground did not smile at the procession or find it worthy of ridicule or lament nor did abraham once settled and reposing in the cool of the evening at the door of his tent gaze sarcastically upon the moving of any of his brother patriarchs  to some such philosophical serenity we shall also return i suppose when we have wisely theorized life in our climate and shall all have become nomads once more following june and october up and down and across the continent and not suffering the full malice of the winter and summer anywhere but as yet the derision that attaches to moving attends even the goerout of town and the man of many trunks and a retinue of linen suited womankind is a pitiable and despicable object to all the other passengers at the railroad station and on the steamboat wharf  this is but one of many ways in which mere tradition oppresses us i protest that as moving is now managed in charlesbridge there is hardly any reason why the master or mistress of the household should put hand to anything but it is a tradition that they shall dress themselves in their worst as for heavy work and shall go about very shabby for at least a day before and a day after the transition it is a kind of sacrifice i suppose to a venerable ideal and i would never be the first to omit it in others i observe that this vacant and ceremonious zeal is in proportion to an incapacity to do anything that happens really to be required and i believe that the truly sage person would devote movingday to paying visits of ceremony in his finest clothes  illustration vacant and ceremonious zeal  as to the house which one has left i think it would be preferable to have it occupied as soon as possible after ones flitting pilgrimages to the dismantled shrine are certainly to be avoided by the friend of cheerfulness a days absence and emptiness wholly change its character though the familiarity continues with a ghastly difference as in the beloved face that the life has left it is not at all the vacant house it was when you came first to look at it for then hopes peopled it and now memories in that golden prime you had long been boarding and any place in which you could keep house seemed utterly desirable how distinctly you recall that wet day or that fair day on which you went through it and decided that this should be the guest chamber and that the family room and what could be done with the little back attic in a pinch the children could play in the diningroom and to be sure the parlor was rather small if you wanted to have company but then who would ever want to give a party and besides the pump in the kitchen was a compensation for anything how lightly the dumb waiter ran up and down    qual piuma al vento  you sang in very gladheartedness then estimates of the number of yards of carpeting and how you could easily save the cost from the difference between boarding and housekeeping adieu mrs brown henceforth let your desirable apartments en suite or single furnished or unfurnished to gentlemen onlythis married pair is about to escape forever from your extortions  well if the years passed without making us sadder should we be much the wiser for their going now you know little couple that there are extortions in this wicked world beside mrs browns and some other things but if you go into the empty house that was lately your home you will not i believe be haunted by these sordid disappointments for the place should evoke other regrets and meditations truly though the great fear has not come upon you here in this room you may have known moments when it seemed very near and when the quick fevered breathings of the little one timed your own heartbeats to that door with many other missives of joy and pain came haply the dispatch which hurried you off to face your greatest sorrowcame by night like a voice of god speaking and warning and making all your work idle and your aims foolish these walls have answered how many times to your laughter they have had friendly ears for the trouble that seemed to grow by utterance you have sat upon the threshold so many summer days so many winter mornings you have seen the snows drifted high about it so often your step has been light and heavy upon it there is the study where your magnificent performances were planned and your exceeding small performances were achieved hither you hurried with the first criticism of your first book and read it with the rapture that nothing but a loveletter and a favorable review can awaken out there is the wellknown humble prospect that was commonly but a vista into dreamland on the other hand is the pretty groveits leaves now a little painted with the autumn and faltering to their fall  yes the place must always be sacred but painfully sacred and i say again one should not go near it unless as a penance if the reader will suffer me the confidence i will own that there is always a pang in the past which is more than any pleasure it can give and i believe that he if he were perfectly honestas heaven forbid i or any one should be would also confess as much there is no house to which one would return having left it though it were the hogshead out of which one had moved into a kilderkin for those associations whose perishing leaves us free and preserves to us what little youth we have were otherwise perpetuated to our burden and bondage let some one else who has also escaped from his past have your old house he will find it new and untroubled by memories while you under another roof enjoy a present that borders only upon the future
