93724359	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    sentence deferred   illustration an elderly man with a wooden leg who joined the indignant officer in the pursuit  fortunately for captain bligh there were but few people about and the only person who saw him trip policesergeant pilbeam was an elderly man with a wooden leg who joined the indignant officer in the pursuit  the captain had youth on his side and diving into the narrow alleyways that constitute the older portion of woodhatch he moderated his pace and listened acutely  the sounds of pursuit died away in the distance and he had already dropped into a walk when the hurried tap of the wooden leg sounded from one corner and a chorus of hurried voices from the other  it was clear that the number of hunters had increased  he paused a second irresolute  the next he pushed open a door that stood ajar in an old flint wall and peeped in  he saw a small brick paved yard in which trim myrtles and flowering plants stood about in freshly ochred pots and opening the door a little wider he slipped in and closed it behind him  well  said a voice sharply  what do you want  captain bligh turned and saw a girl standing in a hostile attitude in the doorway of the house  hsh he said holding up his finger  the girls cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkled  what are you doing in our yard she demanded  the captains face relaxed as the sound of voices died away  he gave his moustache a twist and eyed her with frank admiration  escaping he said briefly  they nearly had me though  you had no business to escape into our yard said the girl  what have you been escaping from  fat policeman said the skipper jauntily twisting his moustache  miss pilbeam only daughter of sergeant pilbeam caught her breath sharply  what have you been doing she inquired as soon as she could control her voice  nothing said the skipper airily nothing  i was kicking a stone along the path and he told me to stop it  well said miss pilbeam impatiently  we had words said the skipper  i dont like policemenfat policemenand while we were talking he happened to lose his balance and go over into some mud that was swept up at the side of the road  lost his balance gasped the horrified miss pilbeam  the skipper was flattered at her concern  you would have laughed if you had seen him he said smiling  dont look so frightened he hasnt got me yet  no said the girl slowly  not yet  she gazed at him with such a world of longing in her eyes that the skipper despite a somewhat large share of selfesteem was almost startled  and he shant have me he said returning her gaze with interest  miss pilbeam stood in silent thought  she was a strong wellgrown girl but she realized fully that she was no match for the villain who stood before her twisting his moustache and adjusting his necktie  and her father would not be off duty until nine  i suppose you would like to wait here until it is dark she said at last  i would sooner wait here than anywhere said the skipper with respectful ardor  perhaps you would like to come in and sit down said the girl  captain bligh thanked her and removing his cap followed her into a small parlor in the front of the house  father is out she said as she motioned him to an easychair but im sure hell be pleased to see you when he comes in  and i shall be pleased to see him said the innocent skipper  miss pilbeam kept her doubts to herself and sat in a brown study wondering how the capture was to be effected  she had a strong presentiment that the appearance of her father at the front door would be the signal for her visitors departure at the back  for a time there was an awkward silence  lucky thing for me i upset that policeman said the skipper at last  why inquired the girl  else i shouldnt have come into your yard was the reply  its the first time we have ever put into woodhatch and i might have sailed away and never seen you  where should we have been but for that fat policeman  miss pilbeamas soon as she could get her breathsaid ah where indeed and for the first time in her life began to feel the need of a chaperon  funny to think of him hunting for me high and low while i am sitting here said the skipper  miss pilbeam agreed with him and began to laughto laugh so heartily that he was fain at last to draw his chair close to hers and pat her somewhat anxiously on the back  the treatment sobered her at once and she drew apart and eyed him coldly  i was afraid you would lose your breath explained the skipper awkwardly  you are not angry are you  he was so genuinely relieved when she said no that miss pilbeam despite her fathers wrongs began to soften a little  the upsetter of policemen was certainly goodlooking and his manner towards her so nicely balanced between boldness and timidity that a slight feeling of sadness at his lack of moral character began to assail her  suppose you are caught after all she said presently  you will go to prison  the skipper shrugged his shoulders  i dont suppose i shall be he replied  arent you sorry persisted miss pilbeam in a vibrant voice  certainly not said the skipper  why i shouldnt have seen you if i hadnt done it  miss pilbeam looked at the clock and pondered  it wanted but five minutes to nine  five minutes in which to make up a mind that was in a state of strong unrest  i suppose it is time for me to go said the skipper watching her miss pilbeam rose  no dont go she said hastily  do be quiet i want to think  captain bligh waited in respectful silence heedless of the fateful seconds ticking from the mantelpiece  at the sound of a slow measured footfall on the cobblestone path outside miss pilbeam caught his arm and drew him towards the door  go she breathed  no stop  she stood trying in vain to make up her mind  upstairs she said quick and leading the way entered her fathers bedroom and after a moments thought opened the door of a cupboard in the corner  get in there she whispered  but objected the astonished bligh  the front door was heard to open  police said miss pilbeam in a thrilling whisper  the skipper stepped into the cupboard without further parley and the girl turning the key slipped it into her pocket and sped downstairs  sergeant pilbeam was in the easychair with his belt unfastened when she entered the parlor and with a hungry reference to supper sat watching her as she lit the lamp and drew down the blind  with a lifelong knowledge of the requirements of the force she drew a jug of beer and placed it by his side while she set the table  ah i wanted that said the sergeant  ive been running  miss pilbeam raised her eyebrows  after some sailorlooking chap that capsized me when i wasnt prepared for it said her father putting down his glass  it was a neat bit o work and i shall tell him so when i catch him  look here  he stood up and exhibited the damage  ive rubbed off what i could he said resuming his seat and i spose the restll brush off when its dry  tomorrow morning i shall go down to the harbor and try and spot my lord  he drew his chair to the table and helped himself and filling his mouth with cold meat and pickles enlarged on his plans for the capture of his assailant plans to which the undecided miss pilbeam turned a somewhat abstracted ear  by the time her father had finished his supper she was trying but in vain to devise means for the prisoners escape  the sergeant had opened the door of the room for the sake of fresh air and it was impossible for anybody to come downstairs without being seen  the story of a sickly geranium in the backyard left him unmoved  i wouldnt get up for all the geraniums in the world he declared im just going to have one more pipe and then im off to bed  running dont agree with me  he went despite his daughters utmost efforts to prevent him and she sat in silent consternation listening to his heavy tread overhead  she heard the bed creak in noisy protest as he climbed in and ten minutes later the lusty snoring of a healthy man of full habit resounded through the house  she went to bed herself at last and after lying awake for nearly a couple of hours closed her eyes in order to think better  she awoke with the sun pouring in at the window and the sounds of vigorous brushing in the yard beneath  ive nearly got it off said the sergeant looking up  its destroying evidence in a sense i suppose but i cant go about with my uniform plastered with mud  ive had enough chaff about it as it is  miss pilbeam stole to the door of the next room and peeped stealthily in not a sound came from the cupboard and a horrible idea that the prisoner might have been suffocated set her trembling with apprehension  hsh she whispered  an eager but stifled hst came from the cupboard and miss pilbeam her fears allayed stepped softly into the room  hes downstairs brushing the mud off she said in a low voice  who is  said the skipper  the fat policeman said the girl in a hard voice as she remembered her fathers wrongs  whats he doing it here for demanded the astonished skipper  because he lives here  lodger queried the skipper more astonished than before  father said miss pilbeam  a horrified groan from the cupboard fell like music on her ears  then the smile forsook her lips and she stood quivering with indignation as the groan gave way to suppressed but unmistakable laughter  hsh she said sharply and with head erect sailed out of the room and went downstairs to give mr pilbeam his breakfast  to the skipper in the confined space and darkness of the cupboard the breakfast seemed unending  the sergeant evidently believed in sitting over his meals and his deep rumbling voice punctuated by goodnatured laughter was plainly audible  to pass the time the skipper fell to counting and tired of that recited some verses that he had acquired at school  after that and with far more heartiness he declaimed a few things that he had learned since and still the clatter and rumble sounded from below  it was a relief to him when he heard the sergeant push his chair back and move heavily about the room  a minute later he heard him ascending the stairs and then he held his breath with horror as the footsteps entered the room and a heavy hand was laid on the cupboard door  elsie bawled the sergeant  wheres the key of my cupboard  i want my other boots  theyre down here cried the voice of miss pilbeam and the skipper hardly able to believe in his good fortune heard the sergeant go downstairs again  at the expiration of another weekby his own reckoninghe heard the light hurried footsteps of miss pilbeam come up the stairs and pause at the door  hst he said recklessly  im coming said the girl  dont be impatient  a key turned in the lock the door was flung open and the skipper dazed and blinking with the sudden light stumbled into the room  fathers gone said miss pilbeam  the skipper made no answer  he was administering first aid to a right leg which had temporarily forgotten how to perform its duties varied with slaps and pinches at a left which had gone to sleep  at intervals he turned a redrimmed and reproachful eye on miss pilbeam  illustration he was administering first aid to a right leg  you want a wash and some breakfast she said softly especially a wash  theres water and a towel and while youre making yourself tidy ill be getting breakfast  the skipper hobbled to the washstand and dipping his head in a basin of cool water began to feel himself again  by the time he had done his hair in the sergeants glass and twisted his moustache into shape he felt better still and he went downstairs almost blithely  im very sorry it was your father he said as he took a seat at the table  very  thats why you laughed i suppose said the girl tossing her head  well ive had the worst of it said the other  id sooner be upset a hundred times than spend a night in that cupboard  however alls well that ends well  ah said miss pilbeam dolefully but is it the end  captain bligh put down his knife and fork and eyed her uneasily  what do you mean he said  never mind dont spoil your breakfast said the girl  ill tell you afterwards  its horrid to think after all my trouble of your doing two months as well as a night in the cupboard  beastly said the unfortunate eying her in great concern  but whats the matter  one cant think of everything said miss pilbeam but of course we ought to have thought of the mate getting uneasy when you didnt turn up last night and going to the policestation with a description of you  the skipper started and smote the table with his fist  fathers gone down to watch the ship now said miss pilbeam  of course its the exact description of the man that assaulted him providential he called it  thats the worst of having a fool for a mate said the skipper bitterly  what business was it of his i should like to know  whats it got to do with him whether i turn up or not  what does he want to interfere for  its no good blaming him said miss pilbeam thinking deeply with her chin on her finger  the thing is what is to be done  once father gets his hand on you  she shuddered so did the skipper  i might get off with a fine i didnt hurt him he remarked  miss pilbeam shook her head  theyre very strict in woodhatch she said  i was a fool to touch him at all said the repentant skipper  high spirits thats what it was  high spirits and being spoken to as if i was a child  the thing is how are you to escape said the girl  its no good going out of doors with the police and half the people in woodhatch all on the lookout for you  if i could only get aboard i should be all right muttered the skipper i could keep down the focsle while the mate took the ship out  miss pilbeam sat in deep thought  its the getting aboard thats the trouble she said slowly  youd have to disguise yourself  it would have to be a good disguise too to pass my father i can tell you  captain bligh gave a gloomy assent  the only thing for you to do so far as i can see said the girl slowly is to make yourself up like a coalie  there are one or two colliers in the harbor and if you took off your coati could send it on afterwardsrubbed yourself all over with coaldust and shaved off your moustache i believe you would escape  shave ejaculated the skipper in choking accents  rub coaldust  its your only chance said miss pilbeam  captain bligh leaned back frowning and from sheer force of habit passed the ends of his moustache slowly through his fingers  i think the coal dust would be enough he said at last  the girl shook her head  father particularly noticed your moustache she said  everybody does said the skipper with mournful pride  i wont part with it  not for my sake inquired miss pilbeam eying him mournfully  not after all ive done for you  no said the other stoutly  miss pilbeam put her handkerchief to her eyes and with a suspicious little sniff hurried from the room  captain bligh much affected waited for a few seconds and then went in pursuit of her  fifteen minutes later shorn of his moustache he stood in the coalhole sulkily smearing himself with coal  thats better said the girl you look horrible  she took up a handful of coaldust and ordering him to stoop shampooed him with hearty goodwill  illustration she took up a handful of coaldust and ordering him to stoop shampooed him with hearty goodwill  no good half doing it she declared  now go and look at yourself in the glass in the kitchen  the skipper went and came back in a state of wildeyed misery  even miss pilbeams statement that his own mother would not know him failed to lift the cloud from his brow  he stood disconsolate as the girl opened the front door  goodby she said gently  write and tell me when you are safe  captain bligh promised and walked slowly up the road  so far from people attempting to arrest him they vied with each other in giving him elbowroom  he reached the harbor unmolested and lurking at a convenient corner made a careful survey  a couple of craft were working out their coal a small steamer was just casting loose and a fishing boat gliding slowly over the still water to its berth  his own schooner which lay near the colliers had apparently knocked off work pending his arrival  for sergeant pilbeam he looked in vain  he waited a minute or two and then with a furtive glance right and left strolled in a careless fashion until he was abreast of one of the colliers  nobody took any notice of him and with his hands in his pockets he gazed meditatively into the water and edged along towards his own craft  his foot trembled as he placed it on the plank that formed the gangway but resisting the temptation to look behind he gained the deck and walked forward  halloa  what do you want  inquired a seaman coming out of the galley  all right bill said the skipper in a low voice  dont take any notice of me  eh said the seaman starting  good lor  what ha you  shut up said the skipper fiercely and walking to the forecastle placed his hand on the scuttle and descended with studied slowness  as he reached the floor the perturbed face of bill blocked the opening  had an accident capn he inquired respectfully  no snapped the skipper  come down herequick  dont stand up there attracting attention  do you want the whole town round you  come down  im all right where i am said bill backing hastily as the skipper putting a foot on the ladder thrust a black and furious face close to his  clear out then hissed the skipper  go and send the mate to me dont hurry  and if anybody noticed me come aboard and should ask you who i am say im a pal of yours  the seaman marvelling greatly withdrew and the skipper throwing himself on a locker wiped a bit of grit out of his eye and sat down to wait for the mate  he was so long in coming that he waxed impatient and ascending a step of the ladder again peeped on to the deck  the first object that met his gaze was the figure of the mate leaning against the side of the ship with a wary eye on the scuttle  come here said the skipper  anything wrong inquired the mate retreating a couple of paces in disorder  comehere repeated the skipper  the mate advanced slowly and in response to an imperative command from the skipper slowly descended and stood regarding him nervously  yes you may look said the skipper with sudden ferocity  this is all your doing  where are you going  he caught the mate by the coat as he was making for the ladder and hauled him back again  youll go when ive finished with you he said grimly  now what do you mean by it  eh  what do you mean by it  thats all right said the mate in a soothing voice  dont get excited  look at me said the skipper  all through your interfering  how dare you go making inquiries about me  me said the mate backing as far as possible  inquiries  whats it got to do with you if i stay out all night  pursued the skipper  nothing said the other feebly  what did you go to the police about me for then demanded the skipper  me said the mate in the shrill accents of astonishment  me i didnt go to no police about you  why should i  do you mean to say you didnt report my absence last night to the police  said the skipper sternly  certnly not said the mate plucking up courage  why should i  if you like to take a night off its nothing to do with me  i ope i know my duty better  i dont know what youre talking about  and the police havent been watching the ship and inquiring for me asked the skipper  the mate shook his bewildered head  why should they he inquired  the skipper made no reply  he sat goggleeyed staring straight before him trying in vain to realize the hardness of the heart that had been responsible for such a scurvy trick  besides it aint the fust time youve been out all night remarked the mate aggressively  the skipper favored him with a glance the dignity of which was somewhat impaired by his complexion and in a slow and stately fashion ascended to the deck  then he caught his breath sharply and paled beneath the coaldust as he saw sergeant pilbeam standing on the quay opposite the ship  by his side stood miss pilbeam and both with a faraway look in their eyes were smiling vaguely but contentedly at the horizon  the sergeant appeared to be the first to see the skipper  ahoy darkie he cried  captain bligh who was creeping slowly aft halted and clenching his fists regarded him ferociously  give this to the skipper will you my lad said the sergeant holding up the jacket bligh had left behind  goodlooking young man with a very fine moustache he is  illustration give this to the skipper will you my lad  said the sergeant  was said his daughter in a mournful voice  and a rather dark complexion continued the sergeant grinning madly i was going to take himfor stealing my coalbut i thought better of it  thought of a better way  at least my daughter did  so long darkie  he kissed the top of a fat middle finger and turning away walked off with miss pilbeam  the skipper stood watching them with his head swimming until arrived at the corner they stopped and the sergeant came slowly back  i was nearly forgetting he said slowly  tell your skipper that if so be as he wants to apologizefor stealing my coali shall be at home at tea at five oclock  he jerked his thumb in the direction of miss pilbeam and winked with slow deliberation  shell be there too he added  savvy
