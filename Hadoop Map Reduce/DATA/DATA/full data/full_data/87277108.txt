87277108	the rover boys on the ocean or a chase for a fortune  by arthur m winfield edward stratemeyer     introduction   my dear boys the rover boys on the ocean is a complete tale in itself but forms a companion volume to the rover boys at school which preceded it  in the former volume i tried to give my young readers a glimpse of life as it actually is in one of our famous military boarding schools with its brightness and shadows its trials and triumphs its little plots and counterplots its mental and physical contests and all that goes to make up such an existence in the present tale i have given a little more of this and also related the particulars of an ocean trip which from a small and unpretentious beginning developed into something entirely unlooked for an outing calculated to test the nerves of the bravest of american youths  how dick tom and sam and their friends stood it and how they triumphed over their enemies i will leave for the story itself to explain this volume will be followed by another to be entitled the rover boys in the jungle telling of curious adventures in the heart of africa  as the first volume of the series was so i well received my one wish is that the present tale may find equal favor at your hands  affectionately and sincerely  yours  edward stratemeyer  september 20 1899     the rover boys on the ocean     chapter i  something about the rover boys   luff up a little sam or the spray will run on the rocks  all right dick i havent got sailing down quite as fine as you yet  how far do you suppose we are from albany  not over eight or nine miles  if this wind holds out well make that city by six oclock  ill tell you what sailing on the hudson suits me firstrate  and it suits me too put in tom rover addressing both of his brothers i like it ten times better than staying on uncle randolphs farm  but i cant say that i like it better than life at putnam hall smiled sam rover as he threw over the tiller of the little yacht  im quite anxious to meet captain putnam and fred frank and larry again  oh so am i answered tom rover  but an outing on the hudson is just the best of a vacation  by the way i wonder if all of our old friends will be back  most of them will be  and our enemies  dan baxter wont come back answered dick seriously  he ran away to chicago with two hundred dollars belonging to his father and i guess thats the end of himso far as putnam hall and we are concerned  what a bully he was  i feel it in my bones dick that well meet dan baxter again came from sam rover  dont you remember that in that note he left when he ran away he said he would take pains to get square with us some day  he was a big blower sam put in tom  i am not afraid of him an his chum mumps was a regular sneak coward  i hope putnam hall will be free from all such fellows during the next term but wehold hard samthere is another yacht bearing down upon us  tom rover leaped to his feet and so did dick  tom was right another craft considerably larger than their own was headed directly for them  throw her over to starboard sang out dick rover  and be quick about itor well have a smashup sure  and he leaped to his brothers assistance while tom did the same  the rover brothers were three in numberdick the oldest and most studious tom next is full of fun as an egg is full of meat and sam the youngest  in a former volume of this series entitled the rover boys at school i related how the three youths had been sent by their uncle randolph rover to putnam hall a military boarding school situated upon cayuga lake in new york state  whether the three boys were orphans or not was a question that could not be answered  their father anderson rover had been a geological expert and rich mine owner and returning from the west had set sail for africa with the intention of exploring the central region of that country in the hope of locating some valuable gold mines  the boys and their uncle knew that he had journeyed from the western coast toward the interior with a number of natives and that was all they did know although they had made numerous inquiries and hoped for the best  the lads mother was dead and all these things had happened years before they had been sent to boarding school  randolph rover was an eccentric but kind hearted man given over entirely to scientific farming of which so far sad to relate he had made a rather costly failure  he spent all of his time over his agricultural books and in the fields and was glad enough to get the boys off his hands by sending them to the military school  when vacation came he wondered what he should do with them during the summer but the problem was solved by the boys who hated to think of remaining on the farm and who proposed a trip up and down the hudson river and through long island sound providing their guardian would furnish the boat and bear the expense of the outing the outcome was the chartering of the yacht spray and all of the boys took lessons in sailing from an old tar who knew exactly how such a craft should be handled  at putnam hall the boys had made a number of friends and also several enemies and had had several surprising adventures as my old readers already know  who their friends and their enemies were and what further adventures were in store for the three brothers i will leave for the pages following to reveal  at present let us turn our attention to the boat which seemed on the point of running down the spray  like their own craft the other boat carried but a single mast but the stick was at least ten feet longer than the mast of the spray and the boat was correspondingly larger in every respect as she came nearer the rover boys saw that she contained two occupants a boy and a somewhat elderly man  sheer off there cried dick at the top of his lungs  do you want to run us down  get out of the way yourself came back the answer from the boy in the other boat  we cant get outwe are almost on the rocks now yelled tom then he gave a start of surprise why its mumps  by jinks it is john fenwick muttered dick  i remember now that he came from the hudson river and that his folks owned a boat  he raised his voice are you going to sheer off or not  by this time the two boats were nearly bowsprit to bowsprit and sam rovers heart almost stopped beating  but now mumps spoke to the man with him and his craft called the falcon sheered to port scraping the sprays side as she did so  mumps what do you mean by such work demanded dick when the immediate danger was past  ha ha  i thought i would give you a scare laughed the former sneak of putnam hall  you neednt be afraid but what i and old bill goss here know how to keep the falcon out of danger  it was foolishness to run so close said tom  dont you talk to me tom rover  ive had enough of you mind that  and i want you to mind and keep off next time mumps  if you dont  what will you do  ill be tempted to come aboard the falcon and give you a thrashing  youll never set foot on my boat and im not afraid of you roared mumps  you think you got the best of me at putnam hall but you didnt and i want you to know it  how is your friend dan baxter cried sam  has he landed in jail yet  never mind dan baxter growled mumps growing red in the face and then the two yachts moved so far apart that further talk was impossible  well i didnt expect to meet him muttered dick after the three brothers had cooled down a bit  he must have known we were in this boat  i saw his craft last night down near catskill said tom ill wager he has been following us up  he wouldnt do that unless he had some reason for it  i believe he would sink us if he could put in sam  to my mind he is almost as bad as baxter  hardly sam dan baxter is a thief and the son of a thief came from tom  by the way i wonder if arnold baxter is still in the hospital at ithaca  more than likely since he was so badly hurt by that fall from the train  if welook mumps has turned around and is following us  sam pointed to the falcon and his brothers saw that he was right  soon the larger craft was again within hailing distance  hi mumps what are you following us for demanded dick as he stepped up on the stern seat  didnt know i was following you was the sour rejoinder  i have a right to sail where i please  if you have any game in mind i advise you not to try it on  what game would i have dick rover  some game to get yourself into trouble  i know my own business  alright you can go about your business  but dont try to step on our toesor youll get the worst of it  so youre going to play the part of a bully  no im only giving you fair warning  if you let us alone well let you alone  you have been watching the movements of the falcon since day before yesterday went on mumps slowly and distinctly as though he expected his words to have a great effect  watching your boat began dick and tom simultaneously  yes watching my boatand i dont like it answered fenwick and his face grew dark  why should we watch your boat demanded sam  never mind why  youve been watching her and thats enough  and why should we put ourselves out to that extentwhen we are merely out for pleasure said dick  there is no fun in watching a fellow like you im sure  john is right ye have been awatchin this boat growled the old sailor named bill goss who it may be as well to state here was thoroughly under his younger masters thumb for reasons best known to himself  if i had my way id wollop the lot on ye and he shook his fist at the occupants of the spray  you keep your oar out cried dick sternly  you are entirely mistaken in your suspicions  we are not spying on you or anybody and if you  dick was permitted to go no further  while bill goss was speaking the spray had been caught by a sudden puff of wind and sent over to starboard  now the falcon came on swiftly and in an instant her sharp bow crashed into the rover boys boat the shock of the collision caused the spray to shiver from stem to stern and then with a jagged hole in her side she began to slowly sink     chapter ii  the encounter on the river   for the instant after the collision occurred none of the rover boys uttered a word  tom and sam stared in amazement at mumps while dick gazed helplessly at the damage done  pull her away quick bill cried mumps in a low voice to the old sailor who at once sprang forward and shoved the two yachts apart with a long boathook  then the rudder of the falcon was put hard a port and she swung away for a distance of half a dozen yards  we are sinking gasped tom who was the first of the three brothers to find his voice  mumps you rascal what do you mean by this work demanded dick  and then without waiting for an answer he turned to sam steer for the shore and beach herif you can  i dont believe we can make it dick  but we can try  well have you locked up for this mumps shouted tom  i couldnt help itit was an accident returned the former sneak of putnam hall glibly  you should have kept out of the way  well see about that later on  maybe you want us to help you  we shant ask you for the favor burst out sam  id rather drown first  but sam did not exactly mean this  he and his brothers could all swim and he felt certain that they were in no immediate danger of their lives  you had better not ask any favors  i wouldnt pick you up for a barrel of money  i think well have to settle this in court mumps said dick as quietly as he could  you cant prove i ran you down  dont you dare to have us hauled up put in bill goss  it was an accident jest as john says  i reckon as how it will teach ye a lesson not to follow us agin  by this time the two yachts were once more so far apart that talking from one to the other became difficult  besides this the rover boys felt that they must turn their whole attention to the spray so no more was said  the yacht had been struck just at the water line and the hole made in her side was all of six inches in diameter  through this the water was pouring into the hold at a lively rate  were going down as sure as guns groaned tom  steer her right for the shore sam  this was done and just as the spray began to settle they ran upon a muddy and rocky flat about thirty feet from the river bank proper  there we cant go down now said dick with something of a sigh of relief  let us lower the mainsail and jib before the wind sends us over on our beam ends  the others understood the value of the advice and soon the mainsail of the yacht came down with a bang and the jib followed  the spray seemed inclined to list to port but stopped settling when her deck line touched the surface of the river  that settles yachting for the present said dick in deep disgust  and the worst of it is we havent even a small boat to go ashore in added sam  whats to do  there is a rowboat putting out from the shore now cried tom hullo there he shouted and waved his hand  the shout was returned and the rowboat was headed in their direction  as it came closer they saw that its occupant was a middleaged man of pleasant appearance  so you had a smashup eh shouted the man as soon as he came near  anybody hurt  our boat is hurt answered tom dryly  much of a hole  big enough to put us on the bottom  so i see  want me to take you ashore  yes put in dick if you will be kind enough to do it  certainly always willing to aid anybody in distress  that other craft run you down in short order didnt she  did you see it burst out sam eagerly  to be sure i did  then you know it was her fault  i do  she had no right to follow you up as she did  im glad you saw the mixup mr  martin harris is my name im an old boatman around herekeep boats to hire and the like and who is this im to take ashore  my name is sam rover  these are my two brothers dick and tom  do you know who it was ran into you  it was the falcon a yacht owned by a mr fenwick  his son and a man he called bill goss were aboard  at this martin harris drew down his mouth  a bad set those i know em well  and we know fenwick too put in dick hes a regular sneak  thats righttakes after his father who did his best to defraud me in a boat deal  and that bill goss is a sneak too and worse and martin harris shook his head decidedly  well we cant talk about those people now said dick  were in a mess and must get out of it the best way we can as you are an old boatman what would you advise us to do  come ashore with me and then get dan haskett to take your boat in charge and fix her up he can stop that leak somehow and pump her out and have her all right inside of twentyfour hours  where can we find this haskett  come into my boat and ill take you to him  the rowboat was now close at hand and one after another the rover boys stowed themselves away in the craft then martin harris took up the oars and started for the river bank  he turned down the stream a bit and landed them at an old dock over which hung the sign daniel haskett boat builder and repairer jobs promptly attended tocharges small  dan haskett proved to be an elderly man who was somewhat deaf and it took the boys some time to make him understand the situation  weve had a smashup began dick  cash up said the deaf man  cash up for what  weve had a smashup repeated the boy in a louder tone  we want our boat mended  whats ended asked the boat builder  your boat  almost ended roared tom wewantyoutofixupourboat he yelled  oh all right  where is she  dick pointed with his finger and at once the boat builder understood  theres a hole in her side bawled the boy  we want it patched up  all right i can do that  can we have her by tomorrow  hows that  and dan haskett placed his hand to his ear  canwehaveherbytomorrow yelled dick  i guess so  ill have to see how badly she is damaged first  haskett got out a small boat of his own and taking dick with him rowed over to the wreck  he pronounced the injury small and said the boys could have their boat by noon the next day  the charges would be twelve or fifteen dollars  well be getting off cheaper than i thought said tom on dicks return  ought to come out of mumps pocket  thats so added sam  by the way i wonder what he meant by saying we were dogging him  i cant say replied dick  but ive been thinking that he cant be up to any good or he wouldnt be so suspicious  just exactly my idea burst out tom  do you know what i half imagine  well  that mumps is cruising around waiting for dan baxter to join him  but baxter went to chicago  he wont stay therenot as long as his father is in the east he will be back before long if he isnt back already  but he took that money belonging to his father  what of that  his father cant do anything against him for he himself is worse than his son as we all know  besides his father is most likely still in the hospital  if you young gentlemen want to sail around until tomorrow noon i can take you out in one of my boats remarked martin harris ive got a firstclass yacht the searchlight that i can let you have reasonably  thanks but i would just as lief stay on shore until our boat is mended answered dick  but i want to pay you for what you did for us he added  oh thats all right  but the boys thought otherwise and in the end gave martin harris two dollars with which the boatman was highly pleased  remember i saw that accident he said on parting  i can prove it was the falcons fault  well remember that answered dick  from time to time they had watched the falcons course until the yacht had disappeared down the river  after a short debate the brothers decided to put up at a hotel which stood not far away on a high cliff overlooking the noble hudson  weve been on the water for nearly two weeks now said dick and to sleep in a real bed will be something of a novelty  as it was in the height of the summer season the hotel was crowded but some guests were just departing and they managed to get a fairly good room on the second floor  this had a double bed and a cot was added to accommodate sam dick and tom sleeping together as usual  it was supper time when the boys arrived and as soon as they had registered and washed up and combed their hair they descended to the spacious dining room where fully a score of tables were set  this way please said the head waiter and showed them to a table at one side overlooking one of the wide verandas of the hotel  im as hungry as a bear exclaimed tom  you cant serve us any too quick he added to the waiter who came up to take their orders  yes sah do the best i can sah grinned the colored man what kind of soup please  ill have oxtail began tom when he happened to glance out of the window  as his gaze fell upon a man sitting in an easy chair on the veranda he uttered a low whistle  by jinks boys look  josiah crabtree as sure as youre born he whispered     chapter iii  josiah crabtree frees his mind   the individual to whom tom referred had been a former master at putnam hall but his disagreeable ways had led to his dismissal by captain putnam  josiah crabtree was a tall slim individual with a sharp face and a very long nose  during the past term at putnam hall he had been very dictatorial to the rover boys and it must be confessed that they had made life anything but a bed of roses for him crabtree had been very desirous of marrying a certain widow by the name of stanhope but the marriage was opposed by dora the widows daughter and as dick was rather sweet on dora he had done all he could to aid the girl in breaking off the match even going so far as to send crabtree a bogus letter which had taken the teacher out to chicago on a hunt for a position in a private college that had never existed  dick knew that crabtree was comparatively poor and wished to marry the widow so that he could get his hands on the fortune which the lady held in trust for her only child  it is crabtree said dick as he gave a look  i wonder how he liked his trip to chicago laughed sam perhaps the midwest national college didnt suit his lofty ideas  hush dont let him hear you talk of that returned dick  he might get us into trouble  what kind of soup sah interrupted the waiter and then they broke off to give their order and the waiter hurried off to fill it  id like to know if he has been around the stanhope cottage again mused dick as he sipped his soup  dick cant bear to think of anybody around dora laughed tom  i dont want him around retorted the elder rover growing red in the face  he wants the stanhopes money and thats all he does want  i dont believe he really loves mrs stanhope  but why does she encourage him came from sam  why dont she send him about his business  oh she is sickly as you know and he seems to have a peculiar hypnotic influence over her at least thats what dora thinks  what are you laughing at tom  ii was thinking of the time we put the crabs in old crabtrees bed answered the younger brother  no you werent  well demanded tom as dick paused  you were laughing because i  mentioned dora and  pon my honor i wasnt smiled tom but his look belied his words  you were  if i mention her cousins grace and nellie laning i guess the laugh will be on you and sam  well call it quits answered tom hurriedly  theyre all nice girls eh sam  to be sure  but i say hadnt we best keep out of old crabtrees way  i dont know as its necessary said dick  im not afraid of him im sure  oh neither am i if you are going to put it that way answered the youngest rover  if hes stopping here im going to have some fun with him grinned tom  the evening meal was soon finished and the boys took a stroll around the grounds  they were just on the point of retiring when dick drew his brothers attention to a figure that was stealing through a nearby grove of trees  there goes crabtree  i wonder where he is going mused sam  where does that path lead to  down to the river came from tom  and then he added suddenly come let us follow him  whats the good grumbled dick  im tired out  there may be some chance for fun  come on and thus urged dick and sam followed their funloving brother  the path through the grove ran directly to the cliff overlooking the hudson at a point where a series of stone steps led up from the waters edge  as they gained a spot where they could look down upon the river dick uttered a short cry  look boys a yacht he said pointing through the moonlight ill wager it is the falcon  and mumps is coming to meet josiah crabtree put in sam  but what would he want to see crabtree about demanded tom  that remains to be seen remember at putnam hall the only friends josiah crabtree had were dan baxter and mumps  that is true dick  see crabtree has his handkerchief out and is waving it as a signal  and here comes somebody up the steps mumps sure enough whispered sam  let us get behind the trees and learn what is going on came from dick and the three brothers lost no time in secreting themselves in the immediate vicinity  well john ive been waiting for you said josiah crabtree as mumps came forward and the two shook hands  so have i been waiting for you returned the former sneak of putnam hall  why didnt you come yesterday  it was impossible to do so my lad  is that the falcon down there  it is  who is in charge of her  a sailor named bill goss  is he aahema man to be trusted  i guess i can trust him snickered mumps if he dared to give me away i could send him to jail  you mean that youerhave himahemin your power  thats it mr crabtree  very good  and is be a good sailor  as good as any on the river  then he can sail the yacht down the river without mishap  he can take her to florida if you wish to go that far  no i dont want to go that farat least not at present  dont you think you ought to let me in on your little game went on mumps earnestly  so far im in the dark  you will know all very soon johnand you shall be well paid for what you do  thats all right  but if it isnt lawful  i will protect you never fear  where is dan baxter  hush  it will be best not to mention his name my lad  but where is he  i cannot say exactly  is he around lake cayuga  wellahemmore than likely he is  to tell the truth he is very anxious to see his father  to bone him for some more money  i think not  daniel thinks a great deal of his parent and when mr baxter was so seriously injured  dan didnt care much for that  he isnt that kind  daniel is a better boy than you think john  he loves his parent and when that imp of a rover got mr baxter into trouble daniel was very much exercised over it  gracious but thats rich murmured dick  i got him into trouble  i guess the rascal did that for himself  well we wont talk about that professor went on mumps  you didnt stay in chicago long  no iahemthe position offered to me did not suit my views so i declined it  geechristopher came from tom and each of the rovers could scarcely keep from laughing  i think those rover boys put up a job on you said mumps  at least i got an inkling that way  indeed  i would like to wring their necks the imps burst out josiah crabtree  oh what have i not suffered at their hands at one hotel where i stopped they placed live crabsbut let that pass the subject is too painful  to come back to the point  i can have the falcon at any time that i may need her  yes  and you will promise to say nothing to a soul about what is done on the trip i propose  i will  very good you see this is aera delicate matter  are you going to marry mrs stanhope and use the yacht for your honeymoon said mumps somewhat slyly  hardlyalthough that would not be a bad idea my lad  but now i have a different deal on handsomething very much different  if you do not object ill take a look at your yacht and interview this sailor you mention  all right come ahead  mumps led the way down the rocky steps and josiah crabtree followed moving slowly that he might not fall  creeping to the edge of the cliff the rover boys saw the pair reach the falcon and go on board  now what is in the wind said dick as soon as the pair were out of hearing  thats a conundrum replied tom ill wager one thing thoughold crabtree is up to no good  i believe you are right  i wish we could hear the rest of what is going on  cant we get close to the yacht suggested sam  see the sky is clouding over  i dont believe they will see us going down the stairs  they talked the plan over for a moment then began to descend the steps keeping as low down as possible and close to some brush which grew up in the crevices of the stones  soon the river bank was gained at a point not over fifty feet from where the yacht lay  they halted behind a large stone close to the waters edge  by straining their eyes in the darkness they saw mumps crabtree and bill goss in earnest conversation in the stern of the vessel a low murmur came to their ears but not a word could be understood  we must get closer was dicks comment when to the surprise of all they saw the sailor hoist the mainsail of the falcon  a gentle breeze was blowing and soon the yacht was leaving the shore  they watched the craft until the gathering darkness hid her entirely from view     chapter iv  the disastrous result of a trick   shes gone  yes and i wonder where to tom  i dont believe the yacht will go very far said sam  maybe old crabtree merely wants to see what sort of a sailing craft she is  we can watch here for a while returned dick  they sat down on a rock and waited in the meantime discussing the strange situation  they could reach no conclusion but that josiah crabtree had some plot he wanted to put into execution and its something underhand too was dicks comment  at last they grew tired of waiting and almost fell asleep  this being the case they returned to the hotel and made their way to the bed chamber  soon each was sleeping soundly  when they awoke the sun was shining brightlyand it was halfpast seven oclock  all up shouted tom and dragged sam out by the foot  soon they were dressed and made their way to the dining room  they had scarcely seated themselves when josiah crabtree came in and was shown to a seat directly opposite the boys  he did not notice them at first and began to eat a dish of oatmeal silently and rapidly  tom nudged sam and the younger rover nudged his oldest brother and a snicker went up  at this josiah crabtree glanced at them carelessly  then he started back in amazement  whyerwhyahemso it is you he stammered ierwhere did you come from  we came from our bedroom answered tom promptly  where did you come from mr crabtree   whyerdont be impertinent rover  i might say that i came from my bedroom too  i thought you came from the river remarked dick carelessly  from the river  yes  you areahem mistaken my lad  i have not been near the riverat least not since i came up from new york on the boat  stopping here for the summer put in sam  i do not know as that is any of your business samuel  i am no longer a master at putnam hall and when i left that place i washed my hands of all those connected with that place  a good thing for the hall sir came from tom  dont be insulting rover  you go your way and ill go mine  as you please sir  you spoke to us first  ill take good care and not do it again  but this looks as if you were following me up  thats what mumps said cried sam before he had stopped to think twice  ha  so you have met mumi mean john fenwick  we met him on the river  and he said you had been following him  never mind mr crabtree we wont talk any more put in dick with a warning glance at sam  he turned to the waiter  some fish please trout and see that the biscuits are warm  yes sah grinned the negro  tom at once took the cue  its going to be a warm day he said to dick  i wonder how sailing was last night put in sam slyly  at this josiah crabtree looked as black as a thundercloud  you boys have been playing the sneak on me he cried  take my advice and beware of what you do in the future  i wasnt talking to you retorted sam kindly keep your remarks to yourself  by this time others were coming to the table consequently the crossfire of words had to come to an end josiah crabtree finished his repast as speedily as possible and strode out of the dining room in high but suppressed anger  hes a corker remarked tom  i believe hed half kill us if he dared  i guess he hasnt forgotten how i stopped him from maltreating dora stanhope said dick  i wish i knew if he had been around their place since he came back from the west  of course he has been back said tom  and hell marry mrs stanhope yetsee if he dont  not if i can help dora prevent it said his elder brother firmly  breakfast finished they walked out to learn what had become of crabtree  they were just in time to see him leaving the hotel valise in hand  hes off said tom  i wonder where he is bound  let us follow him and find out returned dick  this did not prove to be an easy matter for at the foot of the hotel grounds josiah crabtree jumped into a stage which was in waiting bound for the depot  hes off on the train i guess said sam and the others were inclined to agree with him  down at the river shore nothing could be seen of the falcon and they concluded that mumps had also taken himself off  the morning was spent around the hotel in reading the newspapers and taking it easy out on the beautiful lawn  hullo heres a novelty cried tom presently and pointed to an italian who was coming up to the hotel  the fellow had a small hand organ and a trained bear and two monkeys  the monkeys were dressed in red white and blue and sat on the bears back as he trotted along  hes going to give us a performance said sam as the italian came to a halt in the center of the grounds  there they go  the music started and at once the bear reared himself on his hind legs and began to dance  in the meantime the monkeys climbed to the bears head and began a little dance of their own  now for a little sport whispered tom and started for the hotel  be careful of yourself warned dick that bear looks as if he wasnt to be trifled with  but tom did not heed him his whole mind being bent on having a laugh at the expense of the italian and his animals  going around to the kitchen of the hotel he procured a couple of sugar cakes pierced them with pinholes and filled them up with pepper  when he returned he found that a crowd had gathered and the italian was passing around the hat  while sam and dick contributed several cents tom gave the bear one bun and divided the other between the two monkeys  cheep cheep went the monkeys as if highly pleased  youre right they are cheap grinned tom  hope you like the flavor  the monkeys began to eat ravenously for they were nearly starved  but they had not swallowed many mouthfuls before they noticed something wrong  then one threw his bun at tom in a rage  a second later the other monkey leaped back on the bears head and began to dance and scratch wildly in the meanwhile scattering the bun crumbs in all directions  hi hi whata you do to de monks demanded the italian  you letta de monks alone  im not touching the monks replied tom and slipped out of sight in the crowd  by this time the bear had swallowed the larger portion of the bun given to him  it was the more peppery of the two and it brought tears to the beasts eyes  with a roar of rage he turned and shook the monkey from his head and leaped away from his keeper dragging his chain after him  the monkeys were evidently not used to seeing the bear in an ugly mood and at once they sought safety by getting out of his reach one leaped into a tree and ran like a cat to the top while the second pounced on the shoulder of an elderly damsel who looked exactly what she was a hottempered old maid  oh dear screamed the elderly damsel  take the horrid thing off  take it off this minute  come here jocko roared the italian  come jocko and he held out his hands  but jocko had no intention of coming  instead he clung the closer his two forefeet in the ladys hair  the hair was largely false and all of a sudden a long switch came loose and fell to the ground  at this the damsel screeched at the top of her lungs and caught at the hair the monkey cried too in concert and then a young man rushed in to the rescue  but jockos blood was up and leaping to the young mans shoulder he tore off his straw hat and began to pull it to bits  then with the hat still in his possession he made a leap to the tree and joined his brother at the top  by this time the uproar was general and it seemed to anger the bear still more  he had been rushing over the lawn upsetting easy chairs and benches but now he charged straight for the crowd  look out for the bear  the beast is going mad and will chew somebody up  shoot him somebody before we are all killed  such were some of the cries which rang out  the italian turned pale with anger and alarm  no shootta marcus he cried  no shootta heem  he de goodda bear  then catch him put in the proprietor of the hotel  catch him and tie him up  but this the italian could not do and when the bear headed for him he ran as hard as anybody present  around and around the grounds fled the people some rushing for the hotel and the others to the stables and to a large summer house  the bear made first for one and then another but at last halted in front of the stable which now contained the rover boys two ladies and an elderly man and two colored hostlers  shut the doors cried dick but his words were unnecessary for the colored men were already closing them the bar had scarcely been dropped into place when the bear hurled himself with all force against the barrier  he is going to break in the door cried one of the ladies  let us go upstairs said the elderly gentleman and lost no time in leading the way  there was a back door to close and one of the negroes started for this  but just as he got close to the door he saw the bear coming and uttering a wild yell he too made for the stairs  tom was close at hand and it must be confessed that he felt thoroughly sorry over what he had done  im responsible for all of it he groaned  then as the bear stepped close to the back door he got behind the barrier and tried to shove it shut  the result was a surprise for both boy and bear for as the beast made a leap the edge of the door caught him and in a twinkle the animal was held fast by the neck between the door and its frame     chapter v  a nevertobeforgotten swim   ive got him fast  help  help  toms caught the bear shouted sam  can you hold him tom  i guess i can if some of you will help me  panted the youth hurry up  sam and dick were on the stairs but now both ran to their brothers assistance and all three pushed upon the door with all of their strength  the barrier groaned and creaked and it looked as if at any instant it would burst from its hinges  gracious we cant hold him very long gasped sam  cant somebody hit the animal with a club  i reckon i can do dat shouted one of the hostlers and caught up an axhandle which stood in one corner  as he approached the bear the beast uttered a roar of commingled rage and fear and this was so terrorizing to the colored man that he dropped the axhandle and ran for his very life  come back here cried tom  cant do it boss hes gwine ter chew me up howled the hostler  hold the doorill hit him put in sam and he picked up the axhandle stepping forward struck out heavily and the bear dropped in a heap completely dazed and more than half choked to death  by this time the italian was again at hand in one pocket he carried a thin but strong line in a twinkle he had tied one fore and one hind leg together so that the bear when he got up again could do little but hobble along then from another pocket he drew a leather muzzle which he buckled over the beasts head but the bear had had all of the ugliness knocked out him and was once more as docile as ever  tom whispered dick  i guess the best we can do is to get out of this place  if folks discover the trick you played theyll mob you  i guess youre right but wholl settle our bill  ill do that said sam  they know i wasnt near the bear when the rumpus started  so it was agreed and while tom and dick left the hotel grounds sam strolled into the office to pay their bill it was some time before the clerk came to wait on him  say i believe your brother started this kickup observed the clerk  what demanded sam in pretended astonishment  i say i think he started this kickup  what kickup  the one with the bear of course  why my brothers helped to catch the beast  i know that but one of em started it  what do you want  i want to pay our bill  how much is it  going to leave  yes  think you had better eh  we only hired our room until this noon sam drew himself up if you want your pay you be civil  yes but  the clerk broke off short  that will be six dollars please  all right there you are and sam shoved the bills over now dont say we created a muss or ill report you to the proprietor  yes but see here  ive not got my glasses just now  goodby and  that man hasnt got his monkeys yet and  whats that to you  are you afraid the proprietor will put one of em in here in your place  and before the clerk could say another word sam ran off and joined his brothers at the river bank  soon the three reached the dock where the spray lay undergoing repairs  the deaf man was just finishing his work  shell be about as good as ever he said in reply to dicks question  shes a fine boat  i guess he says that of every boat that brings him in a job murmured sam come on  he went aboard and the others followed  dan haskett was paid off the mainsail was hoisted and once more they stood up the river in the direction of the state capital  it was their intention to spend two days in albany and then return to new york with the yacht  this would wind up their vacation for putnam hall was to open on the following monday  the day proved an ideal one but the wind was light and the yacht scarcely moved even with the mainsail and jib set to their fullest  this being so the boys got out their fishing lines and spent an hour in trolling and succeeded in catching several fairsized fish  well have to cook our own dinner remarked dick  tom since you did us out of our meal at the hotel i reckon you are the one to fall in for this work  at this tom cut a wry face but still seeing the justice of his elder brothers remark he went at the dinnergetting with a will  the yacht boasted a kerosene stove and over this he set fish to frying and a pot of potatoes to boiling  as the river was calm and the yacht steady the little stove worked very well  they were still out of sight of albany when the midday meal was pronounced ready  in addition to the articles already mentioned they had coffee bread and butter and what was left of a cocoanut pie purchased the day previous  the boys were all hearty eaters and the food disappeared as if by magic  after dinner the breeze died out utterly and sam proposed that they cast anchor close to shore and take a swim  the others were willing and soon they had disrobed and donned their bathing trunks and were sporting in the water to their hearts content  the water was somewhat colder than they had anticipated and the effect upon sam was disastrous  the youngest rover had eaten more heartily than either of his brothers and this made him sick at the stomach  however as he did not wish to alarm dick and tom and so spoil their fun he said nothing about his condition  let us race each other suggested tom and started off up the shore with dick close beside him  sam brought up in the rear but soon gave up the contest  help  the single cry reached the ears of tom and dick when they were fully a hundred feet from the spray  both turned just in time to behold sam throw up his arms and sink from view  great caesar burst out dick  what can that mean  maybe he is only fooling replied tom yet i wouldnt think he would be so foolish  i dont think sam is fooling said dick seriously and at once struck out to where the youngest rover had gone down  of course tom went with him  to reach the spot was not an easy matter and they were still some distance away when they saw sam come up again  then there was a wild circling of arms and the boy disappeared once more  he is drowning gasped dick hoarsely  come we must save him tom  yes yes was the puffing answer for tom was swimming as never before and for a brief instant he remembered that awful adventure sam had had at humpback falls the summer previous  at that time the youngest rover had nearly lost his life in the water  it was dick who gained the spot first just as sam came up and went down againtotally unconscious  diving the elder rover caught his brother around the chest under the arms  sam sam what is it he questioned and as no reply came back his heart almost stopped beating  what if his brother was dead the agony of the thought was terrible beyond description  can i help you  the question came from tom who was now at the side of the others  catch hold of one arm if you will answered dick  hes a dead weight  oh  the moan came so unexpectedly that both tom and dick were amazed  then of a sudden sam opened his eyes and clutched dick by the throat  save me  clearly the youngest rover was out of his mind or he would not have taken such a hold  as it was dick was nearly strangled and had to unlock the fingers by sheer force  then sam grabbed him again and it looked as if both would go down to a watery grave  but now tom came to the rescue  swimming up from behind he caught sam first under one armand then under the other in a backtoback fashion  then he bent forward and began to tread water thus holding his brothers head well out of water  push us ashore dick he panted and understanding the movement perfectly the elder brother did as desired soon all three gained a point from which tom could wade to the river bank with ease  it was an anxious pair that bent over sam who rested on his back with his eyes closed  but the youngest rover was not allowed to remain long in that position  tom and dick knew something of how to handle a person who is nearly drowned and they now made use of this knowledge with all speed  sam was rolled and hoisted up by the ankles and thus he got rid of a large quantity of the water he had swallowed  yet even when he came to his senses he was too weak to walk and tom had to bring the spray close to shore and the sufferer had to be carried on board his brothers wading up to their waists for that purpose  the first cramp i got was in the stomach said sam when he could talk  then it went all over me like an electric shock and i felt i was going to drown  what happened after that was like some awful dream  and he shuddered  it was a long while before any of them got over that adventure     chapter vi  an unexpected meeting   as just related the boys had brought the spray as closely inshore as possible  all were now in the cabin dick and tom attending to sams wants and consequently no one noticed the passage of one of the palatial steamers that make daily trips between new york and the capital of the state  these steamers in running so fast cast out long rollers on both sides that go tumbling shoreward one after another  the rollers now caught the spray and sent her dancing up and down like a cork  hullo were in danger shouted tom and rushed for the deck with dick almost at his heels  the anchor was dragging and unless pushed off the yacht would soon be pounding on the rocks  ill put up the sail roared dick  you bring up the anchor  i guess you had better pole her off replied tom nevertheless he did as dick requested working like a beaver  the wind was still faint and when the mainsail was hoisted it failed to fill  seeing this dick seized a pole and tom did the same  they speedily found that they could not send the yacht out any distance  but with a pole at the bow and another at the stern they managed to keep her off the rocks until the rollers began to go down then they shoved off with ease and moved slowly up the river  ill tell you what in handling a boat you have got to have your weather eye open all the time observed tom  yes and you want to have it open on all sides of you smiled dick  if you dont youll catch it before you are aware  sam lay on one of the tiny berths with which the spray was provided  his face was deathly white and to use his own words he felt as weak as a rag  im just beginning to realize how close to death i was he whispered to tom  it was awfully good of you and dick to do what you did  pooh you would do just as much for us sam answered the funloving brother  but just the same he gave sams hand a tight squeeze on the quiet  what was that thumping tom asked the younger brother a bit later  the rollers from a big steamer nearly put us on the rocks  gracious more perils  dont you think we had better give up our outing on the water  it will come to an end in a few days sam  well make the trip to albany and that will be the last of it  it was nightfall by the time they came up to the capital city getting the necessary permission to tie up at one of the private wharves they locked up the cabin of the spray and went ashore  tom rover as i live  and dick and sam too  the cry came from up the street and soon a boy of dicks age was running to meet them  it was frank harrington their old school chum and roommate of dormitory no 6  frank came from the three and a general handshaking followed  what brings you here asked dick  why dont you know my folks moved up to albany from new yorkfathers in the state senate now you know returned frank with pride  oh thats soand you are a senators son put in tom  i guess well have to tip our hats to you after this and call you mr harrington  stow it tom and keep your jokes until school opens interrupted frank  yes we live here and i thought you knew all about it  i sent you a letter  weve been away from home for several weeks explained dick and told of their outing on the water  it must be jolly  my father owns a boat but we seldom use it so you are going to stay in albany over tomorrow  if thats the case you must come up to our house  i wont hear of your going to a hotel  will that arrangement suit your folks questioned dick  oh yes  the girls are all awaydown to asbury parkand so is mother and father and i and the servants have the whole mansion to ourselves  i can tell you its just a bit lonely at times and im real glad you came concluded frank  if your father is a senator perhaps you can get us a pass through the capitol building put in sam  you wont need a pass  ill go with you  but sam you look sick  sams tale had to be told to frank who meanwhile led the way to a street car boarding this the boys soon reached the harrington mansion located on one of albanys finest thoroughfares here they met senator harrington and were speedily introduced  ive heard of you before smiled the senator  he was a pleasantlooking man of fortyfive  frank says the rover boys were the whole schoolor something like that  at this there was a laugh  i guess he must have been one of the rovers then rejoined tom he was just as good as any of us and then there was another laugh and the newcomers felt perfectly at home  there was a concert company in town and receiving permission from his father to do so frank took his friends to see the performance  the singing was very good and despite the fact that it was still warm weather the concert hall was packed  the program was a long one and with the numerous encores did not come to an end until nearly eleven oclock  that was immense remarked tom when they were coming out  i wish i could sing like that tenor  we ought to get up a quartet at the hall put in frank  i understand they had a singing club year before last  were going to have a banjo club said dick  larry colby wrote to me about it  he has a new banjo that cost fifteen dollars and he  dick broke off short as a slouchylooking man brushed against him the eyes of the man and the boy met and then the man disappeared in the crowd as if by magic  well i never  whats the matter dick came from all the others  didnt you see him  see who  buddy girk the tramp thief the fellow who used to train with dan baxters father  what the fellow who stole your watch and broke jail at rootville came from tom  the same  where is he now questioned sam  i dont know  the instant he saw me he skipped  ill wager he wasnt in the crowd for any good purpose went on dick as he remembered how he had suffered the loss of his timepiece at buddy girks hands  dick had had a good deal of trouble in recovering the article  he ought to be pointed out to the police put in frank  its not safe to have such men at large  i wish i could collar him and make him talk about fathers affairs grumbled tom  why did he know anything of your fathers affairs exclaimed frank harrington in astonishment  i think so  you see arnold baxter tried to defraud my father out of some western mining property and this buddy girk was mixed up in the affairhow i dont exactly know  i see  by the way tom have you heard anything of your father yet  not a word and toms face grew sober  it does beat all what has become of him doesnt it he added  i should think you would want to go and hunt him up  weve talked about that already but uncle randolph who is our guardian thinks it would prove a wildgoose chase  he says the interior of africa is a big place to hunt any man in  hes right there  but still i would want to hunt for him even if i had to go into the very jungles to do it  well go some dayunless father turns up put in dick decidedly  if uncle randolph wont go well go alone  but i would like to meet this buddy girk he continued after a brief pause  the boys had to walk to the corner of the block to get aboard of a street car and while waiting there somewhat in the shadow sam pulled dick by the coat sleeve  there he goes  who  buddy girk  see him sneaking along the buildings over there and the youngest rover pointed with his hand  all saw the figure and tom at once proposed that they follow the fellow  frank was willing and away they went across the street and also into the gloom  buddy girk was making good time past a number of business buildings which at this hour of the night were locked and barred up and practically deserted  i wonder if he saw us start to follow him whispered dick after several blocks had been passed  i dont think so  if he had its more than likely that he would have legged it to get away  hehullo hes going into that alleyway  as tom spoke he pointed to an opening between two tall office buildings  reaching the spot they saw at the foot of the alleyway a couple of tenement houses  buddy girk was ascending the steps of one of the houses and presently he disappeared within the dark hall  he must be stopping here remarked sam  that is something worth knowingif we want to put the police on his track  i might have him arrested at once suggested dick  he may not be here in the morning  why dont you go and have a talk with him came from frank he may get scared and tell you all you want to know about that mining business  by jinks there is something in that cried dick  dont you get into trouble warned tom  he may prove an ugly customer if you corner him  lets all go in said sam  he wont dare to do much with four against him  the subject was discussed for a few minutes and they resolved to follow sams advice dick to lead the way and learn just how the land lay  then all walked down the alleyway and toward the tenement little dreaming of the surprise in store for them     chapter vii  dick is made a prisoner   the hallway of the tenement was pitchdark the door standing open for a foot or more from a rear room came a thin stream of light under a door and a low murmur of voices  i guess he went to the rear whispered dick  you wait around the corner till i see  noiselessly he entered the hallway and walked to the door of the rear room  listening he heard an irishman and his wife talking over some factory work the man had been promised  girk cant be there he thought when he heard an upper door open  hullo buddy back again muttered a strangely familiar voice and then the upper door was closed and locked  wondering where he had heard that voice before dick came forward again and ascended the rickety stairs  they creaked dismally and he fully expected to see somebody come out and demand what was going on  but nobody came and soon the upper hall was gained and he reached the door which he rightfully guessed had just been opened and closed  yes everything is all okay were the first words to reach his ears  but i had a sweet job to find mooney  hes cracked on music it seems and had gone to a concert instead of attending to business  but he wont fail us tomorrow morning came in a second voice and now dick recognized the speaker as arnold baxter his fathers worst enemy who had been left at the hospital in ithaca with a broken limb and several smashed ribs  baxter had tackled dick while the two were on a moving train and while trying to throw the boy off had gotten the worst of the encounter by tumbling off himself  arnold baxter is it possible muttered dick to himself  he must have a constitution like iron to get around so soon  no mooney wont fail us said buddy girk  i gave him a mighty good talkin to i did  i cant afford to have him go back on us growled arnold baxter  im not well enough yet to do this job alone  how does your chest feel  oh the ribs seem to be all right  but my leg isnt  i shouldnt wonder but what ill have to limp more or less for the rest of my life  that puts me in mind whom do you reckon i clapped eyes on down at the concert hall tonight  im sure i dont know any of our enemies  those three rover boys  what arnold baxter pushed back his chair in amazement  can they bebe following me he gasped  no  i saw em by accident  they had been to the concert  but they dont belong here  they live on a farm called valley brook near the village of dexters corners  they were with another boya welldressed chap  maybe they are paying him a visit  arnold baxter shook his head  i dont like this  if they have got wind of anything  but how could they get wind persisted buddy girk  that would remain to be found out  you must remember buddy that they are down on me because of that row i once had with their father over that gold mine  i know it  and by the way i never got nothin out of that deal neither growled buddy girk  didnt i tell you that some papers were missing  i half believe anderson rover took them with him when he set out for africa  then they are gone for good  not if he comes back buddy that man is like his boysbound to turn up when you least expect it that gold mine waswhats that  arnold baxter stopped short and leaped to his feet  a wrangle in the hallway just outside of the door had interrupted him  vot vos you doin here hey came in a heavy german voice  i dink me you vos up to no goot hey  let me go came from dick  i have done no harm  i dink you vos von sneak thief alretty  stand still bis i find owit  its dutch jake cried buddy girk  he has collared somebody in the hall  ill see who it is  he threw open the door and allowed the light of a lamp to fall on dick and the burly man who had captured the youth  great smoke  its one of dem rover boys he cried dropping into his oldtime manner of speech  wot are you doin here  you know dot young feller demanded the man who had been mentioned as dutch jake  yes i do and hes up to no good here replied buddy girk  den maybe i best kick him owit kvick hey  yesnowait a minute girk turned to arnold baxter here is that oldest rover boy spying on us  ha  i told you they were regular rats for that sort of work fumed arnold baxter  dont let him go  why not  he may know too much  bring him in here till i question him  not much burst out dick  help  help  his cries came to a sudden ending as buddy girk clapped a large and somewhat dirty hand over his mouth  run him in here jake said the former tramp  he is a fellow we have an account to settle with  is dot so  vell i tont vont me no troubles answered the german doubtfully  its all righthehe stole some of our money  thats right in with him and dick was run into the room after which dutch jake retired as suddenly as he had appeared  he was an elderly man of a queer turn of mind and all by himself occupied a garret room of the tenement  as soon as the door was locked arnold baxter faced dick  now will you keep quiet or shall i knock you over with this he demanded and raised a heavy cane he had grown into the habit of carrying since he had escaped from the hospital on the very day that the authorities were going to transfer him to the jail at ithaca  dont you dare to touch me arnold baxter cried the boy boldly  will you keep quiet  that depends  what do you want of me  you followed girk to this place and were spying on us  i think i had a right to follow girk  he is wanted by the authorities as you know  you heard us planning to do something  perhaps i did  i know you did  all right then dont ask me about it  you think that you are a smart boy growled baxter uneasily  thank you for nothing  dont get impudent  that is what old crabtree used to say  the rovers always were too important for their own good young man  we know how to do the fair thing by othersand that is more than you  shut up im in no humor to listen to your preaching  then open the door and let me go  not just yet  i want to know how much you overheard of my talk with buddy girk  i reckon he heard all of it growled the fool  if i was you baxter i wouldnt let him go at all  you would keep him a prisoner  buddy girk nodded  but we cant guard him buddy  we wont want to guard him  just bind him hands and feet and stuff a gag in his mouth and there you are  would you leave him in this room  i dont know  girk scratched his tangled head of hair  no i wouldnt  ill tell you where to take him  he finished by whispering into arnold baxters ear  at once the rascals face brightened and he nodded  just the thing he muttered  it will serve him right  are you going to let me go demanded dick uneasily for he saw that the two were plotting to do him injury  no came from both  without another word dick leaped for the door  the key was in the lock but ere he could turn it buddy girk hauled him back  a scuffle followed which came to a sudden termination when arnold baxter raised his heavy cane and struck the boy on the back of the head  with a million stars dancing before his eyes poor dick went down completely dazed  girk lost no time in following up the advantage thus gained and by the time dick felt like rising he found his hands bound behind him and a gag of knotted cloth stuffed into his mouth  then his feet were fastened together and he was rolled up in an old blanket much the worse for wear and the want of washing  now come on before anybody else spots us exclaimed baxter if you can lift him alone ill bring the light  im no good on the carry yet  all right light the way answered buddy girk and took up the form of the boy  taking up the smoky lamp arnold baxter led the way out of a rear door to a side hallway  here two flights of stairs led to a low and ill ventilated cellar  the underground apartment had never been used for anything but old rubbish and this was piled high on all sides  here we are said baxter as he paused in front of what had once been a stone coal bin  dump him in there and shut the door on him  i dont believe hell get out in any hurry  dicks form was dropped on a heap of dirty newspapers and straw then girk and baxter left the bin  there was a heavy door to the place and this they closed and shoved the rusty bolt into the socket  in a second more they were on their way upstairs again and dick was left to his fate     chapter viii  the search for dick   dick is taking his time thats certain  the remark came from sam after the boys who had been left in the alleyway had waited the best part of half an hour for the elder rovers reappearance  perhaps he has found something of interest suggested frank  and perhaps he has fallen into a trap put in tom  ive a good mind to hunt him up  if you go ill go with you said sam  i dont want to be left out here alone said frank  let us wait a little longer  the best part of an hour passed but of course nothing was seen or heard of dick  i shant wait any longer began tom when they saw the front door of the tenement opened and two men hurried forth  both had their hats pulled far down over their eyes and had their coat collars turned up even though the night was warm  out of sight cried sam in a low voice and they dropped down behind the stoop of the second tenement  one of those men was buddy girk ejaculated tom when the pair had passed up the alleyway  and dont you know who the other was demanded sam  it was dan baxters father  impossible sam  arnold baxter is in the hospital and  it was dan baxters father as true as im born tom  no wonder he walked with a cane  am i not right frank  i dont know im sure i dont remember dans father  but that was buddy girk beyond a doubt  all of the boys were considerably excited and wondered if it would be best to follow up the vanishing pair  id do it if i was certain dick was safe cried tom  im going to hunt for him he added and before the others could stop him he entered the tenement  he stumbled around the lower hallway for several minutes and then called out softly  dick  dick  where are you  no answer came back and he continued his search  then lighting a match he mounted the rickety stairs and called out again  phat are ye araisin such a row about demanded an irish voice suddenly and a front room door was thrown open  cant ye let a dasent family slape  im looking for my brother replied tom  sorry to disturb you  have you seen anything of him  sure an i dont know yer brother from the side av sole leather by  go long an let me an me family slape replied the irishman  ive got to find my brother sir  im afraid he has met with foul play  he came to see the men who just went out  oh is that so now  foul play is it  i thought them newcomers was up to no good  i heard em carryin on in their room a while ago  which room is it please  there ye arethe wan on the lift  is the dure open  tom tried the door  no its lockedthe two men just went out  he raised his voice  dick  where are you  dick  if yez call like that yez will have the wholt tiniment aroused said the irishman  an its a bad crowd on the nixt flure i kin tell ye that  i cant help iti am bound to find my brother replied tom desperately  disappearing for a moment the irishman came out half dressed and with a lighted candle in his hand  by this time sam and frank had followed tom to the upper floor  soon several men and women put in an appearance including dutch jake  who vos dot poy you vos look for asked the aged german  vos he der von vot was standin by dis door apout an hour ago  i guess so said tom  dem mans vot got dis room open der door und took him inside  took him inside burst out sam and tom simultaneously  yah replied dutch jake but failed to add that he had had anything to do with the capture  von of dem say dot poy vos stole some money alretty  it was a cockandbull story to make him a prisoner said tom im going to find him if i can and he threw himself on the door with all of his strength  at first the barrier refused to budge but when sam and frank also pushed it gave way with a bang hurling the trio to the floor inside  by this time the excitement had been communicated to the next tenement in which lived caleb yates the landlord of the two buildings  yates a sourminded old man lost no time dressing and coming over armed with a nightstick  what does this disturbance mean he demanded in a highpitched voice  who broke this door in  we did replied tom boldly  we want to find my brother and he related how dick had disappeared  i know nothing of your trouble with my tenants said caleb yates  but i wont have my property destroyed  im going to find my brother if i have to turn the house upside down  and i am going to find him too put in sam  do you know that the men who have this room are thieves and that one of them broke jail at rootville  i dont believe your yarn boythey looked like very respectable gentlemen both of them  you had better go about your businessafter you have paid me for breaking down the door  you shant ransack their property  if you stop us ill call in the police and have you arrested came promptly from tom  this threat nearly took away caleb yates breath  arrested he gasped  yes arrested  my brother came in here and is missing  those two men are our enemies  if you want to keep out of trouble you will help us to hunt up my brother  that is just what you had better do sir added frank  and who are you demanded the irate landlord  i am frank harrington son of senator harrington  at this unexpected announcement the jaw of the landlord dropped perceptibly whyeri didnt know you were senator harringtons son he stammered  i think if you wish to keep out of trouble you had best aid us all you can  the young man we are after came in here a short while ago and has utterly disappeared  i am afraid he has met with foul play  but mr arson and mr noble are gone  is that the names they were known under  yes  their right names are girk and baxter  they left the building just before we came up  what was your brother doing here asked caleb yates in a calmer tone  he was not my brother but my warmest friend  he was tracking the short man the fellow whose name is girk  girk once robbed him of his watch  i see  and you are sure of your men  if you are search away for i want no shady characters in these houses  the search began immediately several of the inmates of the tenements taking part  everything in the room girk and baxter had occupied was turned topsyturvy but no trace of dick was brought to light until tom looked under the table  heres his pocketknife he cried and held the article up this proves that he came in here beyond a doubt  yes but where is he now put in sam  they couldnt have spirited him away  he cant be far off said frank  again was the search renewed  the men had had one large room and one small apartment where were located a dilapidated bed and a small writing table  on the table lay some writing material and several scraps of paper but they were of no value  the search through the rooms and hallways of the tenement lasted fully an hour  by this time the tenants who had gathered began to grow sleepy again and one after another went back to their apartments  i dont think you are going to find anything remarked caleb yates  to my way of thinking that boy must have followed the two men when they left  he couldnt do that without our seeing him said sam  and why not  heres a back door remember and its pretty dark outside  that may be so returned tom shaking his curly head in perplexity its too bad we didnt follow girk and baxter upat least as far as the street  perhaps dick is at our house waiting for us to come back put in frank  let us go home and see  we can come back early in the morning he looked at his watch  do you know that it is after two oclock  im afraid my father will worry about me  they talked the matter over and decided to return to franks home without further delay  it was a silent trio that walked the streets which were now practically deserted  tom and sam were much worried and frank hardly less so for the senators son and dick had been warm friends for years  when they reached the mansion they found senator harrington pacing the library nervously  well here you are at last he cried  i was wondering what had become of you  he listened to their tale with close attention  no dick has not come in he said at least i think not run up to the bedrooms frank and see  frank did as requested and soon returned  no he isnt about he said disappointedly  its mighty queer what became of him     chapter ix  a loss of importance   half stunned dick lay for a long time on the newspapers and musty straw in the disused coal bin of the tenement cellar  this is what i call tough luck he muttered to himself and tried to force the somewhat loose gag from his mouth  but it would not come  as soon as he felt strong enough he began to work on the rope which bound his hands together  but the rascals who had placed him in the cellar had done their work well and the cord refused to budge  with difficulty he managed to stand erect  the bin was not only pitchdark but full of cobwebs and the latter brushed over his face whenever he moved  then a spider crawled on his neck greatly adding to his discomfort  hour after hour went by and poor dick was wondering what the end of the adventure would be when he heard a footstep overhead and then came the indistinct murmur of voice  somebody is in the room overhead he thought and tried to make himself heard  but before he could do this the footsteps moved off and he heard the slamming of a door  then all became as quiet as before  an hour more went by and the youth began to grow desperate  he was thirsty and his mouth and nose were filled with dust and dirt rendering him far from comfortable  in moving around his foot came in contact with an empty tomato can and this gave him an idea  he knelt down and with the can between his heels tried to saw apart the rope which bound his hands behind him  the position was an awkward one and the job long and tiring but at last the rope gave way and he found his hands free  he lost no further time in ridding himself of the gag and the rope which bound his feet  he was now free so far as his bodily movements went but he soon discovered that the coal bin was without any opening but a long narrow chute covered with an iron plate and that the heavy door was securely bolted  with all force he threw himself against the door but it refused to budge  presently he remembered that he had several loose matches in his vest pocket and taking out one of these he lit it and then set fire to a thick shaving that was handy and which being damp burnt slowly  hullo heres something of a trapdoor he exclaimed as he gazed at the flooring above head  i wonder if i can get out that way  he dropped the lighted shaving in a safe spot and put up his hands  the cutout spot in the flooring went up with ease and dick saw a fairly well furnished room beyond  through one of the windows of the room he saw that daybreak was at hand  great caesar  ive been down here all night he ejaculated and putting out the light leaped up and drew himself through the opening  once in the room he put the trap down again and rearranged the rag carpet he had shoved out of place  the door to the room was locked so the boy hurried to the window  throwing open the blinds he was about to leap out into the tenement alley when a woman suddenly confronted him  she was tall and heavy and had a red disagreeable face  what are you doing in my rooms young fellow she demanded  im trying to get out of this house  what are youa thief  no  i was locked up in the cellar by a couple of bad men and got out by coming through a trapdoor in your floor  a likely story sneered the woman who had been away during the night and had heard nothing of the search for dick  you look like a sneakthief  anyway you havent any right in my rooms  she came closer and as dick leaped to the ground clutched him by the arm  let me go madam  i wont  im going to hand you over to the police  i dont think you will retorted dick and with a twist he wrenched himself loose and started off on a run  the woman attempted to follow him but soon gave up the chase  dick did not stop running until he was several blocks away  then he dropped into a walk and looked about to see if his brothers or frank were anywhere in sight  i suppose they couldnt make it out and went home he mused i had better get to franks house without delay  dick was still a block away from senator harringtons residence when he espied tom sam and frank coming toward him  my gracious where have you been burst out tom as he rushed forward  you look as if youd been rolling around a dirty cellar  and that is just about what i have been doing answered dick with a sickly laugh  do you know anything of buddy girk he added quickly  he ran away from the tenement and arnold baxter was with him replied sam  did you follow them  no we tried to find out what had become of you  each had to tell his story and then dick was led into the house he lost no time in brushing up and washing himself and by that time breakfast was ready in the dining room  its a curious adventure truly said senator harrington as he sat down with the boys  i am glad you got out of it so well the next time you see anything of those rascals you had better lose no time in informing the police  the senator was one of that class of busy men who eat breakfast and read their morning newspaper at the same time  having listened to what dick had to say he unfolded his paper and propped it up against a fruit dish before him  excuse me but i am in a hurry he remarked apologetically i want to catch a train for new york at eightthirtyfive andhullo whats this rush  wilder brokers and bankers robbed thieves enter the office and loot the safe this is news certainly  rush  wilder cried frank  is that the firm you do business with  yes frank  they have lost over sixtyfive thousand dollars besides a lot of unregistered bonds  thats a big loss  will you suffer  i dont know but what i shall  ill have to let that trip to new york go and look into this  and senator harrington settled back to read the account of the robbery in full  they havent any trace of the thieves have they asked tom  no  it says a rear window was broken open and the iron bars unscrewed  the safe door was found closed but unlocked  then the thieves had the combination put in sam  more than likely  i wonder if baxter and girk committed that crime came from dick  i think they would be equal to it  they were up to some game  it might be returned senator harrington with interest  but how would those men obtain the combination of rush  wilders safe  im sure i dont know butyes they mentioned a man named mooney who was to assist them  perhaps he is known around the bankers offices  we can soon find out  what were you boys going to do this morning  i was going back to the tenements to see if i couldnt have baxter and girk arrested said dick  if they learn you have escaped they will probably clear out  i suppose thats so  but i might go down and see  yes id do that  later on you can come over to rush  wilders offices  this was agreed to and as soon as breakfast was over dick and the other boys hurried off to where yates tenements were located  caleb yates was on hand and all visited the apartment baxter and buddy girk had occupied  it was found that the men had not returned and it did not look as if they intended to come back  they have skipped for good take my word on it muttered tom and the others agreed with him  thinking it would be useless to remain around the alleyway any longer the four boys left the vicinity and boarding a street car made their way to the thoroughfare upon which were located the offices of the bankers and brokers who had been robbed  a crowd was collected about the place and two policemen were keeping those outside in check  i want my money one old man was shouting  this is a game of charley rush to do us out of our cash  i dont believe the office was robbed at all  you keep quiet or ill run you in replied one of the policemen and the old man lost no time in slinking out of sight  can we go in asked frank and told who he was  ill send in word and see answered the policeman at the door  oh frank came from the main office and senator harrington beckoned to his son and all four of the boys went in  they found half a dozen men present including the members of the firm a detective and the bookkeeper a young man named fredericks  you are the only one who had the combination besides ourselves fredericks charles rush was saying to the bookkeeper  i hate to suspect you but  mr rush you cant think i took that money and those securities gasped the bookkeeper and fell back as if about to faint  i dont know what to think  i can give you my word i was not near the offices from four oclock yesterday afternoon until i came this morning after you  have you spoken of the safe combination to anybody  no sir  did you put the combination down in writing asked mr wilder  no i never did anything of that sort  the combination was an unusually easy one as you know  yes far too easy for our good groaned mr rush  then he gazed at the four boys curiously  what brought you here he asked  we thought we might know something of this affair said dick and told his story  there may be something in that said the detective especially if those men fail to turn up at that tenement again  did you mention a man named mooney cried fredericks  i did  do you know this mooney put in mr wilder to the bookkeeper  subrug the janitor has a brotherinlaw named mooneya wild kind of a chap who used to hang around more or less  well call subrug in and find out where this mooney is now said charles rush  the janitor proved to be a very nervous old man  i dont know where mooney is he said  hes been a constant worry to me he used to borrow money but lately i wouldnt give him any more and so he stopped coming around  was he ever in here  the janitor thought for a moment  i think he was sirabout a month ago  he started to help me clean the windows but he was too clumsy and i made him give it up  i remember him cried the bookkeeper  he was at the window mr rush while you were at the safe  he must have watched you work the combination     chapter x  tom sam and farmer fox   for an instant there was a dead silence in the bankers offices charles rush looked blankly at his bookkeeper  i believe fredericks is right said mr wilder the first to break the awkward pause  i remember the fellow very well  i thought at the time that he was watching mr rush rather closely  you had no business to bring in a man that was not to be trusted growled charles rush turning to the janitor  do you think he stole the stuff ejaculated subrug  sure mooney wasnt smart enough for such a game  perhaps not but he got others to help him said dick  he got buddy girk and arnold baxter i feel positive of it  the whole thing fits together pretty well said the detective if only we can lay hands on these men the boy mentions well be all right  a long conversation followed and then dick and the others went to the police station  the rooms at yates tenement were thoroughly searched once more and a watch was set for girk and arnold baxter  but the rascals had flown and the watch proved useless  in the meantime two detectives tried to trace what had become of mooney but this work also amounted to nothing and it may be as well to add here that mooney was never heard of again having sailed for south america  upon an accounting it was learned that rush  wilder were by no means in a good financial condition and that senator harrington would lose a good sum of money should they fail  id give a thousand dollars to collar those thieves said the senator dismally  if arnold baxter and girk got that money theyll live in high clover for a while remarked dick when the excitement was over and they had returned to franks home  my what a villain that baxter is proving to be  no wonder dan was bad  it must run in the blood  the robbery kept the boys in albany several days and this being so it was decided to abandon the trip on the river to new york  ill send the spray down by somebody said dick and then we can take a train from here direct to oak run and so it was arranged  the trip to oak run proved to be uneventful  and at the railroad station they were met by jack ness the rovers hired man who had driven over with the carryall to take them home  glad to see you all looking so well grinned the hired man getting fat as butter master tom  thanks jack im feeling fine  any news  no sir none exceptin that your uncle has had a row with joel fox who has the farm next to ours  what was the row about questioned dick  all about some fruit sir  we had a tree hangin over foxs fencefinest pear tree on the place that was  fox strips the tree at night sirsaw him with my own eyes  oh what cheek burst out sam  what did uncle do  tried to talk to him and fox told him to mind his own business that he could have what fruit hung over his fence  so he could but not half of it hung that way and he took every blessed pear  fox always was a mean man murmured tom  id like to square accounts with him before i go back to putnam hall  i reckoned as how you might be up to something like that said ness with another grin  but you want to be careful  only yesterday fox shot off his gun at some boys who were after his apples  did he hit the boys  i dont think he did  who were they  i dont know  and i reckon he dont either  humph tom mused for a moment  id like to scare the mean fellow by making him think one of the boys was killed  thats an idea cried sam and winked at his brother  lets do it  they were soon bowling over swift river and along the road leading to valley brook farm  at the farmhouse their uncle randolph and aunt martha stood in the dooryard to greet them  back again safe and sound cried randolph rover  i suppose you feel like regular sailors  well we do feel a little that way laughed sam and returned the warm kiss his aunt bestowed upon him  its nice to be home once more  would you rather stay here than go back to putnam hall asked his aunt quickly  oh no i cant say that aunt martha  but its awfully nice here nevertheless  a hot supper was awaiting them and while they ate they told of all that had happened since they had been away  randolph rover shuddered over the way dick had been treated  be careful my boy he said  remember even your father could not bring this arnold baxter to justice  he is evidently a thoroughpaced scoundrel and his companion is probably just as bad  and how goes the scientific farming uncle randolph asked tom who knew how to touch his uncle in the right spot  splendidly my boy splendidly  i am now working on a new rotation of crops  it will i am certain prove a revelation to the entire agricultural world  did you make much money this season asked sam dryly  wellerno in fact we ran a little behind but we will do finely next yeari am certain of it i will have some strawberries and celery which shall astonish our state agricultural committee answered randolph rover he was always enthusiastic in spite of almost constant failure thus far his hobby had netted him a loss of several thousand dollars  it was friday and saturday was to be given over to packing up for school  yet on saturday morning tom managed to call sam aside  well go over to foxs said he  are you ready  i am tom answered the younger brother  and be sure and pile it on  trust me for that and tom winked in a fashion that set sam to roaring  they found joel fox at work along the roadside mending a part of a stone wall which had tumbled down  fox was a yankee and miserly and sour to the very core  well what do you want he demanded as the boys came to a halt in front of him  why mr fox i thought you had skipped out cried tom in pretended surprise  skipped out  yes  why should i skip out boy  on account of harry smith  harry smith  who is he  harry smith of oak runthe boy who was shot the other day didnt you hear he was dead  at these words joel fox dropped the tools he was using and turned pale  iseris the boyer  he could not finish  it was a wicked thing to do put in sam  any man that would shoot a boy ought to be lynched  perhaps that crowd of men were coming up here went on tom didnt they have a rope with them  to be sure they had a rope tom  and one of em said something about hanging  what crowd are you talking about stammered joel fox growing paler and paler  the crowd at the depot  did you shoot him mr fox  i cant hardly believe it true although i know you were mean enough to take my uncles pears  ierthe pears were on my property i eri didnt shoot at any boy ieri shot at some crows in my cornfield stammered joel fox did you say a crowd of men were coming over here with a rope  youll see fast enough you bad man cried tom and ran off followed by sam  in vain fox tried to call them back  the boys went as far as a turn in the road then hid behind some bushes  soon they saw fox pick up his tools and make for his barn  then he came out and hurried for his house  i guess hes pretty well rattled laughed tom  wont he be mad when he learns how he has been fooled  they waited for a while but as fox did not reappear they hurried back home by another road that the man might not see them  tom was right when he said that the miserly old farmer was rattled as it is commonly called  all day long the coward remained in the house as nervous as a cat and afraid that a crowd of men would appear at any minute to lynch him  his wife did not know what to make of such actions and finally demanded an explanation and when it was not forthcoming threatened him with the broom which she had used as a weapon of offense several times previously  they say hes dead finally burst out joel  they are goin ter lynch me for it  hide me mandy hide me  who is dead joel fox  the boy i shot at fer stealin them apples  oh theyll lynch me i feel it in my bones groaned the old man  who was it  harry smith of oak run  and he is dead  so they say  but i didnt calkerlate i hit him at all whined joel  no more you did for i saw him run away and he went clear out o sight up the road  who told you this demanded mrs fox  those rover boys tom an sam  those young imps  joel they are fooling you  do you really think so mandy asked the man hopefully  i do  if i was you id go over to oak run and find out  no noif its true theyll lynch me i know they will  then ill go over  i know mrs smith  if hes dead there will be crape on the door an i wont go in concluded mrs fox  and getting out a horse and buckboard she drove over to oak run and to the smiths place  she found no crape on the door  harry smith sat on the porch his arm in a sling  plucking up courage she drew rein dismounted and walked up to the boy who was one of the rover brothers friends  how is your arm harry she began softly  its pretty fair answered the boy politely  wont you come in mrs fox  well i guess not  harry im sorry for this  so am i sorry mrs fox  i didnt think you would do it  why didnt you come up to the house an ask for them apples  the boy looked puzzled for the simple reason that he was puzzled  i dont understand you  what apples  the ones you tried to steal  i didnt try to steal any apples mrs fox  what makes you think that  didnt you try to git in our orchard when joel fired on you cried mrs fox  why i havent been anywhere near your orchard  so mrs fox looked bewildered  thenthen how did you get hurt she faltered  why mr wicks and i were cleaning out pas old shotgun when it went off accidentally and i got a couple of the shot in my forearm answered harry smith promptly  the answer took away mrs foxs breath  drat them boysi knowed it she muttered and drove away without another word  harry smith was much puzzled but letters which soon after passed between him and tom cleared up the mystery  but the boys never heard of how joel fox fared when his wife got home  the lady arrived as mad as a hornet to use a popular saying  youre the worst old fool ever was joel fox were her first words and a bitter quarrel followed that ended only when the man was driven out of the house with the evertrustworthy broom  joel fox wanted to go over to the rover farm to have it out with tom and sam but somehow he could not pluck up the courage to make the move     chapter xi  fun at putnam hall   back to putnam hall at last  yes boys back at last  hurrah for the dear old school and all the boys in it  peleg snuggers the general utility man of the hall had just brought the boys up from cedarville to which place they had journeyed from ithaca on the regular afternoon boat running up cayuga lake  with the rovers had come fred garrison larry colby and several others of their old school chums  for the doings of the putnam hall students previous to the arrival at that institution of the rover boys see the putnam hall series the first volume of which is entitled the putnam hall cadetspublishers  glad to welcome you back boys exclaimed captain victor putnam a pleasant smile on his face  he shook hands all around did you have a nice trip  splendid sir said tom  oh how do you do mr strong and he ran to meet the head teacher  he could not help but think of how different things were now to when he had first arrived at putnam hall the year previous and josiah crabtree had locked him up in the guardroom for exploding a big firecracker in honor of the occasion  well thomas i hope you have left all your pranks behind observed george strong  how about it  and his eyes twinkled  oh im going in for study this session answered tom demurely and then he winked at larry on the sly  but his words did not deceive george strong who understood only too well toms propensity for mischief  it was the first day of the term but as the cadets kept on arriving with every train and boat no lessons were given out and the boys were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased they visited every nook and corner including the classrooms the dormitories the stables and the gymnasium and boathouse and nearly bothered the life out of peleg snuggers mrs green the housekeeper and alexander pop the colored waiter of the mess hall  hullo aleck cried tom rushing up and grabbing the colored man by the hand  how are youpretty well  im firstrate never was better in my life  and he gave the hand a hard squeeze  stop wot yo up to massah  rober roared the waiter leaping off his feet  wot yo got in yo hand  why nothing aleck my boy  yes im feeling fine  ive gained fifteen pounds and  yo lemme go sahyo is stickin pins in my hand howled pop oh deah now de terms dun begun well all be dead wid dat boys tricks he moaned as tom ran off throwing away several tiny tacks as he did so  so youve come back have you observed mrs green as tom stopped at the kitchen door  well just you mind your ps and qs or there will be trouble i can tell you that tom rover  why we never had any trouble mrs green he said soberly did we  oh of course not  but who stole that can of peaches right after the christmas holidays and who locked one of the cows in the back hall and nearly scared the washwoman to death  oh dear you never did anything never  and mrs green shook her head warningly  do you mean to say i would take a can of peaches mrs green asked tom and then his face fell oh dear you always did put me down as the worst boy in the school wheniidomyvery best and almost sobbing tom put his face up against his coat sleeve mrs green was very tenderhearted in spite of her somewhat free tongue and she was all sympathy immediately  there there tom i didnt mean to hurt your feelings she said soothingly  ii was only fooling  will you have a piece of hot mince pie  its just out of the oven  ii dont know sobbed tom  you treat me so awful meanly  i didnt mean itreally i didnt  come sit down and have the pie thats a good boy  im glad you are back and you are better than lots of the other cadets so there  and tom slid into a seat and devoured the generous slice of pie dealt out to him with keen relish  its really like home he murmured presently  mrs green when you die they ought to erect an awfully big monument over your grave  but im not dying just yet tompray dont speak of it  by the way my aunt was dyeing when i left home went on the boy as he moved toward the door  indeed  didnt you hate to leave her  not at all  she didnt seem to mind it  what was her trouble tomconsumption  no she had an old brown dress that had faded out green and she was dyeing it black was the soft answer and then tom ran for his life  mrs green did not speak to him for almost a week after that  and yet with it all she couldnt help but like the boy  of course peleg snuggers came in for his full share of attention and the utility man had all sorts of jokes played on him until he was almost in despair  dont young gents dont he would plead  oh my  an to think the terms just begun  and he mopped his brow with his red bandanna handkerchief  peleg you are getting handsomer every day remarked sam its a wonder you dont go into the beauty show in new york  wot kind of a joke is that master rover  oh its no joke  you are handsome  wont you let me take your photograph  have you got a camera  to be sure  here it is  sam drew a tiny box from his pocket  now stand still and ill take a snap shot  snuggers had wanted to have his picture taken for some time to send to a certain girl in cedarville in whom he was much interested  to have a photograph taken for nothing tickled him greatly  wait till i brush up a bit he said and got out a pocket comb with which he adjusted his hair and his stubby mustache  now stand straight and look happy cried sam as a crowd collected around raise you right hand to your breast just as all statesmen do up with your chindont drop your left eyeclose your mouth now then dont budge on your life  peleg snuggers stood like a statue his chin well up in the air and his eyes set into a steady stare  sam elevated the tiny box and kept the man standing for fully half a minute while the boys behind snuggers could scarcely keep from roaring  there you are said sam at last  now wait a minute and the picture will be finished  dont you have to print em in the sun asked snuggers  no this is a new patented process  sam drew a square of tin from the box  there you are peleg and all for nothing  i dont see any picture growled snuggers looking at the square blankly  you must breathe on it peleg then the picture will come out beautifully  its a little fresh yet  peleg snuggers breathed on the square of tin as directed and then there slowly came to view the picture of a donkeys head the boys gathered around set up a shout  hurrah peleg what a fine picture  youve changed a little in your looks peleg since you had the last taken eh  your girl will fall in love with that picture peleg im certain of it  sam rover ill git square see if i dont roared the utility man as he dashed the square of tin to the ground  i knowed you was goin to play a joke on me  and he started to walk off  why whats the matter demanded sam innocently  isnt it a good picture  ill picture you  i thought i was doing my best  show me off for a donkey if it wasnt against the rules idid wollop you  a donkey  oh peleg i did nothing of the kind   here is your picture on my word of honor  its a donkeys head i say  and i say its your picture  ill leave it to anybody in the crowd  i guess i know a donkeys head when i see it master rover  i didnt expect no such joke from you though your brother tom might have played it  boys isnt this a good picture demanded sam showing up the other side of the tin square  why splendid came from the crowd  peleg there is some mistake here  oh you cant joke me no more returned the utility man  but just look pleaded sam  isnt that a good picture of you if you dont say so yourself ill give you five dollars  he handed the tin over again this time with the opposite side toward snuggers  he had just breathed on it heavily  now blow on it he continued and snuggers did as directed the moisture cleared away revealing the face of the utility man in a bit of lookingglass  oh youre tremendously smart you are muttered snuggers and walked off  but he was not half as angry as he had been a few minutes before     chapter xii  dick visits dora stanhope   battalion fall in  attention  carry arms  it was several days later and the cadets were out for their first parade around the grounds  dick still retained his position as second lieutenant of company a having been reelected the term previous  tom was first sergeant of company b while sam was still a high private in the rear rank as the saying goes  the day was an ideal one in the early autumn and captain putnam and george strong were both on hand to watch the drilling  major bart conners had graduated the year before and his place was now filled by harry blossom formerly captain of company a  shoulder arms came the next order  battalion forward march  tap tap tap tap tap went the drums and then the bass drum joined in and the two companies moved off  soon the fifers struck up a lively air and away went the cadets down the road around grounds and to the mess hall for supper  the boys felt good to be in the ranks once more and captain putnam congratulated them on their soldierly appearance  it does me good to see that you have not forgotten your former instructions in drilling and marching he said  i trust that during the present term we shall see even better results so that the work done here may compare favorably with that done at west point  the school had now begun to settle down and inside of a few days everything was working smoothly  what a difference it makes to have dan baxter and mumps absent observed tom to dick  we dont have any of the oldfashion rows any more  id like to know what mumps and josiah crabtree were up to put in the elder rover  its queer we didnt hear any more of them im going to get off soon and try and see dora stanhope  perhaps she knows what crabtree is doing  on that day frank harrington received a letter from his father in which the senator stated that nothing more had been heard of the men who had looted rush  wilders safe  i fancy they have left the state if not the country was mr harringtons comment  the three rover boys got off the next day and took a walk past the cottages where resided the lanings and the stanhopes  at the lanings place nellie and grace came out to greet them  so you are back cried nellie blushing sweetly  father said you were  he saw you come in at cedarville  yes back again and glad to meet you answered tom and gave the girls hand a tight squeeze while sam and dick also shook hands with both girls  and how do you feel asked grace of dick  wasnt that dreadful the way mr baxter treated you on that train  well he got the worst of it answered dick  oh i know that  and now they suspect him of a robbery in albany  papa was reading it in one of the ithaca papers  yes and i guess hes guilty grace  but tell me does josiah crabtree worry mrs stanhope any more continued the boy seriously  why to be sure he does  and oh let me tell you something dora told me that he was terribly angry over having been sent to chicago on a wildgoose chase  i wish he had remained out there  so do all of us said nellie laning  he seems bound to marry aunty in spite of our opposition and doras  how is your aunt now  she is not very well  do you know i think mr crabtree exercises some sort of a strange influence over her  i think that myself  if he could do it i think he would hypnotize her into marrying him  he is just rascal enough  of course he is after the money mrs stanhope is holding in trust for dora  he cant touch that  he canif he can get hold of it  i dont think josiah crabtree cares much for the law  is dora home now  i believe she is  she was this morning i know  im going over to see her went on dick  i promised to do all i could for her in this matter of standing crabtree off and im going to keep my word  as sam and tom wished to converse with the laning girls a bit longer dick went on ahead telling them to follow him when they chose  it did not take dick long to reach the stanhope homestead  as he approached he heard loud talking on the front piazza  i want nothing to do with you dan baxter and i am astonished that you should come here to see me came in dora stanhopes voice  thats all right dora dont get ugly was the reply from the former bully of putnam hall  im not going to hurt you  i want you to go away and leave my mother and me alone  will you come and see mr crabtree as he wanted  no  if mr crabtree wants to see me let him come here  but you told him you didnt want him here said dan baxter  neither i doto see mamma  but i wont go to see him so there  now please leave me  youre a strongminded miss you are sneered dan baxter  you want taking down  whats that you say demanded dick as he strode up  baxter you deserve to be knocked down for insulting this young lady  oh dick is that you burst out dora her pretty face brightening instantly  im glad you came  dick rover muttered the bully and his face fell  what brought you here  that is my business baxter  so josiah crabtree sent you to annoy miss stanhope  its none of your affair if he did  i say it is my affair  do you want to get into another row with me dick rover and dan baxter clenched his fists  if we fought the battle would end as it did beforeyou would be knocked out answered dick  you have no right to come here if these people want you to stay away and you had better take yourself off  ill go when i please  you cant make me gonor the stanhopes neither growled dan baxter  at these words dick grew white  dora as old readers know was his dearest friend and he could not stand having her spoken of so rudely  for a moment the two boys glared at each other then baxter aimed a blow at dicks face  the elder rover ducked and hit out in return landing upon baxters neck  dora gave a scream  oh dick  dont fight with him  i wontill run him out panted dick and leaping behind the bully he caught him by the collar and the back  out you go you brute he added and began to run baxter toward the open gateway  in vain the bully tried to resist  dicks blood was up and he did not release his hold or relinquish his efforts until the bully had been pushed along the road for a distance of fifty yards  now you dare to come back said dick shaking his fist at the fellow  if you come ill have you locked up  well see about it dick rover snarled dan baxter  he paused for an instant  he laughs best who laughs last he muttered and strode off as fast as his long legs would carry him in the direction of the lake  when dick returned to dora he found that the girl had sunk down on the piazza steps nearly overcome  dont be afraid dora hes gone he said kindly  oh dick im so afraid of him she gasped  was he here long before i came up  about ten minutes  he brought a message from mr crabtree who wants to see me in cedarville  i told him i wouldnt goand i wont  i shouldnt either dora  perhaps crabtree only wants to get you away from the house so that he can come here and see your mother  i never thought of that  where is your mother now  lying down with a headache  she is getting more nervous every day  i wish mr crabtree waswas  in halifax i suppose finished dick  yes or some other place as far off  every time he comes near mamma she has the strangest spells  he is a bad manno doubt of it dora  i almost wish we had him back to the hall  then i could keep my eye on him  im glad you are back dick said the girl softly  if there is any trouble youll let me call on you wont you  i shall expect you to call on me dorathe very first thing he returned promptly  i wouldnt have anything happen to you or your mother for anything in the world  by this time sam and tom were coming up and they had to be told about dan baxter  he and his father are a team said sam  i wonder if he knows what his father has done  if i meet him ill ask him  dick had expected to pay his respects to mrs stanhope but now thought best not to disturb her  all the boys had a short chat with dora and then set out on the return to school  on the way the three boys discussed the situation but could get little satisfaction out of their talk  something is in the wind was dicks comment  but what it is time alone will reveal  and he was right as events in the near future proved     chapter xiii  the fire at the hall   sam had been right when he said that dan baxter was like his father  parent and son were thoroughly bad but how bad the rover boys and their friends were still to learn  on saturday the cadets had a halfholiday and some of them went over to the lake to fish sam and tom accompanying the party  while the boys were waiting for bites they espied a large sailboat skimming along the lake shore  as it came closer tom and sam were much astonished to see that the boat contained dan baxter josiah crabtree and mumps  by jinks there is mumps yacht ejaculated tom  how in the world did he get her up here  brought her by way of the canal and the river i suppose answered sam  hullo there called out larry colby who was in the crowd mumps you might be in better company  you keep your mouth shut retorted fenwick  if you talk to me ill come ashore and give you a thrashing put in baxter  i dare you to come ashore burst out tom  youll stay where you are if you know when you are well off  no more was said and presently the boat sped out of sight around a bend of the lake shore  fishing proved to be good and in the excitement of the sport baxter and the others were for the time being forgotten  it was late when the boys packed up  sam had six fish tom as many more and all of the others a fair catch  well have fish tomorrow for breakfast sure said larry hurry up or well be late  the party started off but had only gone a short distance when sam remembered that he had left his knife sticking in the stump of a tree and ran back to get it in the meantime turning his fish over to tom  the fishing place was behind a grove of trees and when sam reached it again he was much surprised to see dan baxter on shore he having just left the yacht which was cruising some distance away  hullo so you came back to have it out with me eh cried baxter and before sam could say a word he was hurled flat and the bully came down on top of him  sam fought bravely but was no match for the big fellow who began to hammer him unmercifully realizing how matters were turning the youngest rover began to cry for help  you shut up stormed dan baxter  shut up or ill give it to you worse than ever  but sam had no intention of taking such a drubbing quietly and he yelled louder than ever  his cries reached tom who had dropped behind to allow his brother to catch up  something is wrong he muttered and hanging the fish on a bush he ran back at the top of his speed  dan baxter heard him coming and tried to get away but as tom called out sams courage rose and he grabbed the bully by the foot and held him  let go roared dan baxter but sam would not and in a second more tom was at hand and hit the bully such a stinging blow in the face that baxter went down in a heap  a roughandtumble scrimmage ensued and it must be said that the bully got by far the worst of it tom hit him again and again and sam also and when at  last he staggered to his feet one eye was almost closed and his nose was bleeding profusely  now i guess you wont tackle any of us again said tom  ill get evenmark my words roared baxter and ran down the lake shore in the direction the falcon had taken  when baxter reached the yacht he was so weak he could scarcely stand  it was a long while before he could stop his nose from bleeding and his eye stung with a pain that was maddening  did little sam rover do that asked mumps while josiah crabtree looked on in curious silence  sam rover snorted baxter  not much  why the whole crowd piled on me six or seven of them at a time  they tried to kill me  didnt you defend yourself daniel asked crabtree  of course i did  i knocked two of them down and another fellow had two of his teeth broken  but i couldnt fight all six single handed  oh i presume notespecially such brutes as captain putnam is now raising  its a pity we cant get square with them said mumps  oh ill get square  you just wait answered the bully cunningly  im not done with them yet by any means  what will you do  just you wait and see  i dont wish to have you interfere with our plans put in josiah crabtree  i wont interfere with the other plans  but i am going to get square  weve had delay enough continued josiah crabtree  well that wasnt my fault  mumps got sick and thats all there is to it growled dan baxter and then went to dressing his swollen eye once more  in the meantime sam and tom had rejoined their fellows and told their story  all of the others were indignant at baxters doing and glad to learn he had been given a sound drubbing  i dont see why he hangs in this neighborhood said larry its a wonder he doesnt try to join his father  they are probably on the outs since dan took that two hundred dollars answered tom  the boys were all tired that night and the occupants of dormitory no 6 retired early in consequence  it was a little after midnight that dick awoke with a cough  he sat up in bed and opened his eyes to find the room almost filled with smoke  for gracious sake he muttered  whats the matter here  sam tom  whats this came from larry colby  is the house on fire he leaped from his bed and so did dick  by this time the smoke in the dormitory was getting thicker and thicker  it was coming through the door which stood partly open  wake up boys the hall is on fire  fire  fire  fire came from all parts of the building  one after another the cadets roused up  some were completely bewildered and did not know what to do  we had better get out as soon as we can exclaimed dick as he slipped into his trousers  come tom come sam  he ran for the hallway to find it so thick with smoke that escape in that direction seemed cut off  we cant go down that way came from frank  wed be smothered to death  lets jump from the windows put in larry who was more frightened than any of the others  no no dont jump yet cried tom  youll break a leg and maybe your neck  but i dont want to be burnt up returned larry his teeth chattering  hold on we have that rope we used when we had the feast last summer said sam  let us tie that to the window and get down on it  sam ran to the closet and found the rope just where it had been left on a hook in the corner  soon they had it out and fastened to a bedslat braced across the window frame  down you go larry said dick  be careful i reckon we have plenty of time  larry slid down in a jiffy and one after another the others came after him dick being the last  as the youth turned around on the window sill he saw the fire creeping in at the door  their escape had taken place none too soon  down on the parade ground they found a motley collection of halfdressed cadets instructors servants and others who had been sleeping in the burning hall  in the midst of the group was captain putnam pale but comparatively cool considering the excitement under which he was laboring  are all the boys out he asked of george strong  line them up and call the roll  the rollcall was put through in doublequick order  only two lads were missing a boy named harrison and another named leeks  here comes harrison cried harry blossom and the boy limped forth from the opposite side of the burning building  i sprang from the east wing he explained  i guess my ankle is sprained and then he dropped down and was carried away from the scene to a place of safety  where can leeks be questioned captain putnam  leeks  leeks where are you he cried with all the power of his lungs  at first the only reply that came back was the roaring of the flames as they mounted from one section of the hall to another then however came a shriek from the rear end of the western wing  help me  save me  i dont want to be burnt up  it is leeks cried tom  see he is on the gutter of the roof  he pointed in the direction and all saw the cadet dressed in nothing but his white gown clinging desperately to the slates of the roof above the gutter  he had run from the second floor to the third and sought safety by crawling out of a dormer window  dont jump cried a dozen in concert  dont jump leeks  what shall i do  the flames are coming up here as fast as they can groaned the cadet  oh save me somebody  lets get the ladder said dick and started for the barn with a score of cadets at his heels and george strong with them  in the meantime captain putnam again urged leeks to remain where he was  we will save you dont fear he added  the fire below now made the scene as bright as day and already the neighbors were rushing to the scene followed by the cedarville volunteer fire department with their hose cart and old style handpump engine  soon the ladder was brought out of the barn and rushed to the spot directly below where leeks stood  willing hands raised it against the building  and then a loud groan went up  the ladder was too short by ten feetand it was the only ladder to be had     chapter xiv  the disappearance of dora stanhope   we cant reach him with that  hell be burnt up before we can get to him   see the flames are already coming out of the window beside him  save me  push the ladder up higher shrieked leeks  i cant get down to it  wait ive got an idea put in dick and ran behind the barn to the garden patch  soon he came back armed with a long and knotty beanpole  george strong was already on the ladder and the beanpole was shoved up to him  thats all right came the cry  leeks cant you get hold  ill try said the terrorized boy  as quickly as he could george strong mounted to the very top of the ladder  then the teacher raised the beanpole heavy end upward until leeks managed to grasp it  can you steady it against the gutter asked the teacher  ii dont know  if i had a cord  there is a string on the window blind  tie the end of the pole to that  with trembling hands leeks did as directed  the cord was not a stout one but it was sufficiently strong to keep the beanpole in position and that was all that was required since the teacher steadied it and held it up from below  but getting over the edge of the gutter was no easy movement and those on the ground held their breath as leeks crawled to where he could grasp the beanpole  then the cadet came down on the run to where his feet struck the top of the ladder  in a minute more he and the head teacher came to the ground  a cheer went up  hurrah  leeks is safe  good for mr strong in the midst of the cries leeks fainted and had to be carried to the gymnasium for treatment  the fire had evidently started in the lower hallway of the building in a closet under the broad stairs  it was burning furiously in all of the halls and toward the rear  as soon as captain putnam felt assured that the scholars and all others were safe he organized the boys into a bucket brigade  in the meantime mrs grow with more forethought than seemed possible to her nature had turned on the water pipes leading from the water tower on the hall roof  thus a dozen small streams were thrown on the fire to which the boys soon added their buckets of water  then the cedarville fire department added their services and fighting the fire began in earnest while captain putnam directed the removal of all furniture and other things which could be gotten out with safety  say but this is work panted tom as he struggled along with a big bucket of water in each hand  i only hope we succeed in saving the building  we wont save all of it replied sam who was laboring as hard as anybody  and i guess all of our clothing will be burnt up  dont say a word about dat put in alexander pop  i dun gone an buy me a new pair ob checked pants las weekan a new silk hat too  and the negro was almost ready to cry with vexation at the thought that those new clothes with which he had hoped to cut such a dash would go down in the ruin  it was a good two hours ere the fire was gotten under control and not until after sunrise was the last spark put out  then captain putnam and several of the others surveyed the damage that had been done  all of the stairways had been burned away and the plastering from top to bottom of the three hallways was down  in the rear two dormitories and the garret floor had been burned out  a nasty fire said the captain to his head assistant  im afraid i will have to close down the school at least for a while  i dont know as i would do that captain replied george strong  the classrooms are not touched neither are some of the dormitories  we can bunch the boys up a bitand i think they would rather be bunched up than be sent home  the matter was talked over at some length and in the end put to the boys themselves and all declared that they would rather remain and some added that during their spare hours they would do all they could to put the place into shape again  that will be unnecessary said captain putnam  the insurance companies will have to do the repairing and i shall notify them without delay  as to the clothing that has been lost i will make that good to each of you  the fire was not yet out when dora stanhope appeared in company with john laning and nellie and grace  i am so afraid somebody had been burnt up cried dora to dick im awfully glad you and your brothers are all right  we got out easily answered dick but he gave dora a bright smile for the interest she had shown in him  how did the fire start questioned john laning  nobody knows answered tom  captain putnam says it is a complete mystery  i believe the hall was set on fire put in sam  and i believe i can point out the party who is guilty  dan baxter put in larry  yes  would he be wicked enough to do that cried dora in horror  yes i guess dan is bad enough to do anything said dick  he was terribly mad over the way we mauled him came from tom he was just about ready to kill us  if thats the case captain putnam had better have baxter arrested suggested john laning  he is a dangerous boy to be at large  captain putnam came up and was soon told of what had occurred he had not heard of the fight down at the lake but was not greatly surprised  i do not blame you boys since baxter began the attack he said  and i agree he is a thoroughly bad fellow  yes ill have him arrestedproviding we can locate him  word had already been sent to a clothier and a gentlemens outfitter both of whom had stores in cedarville and before noon these men came to the hall and the students were fitted out temporarilythat is the portion who had lost the majority of their clothing  then a gang of laborers and scrubwomen were sent to work to clean up the mess and make the classrooms and unburned dormitories fit for occupation  in two days putnam hall was once more in full sway as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened the burnt section being boarded entirely off from the other  the search for dan baxter began at once but nothing could be ascertained concerning him  a search was also made for the falcon but that craft had disappeared from the lake  well i hope we never hear or see anything more of baxter said sam  i declare he is worse than a snake in the grass  id rather see him locked up answered dick grimly  then id know he was out of the way of harming us further  several days slipped by and the boys were deep in their studies when late one afternoon dick was greatly astonished by being told that mrs stanhope was in the parlor waiting to see him  she seems very much agitated said captain putnam  i am afraid something is wrong  can you say what it is richard  no sir excepting dan baxter or josiah crabtree may have been worrying them again   do you mean to tell me that baxter goes to their house  he has been there several times to my knowledge hes as sweet on dora stanhope as josiah crabtree is anxious over mrs stanhopeand neither person deserves any encouragement  i thought the engagement between mrs stanhope and crabtree was off  it wasfor the time being  but it seems mr crabtree isnt going to give her uphe is too anxious to get hold of doras money and with this remark dick hurried to the parlor  oh dick rover cried mrs stanhope when he entered do tell me what has become of dora  dora he repeated in bewilderment  i dont know i am sure has she left home  she hasnt been home since she answered your note yesterday afternoon  my note  i sent her no note  but i found it lying on the diningroom table last evening when i came from my room  you see i had been lying down with a headache  mrs stanhope i sent dora no note  if she got one that was signed with my name it was a forgery  oh dick rover  the lady had arisen on his entrance now she sank back into a faint  the youth was greatly alarmed and at once rang for one of the servants and also for captain putnam  what is the matter asked the master of the hall  something is very much wrong sir replied dick  dora stanhope has disappeared  disappeared  yes sir she received some sort of a note signed with my name  no more was said just then dick the captain and the servant doing all they could to restore mrs stanhope to consciousness when the lady finally came to her senses she could not keep from crying bitterly  oh where can my dora be she moaned  something dreadful has happened to heri feel certain of it  where is that note asked dick  i left it on the mantelpiece in our dining room  it said dear friend dora meet me as soon as you can down at the old boathouse on the lake  i have something important to tell you and it was signed richard rover  mrs stanhope as true as i stand here i never wrote that note or sent it  i believe you dick  but who did send it  some enemy who wanted to get her away from the housedan baxter or  dick paused  or who  well josiah crabtree if you must know  he hates her and he wants to separate her from you  at the mention of josiah crabtrees name a curious shiver passed over mrs stanhope  wewell not talk about mr crabtree she faltered  but oh i must have my dora back  and then she came near to fainting again  i would like to go over to the stanhope cottage and investigate said dick after the lady had been placed in mrs greens care  to my mind it wont do to lose time either  you can go richard answered captain putnam  but be careful and keep out of trouble  can i take tom and sam with me  at this the master of putnam hall smiled broadly  always like to be together eh  all right i dont know but what it will be safer for the three of you to go together he said and dick lost no time in telling his brothers  in a few minutes the trio set off for the stanhope cottage little dreaming of the long time that was to elapse before they should see putnam hall again     chapter xv  dicks bravery and its reward   the three rover boys reached the stanhope cottage on a run to find nobody in charge but a washwoman who was hanging up some clothing in the back yard  explaining the situation so far as was necessary they went inside and hunted up the note mrs stanhope had mentioned  i believe that is dan baxters writing said dick slowly  it is came from sam  i know it from the flourishes on the capitals  he was always great on flourishes  we wont waste time here went on dick  let us go down to the old boathouse  they were soon on the way along a road lined with brush and scrubby cedars the trees which in years gone by had given cedarville its name  at the old boathouse everything was quiet and not a soul was in sight  walking to the end of the house float they gazed out on the lake  not a boat anywhere murmured dick  now what could have become of dora do you suppose  its ten to one that baxter took her off in mumps boat cried tom  by jinks i think i see through this  dont you remember the plot josiah crabtree and mumps were hatching  ill wager they are all in this to get dora away from her mother  i believe tom is right came from sam  and if that is true dora was taken off on a boat beyond a doubt  if she was it wont take very long to find her returned dick let us go to cedarville and see if anybody has seen the falcon  dick had scarcely spoken when a small steam tug hove into sight bound up the lake  theres a tug now exclaimed tom  hi there  hi he yelled stop  the captain of the tug heard him and saw him waving his hand and slowing up made a half circle toward shore  whats wanted young man he asked  anything wrong  yes a good deal is wrong replied tom  have you seen a yacht named the falcon today  no but i saw her late yesterday afternoon was the reply  around here  no further down the lake  i think she was bound for cayuga  did you notice who was on board  you seem to be very particular about it  we are particular  a young lady has disappeared and we think she was taken away on that yacht explained dick as the steam tug came to a halt  is that so  yes i did see a young lady on board of her  she called to our boat as we passed but i thought it was only in fun  i guess she wanted you to help her said dick bitterly  then he continued suddenly  have you anything to do just now  no i was going up to ithaca to look for a tow  what will you charge to take us down to cayuga  the captain of the tug thought for a moment  three dollars  it ought to be worth that to find the young lady  well go you answered dick promptly  swing in and well jump aboard  captain lambert did as requested and in a moment more the three rover boys were on board of the cedar queen as the craft was named  the captain proved to be a nice man and became thoroughly interested in the story the lads had to tell  i hope we spot the rascals he said  ill certainly do all i can for you  the cedar queen was a little craft and somewhat slow and the boys fretted a good bit at the long time it took to reach cayuga  when they ran into the harbor of the town at the foot of the lake they looked in vain for the falcon  well take a sail around said captain lambert and this they did continuing the hunt until long after dark  its no use groaned dick  weve missed her  it took nearly all the money the boys could scrape up between them to pay off the captain of the tug and when they had been landed at one of the docks they wondered what they had best do next  weve got to stay here over night said dick  we may as well telegraph to captain putnam for cash and this they did and put up at one of the hotels  the place was crowded for there was a circus in the town and a public auction of real estate had also taken place that day  the boys could get only a small room but over this they did not complain  their one thought was of dora and of the rascals who had carried her off  we must get on the track somehow said dick  but how was the question  he could not sleep and after the others had retired took a long walk just to settle his nerves  dicks walk brought him to the lot where the circus had held forth and for some time he watched the men as they worked under the flaring gasoline torches packing up what still remained on the grounds  the tent men had to labor like slaves in rolling up the huge stretches of canvas and in hoisting the long poles into the wagons and he shook his head grimly as he turned away  no circus life in mine he mused at least not that part of it  dick had moved away from the grounds but a short distance when his attention was attracted to the strange movements of two roughlooking individuals who were hurrying off with a third man between them  i dont want to go i tell you the middle man muttered  i dont want more to drink  thats all right mr castor said one of the other men glibly just have one more glass thats a good fellow  i wont take it so there cried the man called castor  i know when ive had enough  youve got to come along with us put in the third man savagely  you owe us some money  i dont owe you a cent fusty  yes you doand im bound to have it  hold him mike till i go through him  of a sudden there was a struggle and the man called castor found himself helpless while the fellow called fusty began to go through his pockets with great rapidity  the scene alarmed dick and he wondered what he had best do then he made up his mind to go to castors assistance and ran forward  here let that man alone he cried as he picked up a fence picket which happened to lie handy leave him alone i say  the old nick take the luck muttered one of the other men whos this  help  help cried castor  let him alone i say repeated dick and then struck at one of the men and hit him on the arm  seeing himself thus reenforced castor also struck out and continued to call for help  we might as well give it up fusty cried one of the rascals and took to his heels and then there was nothing to do for the other man but to follow him  are you hurt asked dick as he helped the man who had been assaulted to his feet  not much was the slow reply  young man you came in time and no more  do you know those fellows who just ran away  i met them at the circus this afternoon  we had several drinks and they became very friendly  i believe they were after my money  i think so too mr  my name is george castor and who are you  i am dick rover sir  rover i must thank you for your services  i shant forget you not me and george castor held out his hand cordially  i think i made a mistake by drinking with those fellows  i havent any doubt of it mr castor  do you reside in town  no sir i am stopping at the hotel with my brothers  we just came into town tonight on rather a curious errand  indeed and what was that  in a few words dick explained the situation  he had not yet finished when george castor interrupted him  my boy you have done me a good turn and now i think i can return the compliment  do you mean to say you know something of this case demanded dick eagerly  perhaps i do  describe this dan baxter as well as you can will you  certainly  and dick did so  it is the same fellow  i met him last night down near the lumber wharves  you see i am a lumber merchant from brooklyn and i have an interest in a lumber company up here  you saw baxter  was he alone  no there was another man with him a tall slim fellow with an unusually sour face  josiah crabtree to a t burst out dick  did you notice where they went  i did not  but i overheard their talk  they spoke about a boat on the hudson river the flyaway  they were to join her at albany  who was to join her  this baxter if it was he and somebody elsea man called muff or something like that  mumps  you struck them sure enough  but did they say anything about the girl  the tall man said that he would see to it that she was therewhatever he meant by that  i cant say any more than you mr castor  but i guess they are going to carry dora stanhope through to albany from all appearances  then perhaps you had better follow  id go at once if i had the money that i have telegraphed for you see my brothers and i came away in a hurry for the stanhopes are close friends of ours  dont let the matter of money worry you  do you know how much i have with me  i havent the slightest idea sir  nearly eleven hundred dollarsand if those rascals had had the chance they would have robbed me of every dollar of it  i shouldnt think you would carry so much  i dont usually but i was paid a large bill today and went to the circus instead of the banknot having seen such a show in years  but to come back to business  will a hundred dollars see you through  you mean to say you will loan me that much  perhaps i had better give it to you as a reward for your services  i wont take it for i dont want any reward  but ill accept a loan if youll make it and be very much obliged to you continued dick  all right then well call it a loan concluded george castor and the transfer of the amount was made on the spot  later on dick insisted upon returning the money     chapter xvi  the search for the flyaway   tom  sam  get up at once  whats the row now dick came sleepily from tom  have you discovered anything  yes  ive discovered a whole lot get up if you want to catch the next train  the next train for where demanded tom as he hopped out of bed  the next train for albany  have they taken dora to albany questioned sam as he too arose and began to don his garments  i think so was the elder brothers reply and while the pair dressed dick told of what had occurred and what he had heard  this is getting to be quite a chase was toms remark  but i reckon you are right and well land on them in the capital  if we arent too late answered dick  id like to know how they are going to take dora to albany if she doesnt want to go came from tom when they were dressed and on their way to the railroad station  no one could answer this question josiah crabtree is a queer stick and can do lots of queer things was what dick said  the train left at half past two in the morning and they had not long to wait  once on board they proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible each having a whole seat to himself and sam and tom went to sleep without much trouble  but dick was wide awake wondering what would be the next move on reaching albany  poor dora he murmured  oh but that crowd shall be punished for this  if she comes to harm it will almost kill mrs stanhope  and his heart sank like a lump of lead as he thought of his dearest friend in the power of her unscrupulous enemies  it was just getting daylight when the long train rolled into the spacious depot at the state capital  only a few working people and newsboys were stirring  tom and sam pulled themselves together with long yawns  sleeping in a seat doesnt come up to a bed by any means remarked tom  which way now  well go down to the river and look for the flyaway answered his elder brother  it will be like looking for a needle in a haystack said sam the boats are pretty thick here  that is true but it is the best we can do replied the elder rover  once along the river front they began a careful inquiry concerning the boat of which they were in search  not much progress remarked tom after two hours had been spent in vain  this climbing from one dock to the next is decidedly tiring  and im hungry put in sam  i move we hunt up a restaurant an eating place was not far away and entering they ordered a morning meal of ham and eggs rolls and hot coffee  while they were eating a man came in and sat down close by them it was martin harris the fellow who had come to their assistance after the collision between the spray and the falcon  hullo how are you he said heartily  still cruising around in your yacht  no we just got back to albany replied dick  weve been to school since we left you  i see  how do you like going back to your studies  we liked it well enough put in tom  but we left in a hurry he went on thinking martin harris might give them some information  have you been out on the river yet this morning  yes just came up from our place below to do a little trading  did you see anything of a yacht called the flyaway  the flyaway  what sort of a looking craft is she  i cant tell you that  one boat there attracted my attention said martin harris slowly  i saw two boys and a girl on board of her  how was the girl dressed cried dick  she had on a lightblue dress and a sailor hat  and the boys  one was dressed in gray and the other in darkblue or black  that was the boat  where did she go ejaculated dick who remembered well how mumps and baxter had been attired and the pretty dress and hat dora was in the habit of wearing  she was bound straight down the river  we must follow her  thats the talk  burst out tom  but how  what do you want to follow the flyaway for asked martin harris curiously  those two boys are running away with that girl  impossible  no it isnt one of the fellowsthe fellow in dark clothingis the chap who ran into us that day  well now do you know i thought it looked like him was harris comment  and come to think of it that boat got as far away from me as she could  do you think you would know her again  i mean the flyawayif we got anywhere near her asked dick  i think i would lad  she had a rather dirty mainsail and jib and each had a new patch of white near the top  then too her rig is a little different from what we have around here  looked like a southern boat  have you your boat handy  yes shes right at the end of this street  do you want me to follow up that crowd  could your boat catch the flyaway do you think  my boat the searchlight is as good a yacht as there is anywhere around if i do say it myself answered martin harris promptly  it you dont believe it try her and see  we will try her came promptly from dick  and the sooner you begin the chase the better it will suit me  all right well start as soon as ive swallowed this coffee answered the skipper of the searchlight but hold on this may prove a long search  do you want to make terms  i wasnt thinking of that  ill leave it to you as to what the job is worth after were done  i was thinking that i havent any provender aboard my yacht if we want to stay out any length of time  ill fix that answered dick  come sam  you say the yacht is at the foot of the street  yes  well be there in less than five minutes  where are you goingto buy provisions  yes  dick made off followed not only by sam but likewise by tom  he found a large grocery close at hand and here purchased some coffee sugar canned meat and fish a small quantity of vegetables and also several loaves of bread and some salt  to this tom added a box of crackers and sam some cake and fruit and with their arms loaded down they hurried to the searchlight  martin harris was on hand and ready to cast off  hullo you did lay in some things he grinned  i reckon you calculate this chase to last some time  weve got enough for several days anywaythat is all butwater returned dick  ive got a whole barrel full of that forward lad  then we are ready to leave  i hope though we run the flyaway down before noon concluded the elder rover as he hopped on board  leaving sam to stow away the stores as he saw fit dick and tom sprang in to assist martin harris and soon the mainsail and jib were set and they turned away from the dock and began the journey down the hudson  as soon as they were clear of the other boats the skipper set his topsail and flying jib and they bowled along at a merry gait the wind being very nearly in their favor and neither too strong nor too slack  now id like to hear the particulars of this case remarked martin harris as he proceeded to make himself comfortable at the tiller  you see i want to know just what i am doing  i dont want to get into any trouble with the law  you wont get into any trouble   nobody has a right to run off with a girl against her will replied dick  thats true  but why are they running off with her  i think they have been hired to do it by a man who wants to marry the girls mother went on dick and related the particulars of what had occurred  martin harris was deeply interested  i reckon you have the best end of it he said when the youth had finished  and you say this dan baxter is a son of the rascal who is suspected of robbing rush  wilder  yes  evidently a hard crowd  you are rightand they ought all of them to be in prison observed tom  by the way have they heard anything of those robbers  the detectives are following up one or two clues  one report was that this baxter and girk had gone to some place on staten island  but i dont think they know for certain     chapter xvii  in which dora is carried off   perhaps it will be as well to go back a bit and learn how poor dora was enticed into leaving home so unexpectedly to the sorrow of her mother and the anxiety of dick and her other friends  dora was hard at work sweeping out the parlor of the stanhope cottage when she saw from the window a boy walking up the garden path  the youth was a stranger to her and carried a letter in his hand  is this mrs stanhopes place  he questioned as dora appeared  yes  heres a letter for miss dora stanhope and he held out the missive  whom is it from  i dont know  a boy down by the lake gave it to me was the answer and without further words the lad hurried off having received instructions that he must not tarry around the place after the delivery of the communication  tearing open the letter dora read it with deep interest  what can dick have to tell me she mused  can it be something about mr crabtree  it must be  dropping her work she ran upstairs changed her dress put on her hat and started for the boathouse  it took her but a short while to reach the place but to her surprise nobody was in sight  can i have made some mistake she murmured when the falcon hove into view from around a bend in the shore line  is that miss stanhope shouted a strange man who seemed to be the sole occupant of the craft  yes i am dora stanhope answered the girl  dick rover sent me over from the other side of the lake  he told me if i saw you to take you over to nelson point  nelson point was a grove situated directly opposite cedarville it was a place much used by excursionists and picnic parties  thank you said dora never suspecting that anything was wrong if youll come in a little closer i will go with you  the falcon was brought in and dora leaped on board of the yacht  she had scarcely done so when mumps and dan baxter stepped from the cabin  oh dear she gasped  wherewhere did you come from  didnt quite expect to see us here did you grinned the former bully of putnam hall  i did not answered dora coldly  whatwhere is dick rover  over to nelson point  did he send you over here for me  of course he did said mumps  i do not believe it  this is some trick burst out the girl i want you to put me on shore again  you cant go ashore now answered baxter  ease her off goss  right you are answered bill goss  whats the course now  straight down the lake  all right  you are not going to take me down the lake cried dora in increased alarm  yes we are  ii wont go  i dont see how you are to help yourself responded baxter roughly  dan baxter you are a brute  if you cant say anything better than that you had better say nothing muttered baxter  i will say what i please  you have no right to carry me off in this fashion  well i took the right  you shall be locked up for it  youll have to place me in the laws hands first  i dont believe dick rover sent that letter at all  you can believe what you please  you forged his name to it  let us talk about something else  you are as bad as your father and that is saying a good deal went on the poor girl bitterly  see here dont you dare to speak of my father roared the bully in high anger  my father is as good as anybody  this is only a plot against himgotten up by the rovers and his other enemies  dan baxters manner was so terrible that dora sank back on a camp stool nearly overcome  then seeing some men at a distance on the shore she set up a scream for help  here none of that ejaculated mumps and clapped his hand over her mouth  let me go she screamed help  help  well put her in the cabin ordered dan baxter and also caught hold of dora  she struggled with all the strength at her command but was as a baby in their grasp and soon found herself in the cabin with the door closed and locked behind her  it was then that her nerves gave way and throwing herself on a couch she burst into tears  what will they do with me she moaned  oh that i was home again  it was a long while before she could compose herself sufficiently to sit up  in the meantime the falcon was sailing down the lake toward cayuga with all speed  this must be some plan of josiah crabtree to get me away from home she thought  poor mother  i wonder what will happen to her while i am away  if that man gets her to marry him what will i do  i can never live with themnever  and she heaved a deep sigh  presently she arose and walked to the single window of which the cabin boasted  it was open but several little iron bars had been screwed fast on the outside  they have me like a bird in a cage she thought  where will this dreadful adventure end  hour after hour went by and she was not molested  then came a knock on the cabin door  dora  dora stanhope came in dan baxters voice  well  will you behave yourself if i unlock the door  it is you who ought to behave yourself she retorted  never mind about that  i have something for you to eat  i dont want a mouthful  and dora spoke the truth for the food would have choked her  you had better have a sandwich and a glass of milk  if you want to do something give me a glass of water she said finally for she wished a drink badly the cabin was so hot and stuffy  baxter went away and presently unlocked the door and handed her the water of which she drank eagerly  where are you going to take me she questioned as she passed back the glass  youll learn that all in good time dora  come why not take the whole matter easy went on the bully as he dropped into a seat near her  how can i take it easy  we wont hurt youill give you my word on that  she was about to say that his word was not worth giving but restrained herself  if she angered baxter there was no telling what the fellow might do  is this a plot of josiah crabtrees she asked sharply  baxter started  how did you he began and stopped short you had better not ask any questions  which means that you will not answer any  you can take it that way if you want to dora  it was a mean trick you played on me  lets talk of something else we are going to leave the falcon soon and i want to know if you are going with us quietly  leave the falcon  yes at cayuga  are we there already gasped dora in dismay  we soon will be  i dont wish to go with you  but we want you to go if you go quietly all will be welland ill promise to see you safe home in less than twentyfour hours  you wish to keep me away from home that length of time  if you must know yes  and why  so josiah crabtree cancan  she did not finish  so that mr crabtree can interview your motheryes put in mumps who had just appeared  baxter theres no use in beating around the bush  crabtree is bound to marry mrs stanhope and dora may as well know it now as later     chapter xviii  still in the hands of the enemy   that man will never marry my mother with my consent burst out the unhappy girl  she probably wont ask your consent sneered mumps  she would not marry him if i was with her  he only has an influence over her when i am away  exactlyand he knows that put in baxter  do you mean to say josiah crabtree is going to marry her now demanded dora springing to her feet  more than likely  then hehe hired you to carry me off  well talk about something else said the bully  will you leave the falcon quietly  where do you want me to go  to the home of an old lady who will treat you as nicely as she possibly can  dora shook her head  i dont wish to go anywhere excepting home and i wont submit a bit longer than i have to  dont be foolish exclaimed mumps  we might treat you a good deal worse if we were of a mind to do so  crabtree told us to bind and gag you  he did  yes  he says you are a perfect minx  a few words more followed and then both of the boys left the cabin  she wont submit whispered mumps  what had we best do  use the drug crabtree gave us answered baxter  its a lucky thing i brought that vial  yesif we dont have any tripup in the matter answered the toady with a doubtful shake of his head  mumps had gone into the whole scheme rather unwillingly but now saw no way of backing out  a little later the falcon ran into the harbor of cayuga and came to anchor close to one of the docks  then baxter appeared with some sandwiches and a glass of milk  you might as well eat its foolish not to he said and set the food on a little stand  by this time dora was very hungry and as soon as the bully had left she applied herself to what had been brought  poor creature she did not know that both sandwiches and milk had been doctored with a drug calculated to make her dull and sleepy  she had hardly finished the scant meal when her eyes began to grow heavy  then her brain seemed to become clouded and she could scarcely remember where she was  heres news cried baxter coming in an hour later  we are to join your mother and mr crabtree at albany  at albany she repeated slowly  havehave they gone there  yes they are going on a honeymoon on the yacht flyaway  your mother wants you to join her and forgive her  dora heaved a long sigh  i cannot i cannot she sobbed and burst again into tears  nevertheless she allowed herself to be led off the falcon and to the depot  your face is full of tears said baxter  here put this veil over it and she was glad enough to do as bidden that folks might not stare at her  what happened afterward was very much like a dream to her  she remembered entering the cars and crouching down in a seat with baxter beside her  a long ride in the night followed and she slept part of the way although troubled with a horrible nightmare  she wanted to flee but seemed to lack both the physical and mental strength to do so  the ride at an end baxter and mumps almost carried her to the river  here the flyaway was in waiting  bill goss had gone on ahead and notified his wife that she was wanted  it may as well be added here that mrs goss was as coarse and unprincipled as her husband  when doras mind was once more clear she found herself in a much larger cabin than that she had formerly occupied  she lay on a couch and mrs goss a fat uglylooking creature sat beside her  are you awake dear asked the woman as smoothly as she could  whowho are you asked dora feebly  i am mrs goss  i dont know you wherewhere is my motherand mr crabtree  youll have to ask mr baxter or mr fenwick about that  do you belong on this boat  i do when i go out with my husband  was he the man who was with those boys  yes  where are we now  on the hudson river just below albany  where are they going to take me next  you had better ask mr baxter  i was only brought on board to wait on you  then that means that they wish to take me quite a distance cried dora and ran on deck  mumps and baxter were talking earnestly together near the bow at once she ran to them  where is my mother  youll see her soon answered the former bully of putnam hall  it was another trick of yours burst out dora  and i think you gave me something last night to make me sleepy  what if we did came from mumps  you are all right now  i do not want to go another step with you  dora looked around and saw a strange boat passing  help help she screamed  at once there was another row in which not only the boys but also bill goss and his wife took a hand  in the end poor dora was marched to the cabin and put under lock and key  if the girl had been disheartened before she was now absolutely downcast  they have me utterly in their power she moaned over and over again  heaven alone knows where they will take me  and then she sank down on her knees and prayed that god might see her safely through her perils  her prayer seemed to calm her and she felt that there was at least one power that would never desert her  poor poor mamma how i wish i knew what was happening to her she murmured  slowly the hours went by  mrs goss came and went and dora was even allowed to go on deck whenever no other boat was close at hand  thus martin harris saw her but as we know that meeting amounted to nothing  it was mrs goss who served the meals and as dora could not starve she was compelled to eat what was set before her the fare being anything but elaborate  sorry but we havent got a hotel chef on board observed dan baxter as he came in during the supper hour  but ill try to get something better on board at new york  do you mean to say you intend to take me away down to that city queried dora  humph we are going further than that  and to where  wait and see  are you afraid to tell me  i dont think it would be a wise thing to do  we are just going to take a short ocean trip began mumps when baxter stopped him  dont talk so muchyoull spoil everything remarked the bully  an ocean trip burst out dora  no  no  i do not wish to go on the ocean  as i said before i think youll go where the yacht goes  does my mother know anything of this  she knows you are away grinned mumps  you need not tell me that exclaimed dora  you are a mean mean boy so there  and she turned on her heel and walked off  she wished she had learned how to swim  they were running quite close to shore and she felt that a good swimmer could gain land without much effort  then a man came out from shore in a large flatboat  help  help she cried  save me and i will reward you well they are carrying me away from home  whats that called out the man and dora repeated her words before any of the others could stop her  all right ill do what i can for you said the man and running up beside the yacht which had become caught in a sudden calm he made fast with a boathook     chapter xix  dora tries to escape   now were in a pickle whispered mumps  that man may cause us a whole lot of trouble  you let me do the talking answered dan baxter  help goss get her back to the cabin  i wont go back screamed dora  let me be  and she ran for the rail  but mumps caught hold of her and dragged her back  then bill goss approached followed by his wife  you must go below miss said the sailor  come nancy give us a lift  poor dora found herself at once surrounded and shoved back  she tried to call out again but mumps checked her with that everready hand of his  be careful shouted baxter for the benefit of the man on the flatboat  treat her with care poor girl  all right grinned mumps  come down you go he went on to dora and literally forced her down the companionway  once in the cabin she was left in mrs goss care  the door was locked and goss and mumps went on deck to learn what baxter was doing  what does this mean asked the man in the flatboat  he was a farmer who had just been taking a load of hay across the stream  oh its all right answered baxter carelessly  thats my sister  your sister  yes  whats the row  no row at allexcepting that i am trying to get her back to the asylum  is she crazy  a little bit but not near as bad as she used to be  she got out of the asylum in brooklyn yesterday and ive had my hands full trying to get her back  she imagines she is a sea captain and always runs off with my uncles yacht  i see  thats putty bad for your family  oh yes but we are getting used to it  take care we are going to swing around  never suspecting that he had been regaled with a string of falsehoods the farmer let go with his boathook and yacht and flatboat speedily drifted apart  it was with a big sigh of relief that dan baxter saw the flatboat recede in the distance  that was a narrow shave he muttered  if that fellow had insisted on talking to dora there would have been a whole lot of trouble  in vain dora waited for the man to come on board  he had said that he would do what he could for her  surely he would not desert her  but as the time slipped by her heart failed her and she gave herself up to another crying spell  this caused mumps and goss to withdraw and she was left alone again with mrs goss  where are we now she asked at length  we are approaching new york was the answer  and that man what of him  oh he didnt come an board  it was night when the flyaway came to a landing near the upper portion of the metropolis  the boys and bill goss went ashore leaving dora in mrs goss care  be careful and dont let her escape cautioned dan baxter  we wont be gone very long  baxter had left for a telegraph office expecting to receive a message from josiah crabtree  for half an hour mrs goss sat in the cabin watching dora who was pacing the floor impatiently  make yourself comfortable miss said the woman  it wont do you any good to get all worked up over the matter  you do not understand my situation mrs goss faltered dora if you did understand i am sure you wouldnt keep me a prisoner in this fashion  i am only obeying orders miss  if i didnt my bill would almost kill me  is he so harsh to you  he is now  but he didnt used to bewhen he didnt drink  then he drinks now  yes twice over what is good for him  where have they gone  to a telegraph office  didnt they say they would be back soon  yes  dora said no more but sank down on the couch  then an idea came to her mind and lying back she closed her eyes and pretended to go to sleep  the woman watched her closely for a while then satisfied that the girl had really dropped off gave a long sigh of relief  i guess i can get a little sleep myself she muttered  i think i deserve it  she locked the cabin door carefully and placed the key in her pocket   then she stretched out in an easy chair with her feet on a low stool  dora watched her out of the corner of her eye as a cat watches a mouse  was the woman really sleeping  soon mrs goss breathing became loud and irregular  she must be asleep thought dora and stirred slightly  mrs goss took no notice of this and with her heart in her throat the girl slipped noiselessly from her resting place and stood up  still the woman took no notice and now dora found herself confronted by a most difficult task  without the key to the cabin door she could do nothing and how to obtain the much coveted article was a problem  with trembling hands she sought the pocket of mrs goss dress only to find that the woman was sitting on the key  oh dear this is the worst yet she murmured  as she stood in the middle of the cabin in perplexity her captor gave a long sigh and turned partly over in her chair  the pocket was now free and within easy reach and with deft fingers dora drew the key forth and tiptoed her way to the cabin door  she was so agitated that she could hardly place the key in the keyhole  the lock had been used but seldom and the action of the salt air had rusted it greatly  as the key turned there was a grating sound which caused mrs goss to awaken with a start  whats the matter  who is there she cried and turned around to face the cabin door  come back here  come back  she started after dora who now had the cabin door wide open away went girl and woman up the low stairs  but dora was the more agile of the two and terror lent speed to her limbs  on the deck however she came to a pause  the flyaway was a good six feet from the dock and between lay a stretch of dark murky water the sight of which made her shiver  what if she should fall in  she felt that she would surely be drowned  but as mrs goss came closer her terror increased  she felt that if she was caught she would be treated more harshly than ever for having attempted to run away  ill take the chances she though and leaped as best she could  her feet struck the very edge of the string piece beyond and for an instant it looked as if she must go over  but she clutched at a handy rail and quickly drew herself to  a place of safety  and yet safety was but temporary for mrs goss followed her in her leap and struck the dock directly behind her  come back you minx she cried and caught dora by the skirt  i wont come back  let me be screamed the girl and tore herself loose ripping her garment at the same time  then she started up the dock as swiftly as her trembling limbs would carry her  but fate was against her for as she gained the very head of the dock bill goss appeared followed by baxter and mumps  hullo whos this cried the sailor  the gal sure as you are born  she is running away called out mrs goss  stop her  here this will never do roared dan baxter  come here dora stanhope and he made a clutch at her  soon the two boys were in pursuit with the sailor close behind fortunately for the evildoers the spot was practically deserted so that dora could summon no assistance even though she began to call for help at the top of her lungs  the girl had covered less than a halfblock when baxter ranged up alongside of her  this wont work he said roughly  come back and he held her tight  let me go she screamed  help  help  close her mouth put in mumps  if this keeps on well have the police down on us in no time  again his hand was placed over doras mouth while baxter caught her from behind  then goss came up  well have to carry her said the former bully of putnam hall take her by the feet  wots the meanin o this cried a voice out of the darkness and the crowd found themselves confronted by a dirtylooking tramp who had been sleeping behind a pile of empty hogsheads  help me cried dora  bring the police  tell them i am dora stanhope of cedarville and that i  she could get no further for mumps cut her short  dora stanhope repeated the tramp  if you forget this my man said baxter heres half a dollar for you  this lady is my cousin who is crazy  she just escaped from an asylum  tanks came from the tramp and he pocketed the money in a hurry  then he ran off in the darkness  hes going to tell the police anyway cried goss  you had better get away from here  you are right responded mumps  hurry up i dont want to be arrested  as quickly as it could be done they carried dora aboard of the yacht and bundled her into the cabin  now keep her there cried baxter to mrs goss  after we are off you can explain how she got away  she hit me with a stick and knocked me down said the woman glibly  she shant get away a second time  once again poor dora found herself a prisoner on board of the flyaway  then the lines were cast off the sails set and they stood off in the darkness down new york bay and straight for the ocean beyond     chapter xx  a long chase begun   as they journeyed down the hudson the boys and martin harris scanned the river eagerly for some sign of the flyaway  its ten to one she put down a pretty good distance remarked dick  they wouldnt bring dora over here unless they were bound for new york or some other place as far or further  i believe you said tom  but she may be delayed and if what harris says is true the searchlight ought to make better time than baxters craft  several miles were covered when sam who had just come up from the cabin called attention to a farmer who was ferrying a load of hay across the river  if hes been at that sort of work all day he may know something of the flyaway he suggested  well hail him anyway said tom  it wont do any harm providing we dont lose any time  so the farmer was hailed and asked if he had seen anything of the craft  waal now i jest guess i did he replied  they war havin great times on board of hera takin care of that crazy gal  a crazy girl cried dick  who said she was crazy  one of the young men  he said she was his sister and had escaped from some asylum  she called to me to help her  but i dont want nuthin to do with crazy gals  my wifes cousin was out of his head and he cut up high jinks around the house athreatenin folks with a butcher knife  that girl was not crazy though as it happens said dick coldly  that villain was carrying her away from home against her will  she was no relation to him  by gosh  the farmers face fell and he stared at the youth blankly  you are certain of this  yes  we are after the crowd now  if we catch them well put them in prison just as sure as you are the greatest greeny we ever met continued dick and motioned to harris to continue the journey  the farmer wanted to talk back as the saying is but could find no words  well maybe i deserved it he muttered to himself  i was tuk in no doubt ont  and he continued to ferry his hay load along  well we are on the right track thats one satisfaction said tom  that farmer couldnt have done much against a man and two big boys  he could have gone ashore and got help replied dick  but he was so green he took in all that was told to him for simple truth  how dan baxter must have laughed over the way his ruse worked  yes and mumps too added sam  say we ought to punch their heads well for them when we catch them  let us get our eggs before we cook them said tom  by the way im getting hungry  ditto came from harris  will you boys see what you can offer  i dont like to leave the tiller for i know just how to get the best speed out of the searchlight  ill get up some kind of a meal said sam who had played cook on many previous occasions  inside of half an hour he had the table set and harris was called down dick taking his place  by the time all hands had been served they were in sight of upper new york city  now we had better take in some sail said the old sailor  the yachts are pretty thick around here and we will miss the flyaway without half trying unless we are careful  by the time it was dark they were pretty well down the water front of the metropolis  a consultation was held and it was decided to lower the mainsail and topsail and leave only the jib flying  we cant go much further tonight anyway said harris  i dont know but what it may be as well to tie up somewhere  well have to do that unless we can catch some sort of clue responded dick gloomily  if they have taken her to some place in new york well have a big job to find her  a halfhour passed and they were on the point of turning in at a dock when tom gave a cry  look  look  whats up tom came from dick and sam simultaneously  is that the flyaway  all gave a look and saw a large yacht moving away from a dock just below where they had thought to stop  call harris cried dick and sam ran to the cabin for the sailor who had just gone below  i reckon thats our boat said martin harris after a quick look  hark cried dick and held up his hand  thats dan baxters voice just as sure as fate  i believe you returned sam  come we can run her down in no time  as quickly as it could be accomplished the course of the searchlight was changed  but the tall buildings of the city cut off a good deal of wind and it took several minutes before they could get their sails filled  boat ahoy shouted tom before dick could stop him  is that the flyaway  thats tom rover came back in mumps voice  they have tracked us after all  tom what made you call  demanded dick in disgust   we might have sneaked upon them unawares  never mind i reckon we can catch them any how returned tom but he was crestfallen nevertheless as he realized the truth of his elder brothers observation  crowd on the sail harris  thats what i am adoin came from the sailor  well catch em before they gain the battery  yes but we must be careful said dick  we dont want to have a collision with some other boat  no indeed put in sam  why if one of those big ferryboats ran into us there would be nothing left of the searchlight  you jest trust me came from martin harris i know my business and there wont be any accidents  the other yacht is making for the jersey shore cried sam a little later  if we dont look out well lose her  there she goes behind a big ferryboat  shes going to try to bother us grumbled martin harris as he received a warning whistle from the ferryboat and threw the yacht over on the opposite tack  the fellow who is sailing that boat knows his business  its that bill goss i suppose said tom  there they go behind another ferryboat  it wont matter so long as we keep her in sight said harris we are bound to run her down sooner or later  inside of half an hour the two boats had passed the statue of liberty  the course of the flyaway was now straight down the bay and the rover boys began to wonder where dan baxter and his crowd might be bound  they must have dora a close prisoner mused dick with a sad shake of his head  that is if they didnt leave her in new york he added suddenly  do you suppose they did that  asked sam  perhapsthere is no guessing what they did  we missed it by not telegraphing back to the authorities at cedarville to arrest josiah crabtree said tom  i think we can prove that he is in this game before the curtain falls on the last act  well telegraph when we get back answered dick never thinking of all that was to happen ere they should see the metropolis again  gradually the lights of the city faded from view and they found themselves traveling down the bay at a rate of five to six knots an hour  we dont seem to be gaining remarked tom after a long silence  i can just about make her out and thats all  but we are gaining and youll find it so pretty soon answered martin harris  they had the advantage in dodging among those other boats but now weve got a clear stretch before us  on and on went the two yachts until the flyaway was not over five hundred feet ahead of the searchlight  what did i tell you said harris  well overtake her in less than quarter of an hour  this is a regular yacht race smiled dick grimly  but its for more than the american cup  keep off came suddenly from ahead  keep off or it will be the worse for you  it was dan baxter who was shouting at them  the former bully of putnam hall stood at the stern rail of the flyaway and was using his hands like a trumpet  you had better give up the race baxter called dick in return you cant get away from us no matter how hard you try  keep off repeated baxter  we wont stand any nonsense  we are not here for nonsense put in tom  what have you done with dora stanhope  dont know anything about dora stanhope came back from mumps  you have her on board of your boat  its a falsehood  then you left her somewhere in new york  we havent seen her at all put in baxter  if you are looking for her you are on the wrong trail  she went away with josiah crabtree  did he take her to albany  no  they went west  we do not believe you baxter said dick warmly you are one of the greatest rascals i ever metnot counting your fatherand the best thing you can do is to surrender if you dont youll have to take the consequences  and we warn you to keep off  if you dont well shoot at you was the somewhat surprising response  no no please dont shoot at them came in doras voice  i beg of you not to shoot  she had escaped from mrs goss custody and now ranged up alongside of dan baxter and her other enemies who were handling the flyaway  her hair was flying wildly over her shoulders and she trembled so she could scarcely stand     chapter xxi  the meeting in the bay   there is dora now cried dick and his heart leaped into his throat at the sight of his dearest friend  dick rover are you there came from the girl in nervous tones  yes dora i am here with my brothers and a sailor friend  save me please  we will came from all of the rover boys in concert  take her below roared baxter angrily as he turned to mrs goss who had followed dora to the dock  didnt i tell you to keep a close eye on her  she said she wished to speak to you answered the woman  i thought she wanted to make terms with you  mrs goss caught dora by the wrist and assisted by mumps carried her below  she struggled and tried to fight them off and her cries reaching dick made the youth long to be at her side  let her alone baxter he cried hotly  if you harm her you shall pay dearly for it remember that  talk is cheap dick rover came back with a sneer  now keep off or ill do as i threatened  you wont dare to fire on us  wont i  just come a little closer and youll see  by this time the two yachts were not over a hundred feet apart the searchlight to the starboard of her rival  so far the countless stars had brightened up the bosom of the ocean but now martin harris noted a dark mass of clouds rolling up from the westward  well have it pretty dark in a few minutes he cautioned  if you want to haul up close better do it at once  all right run them down ordered dick half recklessly  i dont care how much their boat is damaged so long as i save the girl  mumps ran me down remember  i reckon i can sheer em all right enough grinned harris who by this time had entered fully into the spirit of the adventure but will they shoot  i dont believe they have any firearms said tom  and if they have i dont think baxter could hit the side of a house at fifty yards  are you going to keep off or not yelled baxter  ill give you just ten seconds in which to make up your mind  by jinks  he has got a gun whispered sam as he caught a glint of the polished barrel  the villain  baxter you are playing a foolish game answered dick  what do you intend to do with dora stanhope  thats my business  i shant harm herif youll promise to leave me alone  did you run off with her on crabtrees account  its none of your business put in mumps who had just returned to the deck after making sure that dora should not get away from mrs goss again for the time being  it is my business  youre awfully sweet on her aint you  do you know its a states prison offense to abduct anybody  i havent abducted anybody  she came of her own free willat first  its not my fault if shes sick of her bargain now  i dont believe a word you say  do as you please  but are you going to keep off or not  well not keep off  then ill fire on you  if you do so well fire in return said sam  maybe we can scare him too he added in a whisper  i dont believe youve got any weapon came from mumps in a voice that the toady tried in vain to steady  if there was one thing mumps was afraid of it was a gun or a pistol  try us and see said tom  then he raised his voice  harris bring up that brace of pistols you said were in the locker  all right answered the sailor catching at the ruse at once and he hurried below to return with two shining barrels made of the handles of a dipper and a tin pot  he held one of the tin barrels out at arms length  shall i fire on em now he demanded at the top of his voice  dont shrieked mumps and dropped out of sight behind the mainmast of the flyaway  the toady had scarcely uttered the word when a loud report rang out and a pistol bullet cut its way through the mainsail of the searchlight  baxter had fired his gun but had taken good care to point the weapon over the rover boys heads  the bully now ran for the cabin expecting to receive a shot in return but of course it did not come  by this time the two yachts were almost side by side and running along at a high rate of speed   harris got out his boathook to catch fast to the flyaway when a cry from tom made him pause  help me  dont leave me behind  great caesar gasped sam  toms overboard  down with the mainsail roared harris  how did he fall over the side  he tried to jump to the other boat said dick who had seen the action  i was just thinking of doing it myself  with all possible speed the big sheet of the searchlight was lowered and then they turned as fast as the wind would permit to the spot where unlucky tom was bobbing up and down on the swells like a peanut shell  catch the line cried dick and let fly with a life preserver attached to a fairsized rope  his aim was a good one and soon tom was being hauled aboard again with all possible speed  oh what a mess i made of it he panted when he could catch his breath  im not fit to hunt jack rabbits  its lucky you werent run down by the yacht and killed said dick  i was going to jump but when i saw you go down i thought better of it  ten minutes of precious time had been lost and now the flyaway was once more far in the distance  she was heading for shore and soon the oncoming darkness hid her from view  now whats to be done questioned sam  shell slip us sure  she cant go very far answered harris  the waterline around here is rather dangerous in the dark  is that a storm coming up asked dick  i wouldnt be surprised  with care they continued on their way taking the course they surmised their enemies had pursued  there is some kind of land cried sam who was on the watch what place is that harris  beckers cove so they call it answered the old tar   its not far from staten island  do you think they came in here  if they did i reckon they calculate to stay over night  why  because theyll want a pilot otherwise  its rather dangerous sailing about hereespecially in the dark  five minutes later found them close to shore and the sails were lowered and the anchor cast out  im going to land said dick and after a consultation it was decided that he should take sam with him leaving tom and martin harris to keep watch from the yacht  if either party discovered anything a double whistle twice repeated was to notify the others  now that dan baxter had actually opened fire on them dick wished he had a firearm of some sort  but none was at hand nor did he know where to obtain such a thing in that vicinity and the best he and sam could do was to cut themselves clubs out of some brush growing not far from the shore line  the spot at which they had landed was by no means an inviting one  it looked like a bit of dumping and meadow ground and not far away rested the remains of half a dozen partly decayed canal boats which the tide had washed up high in the bogs years before  if they landed around here id like to know where they went to grumbled sam after he and his big brother had trudged around for half an hour without gaining any clue worth following   it begins to look as if we had missed it doesnt it  never give up sam  we have got to find them you know  yes if we dont break our necks before that time comes dick and as sam spoke he went down into a meadow hole up to his knees dick helped him out and as he did so the sound of two voices broke upon their ears  you neednt come if you dont want to mumps came out of the darkness in dan baxters voice  i only thought you would be glad of the chance  there they are whispered dick  lie down and well see where they are bound and if dora is with them  he threw himself to earth and sam followed  in another moment baxter and his toady came into plain view although still some distance away  ill come came from mumps   but i didnt expect to meet your father here  i did  hes been here for several days  thats the reason why i had goss bring the flyaway over  im going to kill two birds with one stone  what do you mean  im going to carry dora stanhope off just as old crabtree wanted and im going to give my father a lift  you mean that you are going to help him to escape from the authorities  i didnt put it that way  he wants to keep out of sight  it amounts to the same thing dan  as you will  will you come or do you want to go back to the yacht  ieri guess ill come faltered the toady  but we must be careful  to be sure  i reckon i have as much at stake as you  the two passed out of hearing and dick touched his brother on the arm  did you hear that sam he asked excitedly  i did  what can it mean  mean  it means that dan baxters father is in the neighborhood and dan is going to call on his parent  i know that but  you are surprised that father and son are equally bad  im not i thought it all along  what will you do  follow them  will you whistle for tom and martin harris  no that might arouse suspicion  let us follow them alone when they return to their yacht we can tell the others concluded dick     chapter xxii  the baxters make a new move   as silently as possible dick and sam came after baxter and his toady john fenwick  the pair of evildoers left the stretch of meadow as fast as they could and hurried up a narrow path leading to a halftumbleddown brick factory  at the corner of the dilapidated building they paused and dan baxter emitted a long low whistle  a silence of several seconds followed and then a man appeared out of the darkness  whos dat came the question  its me girkdan baxter replied the former bully of putnam hall with small regard for the grammar that had been taught to him  whos dat with you  mumps  hes all right  i dont know about dat  yer father tought yer would come alone growled the tramp thief  ive got a new movement on buddy  take us to my father without delay  is dat fellow to be trusted  yes you can trust me replied mumps with considerable nervousness  his steps in the direction of wrong were beginning to frighten him  at the start he had thought of nothing but to aid josiah crabtree in his suit with mrs stanhope and had calculated that after the marriage the running off with dora would be overlooked  but here he was taking the girl miles from her home and associated with two men who had robbed a firm of bankers of many thousands of dollars  the outlook consequently worried him very much  all right den muttered buddy girk  follow me  he disappeared within the ruined factory and baxter and mumps went after him  listening intently at a brokenout window dick and sam heard them ascend to an upper floor  i guess we have tracked arnold baxter  whispered dick  i wonder if he and girk have that stolen money and the securities here  more than likely dick  thieves dont generally leave their booty far out of their sight so ive been told  i would like to make sure  i wonder if we cant go inside and hear some more of their talk  we would be running a big risk  if arnold baxter caught us he wouldwouldwell he wouldnt be very friendly thats all and sam gave a shiver  im going in  you can remain outside on watch  if you want me whistle as we agreed  but be careful dick pleaded the younger brother  i will be  and dont stay too long added sam who did not relish being left alone in such a forlorn looking spot and in the intense darkness which had now settled down over them  i wont be any longer than necessary you can depend on that replied the big brother  as silently as a cat after a mouse dick entered the gloomy building and felt his way over the halfrotted floor to where the stairs were located  ascending these he found himself in something of a hallway the upper floor of the building being divided into several apartments by wooden partitions nine or ten feet in height  from one of the apartments shone a faint light  to this he made his way and looking through a goodsized knothole in the partition he saw arnold baxter girk and the two newcomers seated on several boxes and boards  on one box stood a candle thrust in the neck of a bottle some liquor and glasses and a pasteboard box containing a cold lunch  so youre glad ive come eh dan baxter was saying to his father  yes i am glad was the slow reply that isi want to get away from here as soon as possible  why dont you go  im afraid to go up into the town  i would prefer to go away by boat  to where  to searock on the jersey coast  do you want us to take you there  if you can do it dan  ill give mumps and your sailor friend a nice little sum for your trouble  and dont i get anything cried the son sharply  to be sure dan  how much  ill give you a hundred dollars  pooh  whats that  i want more  well arrange that later  you and girk are making a fortune out of this deal  not as much as you think  ive read the newspapers and i know how much was in the haul  i want a thousand dollars  well arrange that afterward dan  remember in the future what is mine is yours  now youre talking dad was the bullys quick reply  i like the way you are doing things and im going to stick to you as soon as this little matter mumps and i have on hand is settled  all right you shall stay with me responded the elder baxter where is your boat  not over half a mile from here  all ready to sail  yes  then let us make off at once  dats it put in buddy girk  im afraid the police will let down on us any minit  the trouble is that other boat i mentioned is after us  how many are on board  the three rover boys and an old sailor  four and well be five not counting the woman you mentioned i dont think i am afraid of the rovers returned arnold baxter besides cant we get away from them in the dark without their knowing what is up  perhaps we can said the son slowly the trouble iswhats that  dan baxter stopped short as a cracking sound broke upon their ears  dick had stepped on a rotten board and it went down  his foot was caught and held at the ankle and before he could extricate himself arnold baxter and buddy girk had him in their grasp  dick rover again ejaculated arnold baxter  where did you come from  your son can tell you that answered dick  let go of me  to be sure i will returned the elder baxter sarcastically are you alone  you can look for yourself  i dont see no buddy here announced girk as he held up the candle  maybe somebody is downstairs  ill go down and see put in dan baxter  fearful that sam might be caught dick did his best to break away  sam sam look out for yourself he yelled  dont let them catch you  call tom and harris and the police quick  hang the luck muttered arnold baxter  we must cut for it and be lively about it too  take de swag said girk referring to a tin box hidden under the flooring of the factory  in this was hidden the money and securities stolen from rush and wilder  he ran off to get  the box  in the meantime arnold baxter stood undecided as to what to do  then he raised his fist and struck dick with an unexpected blow to the temple  take that you imp he cried and the youth went down at full length more than half stunned  in the meantime sam heard the rapid footsteps and the cry of alarm and his heart leapt to throat  then as dan baxter and mumps came towards him he retreated in the direction of the searchlight giving the danger signal as he ran  ive got de box shouted buddy girk to arnold baxter  wots de next move  follow me said dan baxter  and lose no time  that other boy will soon have the whole neighborhood aroused  away went the crowd out of the factory the bully leading  once down in the meadow dan baxter hurried them off in the direction of a tiny cove where the flyaway lay at anchor with bill goss on watch at the stern and mrs goss in the cabin with dora  as quickly as they could do so one after another tumbled on board of the yacht  they heard cries in the distance as tom and martin harris leaped ashore to join sam  up the mainsail roared dan baxter and goss obeyed the order with alacrity  at the same time dan baxter and mumps pulled up the anchor and in less than two minutes the flyaway was standing out into the bay     chapter xxiii  down the staten island shore to sandy hook   dick  dick  what ails you  my head sam  arnold baxter struck me down came with a groan  can you get up  we want to follow them cried tom as he caught his brother by the arm  he had just reached the factory on a dead run lantern in hand to find dick  i guess i can stand tom  but i cant run yet  here take the lantern and ill carry you came quickly and in a moment more tom rover had dick on his back and was running for the searchlight as rapidly as the nature of the meadow land permitted dick holding the light over his head so that both might see  the alarm had now become general and by the time the yacht was gained two police officers who had been on the hunt for harbor thieves appeared  whats the row about demanded one of the officers of the law as he came into view  is that an officer questioned dick feebly  i am an officeryes  we are after some thieves and some parties who have abducted a girl will you help us  certainly if what you say is true  where is the crowd  they ran off in that direction came from sam as he loomed up out of the darkness  they have a yacht out there somewhere  then we cant catch themunless we get a boat answered sergeant brown  we have a boat out this way and sam pointed with his hand but i guess we had better make certain that they go out first  true for you young man  lead the way and well be with you  all ran on again tom bringing up in the rear with dick  soon the cove previously mentioned was gained  they were just in time to see the flyaway disappearing in the darkness  come back here cried tom if you dont it will be the worse for you  dont you attempt to follow us came savagely from arnold baxter   if you do somebody will get shot  by crickety hes a bad one cried the second police officer  stop  i order you to stop in the name of the law shouted sergeant brown  its the police howled mumps in sudden terror  oh dear i knew we should catch it  shut up muttered dan baxter  run up the jib goss and be quick about it  you do itill have to steer here answered the sailor and dan baxter leaped for the sheet mentioned  are you going to stop cried sergeant brown after a few seconds pause  to this there was no answer  the sergeant drew his pistol but before he could use it even if he so intended the yacht was nothing but an uncertain shadow in the gloom of the night  we had better get to your boat said the police officer  all right come on said sam and showed the way which was decidedly uncertain  at one point there was a wide ditch to cross and tom had his hands full getting dick over  martin harris was watching for them and had all ready to cast off should this be required  im mighty glad you found the police he said to dick who now felt able to do for himself once more  will they go with us  you are certain those folks on the other boat are thieves demanded sergeant brown  carter and i dont want to go off on any wild goose chase  they are not only thieves but abductors said dick  we can easily prove it  they must be caught if it is possible to do so  all right then well go with you  come carter and the two officers hopped on board  soon the mainsail was set followed by all the other available canvas and the searchlight was continuing the chase which had been so curiously broken off  martin harris was in the dark so far as knowing what course the flyaway had taken and had to trust to luck to fall in with the fleeing craft  if shes going outside of staten island i reckon i can spot her before long he said  it looks to me as if the clouds were blowing away said tom if they do the starlight will help us a good deal  as the yacht tore along through the water the two police officers listened with close attention to what the boys had to tell them  if they are the men who robbed rush  wilder it will make a fine haul to capture them said sergeant brown  we want to save dora stanhope as much as we want to catch those thieves returned dick  i wonder if her disappearance has been reported to the police  i cant say  you see carter and i have been out all day looking for a pair of harbor thieves who stole some clothing from a pleasure yacht lying off the staten island shore  did you see anything of your men  we saw them but they got away in a rowboat  where they have gone to is hard telling  but i dont imagine the theft amounted to muchat least it was nothing in comparison to the crimes you are trying to run down  on and on went the searchlight through the night and slowly but surely the clouds in the heavens cleared away letting the stars shine down once more on the silent waters  suddenly martin harris gave a murmur of satisfaction there she is  the flyaway came from several of the others  yes  just as i thought she is heading down the staten island shore straight for sandy hook  they are bound for searock cried dick suddenly  mr baxter mentioned the place just before they discovered that i was spying on them  thats a good way down the new jersey coast said sergeant brown  can this boat stand such a sail  can she snorted harris  shes strong enough to go to europe if you want to make the trip  thank you when i go to europe ill go in a steamer laughed the police officer  i dont think youd do much in a heavy blow  the searchlight would hold her own answered the old sailor confidently  the breeze was increasing and they rounded the narrows at a lively rate  the swell from the ocean now struck them and the yacht occasionally dipped her nose a little deeper into it than was expected  here i dont want to get wet cried carter  im no sailor you know  you wont get much laughed harris  this roll is just enough to be pleasant  perhapsto some people came from the policeman who had never cared for the rolling deep and who was beginning to feel a trifle seasick  fortunately for him however the sickness proved mild and of short duration  the flyaway was now in plain sight but too far off to be spoken she had every sail set to its fullest and for the time being it seemed impossible for the searchlight to gain upon her  thus mile after mile was covered until sandy hook lighthouse could be plainly seen but a short distance away  we are out in the ocean now remarked dick an hour later gracious when i left cedarville i didnt think that this was going to develop into such a long chase  never mind how far we go if only the chase proves a success answered tom  if we succeed in not only rescuing dora but also in bringing those thieves to justice it will be a big feather in our caps  im glad the police are along came from sam  they must be well armed and i dont see how arnold baxter and the others will dare resist them  they will dare a good deal to keep out of prison sam remarked dick  they know well enough that if they are caught it may mean a long term for each of them  on and on went the two yachts until sandy hook lighthouse was left in the distance  once it began to cloud over as if there was a storm in sight but soon the rising sun came out brightly over the rim of the ocean  when it came mealtime sam prepared the repast and all even the officers of the law enjoyed what was served to them  it gives one an appetite this salt air was sergeant browns comment  soon they were standing down the new jersey coast but so far out on the ocean that the shore line was little more than a dark streak on the horizon  are we gaining that was the question each asked not once but a score of times  martin harris felt sure that they were but if this was so the advantage on the side of the searchlight was but a slight one     chapter xxiv  searchlight and lantern   one thing is in our favor remarked dick as the day wore away and the distance between the two yachts seemed undiminished even if we dont succeed in catching them before tonight we know where they are bound  perhaps it might be as well to hang back burst in tom  if we remain in sight they wont land as intended  the thing of it is they may change their plans especially if they think your brother overheard their talk put in the police sergeant  my idea is theyll keep right on down the coast until the darkness hides them from us  then theyll try to sneak in some cove or river and abandon the boat  theyll have a job taking dora stanhope along was sams remark  i dont believe shell go another step willingly  as if she has gone willingly said dick  well i mean shell be more on her guard than she was and theyll have more of a job to make her go along  night settled down gradually and found every heart full of serious speculation  dick was especially affected for he had hoped to see dora rescued hours before  goodness only knows where they will take her by morning he groaned  id give almost anything to be at her side  with the going down of the sun the wind died away and the sails of the searchlight flapped idly to and fro  now its a waiting game announced martin harris  if we cant move neither can they  just the same the flyaway is turning out to sea cried tom now what can that mean  that may be only a blind said carter  no they are afraid of drifting on the sands answered the skipper of the searchlight  i reckon well have to turn out too and he changed the course of the yacht  darkness found both boats far out on the atlantic and almost out of sight of each other  this is maddening cried dick  cant we row or do something  rowing wouldnt count much im afraid laughed martin harris but dont fret  unless i am mistaken well have a breeze before midnight  and they may be out of sight long before that time  thats to be seen lad  ill watch the thing closely for im as anxious to catch em as you are  id give a good deal for a small boat  so would i  i thought all yachts carried them  they do generally but mine was stove in at a catskill dock about a week ago and is being repaired  here comes the wind shouted sam half an hour later and when the flyaway was almost out of sight  now harris let us make the most of it  we will and i hope there isnt too much of it was the quick reply  soon the breeze struck them and as it came from shore it hit the searchlight first and drove her fairly close to the other yacht  but before anything could be said or done the other craft also moved and then the chase began as before  were getting all we want now announced tom as the wind grew heavier  just look how the yacht dips her nose into the brine  well have to shorten sail before long said martin harris if we dont a sudden gust might make us lose our stick  id like to see the flyaway lose her mast cried tom  it would just serve the baxters right if they went to the bottom  no we dont want to see that yacht harmed put in dick quickly  remember dora is on boardand that stolen fortune too  swiftly both yachts flew on their outward course the ocean growing more tempestuous each minute  the police officers viewed the turn of affairs with alarm  if its not safe let us turn back whispered carter  dont get scared so soon replied harris who overheard the remark  ive been in a worse blow than this twice over  the sails were reefed and they continued on their course  the flyaway was now but a shadow in the gloom and presently even this died out  the chase is over announced harris with disgust  hang the luck anyhow  what do you mean demanded dick  shes out of sight and there is no telling now how she will turn  but she cant tack back in this wind  she can make a putty good try at it lad  not much of a one lad  there is a little electric battery and light in the cabin one that was used by a professor that i took out two years ago when the yacht was built  he was interested in electricity and he made the light himself  i never used it for i didnt understand how it worked  let us look at the light perhaps we can do something with it said dick  thats the talk came from tom  anything is better than holding your hands and doing nothing  martin harris was willing and led the way into the cabin battery and light were stored away in a couple of soap boxes and the boys brought them out and set them on the cabin table  i think i can fix these up said dick after a long examination  the batteries are not in very good shape but i think they will do  they are meant to work on the same plan as these new electric lights for bicycles only they are i reckon more powerful  well do what you please with the machine said martin harris in the meantime ill see what i can do with a lantern and a tin reflector  sometimes you can see a white sail putty good with a tin reflector  he hurried to the deck again and sam who was not much interested in electricity followed him  one of the best of the yachts lanterns was polished up to the last degree and they also polished the metal reflector until it shone like a newly coined silver piece  thats a good light cried sam when it was lit up  where will you place it  up at the top of the mast answered the old sailor  ill show you  it took some time to adjust the lantern just right but this accomplished they found that they could see for a distance of a hundred yards or more  i see the sail announced harris  dont youjust over our port bow  i see it answered sergeant brown  not very far off either  without delay the course of the searchlight was changed so that she was headed directly for the flyaway  keep off was the cry out of the darkness  keep off or it will be the worse for you  you may as well give up shouted back the police sergeant you are bound to be caught sooner or later  we dont think go  if it comes to the worst remember we can do a heap of fighting  we can fight too was the grim response  dora  dora  are you safe shouted sam with all the strength of his youthful lungs  save me came back the cry  dont let them carry me further away  well do our best dont fear  dora wanted to say more but was prevented from doing so by mumps who again hurried her below  you must lock her up he said to mrs goss and once more the unhappy girl found herself a prisoner in the cabin  she had hoped for much during the chase along shore but now her heart sank like a lump of lead and she burst into tears  no use of crying said mrs goss  it wont help you a bit  i want to be free sobbed dora  where will they take me  never mind you just be quiet and wait  but you are running directly out into the ocean  what of that  i dont wish to go  youll have to take what comes as i told you before  mrs goss have you no pity for me  if i did have it wouldnt do you any good miss dora  ive got to do as the men folks want me to do  if i dont theyll make  the woman did not finish what she was saying  a loud report rang out on deck followed by the distant crash of glass  then came a yell followed by another report and more crashing of glassware  what can that mean burst out dora but instead of answering her  mrs goss bounced out of the cabin locking the door after her and hurried to the deck     chapter xxv  a shot from the darkness   the shots which had reached doras ears had come from a gun in the hands of arnold baxter  the man had been enraged at the sight of the lantern on the mast of the searchlight and taking careful aim had sent a charge of shot into the affair smashing globe reflector and tin cup and scattering the oil in all directions  hurrah i struck it shouted arnold baxter gleefully  now they wont see us quite so plainly  knock out the other lantern pop put in dan baxter and the parent turned in the second barrel of the shotgun with equal success  for an instant the deck of the searchlight seemed to be in darkness  sam felt a bit of hot glass strike him on the cheek and raised his hand to brush it off  then he felt something warm on the back of his leg  looking down he saw to his horror that some of the oil from the lantern had fallen on him and that it was ablaze  help help he shrieked  im burning up  his cry alarmed everybody and all even dick and tom came rushing to his aid  but sergeant brown was first and he promptly threw the boy down flat and whipping off his coat began to beat out the flames  another shot now rang out aimed at a third lantern but the light was not struck  by this time martin harris made the discovery that the mainsail was on fire in two places while the jib was also suffering  this is getting hot he cried when carter opened up fire at random determined to do what he could  a yell and a groan followed and then all became quiet and firing on both sides was over  fortunately for sam the flames upon his person were quickly extinguished and all the lad really suffered was the ruin of his trousers and an ugly blister on the calf of his leg  but he was badly scared and when it was over he had almost to be carried to the cabin  in the meantime martin harris procured several pails of water and a longhandled swab and with these did what he could to extinguish the fire on the sails  several of the others joined in and inside of ten minutes all danger of a conflagration was past  thats the worst yet growled the old sailor as he surveyed the mainsail which had two holes in it each is large as a barrel  id like to wring the neck of the fellow as did it yes i would and he shook his head determinedly  thats the end of that light said sergeant brown  what are you going to do next  i think i can get that searchlight to work put in dick  but will it be of any use  they may start to shooting again  weve got to have some kind of a light even if its only a tallow candle grumbled harris  if we havent got a light some coastwise steamer may run us down  he set to work to rig up a temporary light and in the meantime dick returned to the cabin to experiment with the electric light he found sam on the couch bathing his leg with oil to take away the sting of the bum  how is it samhurt much  i suppose it might be worse was the younger brothers reply i wonder who fired that shot  one of the baxters more than likely they are a coldblooded pair  one or more of us might have been killed if we had been directly behind the lights  that is true  i dont suppose arnold baxter would care much if we were   he was fathers enemy you must remember and he said he hated all of us  sam resumed his bathing and dick turned to the cabin table upon which the battery and other portions of the searchlight rested  dick had always been greatly interested in electricity and therefore the parts of the battery before him were not hard for him to understand  but there was one trouble with the battery which did not reach his eye as he turned it around and started it up  that was that a portion of the insulation of a main wire was worn off  as he turned on the current there was a flash and the light blazed up almost as bright as day  thats fine cried sam  well be able to see the flyaway a long distance off now  well i only hope when we put this up it wont be knocked out like the other lights were  of course well have to run that risk  in a minute more dick started to carry the searchlight to the deck  he had turned off the light proper consequently the way to the companionway was rather dark  he had almost reached the top of the steps when sam heard a scream saw a flash of fire and then dick came tumbling to the cabin floor in a heap with the battery and light beside him  my gracious hes been shocked burst out the youngest rover and forgetting all about his burn ran to his brothers assistance  whats that noise came from the deck  dicks been shocked by the searchlight  cried sam  come down here somebody and let us see what we can do for him  shocked is it cried sergeant brown  if thats the case look out that somebody else dont catch it  tom came tumbling down followed by both police officers and dick was picked up and deposited on the couch  then sam kicked the searchlight and batteries into a corner  they can stay there for all i care said he  they are too dangerous unless a chap knows just how to handle them  dick lay with his eyes wide open but unable to move  tom bent down and announced that his heart was still beating  but little in the way of restoratives were at hand and the most they could do was to rub the youths body in an attempt to restore the circulation  oh i hope he isnt permanently injured cried tom  if he should turn out a cripple it would be awful  thats so answered sam  poor dick  hes as bad off as if those rascals had shot him  slowly dick came to his senses  but he was very weak and soon he discovered that he was powerless to move his left arm  its all numb he announced  it feels as if it was dead  let me shake it for you said tom and both brothers went to work but with small success  the arm hung down as limp as a rag and the left leg was nearly as badly off although dick said he could feel a slight sensation in it like so many needles sticking him  you see ive been afraid of that battery right along said martin harris  the professor got shocked once and he limped around for a long while after  but he got over it at last didnt he questioned tom eagerly  i cant say about that  he went off and i havent seen him since was the unsatisfactory reply  the injuries to dick and to sam had somewhat dampened toms ardor and he wondered what they had best do next and spoke to the police officers about it  i dont know of anything but to turn back to shore said sergeant brown  weve lost them in the dark and that is all there is to it  if we go ashore we can send out an alarm and as soon as the flyaway is spotted somebody will go out and arrest everybody on boardi mean everybody but the young lady of course  but they may come ashore in the dark  and they may do that even if we stay out hereand then theyll have more of an advantage than ever  no i think the best thing we can do is to turn back to the coast and make the safest landing we can find  when dick heard of this however he shook his head  dont go back yet he pleaded  see if you cant make out the flyaway somewhere  she wont dare to sail very far without a light  i dont go for giving up just yet put in martin harris  as the lad says shell show a light very soon nowfor there is a coastwise steamer acoming and he pointed in the direction of sandy hook  he was right and soon the many lights from the big steam vessel could be plainly seen  she was heading almost directly for them but presently steered to the eastward  she must be almost in the track of the flyaway went on martin harris  just wait and see if i aint right  they waited and watched eagerly and thus five minutes passed then from a distance they saw a light flash up  there she is cried tom  let us head for her at once  they wont keep that light out longjust long enough to let that steamer go by  martin harris was already at the tiller and soon the searchlight was thrown over and was again dipping her nose in the long ocean swells  the wind had died away only to freshen more than ever and the chase now became a lively one  the enemy seemed to know that the exposure of their light had given those on the searchlight the cue and they were sailing as rapidly as all of their canvas permitted  but harris was now handling his craft better than ever before and slowly but surely the distance between the two craft was diminished until the flyaway could be made out faintly even without a light  dont lose her again said dick  we must keep at it until we run them down completely  and harris promised to do his best  it was now past midnight and the police officers said they were tired out and dropped into the cabin to take a nap  dick likewise remained below trying to get up some circulation in the lamed arm  cant you feel anything queried tom  i think i can answered his big brother  yes yes its coming now he went on  thank god and he suddenly raised the arm and bent the fingers of his hand  by daylight that member of his body was nearly as well as ever  but this experience was one which dick has not forgotten to the present day  sam had bound up his burn with a rag saturated with oil and flour and announced that he felt quite comfortable  but just let me get hold of those baxters he added  i shant stand on any ceremony with them  i dont believe any of us will said tom  but as anxious as i am to have this over i would just as lief have the chase last until morning  then well be better able to see what we are doing  or trying to do said sam with a faint smile     chapter xxvi  a flag of truce   sunrise found the two yachts far out on the ocean with land nowhere in sight  the breeze was still stiff but it was not as heavy as it had been and martin harris was unable to decrease the space which separated his own craft from that of the enemy  you see the searchlight is the better boat in a strong blow he explained  when the wind is light the flyaway has as good a chance of making headway as we have  well one thing is certain said tom  this chase cant last forever  it may last longer than you imagine lad  hardly  we havent more than enough provisions aboard to last over today  perhaps the other boat is even worse off said sergeant brown hopefully  if thats the case well starve them out  i dont care what we do so long as we rescue dora and get that stolen fortune said dick as he dragged himself to the crowd followed by sam  and hows sam questioned tom turning to his younger brother  oh im all rightif it comes to fighting  and you dick  i think i can do somethingat least i am willing to try  breakfasta rather scant mealhad just been disposed of when martin harris uttered a shout  they want to do some talking he announced  why what do you mean asked dick  they are hoisting a white rag  sure enough ejaculated tom as he pointed to a flag of truce which dan baxter was holding aloft fastened to an oar  what do you make of that  they want to make terms laughed sergeant brown  i reckon things are coming our way at last  do we want to talk to them asked tom  let us make them surrender and do the talking afterward came from sam  it wont hurt to let them talk said the police sergeant  we can do as we please anyway after they are done  the matter was discussed for a moment and then tom tied his handkerchief to a stick and held it up  ahoy there came from arnold baxter  will you honor the flag of truce  yes yelled sergeant brown  and let us have our distance after our talk is over if we cant come to terms  yes  all right then well come close enough to talk to you  slowly and cautiously the flyaway drew nearer until all on board of harris yacht could see their enemies quite plainly  arnold baxter was armed with a shotgun while buddy girk and dan baxter carried pistols  mumps kept out of sight as much as possible while bill goss attended to the steering of the boat dora and mrs goss were below  well what have you got to say demanded dick as soon as the others were within easy talking distance  how many on board of that yacht demanded arnold baxter as he looked at the police officers glumly  enough replied dick  is that all youve got to say  dont grow impudent boy  it wont set well  a person couldnt be impudent to such a rascal as you arnold baxter  have a care dick rover  what do you propose to do  land all of you in jail rescue dora stanhope and recover that money you stole  indeed  yesindeed  dont you think we are pretty close to doing it  no you are a long way off  you wont dare to break this truce while the flags fly  if you do ill shoot you just as sure as you are born  i dont intend to dishonor any truce arnold baxter  but nevertheless you and your crowd are almost at the end of your rope and you know it  feeling hungry aint you put in martin harris  you shut up roared dan baxter for harris had hit the nail exactly on the head  well settle this with the rovers and the police not with you  youll settle with me for burning my sails and breaking my lanterns retorted the skipper of the searchlight wrathfully  let us come to terms went on arnold baxter in a milder tone i reckon what you want principally is to rescue dora stanhope  yes i want that said dick quickly  if we hand her over to you will you promise not to follow us any longer  wellerwhat of that money began dick glancing at those around him  we cant let you go interposed sergeant brown  you are wanted for that robbery in albany  we deny the robbery said arnold baxter  all rightyoull have a chance to clear yourself in court  we are not going to court not by a jugful put in buddy girk if we give up the gal thats got to end it  otherwise we dont give her up see  but youll have to give her up later on put in tom  and the longer you keep her the more you will have to suffer for it when it comes to a settlement  lets give her up whispered mumps to dan baxter  to the credit of the toady let it be said that he was heartily sick of the affair and wished he had never entered into it  you keep your mouth shut answered the former bully of putnam hall  my dad knows how to work this racket  somebody said something about being hungry continued arnold baxter significantly i imagine miss stanhope is as hungry as any of us if not more so  do you mean to say you are starving her cried dick indignantly  i mean to say that she will have to starve just as much as we do was the unsatisfactory answer  and you have run out of provisions  we have run out of provisions for her yes  that means that you wont give her any more even though you may have some for yourselves  you are even bigger brutes than i took you to be concluded the elder rover boy bitterly  weve got to look out for ourselves said dan baxter  if we let you have the girl you ought to be satisfied  let us talk to dora suggested tom  no you cant see her unless you agree to our terms said arnold baxter decidedly  if we bring her up now she may try to get away from us  you have got to submit to arrest and stand trial said sergeant brown  there are no two ways about it  if you wont submit quietly well have to fight  but let me tell you if you fight it will go hard with you  thats right make them give up everything put in tom  ill fight them if it comes to the worst  if only they dont harm dora whispered dick  think they may be starving her already  i dont believe they would dare dick  dare i think the baxters are cruel enough to do most anything  officer do you know that you are on the high seas and cant touch us went on arnold baxter after an awkward pause  i know nothing of the kind and ill risk what i am doing retorted sergeant brown  cant we compromise this matter  what else have you to propose  ill tell you what ill do  if youll agree not to molest us further ill turn the girl over to you and make each of you a present of one hundred dollars went on arnold baxter nervously  want to bribe us eh cried tom  thanks but we are not in that business  i never took a bribe yet and ive been on the force six years put in carter  you cant bribe me said the sergeant in a tone that admitted of no argument  you must surrender absolutely or take the consequences  all right then well take the consequences was the reckless response  and remember we hold that girl and any harm you do us will only counteract on her head  dont you dare to harm her you villain cried dick turning pale  whatever you do you shall answer for in court  humph dick rover dont be so smart put in dan baxter  this game is still ours and you know it  i know nothing of the kind  we will starve you out and fight you and you will see what the end will be dan baxter retorted dick and then the two yachts began to drift apart once more  as the flyaway moved off  mumps who had disappeared for a minute came into sight once more  in his hand he hold something white which he threw with all force at the searchlights mainsail  take that he cried  take that and remember me  by this time the two yachts were so far apart that no more could be said  what was that you threw on their boat demanded baxter turning to his toady  a seashell replied mumps  i thought i could hit dick rover with it  humph you had better take some lessons in throwing muttered the bully  you didnt come within a dozen feet of him  never mind i showed them i wasnt afraid of them said mumps and turned away  then he looked back anxiously  i hope they pick it up and see whats inside he murmured  oh but aint i tired of this crowd  if ever i get out of this you can wager ill turn over a new leaf and cut dan baxter dead     chapter xxvii  the collision in the fog   hullo  mumps isnt keeping this flag of truce very good remarked sam as the seashell dropped at his feet  there is something inside of the shell said tom  a bit of paper  perhaps its a message  ill soon see returned his younger brother and ran to where he could not be seen from the other yacht  he pulled from the seashell a small square of paper upon which had been hastily scrawled the following in lead pencil  i will help you all i can and hope you wont prosecute me  i will see that dora s gets something to eat even if i give her my share  they intend to go to sand haven if they can give you the slip  good for mumps  hes coming to his senses cried sam and showed the others the message  dick read the words with much satisfaction  i hope he does stand by dora he said  if so ill shield him all i can when the crowd is brought up for trial  if he tells the truth we may as well put into harbor and make for sand haven said martin harris who had now resumed the chase once more  yes but he may not be telling the truth was sergeant browns comment  the whole thing may be a trick to get us to go to sand haven while that crowd goes somewhere else  i think they are tired of carrying the girl around said carter  to give her up to us would have been no hardship  thats it put in martin harris  well im willing to do whatever the crowd says  the matter was talked over at some length and it was finally decided to cruise around after the flyaway for the best part of the day  if when night came on the other craft should steer in the direction of sand haven they would do likewise and land as soon as darkness came to cover up their movements  slowly the day wore along and the two yachts kept at about the same distance  they were both running due south and land was out of sight as before  this is developing into a regular ocean trip and no mistake remarked tom as he dropped into a seat near the cabin  who would have thought it when we left cedarville in such a hurry  id like to know how things are going up there mused dick it will be too bad if josiah crabtree succeeds in marrying mrs stanhope while we are away  let us hope for the best put in sam  hullo the flyaway is moving eastward  what does that mean harris cried dick  it means that they want to make the most of this wind responded the skipper of the yacht grimly  im learning a trick or two on em and ill overreach em if they aint careful  you cant do it any too quick answered dick  when next we meet there wont be quite so  much talking  instead well have some acting and pretty lively at that  sergeant brown was questioned concerning his weapons and said he had two pistols and carter had the same  one of the extra weapons was loaned to dick and the second went to tom  it was decided that in case of a close brush sam and harris were to arm themselves with anything that was handy but otherwise they were to attend to the sailing of the searchlight  provisions to use toms way of expressing it were now  more than low and as they ate the scant food dealt around dick could not help but think of how dora might be faring  id willingly starve myself if only it would give her what she needs he thought  it made him sick at heart to think of how she might be suffering  mile after mile was passed until the sun began to descend over to the westward  the yachts were now close on to quarter of a mile apart  here comes another steamer cried tom presently  look here why cant we get some help from her  perhaps we can burst out dick  i never thought of that  let us signal her anyway suggested sergeant brown  a flag was run up as high as the topmast permitted and they headed directly for the steamers course  as the ship came closer they made her out to be a big tramp from the south american trade  for the benefit of those who do not know let me state that a tramp steamer is one going from one port to another regardless of any regular route the movements of the craft depending entirely upon the freight to be picked up  she sees the signal exclaimed dick after an anxious wait of several minutes  slowly the steamer came up to them and then her ponderous engines ceased to work  what is wanted came in spanish from a darklooking man on the forward deck  cant you talk english cried dick  a leetle  we are after that other sailboat  the men in her are thieves and have abducted a girl too  will you help us catch them  at this the man on the steamer drew down his face and held a consultation with several behind him  you are sure they are thieves he asked presently  yes  have they with them the money that was stolen  we are pretty certain they have  and the girl  yes  and what is the reward for the girl senor  well i declare burst out tom  they are after a reward the first thing  no reward yet answered dick  but there may be  at this the south american scowled  we cannot lose time on a hunt that is worth nothing he said  we must get to brooklyn by tomorrow morning  you wont help us bring them to justice  we cannot afford to lose the time  without further words the big steamers engines were started up again and away she sped leaving the searchlight to sink and rise on the rollers left in her wake  my but that fellow is accommodating groaned dick  he isnt doing a single thing without pay  we might have bought some provisions from him put in martin harris  i reckon hed sell some for a round pricebeing so near to the end of his voyage  i dont want his stuff remarked sam  im afraid it would choke me if i tried to eat it  the stop had given the flyaway an advantage and she was making the most of it  but before the gun went down those on the other yacht saw her head for the coast once more  i guess the note told the truth said harris  is sand haven near here questioned tom  it is not over half a mile further down the coast  and how far are we out was the police sergeants question  between five and six miles as near as i can calculate  will they be able to run in by dark  i think so  you see the wind is shifting and it depends a good bit on how much it veers around concluded the old sailor  slowly the sun sank in the west  it was growing cloudy and a mist was rising  the mist made martin harris shake his head but not wishing to alarm the others he said nothing  but soon dick noticed the mist and so did the rest  gracious supposing we get caught in a fog muttered tom  i was just thinking of it returned his elder brother  there will be no fun in itif we are out of sight of land  a quarter of an hour went by and still no land appeared  it was now so raw that the boys were glad enough to button their coats tightly about them  then of a sudden the fog came rolling over them like a huge cloud and they were unable to see a dozen yards in any direction  this is the worst yet groaned sam  whats to do now  yes  whats to do now repeated sergeant brown  can you make the coast skipper  to be sure i can replied harris as he looked at the compass but i dont know about landing  you see we might stick our nose into a sandbank before we knowed it  perhaps the fog will lift suggested carter  a fog like this isnt lifting in a hurry said dick  like as not it wont move until the sun comes up tomorrow morning and in this guess he was right  a halfhour went by and from a distance came the deep note of a foghorn sounding apparently from up the shore  we ought to have a horn said sam  some big boat may come along and run us down  there is a horn in the cabin pantry replied martin harris we might as well bring it out  if we are sunk one or more of us will most likely be drowned  oh dont say that ejaculated carter  ill get the horn and running below he brought it up and he and sam took turns at blowing it with all the strength of their lungs  one thing is comforting those rascals are no better off than we are was toms comment  yes but if they founder what will become of dora  i dont believe any one of them would put himself out to save her  i guess youre right there dick  i never thought of her poor girl replied the brother  dick and sergeant brown were well up in the bow one watching to starboard and the other to port for anything which might appear through the gloom  the horn was blowing constantly and now from a distance came the sounds of both horns and bells  we are getting close to some other ships said martin harris i reckon we had best take a few reefs in the mainsail and stow away the jib and these suggestions were carried out  the minutes that followed were anxious ones for all felt that a collision might occur at any moment  the fog was growing thicker each instant and this coupled with the coming of night seemed to shut them in as with a pall  a boat is dead ahead came suddenly from dick and sergeant brown also gave a cry of warning  then came a shock and a crash and a splintering of wood followed by the cries of men and boys and the screams of a woman and a girl  weve struck the flyaway called out tom and then he found himself in the water with sam alongside of him     chapter xxviii  home againconclusion   when the collision came dick to save himself from injury gave a leap up into the air and sergeant brown did the same  the shock sent the searchlight backward and when the youth came down he found himself sprawling on the flyaways deck close beside dan baxter  dick rover gasped the former bully of putnam hall  so it is your boat that has run into us  baxter where is dora stanhope panted dick as soon as he could speak  he was afraid that one or both yachts were going down and that dora might be drowned  even in this extreme moment of peril his one thought was for his girl friend  find out for yourself burst out baxter and aimed a blow at dicks head with his fist  but the blow never reached its mark for mumps hauled the bully backward  weve had enough of thisat least ive had enough said fenwick astonishing himself at his own boldness  dick dora is in the cabinno shes coming up  save me came in a scream from the girl  oh dick is it really you and she ran right into dicks arms  by this time it was discovered that the two yachts were locked together the bowsprit of the flyaway having become entangled in the rigging of the searchlight  both yachts were badly damaged but neither sufficiently so as to be in danger of sinking  back with you came from arnold baxter and fired his shotgun at the police officer  but the rocking of the boats spoiled his aim  then sergeant brown fired and the elder baxter went down shot through the left leg  by this time all of the evildoers realized that the final struggle for freedom was at hand and began to fight desperately buddy girk engaging dick bill goss facing carter and mrs goss beating martin harris back with a stew pan from the gallery  in the meantime tom and sam swam back to the searchlight and clambered on board as rapidly as possible  they were in time to see carter go down hit over the head by bill goss  but that was the last of the fight so far as the skipper of the flyaway was concerned for two blows delivered by tom and sam simultaneously stretched him senseless on the deck  you had better give up cried tom to dan baxter who was doing what he could to get the two yachts apart  this is our battle  not much muttered the bully  stand back or it will be the worse for you  he sprang at tom and shoved a pistol under the boys very nose but before the weapon could be discharged dick leaving dora kicked the pistol from the bullys hand  you villain take that cried dick and grappled with baxter both rolled over on the deck and shoved by somebody from behind sam rolled on top of the pair  a second later all three rolled down the cabin stairs in a heap  oh my back it was baxter who uttered the cry and not without cause for his backbone had received a hard crack on the bottom step of the stairs  you lie still commanded dick as he leaped to his feet  if you dare to move ill put you out of the fight altogether  dontdont shoot me panted dan baxter in sudden fear  do you give in  yes  then keep still  sam guard him will you  i want to see how matters are on deck  yes ill guard him answered the youngest rover  the fight on deck had been short and fierce but our friends had had the best of it from the very start and when dick came up he found but little for him to do  arnold baxter lay where he had fallen moaning piteously while buddy girk and bill goss were in irons  mrs goss still stood at bay flourishing her stew pan over her head while mumps remained at a distance his arms folded over his breast and an anxious look in his eyes  i wont go to prison shrieked mrs goss  you let me and my husband go  mrs goss you had best give in began sergeant brown when tom sneaking up behind her snatched the stew pan from her grasp  as she turned on the boy carter ran in and in a twinkle she was held and her hands were bound behind her  then the crowd turned to mumps  i submit said the misguided boy  didnt i tell you in the note that i would help you  yes he has tried to do better put in dora  if it hadnt been for him i wouldnt have had a mouthful to eat today  i guess we can trust him then said dick  but mumps take care that you dont go back on us  i wont go back on you said the toady  im going to cut that crowd after this  you cant make a better move was dicks comment  now that affairs were in their own hands our friends hardly knew how to turn next  after a discussion it was agreed to place the flyaway in charge of dick and tom who were also to carry dora and mumps  all of the others went aboard of the searchlight arnold baxter being carried by the police officers who attended to his wound as well as the accommodations on board of the yacht permitted  so far nothing had been said about the money and securities stolen by baxter and girk but they were in a locker in the flyaways cabin and easily brought to light  this is a big day for us said dick  wont folks at home be astonished when they hear of what we have done  i cannot get home fast enough said dora  poor mama if only i knew she was safe  josiah crabtree shall suffer for this said dick  remember it was he who had you carried off by mumps and dan baxter  the searchlight was already on the way and the flyaway came behind her the course was due west and they kept on until the breakers could be heard in the distance then martin harris bore away to the northward  with the coming of daylight the fog disappeared as if by magic and they found themselves close to the seashore town of lightville  here there was a small river and they ran into this and came to a safe anchor close to one of the docks  on going ashore dicks first movement was to send two telegraph messages one to rush  wilder telling them that the stolen securities and money had been recovered and the second to captain putnam breaking the news of doras safety and requesting the master of the hall to acquaint mrs stanhope with the fact and take steps toward josiah crabtrees arrest  later on another message was sent to randolph rover so that the boys uncle might no longer be alarmed over their safety  sergeant brown also telegraphed to his superiors  inside of an hour after landing arnold baxter buddy girk dan baxter and the two gosses were safely housed in the lightville jail  at first it was thought to arrest mumps also but he begged for his liberty and promised if let go to tell everything  as some witness would be wanted when the others came to trial he was taken at his word  it was a happy party that started for cedarville that evening no one could have been more attentive than dick was to dora and no one could have been more appreciative than the girl of what the three rover boys had done for her  at ithaca a surprise awaited the crowd  frank fred and larry were there to welcome them and soon after captain putnam appeared  i am very glad to see you all safe and sound said the captain as he shook hands  you have had a regular ocean chase and no mistake  and how is my mother questioned dora quickly  she is happy miss stanhope but the shock of your sudden disappearance has made her quite ill  and josiah crabtree  has disappeared  your mother said he wanted to marry her after you went away but she would not listen to him  i imagine that after this he will keep his distance  he had better keep his distanceif he wants to remain out of jail put in dick  the return of the boys to putnam hall was the signal for a regular jollification and my readers can rest assured that all of the cadets made the most of it  captain putnam ordered an extra dinner for them and in the evening a huge bonfire was started on the campus and as the boys gathered around dick tom and sam they sang for hes a jolly good fellow until they were hoarse  it was a celebration never to be forgotten  just the right sort for a home coming as sam expressed it  let them have it said the master as he looked on  they deserve it  you are right returned george strong  those rover boys have proved themselves regular heroes                                       here i will bring to a close the story of the rover boys doings on the ocean while trying to rescue dora stanhope from her abductors and while endeavoring to recover the fortune stolen from rush  wilder  words cannot describe the happiness which mother and daughter felt when mrs stanhope and dora found themselves together once more  tears were freely shed and the widow blessed the boys who had done so much for herself and her child  she declared that her eyes were now open to the real wickedness of josiah crabtree never more would she have anything to do with the man  rush  wilder were immensely pleased to recover what had been taken from their safe and when money and securities were returned to them they rewarded the rover boys and the others handsomely for their work  but to this day dick declares that the recovery of the stolen fortune was only a side issue  we were out to rescue dora he says  and thank god we did it  in due course of time the evildoers were brought to trial and with mumps and the others to testify against them all were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment  being wounded arnold baxter was taken as before to a hospital but this time the authorities kept a close watch on him  with their enemies in custody the rover boys imagined that life at putnam hall would now run along smoothly  but in this they were mistaken  they had hardly settled down to their studies when a strange message from over the sea started them off on a search for their father the particulars of which will be related in another volume to be entitled the rover boys in the jungle or stirring adventures in africa  in this book we will not only meet dick tom and sam again but also dan baxter and several others with whom we are already acquainted  but for the time being all went well and here we will leave the three boys wishing them the best of good luck in the future   the end
