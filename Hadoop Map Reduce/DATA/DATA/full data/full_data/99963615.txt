99963615	an openeyed conspiracyan idyl of saratoga     chapter i    the day had been very hot under the tall trees which everywhere embower and stifle saratoga for they shut out the air as well as the sun and after tea they still have an early dinner at all the hotels in saratoga and tea is the last meal of the day i strolled over to the pretty congress park in the hope of getting a breath of coolness there  mrs march preferred to take the chances on the verandah of our pleasant little hotel where i left her with the other ladies forty fanning like one as they rocked to and fro under the roof lifted to the third story by those lofty shafts peculiar to the saratoga architecture  as far as coolness was concerned i thought she was wise after i reached the park for i found none of it there  i tried first a chair in the arabesque pavilion i call it arabesque in despair it might very well be swiss it is charming at all events and studied to deceive myself with the freshlooking ebullition of the spring in the vast glass bowls your goblets are served from people say it is pumped and artificially aerated but after a few moments this would not do and i went out to a bench of the rows beside the gravelled walks it was no better there but i fancied it would be better on the little isle in the little lake where the fountain was flinging a sheaf of spray into the dull air  this looked even cooler than the bubbling spring in the glass vases and it sounded vastly cooler there would be mosquitoes there of course i admitted in the debate i had with myself before i decided to make experiment of the place and the event proved me right  there were certainly some mosquitoes in the grecian temple if it is not a turkish kiosk perhaps we had better compromise and call it a grecian kiosk which you reach by a footbridge from the mainland and there was a damp in the air which might pass for coolness  there were three or four people standing vaguely about in the kiosk but my idle mind fixed itself upon a young frenchcanadian mother of low degree who sat with her small boy on the verge of the pavement near the water  she scolded him in their parlance for having got himself so dirty and then she smacked his poor filthy little hands with a frown of superior virtue though i did not find her so very much cleaner herself  i cannot see children beaten without a heartache and i continued to suffer for this small wretch even after he had avenged himself by eating a handful of peanut shells which would be sure to disagree with him and make his mother more trouble  in fact i experienced no relief till his mother having spent her insensate passion gathered him up with sufficient tenderness and carried him away then for the first time i noticed a girl sitting in a chair just outside the kiosk and showing a graceful young figure as she partly turned to look after the departing mother and her child  when she turned again and glanced in my direction at the noise i made in placing my chair i could see two thingsthat she had as much beauty as grace and that she was disappointed in me  the latter fact did not wound me for i felt its profound impersonality  i was not wrong in myself i was simply wrong in being an elderly man with a grey beard instead of the handsome shape and phase of youth which her own young beauty had a right to in my place  i was not only not wounded but i was not sorry not to be that shape and phase of youth except as i hate to disappoint any one  her face was very beautiful it was quite perfectly beautiful and of such classic mould that she might well have been the tutelary goddess of that temple if it was a temple and not a kiosk in the white duck costume which the goddesses were wearing that summer her features were greek but her looks were american and she was none the less a goddess i decided because of that air of something exacting of not quite satisfied which made me more and more willing to be elderly and greybearded  i at least should not be expected to supply the worship necessary to keep such a goddess in good humour  i do not know just how i can account for a strain of compassion which mingled with this sense of irresponsibility in me perhaps it was my feeling of security that attuned me to pity but certainly i did not look at this young girl long without beginning to grieve for her and to weave about her a web of possibilities which grew closer and firmer in texture when she was joined by a couple who had apparently not left her a great while before and who spoke without otherwise saluting her as they sat down on either side of her  i instantly interpreted her friends to be the young wife and middle aged husband of a second marriage for they were evidently man and wife and he must have been nearly twice as old as she  in person he tended to the weight which expresses settled prosperity and a certain solidification of temperament and character as to his face it was kind and it was rather humorous in spite of being a little slow in the cast of mind it suggested  he wore an irongrey beard on his cheeks and chin but he had his strong upper lip clean shaven some drops of perspiration stood upon it and upon his forehead which showed itself well up toward his crown under the damp strings of his scanty hair  he looked at the young goddess in white duck with a sort of trouble in his friendly countenance and his wife if it was his wife seemed to share his concern though she smiled while he let the corners of his straight mouth droop she was smaller than the young girl and i thought almost as young and she had the air of being somehow responsible for her and cowed by her though the word says rather more than i mean  she was not so well dressed that is not so stylishly though doubtless her costume was more expensive  it seemed the inspiration of a village dressmaker and her husbands lowcut waistcoat and his expanse of plaited shirtfront betrayed a provincial ideal which she would never decrywhich she would perhaps never find different from the most worldly  he had probably i swiftly imagined been wearing just that kind of clothes for twenty years and telling his tailor to make each new suit like the last he had been buying for the same period the same shape of panama hat regardless of the continually changing type of straw hats on other heads  i cannot say just why as he tilted his chair back on its hindlegs i felt that he was either the cashier of the village bank at home or one of the principal business men of the place  village people i was quite resolute to have them all but i left them free to have come from some small manufacturing centre in western massachusetts or southern vermont or central new york  it was easy to see that they were not in the habit of coming away from their place wherever it was and i wondered whether they were finding their account in the present excursion  i myself think saratoga one of the most delightful spectacles in the world and mrs march is of the same mind about it  we like all the waters and drink them without regard to their different properties but we rather prefer the congress spring because it is such a pleasant place to listen to the troy military band in the afternoon and the more or less vocal concert in the evening  all the saratoga world comes and goes before us as we sit there by day and by night and we find a perpetual interest in it  we go and look at the deer a herd of two i think behind their wire netting in the southward valley of the park and we would feed the trout in their blue tank if we did not see them suffering with surfeit and hanging in motionless misery amid the clear water under a cloud of bread crumbs  we are such devotees of the special attractions offered from time to time that we do not miss a single balloon ascension or pyrotechnic display  in fact it happened to me one summer that i studied so earnestly and so closely the countenance of the lady who went up in trunkhose in order to make out just what were the emotions of a lady who went up every afternoon in a balloon that when we met near the end of the season in broadway i thought i must have seen her somewhere in society and took off my hat to her she was not at the moment in trunkhose  we like going about to the great hotels and sponging on them for the music in the forenoon we like the gaudy shops of modes kept by artists whose addresses are french and whose surnames are irish and the bazaars of the armenians and japanese whose rugs and bricabrac are not such bargains as you would think  we even go to the races sometimes we are not sure it is quite right but as we do not bet and are never decided as to which horse has won it is perhaps not so wrong as it might be  somehow i could not predicate these simple joys of the people i have been talking of for the very reason that they were themselves so simple  it was our sophistication which enabled us to taste pleasures which would have been insipidities to them  their palates would have demanded other flavourssocial excitements balls flirtations almost escapades  i speak of the two women the man doubtless like most other americans of his age wanted nothing but to get back to business in the small town where he was important and still more i speak of the young girl for the young wife i fancied very willing to go back to her housekeeping and to be staying on in saratoga only on her friends account    chapter ii    i had already made up my mind that  they had been the closest friends before one of them married and that the young wife still thought the young girl worthy of the most splendid fate that marriage could have in store for any of her sex  women often make each other the idols of such worship but i could not have justified this ladys adoration so far as it concerned the mental and moral qualities of her friend though i fully shared it in regard to her beauty  to me she looked a little dull and a little selfish and i chose to think the husband modestly found her selfish if he were too modest to find her dull  yet after all i tacitly argued with him why should we call her selfish  it was perfectly right and fit that as a young girl with such great personal advantages she should wish to see the world even to show herself to the worldand find in it some agreeable youth who should admire her and desire to make her his own for ever  compare this simple and natural longing with the insatiate greed and ambition of one of our own sex i urged him and then talk to me if you can of this poor girls selfishness  a young man has more egoism in an hour than a young girl has in her whole life  she thinks she wishes some one to be devoted to her but she really wishes some one to let her be devoted to him and how passively how negatively she must manage to accomplish her selfsacrifice  he on the contrary means to go conquering and enslaving forward to be in and out of love right and left and to end after many years of triumph in the possession of the best and wisest and fairest of her sex  i know the breed my dear sir i have been a young man myself we men have liberty we have initiative we are not chaperoned we can go to this one and that one freely and fearlessly  but women must sit still and be come to or shied off from  they cannot cast the bold eye of interest they can at most bridle under it and furtively respond from the corner of the eye of weak hope and gentle deprecation  be patient then with this poor child if she darkles a little under the disappointment of not finding saratoga so personally gay as she supposed it would be and takes it out of you and your wife as if you were to blame for it in something like sulks  he remained silent under these tacit appeals but at the end he heaved a deep sigh as he might if he were acknowledging their justice and were promising to do his very best in the circumstances  his wife looked round at him but did not speak  in fact they none of them spoke after the first words of greeting to the girl as i can very well testify for i sat eavesdropping with all my might resolved not to lose a syllable and i am sure i lost none  the young girl did not look round at that deepdrawn sigh of the mans she did not lift her head even when he cleared his throat but i was intent upon him for i thought that these sounds preluded an overture i am not sure of the figure to my acquaintance and in fact he actually asked do you know just when the concert begins  i was overjoyed at his question for i was poignantly interested in the little situation i had created and i made haste to answer well nominally at eight oclock but the first halfhour is usually taken up in tuning the instruments  if you get into the pavilion at a quarter to nine you wont lose much  it isnt so bad when it really begins  the man permitted himself a smile of the pleasure we americans all feel at having a thing understated in that way  his wife asked timidly do we have to engage our seats in thepavilion  oh no i laughed theres no such rush as that  havent you been at the concerts before  the man answered for her  we havent been here but a few days  i should think he added to her it would be about as comfortable outside of the house  i perceived that he maintained his independence of my superior knowledge by refusing to say pavilion and in fact i do not know whether that is the right name for the building myself  it will be hot enough anywhere i assented as if the remark had been made to me but here i drew the line out of selfrespect and resolved that he should make the next advances  the young girl looked up at the first sound of my voice and verified me as the elderly man whom she had seen before and then she looked down at the water again  i understood and i freely forgave her  if my beard had been brown instead of grey i should have been an adventure but to the eye of girlhood adventure can never wear a grey beard  i was truly sorry for her i could read in the pensive droop of her averted face that i was again a disappointment  they all three sat without speaking again in the mannerless silence of americans  the man was not going to feel bound in further civility to me because i had civilly answered a question of his  i divined that he would be glad to withdraw from the overture he had made he may have thought from my readiness to meet him half way that i might be one of those sharpers in whom saratoga probably abounded  this did not offend me it amused me i fancied his confusion if he could suddenly know how helplessly and irreparably honest i was  i dont know but its a little too damp here rufus said the wife  i dont know but it is he answered but none of them moved and none of them spoke again for some minutes  then the wife said again but this time to the friend i dont know but its a little too damp here julia and the friend answered as the husband had   i dont know but it is  i had two surprises in this slight event  i could never have imagined that the girl had so brunette a name as julia or anything less blond in sound than say evadne at the very darkest and i had made up my mindheaven knows whythat her voice would be harsh  perhaps i thought it unfair that she should have a sweet voice added to all that beauty and grace of hers but she had a sweet voice very tender and melodious with a plangent note in it that touched me and charmed me  beautiful and graceful as she was she had lacked atmosphere before and now suddenly she had atmosphere  i resolved to keep as near to these people as i could and not to leave the place as long as they stayed but i did not think it well to let them feel that i was aesthetically shadowing them and i got up and strolled away toward the pavilion keeping an eye in the back of my head upon them  i sat down in a commanding position and watched the people gathering for the concert and in the drama of a group of cubans or of south americans i almost forgot for a moment the pale idyl of my compatriots at the kiosk  there was a short stout little spanish woman speaking in the shapely sentences which the latin race everywhere delights in and around her was an increasing number of serious spanish men listening as if to important things and paying her that respectful attention which always amuses and puzzles me in view of what we think their low estimate of women i cannot make out whether it is a personal tribute to some specific woman whom they regard differently from all the rest of her sex or whether they choose to know in her for the nouce the abstract woman who is better than woman in the concrete  i am sure i have never seen men of any other race abandon themselves to such a luxury of respect as these black and grey bearded spaniards of leaden complexion showed this dumpy personification of womanhood with their prominent eyes bent in homage upon her and their hands trembling with readiness to seize their hats off in reverence  it appeared presently that the matter they were all canvassing so devoutly was the question of where she should sit  it seemed to be decided that she could not do better than sit just at that point  when she actually took a chair the stately convocation ended and its members with low obeisances dispersed themselves in different directions  they had probably all been sitting with her the whole afternoon on the verandah of the everett house where their race chiefly resorts in saratoga and they were availing themselves of this occasion to appear to be meeting her after a long interval in society  i said to myself that of course they believed saratoga was still that centre of american fashion which it once was and that they came and went every summer probably in the belief that they saw a great deal of social gaiety there  this made me think by a natural series of transitions of the persons of my american idyl and i looked about the pavilion everywhere for them without discovering till the last that they were just behind me  i found the fact touching  they had not wished to be in any wise beholden to me and had even tried to reject my friendly readiness to know them better but they had probably sought my vicinity in a sense of their loneliness and helplessness which they hoped i would not divine but which i divined instantly  still i thought it best not to show any consciousness of them and we sat through the first part of the concert without taking notice of one another  then the man leaned forward and touched me on the shoulder  will you let me take your programme a minute  why certainly said i  he took it and after a vague glance at it he passed it to his wife who gave it in turn to the young girl  she studied it very briefly and then after a questioning look offered it back to me  wont you keep it i entreated  ive quite done with it  oh thank you she answered in her tender voice and she and the wife looked hard at the man whom they seemed to unite in pushing forward by that means  he hemmed and asked have you been in saratoga much  why yes i said rather a good deal  my wife and i have been here three or four summers  at the confession of my married state which this statement implicated the women exchanged a glance i fancied of triumph as if they had been talking about me and i had now confirmed the ground they had taken concerning me  then they joined in goading the man on again with their eyes  which hotel he asked should you say had the most going on  the young girl and the wife transferred their gaze to me with an intensified appeal in it  the man looked away with a certain shame the shame of a man who feels that his wife has made him make an ass of himself  i tried to treat his question by the quantity and quality of my answer as one of the most natural things in the world and i probably deceived them all by this effort though i am sure that i was most truthful and just concerning the claims of the different hotels to be the centre of excitement  i thought i had earned the right to ask at the end are you stopping at the grand union  no he said and he mentioned one of the smaller hotels which depend upon the great houses for the entertainment of their guests are you there he asked meaning the grand union  oh no i said we couldnt do that sort of thing even if we wanted  and in my turn i named the modest hotel where we were and said that i thought it by all odds the pleasantest place in saratoga  but i cant say i added that there is a great deal going on there either  if you want that sort of thing you will have to go to some of the great hotels  we have our little amusements but theyre all rather mild  i kept talking to the man but really addressing myself to the women  theres something nearly every evening  prestidigitating or elocutioning or a little concert or charades or impromptu theatricals or something of that sort  i cant say theres dancing though really i suppose if any one wanted to dance there would be dancing  i was aware that the women listened intelligently even if the man did not  the wife drew a long breath and said it must be very pleasant  the girl saidrather more hungrily i fanciedyes indeed  i dont know why their interest should have prompted me to go on and paint the lily a little but i certainly did so  i did not stop till the music began again and i had to stop  by the time the piece was finished i had begun to have my misgivings and i profited by the brief interval of silence to say to the young girl i wouldnt have you think we are a whirl of gaiety exactly  oh no she answered pathetically as if she were quite past expecting that or anything like it  we were silent again  at the end of the next piece they all rose and the wife said timidly to me well goodevening as if she might be venturing too far and her husband came to her rescue with well goodevening sir  the young girl merely bowed  i did not stay much longer for i was eager to get home and tell my wife about my adventure which seemed to me of a very rare and thrilling kind  i believed that if i could present it to her duly it would interest her as much as it had interested me  but somehow as i went on with it in the lamplight of her room it seemed to lose colour and specific character  you are always making up these romances about young girls being off and disappointed of a good time ever since we saw that poor little kitty ellison with her cousins at niagara said mrs march  you seem to have it on the brain  because its the most tragical thing in the world and the commonest in our transition state i retorted  i was somewhat exasperated to have my romance treated as so stale a situation though i was conscious now that it did want perfect novelty  its precisely for that reason that i like to break my heart over it  i see it every summer and it keeps me in a passion of pity something ought to be done about it  well dont you try to do anything basil unless you write to the newspapers  i suppose i said that if the newspapers could be got to take hold of it perhaps something might be done  the notion amused me i went on to play with it and imagined saratoga by a joint effort of the leading journals recolonised with the social life that once made it the paradise of young people  i have been writing to the children said my wife and telling them to stay on at york harbour if the herricks want them so much they would hate it here  you say the girl looked cross  i cant exactly imagine a cross goddess  there were lots of cross goddesses i said rather crossly myself for i saw that after having trodden my romance in the dust she was willing i should pick it up again and shake it off and i wished to show her that i was not to be so lightly appeased  perhaps i was thinking of angels she murmured  i distinctly didnt say she was an angel i returned  now come basil i see youre keeping something back  what did you try to do for those people  did you tell them where you were stopping  yes i did  they asked me and i told them  did you brag the place up  on the contrary i understated its merits  oh very well then she said quite as if i had confessed my guilt they will come here and you will have your romance on your hands for the rest of the month  im thankful were going away the first of august    chapter iii    the next afternoon while we were sitting in the park waiting for the troy band to begin playing and i was wondering just when they would reach the washington post march which i like because i can always be sure of it my unknown friends came strolling our way the man looked bewildered and bored with something of desperation in his troubled eye and his wife looked tired and disheartened the young girl still in white duck wore the same air of passive injury i had noted in her the night before  their faces all three lighted up at sight of me but they faded again at the cold and meagre response i made to their smiles under correction of my wifes fears of them  i own it was base of me but i had begun to feel myself that it might be too large a contract to attempt their consolation and in fact after one is fifty scarcely any romance will keep overnight  my wife glanced from them to me and read my cowardly mind but she waited till they passed as they did after an involuntary faltering in front of us and were keeping on down the path looking at the benches which were filled on either hand  she said werent those your friends  they were the persons of my romance  no matter  go after them instantly and bring them back here poor things  we can make room for them  i rose  isnt this a little too idyllic  arent you rather overdoing it  dont speak to me basil  i never heard of anything so atrocious go on your knees to them if they refuse  they can sit here with me and you and he can stand  fly  i knew she was punishing me for her own reluctance but i flew in that sense of the term and easily overhauled them in the tangle of people coming and going in the path and the nursemaids pushing their perambulators in either direction  hat in hand i delivered my message  i could see that it gave the women great pleasure and the man some doubt  his mouth fell open a little their cheeks flushed and their eyes shone  i dont know as we better the wife hesitated im afraid well crowd you  and she looked wistfully toward my wife  the young girl looked at her  not at all i cried  theres an abundance of room  my wifes keeping the places for youin fact i saw her putting her arm out along the bench and explaining to a couple who had halted in front of her that the seats were takenand shell be disappointed  well the woman consented with a little sigh of triumph that touched me and reanimated all my interest in her and in her friend she said with a sort of shy instinctive politeness i dont know as you and mr deering got acquainted last night  my name is march i said and i shook the hand of mr deering  it was rather thick  and thisis our friend mrs peering went on in presentation of me to the young lady miss gage thats come with us  i was delighted that i had guessed their relative qualities so perfectly and when we arrived at mrs march i glibly presented them  my wife was all that i could have wished her to be of sympathetic and intelligent  she did not overdo it by shaking hands but she made places for the ladies smiling cordially and mrs deering made miss gage take the seat between them  her husband and i stood awhile in front of them and then i said we would go off and find chairs somewhere  we did not find any till we had climbed to the upland at the south east of the park and then only two iron ones which it was useless to think of transporting  but there was no reason why we should not sit in them where they were  we could keep the ladies in plain sight and i could not mistake washington post when the band came to it  mr deering sank into one of the chairs with a sigh of satisfaction which seemed to complete itself when he discovered in the thick grass at his feet a twig from one of the tall slim pines above us  he bent over for it and then as he took out his penknife and clicked open a blade to begin whittling he cast up a critical glance at the trees  pretty nice pines he said and he put his hand on the one next to us with a sort of appreciation that interested me  yes the trees of saratoga are the glory of the place i returned i never saw them grow anywhere else so tall and slim  it doesnt seem the effect of crowding either  its as if there was some chemical force in the soil that shot them up  theyre like rockets that havent left the ground yet  its the crowding he said seriously as if the subject were not to be trifled with  its the habit of all these treespines and oaks and maples i dont care what they areto spread and thats what we tell our customers  give the trees plenty of room dont plant em too thick if you want to get all the good out of em  as if he saw a question in my eye he went on  we do a foresttree business exclusively these shadetrees and walnuts hickories chestnuts and all kinds  its a big trade getting to be and growing all the time  folks have begun to find out what fools they were to destroy the forests and the children want to buy back what the fathers threw away  i scarcely needed to prompt him he was only too glad to talk on about his business and he spoke with a sort of homesick fondness he told me that he had his nurseries at de witt point up on the st lawrence where he could raise stock hardy enough for any climate and ship by land or water  ive got to be getting home right away now he said finally clicking his knifeblade half shut and open with his thumb  its about time for our evergreen trade and i dont want the trees to stay a minute in the ground after the middle of the month  wont the ladies find it hard to tear themselves away from the gaieties of saratoga i asked with apparent vagueness  well thats it said mr deering and he shut his knife and slipped it into his pocket in order to take his knee between his clasped hands and lift his leg from the ground  i have noticed that this is a philosophical attitude with some people and i was prepared by it for some thoughtful generalising from my companion women would be willing to stay on in a place for a year to see if something wouldnt happen and if you take em away before anything happens theyll always think that if theyd stayed something would have happened the next day or maybe the day they left  he stared upward into the pine boughs and i said  yes thats so i suppose we should be like them if we had the same conditions their whole life is an expectation of something to happen  men have the privilege of making things happenor trying to  oh i dont know as i want to criticise em  as you say i guess we should be just so  he dropped his leg and bent over as if to examine the grass he ended by taking a blade of it between his teeth before he spoke again with his head still down  i dont want to hurry em i want to give em a fair show now were here and ill let the stock go as long as i can  but i dont see very much gaiety around  i laughed  why its all gaiety in one way  saratoga is a perpetual fourth of july we think  oh yes theres enough going on and my wife and me we could enjoy it first rate  if the young lady could i ventured with a smile of sympathetic intelligence  well yes  you see we dont know anybody and i suppose we didnt take that into account  well i suppose its like this  they thought it would be easy to get acquainted in the hotel and commence having a good time right away  i dont know my wife had the idea when they cooked it up amongst em that she was to come with us  but i swear i dont know how to go about it  i cant seem to make up my mouth to speak to folks first and then you cant tell whether a man aint a gambler or on for the horseraces anyway  so weve been here a week now and youre the first ones weve spoken to besides the waiters since we came  i couldnt help laughing their experience was so exactly as i had imagined it when i first saw this disconsolate party  in my triumph at my own penetration i would not have had their suffering in the past one pang the less but the simple frankness of his confession fixed me in the wish that the future might be brighter for them  i thought myself warranted by my wifes imprudence in taking a step toward their further intimacy on my own account and i said  well perhaps i ought to tell you that i havent been inside the saratoga club or bet on the races since ive been here  thats my name in fulland i gave him my cardand im in the literary line that is im the editor of a magazine in new yorkthe every other week  oh yes i know who you are said my companion with my card in his hand  fact is i was round at your place this morning trying to get rooms and the clerk told me all about you from my description i felt as mean as pusley goin seemed to be takin kind of an advantage of you  not at all its a public house i interrupted but i thought i should be stronger with mrs march if i did not give the fact away to her and i resolved to keep it  but they couldnt rest easy till i tried and i was more than half glad there wasnt any rooms  oh im very sorry i said and i indulged a real regret from the vantage i had  it would have been very pleasant to have you there perhaps laterwe shall be giving up our rooms at the end of the month  no he said with a long breath  if ive got to leave em i guess itll be just as well to leave em where theyre acquainted with the house anyway  his remark betrayed a point in his thinking which had not perhaps been reached in his talk with the ladies its a quiet place and theyre used to it and i guess they wouldnt want to stay through the rest of the month quite  i dont believe my wife would anyway  he did not say this very confidently but hopefully rather and i thought it afforded me an opening to find out something yet more definite about the ladies  miss gage is remarkably finelooking i began  think so he answered  well so does my wife  i dont know as i like her style exactly he said with a kind of latent grudge  her style is magnificent i insisted  well maybe so  i guess shes good enough looking if thats what you mean  but i think its always a kind of a mistake for three persons to come off together i dont care who they are  then theres three opinions  shes a nice girl and a good girl and she dont put herself forward  but when youve got a young lady on your hands youve got her and you feel bound to keep doin something for her all the time and if you dont know what to do yourself and your wife cant tell  i added intelligently yes  well thats just where it is  sometimes i wish the whole dumb town would burn up  i laughed and laughed and my friend having begun to unpack his heart went on to ease it of the rest of its load  i had not waited for this before making some reflections concerning him but i now formulated them to myself  he really had none of that reserve i had attributed to him the night before it was merely caution and this is the case with most country people they are cautious but not reserved if they think they can trust you they keep back none of their affairs and this is the american character for we are nearly all country people  i understood him perfectly when he said i ruther break stone than go through what i have been through the last week  you understand how it is  taint as if she said anything i wish she would but you feel all the while that it aint what she expected it to be and you feel as if it was you that was to blame for the failure  by george if any man was to come along and make an offer for my contract i would sell out cheap  its worse because my wife asked her to come and thought she was doin her all kinds of a favour to let her  theyve always been together and when we talked of coming to saratoga this summer nothing would do my wife but julia must come with us  her and her father usually take a trip off somewhere in the hot weather but this time he couldnt leave president of our national bank and president of the village too  he threw in the fact of these dignities explanatorily but with a willingness i could see that it should affect me  he went on  theyre kind of connections of my first wifes  well shes a nice girl too nice i guess to get along very fast  i see girls all the way along down gettin acquainted on the cars and boatswe come east on the ogdensburg road to rouses point and then took the boat down lake champlain and lake georgebut she always seemed to hold back  i dont knows shes proud either i cant make it out  it balls my wife all up too  i tell her shes fretted off all the good her trips goin to do her before she got it  he laughed ruefully and just then the band began to play the washington post  what tunes that he demanded  washington post i said proud of knowing it  by george that tune goes right to a fellows legs dont it  its the new march i said  he listened with a simple joy in it and his pleasure strengthened the mystic bond which had formed itself between us through the confidences he had made me so flatteringly corroborative of all my guesses concerning him and his party    chapter iv    i longed to have the chance of bragging to my wife but this chance did not come till the concert was quite over after i rejoined her with my companion and she could take leave of them all without seeming to abandon them  then i judged it best to let her have the word for i knew by the way she ran her hand through my arm and began pushing me along out of earshot that she was full of it  well basil i think that is the sweetest and simplest and kindest creature in the world and im perfectly in love with her  i did not believe somehow that she meant the girl but i thought it best merely to suggest there are two  you know very well which i mean and i would do anything i could for her  shes got a difficult problem before her and i pity her the girls very well and she is a beauty and i suppose she has been having a dull time and of course you couldnt please mrs deering half so well as by doing something for her friend  i suppose youre feeling very proud that theyre just what you divined  not at all im so used to divining people  how did you know i knew it  i saw you talking to him and i knew you were pumping him  pumping  he asked nothing better than to flow  he would put to shame the provoked spontaneity of any spring in saratoga  well did he say that he was going to leave them here  he would like to do ityes  he was very sweet and simple and kind too isabel  he complained bitterly of the goddess and all but said she sulked  why i dont know said my wife  i think considering that she is rather amiable  she brightened up more and more  that was prosperity or the hope of it my dear  nothing illumines us like the prospect of pleasant things  she took you for society smiling upon her and of course she smiled back  but its only the first smile of prosperity that cheers  if it keeps on smiling it ends by making us dissatisfied again  when people are getting into society they are very glad when they have got in they seem to be rather gloomy  we mustnt let these things go too far  now that youve got your friends in good humour the right way is to drop themto cut them dead when you meet them to look the other way that will send them home perfectly radiant  nonsense  i am going to do all i can for them  what do you think we can do  they havent the first idea how to amuse themselves here  its a miracle they ever got that dress the girl is wearing they just made a bold dash because they saw it in a dressmakers window the first day and she had to have something  its killingly becoming to her but i dont believe they know it and they dont begin to know how cheap it was  it was simply thrown away  im going shopping with them in the morning  oh  but now the question is what we can do to give them some little glimpse of social gaiety  thats what theyve come for  we were passing the corner of a large enclosure which seems devoted in saratoga to the most distracting of its pleasures and i said well we might give them a turn on the circular railway or the switchback or we could take them to the punch and judy drama or get their fortunes told in the seeresss tent or let them fire in the shootinggallery or buy some sweetgrass baskets of the indians and there is the popcorn and the lemonade  i will tell you what said mrs march who had not been listening to a word i said for if she had heard me she would not have had patience with my ironical suggestions  well what  or no that wouldnt do either  im glad you dont approve of the notion on second thoughts  i didnt like it from the beginning and i didnt even know what it was  we could have them up to the house this evening and introduce them to some of our friendsonly there isnt a young man in the whole placeand have them stay to the charades  what do you think i said of their having come up this morning and tried to get rooms at our house  yes they told me  and dont you call that rather forthputting  it seems to me that it was taking a mean advantage of my brags  it was perfectly innocent in them  but now dearest dont be tiresome  i know that you like them as well as i do and i will take all your little teasing affectations for granted  the question is what can we do for them  and the answer is i dont in the least know  there isnt any society life at saratoga that i can see and if there is we are not in it  how could we get any one else in  i see thats what youre aiming at  those public socialities at the big hotels they could get into as well as we could but they wouldnt be anywhere when they got there and they wouldnt know what to do  you know what hollow mockeries those things are  dont you remember that hop we went to with the young braceys the first summer  if those girls hadnt waltzed with each other they wouldnt have danced a step the whole evening  i know i know sighed my wife it was terrible  but these people are so very unworldly that dont you think they could be deluded into the belief that they were seeing society if we took a little trouble  you used to be so inventive  you could think up something now if you tried  my dear a girl knows beyond all the arts of hoodwinking whether shes having a good time and your little scheme of passing off one of those hotel hops for a festivity would never work in the world  well i think it is too bad  what has become of all the easy gaiety there used to be in the world  it has been starched and ironed out of it apparently  saratoga is still trying to do the good old american act with its big hotels and its heterogeneous hops and i dont suppose theres ever such a thing as a society person at any of them  that wouldnt be so bad but the unsociety people seem to be afraid of one another  they feel that there is something in the airsomething they dont and cant understand something alien that judges their oldfashioned american impulse to be sociable and contemns it  no we cant do anything for our hapless friendsi can hardly call them our acquaintances  we must avoid them and keep them merely as a pensive colour in our own vivid memories of saratoga  if we made them have a good time and sent them on their way rejoicing i confess that i should feel myself distinctly a loser  as it is theyre a strain of melancholy poetry in my life of music in the minor key  i shall always associate their pathos with this hot summer weather and i shall think of them whenever the thermometer registers eightynine  dont you see the advantage of that  i believe i can ultimately get some literature out of them  if i can think of a fitting fable for them fulkerson will feature it in every other week  hell get out a saratoga number and come up here and strike the hotels and springs for ads  well said mrs march i wish i had never seen them and its all your fault basil  of course when you played upon my sympathies so about them i couldnt help feeling interested in them  we are a couple of romantic old geese my dear  not at all or at least im not  i simply used these people conjecturally to give myself an agreeable pang  i didnt want to know anything more about them than i imagined and i certainly didnt dream of doing anything for them  youll spoil everything if you turn them from fiction into fact and try to manipulate their destiny  let them alone they will work it out for themselves  you know i cant let them alone now she lamented  i am not one of those who can give themselves an agreeable pang with the unhappiness of their fellowcreatures  im not satisfied to study them i want to relieve them  she went on to praise herself to my disadvantage as i notice wives will with their husbands and i did not attempt to deny her this source of consolation  but when she ended by saying i believe i shall send you alone and explained that she had promised mrs deering we would come to their hotel for them after tea and go with them to hear the music at the united states and the grand union i protested  i said that i always felt too sneaking when i was prowling round those hotels listening to their proprietary concerts and i was aware of looking so sneaking that i expected every moment to be ordered off their piazzas  as for convoying a party of three strangers about alone i should certainly not do it  not if ive a headache  not if youve a headache  oh very well then  what are you two quarrelling about cried a gay voice behind us and we looked round into the laughing eyes of miss dale  she was the one cottager we knew in saratoga but when we were with her we felt that we knew everybody so hospitable was the sense of world which her kindness exhaled  it was mrs march who was quarrelling i said  i was only trying to convince her that she was wrong and of course one has to lift ones voice  i hope i hadnt the effect of halloaing  well i merely heard you above the steam harmonicon at the switchback said miss dale  i dont know whether you call that holloaing  oh miss dale said my wife we are in such a fatal  pickle i suggested and she instantly adopted the word in her extremity  pickle with some people that providence has thrown in our way and that we want to do something for and in a labyrinth of parentheses that no man could have found his way into or out of she possessed miss dale of the whole romantic fact  it was mr march of course who first discovered them she concluded in plaintive accusation  poor mr march cried miss dale  well it is a pathetic case but it isnt the only one if thats any comfort  saratoga is reeking with just such forlornities the whole summer long but i can quite understand how you feel about it mrs march  we came to a corner and she said abruptly  excuse my interrupting your quarrel  not quite so loud mr march and she flashed back a mocking look at me as she skurried off down the street with astonishing rapidity  how perfectly heartless cried my wife  i certainly thought she would suggest somethingoffer to do something  i relied upon her too i said but now i have my doubts whether she was really going down that street till she saw that it was the best way to escape  were certainly in trouble my dear if people avoid us in this manner    chapter v    i am doing it entirely on mrs deerings i account said my wife that evening after tea as we walked down the sidestreet that descended from our place to broadway  she has that girl on her hands and i know she must be at her wits end  and i do it entirely on deerings account i retorted  he has both of those women on his hands  we emerged into the glistening thoroughfare in front of the vast hotels and i was struck as i never fail to be with its futile and unmeaning splendour  i think there is nothing in our duncoloured civilisation prettier than that habit the ladies have in saratoga of going out on the street after dark in their bare heads  when i first saw them wandering about so in the glitter of the shopwindows and the fitful glare of the electrics everywhere i thought they must be some of those spanishamericans mistaking the warm dry air of the northern night for that of their own latitudes but when i came up with them i could hear if i could not see that they were of our own race  those flat and shapeless tones could come through the noses of no other  the beauty and the elegance were also ours and the fearless trust of circumstance  they sauntered up and down before the gaunt high porticoes of the hotels as much at home as they could have been in their own houses and in much the same dress as if they had been receiving there  the effect is one of incomparable cheer and is a promise of social brilliancy which saratoga no more keeps than she does that of her other characteristic aspects say the forenoon effect of the same thoroughfare with the piazzas banked with the hotel guests and the street full of the light equipages which seem peculiar to the place passing and repassing in the joyous sunlight and out of it on the leafflecked street  even the public carriages of saratoga have a fresh unjaded air and to issue from the railway station in the midst of those buoyant topphaetons and surreys with their light limbed horses is to be thrilled by some such insensate expectation of pleasure as fills the heart of a boy at his first sally into the world  i always expect to find my lost youth waiting for me around the corner of the united states hotel and i accuse myself of some fault if it disappoints me as it always does  i can imagine what gaudy hopes by day and by night the bright staging of the potential drama must awaken in the breast of a young girl when she first sees it and how blank she must feel when the curtain goes down and there has been no play  it was a real anguish to me when that young girl with the deerings welcomed my wife and me with a hopeful smile as if we were the dramatis personae and now the performance must be going to begin  i could see how much our chance acquaintance had brightened the perspective for her and how eagerly she had repaired all her illusions and i thought how much better it would have been if she had been left to the dull and spiritless resignation in which i had first seen her  from that there could no fall at least and now she had risen from it only to sink again  but in fact the whole party seemed falsely cheered by the event of the afternoon and in the few moments that we sat with them on their verandah before going to the music at the grand union i could hear the ladies laughing together while deering joyously unfolded to me his plan of going home the next morning and leaving his wife and miss gage behind him  they will stay in this hotelthey might as welland i guess they can get along  my wife feels more acquainted since she met mrs march and i shant feel so much like leavin her among strangers here i dont know when shes taken such a fancy to any one as she has to your wife or miss gage either  i guess shell want to ask her about the stores  i said that i believed the fancy was mutual and that there was nothing my wife liked better than telling people about stores  i added in generalisation that when a woman had spent all her own money on dress it did her quite as much good to see other women spending theirs and deering said he guessed that was about so  he gave me a push on the shoulder to make me understand how keenly he appreciated the joke and i perceived that we had won his heart too  we joined the ladies and i thought that my sufferings for her authorised me to attach myself more especially to miss gage and to find out all i could about her  we walked ahead of the others and i was aware of her making believe that it was quite the same as if she were going to the music with a young man  not that she seemed disposed to trifle with my grey hairs i quickly saw that this would not be in character with her but some sort of illusion was essential to her youth and she could not help rejuvenating me this was quite like the goddess she looked i reflected but otherwise she was not formidably divine and in fact i suppose the goddesses were after all only nice girls at heart  this one at any rate i decided was a very nice girl when she was not sulking and she was so brightened by her little adventure which was really no adventure that i could not believe i had ever seen her sulking  the hotel people did not keep us from going into the court of the hotel as i was afraid they might and we all easily found places in the pauses of the music i pointed out such notables and characters as i saw about us and tried to possess her of as much of the saratoga world as i knew  it was largely there in that bold evidence it loves and in that social solitude to which the saratoga of the hotels condemns the denizens of her world  i do not mean that the saratoga crowd is at all a fastlooking crowd  there are sporting people and gamblers but the great mass of the frequenters are plain honest americans out upon a holiday from all parts of the country and of an innocence too inveterate to have grasped the fact that there is no fashion in saratoga now but the fashion of the ladies dresses  these i must say are of the newest and prettiest the dressing of the women always strikes me there  my companion was eager to recognise the splendours which she had heard of and i pointed out an old lady by the door who sat there displaying upon her vast person an assortment of gems and jewels which she seemed as personally indifferent to as if she were a show window and i was glad to have the girl shrink from the spectacle in a kind of mute alarm  i tried to make her share my pleasure in a group of cubansfat father fat mother fat daughterwho came down the walk toward us in the halo of tropical tradition but she had not the taste for olives and i saw that i failed to persuade her of the aesthetic value of this alien element among us  she apparently could do almost as little with some old figures of bygone beaus spectrally revisiting the hotel haunts of their youth but she was charmed with the sylvan loveliness of that incomparable court  it is in fact a park of the tall slim saratoga trees enclosed by the quadrangle of the hotel exquisitely kept and with its acres of greensward now showing their colour vividly in the light of the electrics which shone from all sides on the fountain flashing and plashing in the midst  i said that here was that union of the sylvan and the urban which was always the dream of art and which formed the delicate charm of pastoral poetry and although i do not think she quite grasped the notion i saw that she had a pleasure in the visible fact and that was much better  besides she listened very respectfully and with no signs of being bored  in the wait between the two parts of the concert i invited her to walk around the court with me and under the approving eye of mrs march we made this expedition  it seemed to me that i could not do a wiser thing both for the satisfaction of my own curiosity and for the gratification of the autobiographical passion we all feel than to lead her on to speak of herself  but she had little or nothing to say of herself and what she said of other things was marked by a straightforward good sense if not a wide intelligence  i think we make a mistake when we suppose that a beautiful woman must always be vain or conscious  i fancy that a beauty is quite as often a solid and sensible person with no inordinate wish to be worshipped and this young lady struck me as wholly unspoiled by flattery  i decided that she was not the type that would take the fancy of de witt point and that she had grown up without local attention for that reason or possibly because a certain coldness in her overawed the free spirit of rustic lovemaking  no doubt she knew that she was beautiful and i began to think that it was not so much disappointment at finding saratoga as indifferent as de witt point which gave her the effect of disgust i had first noted in her the night before  that might rather have come from the sense of feeling herself a helpless burden on her friends and from that young longing for companionship which is as far as may be from the desire of conquest of triumph  finding her now so gratefully content with the poor efforts to amuse her which an old fellow like me could make i perceived that the society of other girls would suffice to make saratoga quite another thing for her and i cast about in my mind to contrive this somehow  i confess that i liked her better and better and before the evening was out i had quite transferred my compassion from the deerings to her  it was forlorn and dreary for her to be attached to this good couple whose interests were primarily in each other and who had not the first of those arts which could provide her with other company  she willingly told about their journey to saratoga and her story did not differ materially from the account deering had already given me but even the outward form of adventure had fallen from their experience since they had come to saratoga  they had formed the habit of congress park by accident but they had not been to the lake or the races or the house of pansa or mount mgregor or hilton park or even the outlying springs  it was the first time they had been inside of the grand union  then you have never seen the parlour i asked and after the concert i boldly led the way into the parlour and lavished its magnificence upon them as if i had been the host or one of the hotel guests at the very least  i enjoyed the breathlessness of the deerings so much as we walked up and down the vast drawingrooms accompanied by our images in the mirrors that i insisted upon sitting down with them all upon some of the richest pieces of furniture and i was so flown with my success as cicerone that i made them come with me to the united states  i showed them through the parlours there and then led them through to the inner verandah which commanded another wooded court like that of the grand union  i tried to make them feel the statelier sentiment of the older hotel and to stir their imaginations with a picture of the old times when the southern planters used to throng the place and all that was gay and brilliant in fashionable society was to be seen there some time during the summer  i think that i failed in this but apparently i succeeded in giving them an evening of dazzling splendour  well sir this has been a great treat said mr deering when he bade us goodbye as well as goodnight he was going early in the morning  the ladies murmured their gratitude mrs deering with an emotion that suited her thanks and miss gage with a touch of something daughterly toward me that i thought pretty    chapter vi    well what did you make of her my dear mrs march demanded the instant she was beyond their hearing  i must say you didnt spare yourself in the cause you did bravely  what is she like  really i dont know i answered after a moments reflection  i should say she was almost purely potential  shes not so much this or that kind of girl shes merely a radiant image of girlhood  now your chicquing it youre faking it said mrs march borrowing the verbs severally from the art editor and the publisher of every other week  you have got to tell me just how much and how little there really is of her before i go any further with them  is she stupid  nono i shouldnt say stupid exactly  she iswhat shall i say extremely plainminded  i suppose the goddesses were plainminded im a little puzzled by her attitude toward her own beauty  she doesnt live her beauty any more than a poet lives his poetry or a painter his painting though ive no doubt she knows her gift is hers just as they do  i think i understand  you mean she isnt conscious  no  conscious isnt quite the word i said fastidiously  isnt there some word that says less or more in the same direction  no there isnt and i shall think you dont mean anything at all if you keep on  now tell me how she really impressed you  does she know anything  has she read anything  has she any ideas  really i cant say whether they were ideas or not  she knew what every other week was she had read the stories in it but im not sure she valued it at its true worth  she is very plainminded  dont keep repeating that  what do you mean by plainminded  well honest single commonsense coherent arithmetical  horrors  do you mean that she is mannish  no not mannish  and yet she gave me the notion that when it came to companionship she would be just as well satisfied with a lot of girls as young men  mrs march pulled her hand out of my arm and stopped short under one of those tall saratoga shadetrees to dramatise her inference then she is the slyest of all possible pusses  did she give you the notion that she would be just as well satisfied with you as with a young man  she couldnt deceive me so far as that my dear  very well i shall take her in hand myself tomorrow and find out what she really is  mrs march went shopping the next forenoon with what was left of the deering party deering had taken the early train north and she seemed to have found the ladies livelier without him  she formed the impression from their more joyous behaviour that he kept his wife from spending as much money as she would naturally have done and that while he was not perhaps exactly selfish he was forgetful of her youth of the difference in years between them and of her capacity for pleasures which he could not care for  she said that mrs deering and miss gage now acted like two girls together and if anything miss gage seemed the elder of the two  and what did you decide about her i inquired  well i helped her buy a hat and a jacket at one of those nice shops just below the hotel where theyre stopping and weve started an evening dress for her  she cant wear that white duck morning noon and night  but her characterher nature  oh  well she is rather plainminded as you call it  i think she shows out her real feelings too much for a woman  why do you prefer dissimulation in your sex my dear  i dont call it dissimulation  but of course a girl ought to hide her feelings  dont you think it would have been better for her not to have looked so obviously out of humour when you first saw her the other night  she wouldnt have interested me so much then and she probably wouldnt have had your acquaintance now  oh i dont mean to say that even that kind of girl wont get on if she gives her mind to it but i think i should prefer a little less plainmindedness as you call it if i were a man  i did not know exactly what to say to this and i let mrs march go on  its so in the smallest thing  if youre choosing a thing for her and she likes another she lets you feel it at once  i dont mean that shes rude about it but she seems to set herself so square across the way and you come up with a kind of bump against her  i dont think thats very feminine  thats what i mean by mannish you always know where to find her  i dont know why this criticism should have amused me so much but i began to laugh quite uncontrollably and i laughed on and on  mrs march kept her temper with me admirably  when i was quiet again she said   mrs deering is a person that wins your heart at once she has that appealing quality  you can see that shes cowed by her husband though he means to be kind to her and yet you may be sure she gets round him and has her own way all the time  i know it was her idea to have him go home and leave them here and of course she made him think it was his  she saw that as long as he was here and anxious to get back to his stock there was no hope of giving miss gage the sort of chance she came for and so she determined to manage it at the same time you can see that she is true as steel and would abhor anything like deceit worse than the pest  i see and that is why you dislike miss gage  dislike her  no i dont dislike her but she is disappointing if she were a plain girl her plainmindedness would be all right it would be amusing she would turn it to account and make it seem humorous  but it doesnt seem to go with her beauty it takes away from thati dont know how to express it exactly  you mean that she has no charm  no i dont mean that at all  she has a great deal of charm of a certain kind but its a very peculiar kind  after all the truth is the truth basil isnt it  it is sometimes my dear i assented  and the truth has its charm even when its too blunt  ah im not so sure of that  yesyes it has  you mustnt say so basil or i shall lose all my faith in you  if i couldnt trust you i dont know what i should do  what are you after now isabel  i am not after anything  i want you to go round to all the hotels and see if there is not some young man you know at one of them there surely must be  would one young man be enough  if he were attentive enough he would be  one young man is as good as a thousand if the girl is the right kind  but you have just been implying that miss gage is cold and selfish and greedy  shall i go round exploring hotel registers for a victim to such a divinity as that  no you neednt go till i have had a talk with her  i am not sure she is worth it i am not sure that i want to do a single thing for her    chapter vii    the next day after another forenoons shopping with her friends mrs march announced  well now it has all come out basil and i wonder you didnt get the secret at once from your mr deering have you been supposing that miss gage was a poor girl whom the deerings had done the favour of bringing with them  why what of it i asked provisionally  she is very well off  her father is not only the president as they call it of the village but hes the president of the bank  yes i told you that deering told me so  but he is very queer  he has kept her very close from the other young people and mrs deering is the only girl friend shes ever had and shes grown up without having been anywhere without him they had to plead with him to let her come with themor mrs deering hadbut when he once consented he consented handsomely he gave her a lot of money and told them he wanted her to have the best time that money could buy and of course you can understand how such a man would think that money would buy a good time anywhere but the deerings didnt know how to go about it  she confessed as much when we were talking the girl over  i could see that she stood in awe of her somehow from the beginning and that she felt more than the usual responsibility for her  that was the reason she was so eager to get her husband off home as long as he was with them she would have to work everything through him and that would be double labour because he is so hopelessly villaginous dont you know that he never could rise to the conception of anything else he took them to a cheap secondclass hotel and he was afraid to go with them anywhere because he never was sure that it was the right thing to do and he was too proud to ask and they had to keep prodding him all the time  thats delightful  oh i dare say you think so but if you knew how it wounded a womans selfrespect you would feel differently or you wouldnt rather  but now thank goodness theyve got him off their hands and they can begin to breathe freely  that is mrs deering could if she hadnt her heart in her mouth all the time wondering what she can do for the girl and bullying herself with the notion that she is to blame if she doesnt have a good time  you can understand just how it was with them always  mrs deering is one of those meek little things that a great splendid lonely creature like miss gage would take to in a small place and perfectly crush under the weight of her confidence and she would want to make her husband live up to her ideal of the girl and would be miserable because he wouldnt or couldnt  i believe the good deering didnt even think her handsome  thats it  and he thought anything that was good enough for his wife was good enough for miss gage and hed be stubborn about doing things on her account even to please his wife  such conduct is imaginable of the good deering  i dont think he liked her  nor she him  mrs deering helplessly hinted as much  she said he didnt like to have her worrying so much about miss gages not having a good time and she couldnt make him feel as she did about it and she was half glad for his own sake that he had to go home  did she say that  not exactly but you could see that she meant it  do you think it would do for them to change from their hotel and go to the grand union or the states or congress hall  have you been putting them up to that isabel  i knew you would suspect me and i wouldnt have asked for your opinion if i had cared anything for it really  what would be the harm of their doing it  none whatever if you really want my worthless opinion  but what could they do there  they could see something if they couldnt do anything and as soon as miss gage has got her new gowns im going to tell them you thought they could do it  it was their own idea at any rate  miss gages  mrs deerings  she has the courage of ai dont know what  she sees that its a desperate case and she wouldnt stop at anything  now that her husband has gone home  well which hotel shall they go to  oh that requires reflection  very well then when youve reflected i want you to go to the hotel youve chosen and introduce yourself to the clerk and tell him your wife has two friends coming and you want something very pleasant for them  tell him all about yourself and every other week  hell think i want them deadheaded  no matter if your conscience is clear and dont be so shamefully modest as you always are but speak up boldly  now will you promise me you will  i will try as the good little boy says  but isabel we dont know these people except from their own account  and that is quite enough  it will be quite enough for the hotelkeeper if they run their board  i shall have to pay it  now basil dear dont be disgusting and go and do as youre bid  it was amusing but it was perfectly safe and there was no reason why i should not engage rooms for the ladies at another hotel  i had not the least question of them and i had failed to worry my wife with a pretended doubt  so i decided that i would go up at once and inquire at the grand union  i chose this hotel because though it lacked the fine flower of the more ancient respectability and the legendary charm of the states it was so spectacular that it would be in itself a perpetual excitement for those ladies and would form an effect of society which with some help from us might very well deceive them  this was what i said to myself though in my heart i knew better  whatever mrs deering might think that girl was not going to be taken in with any such simple device and i must count upon the daily chances in the place to afford her the good time she had come for  as i mounted the steps to the portico of the grand union with my head down and lost in a calculation of these chances i heard my name gaily called and i looked up to see young kendricks formerly of our staff on every other week and still a frequent contributor and a great favourite of my wifes and my own  my heart gave a great joyful bound at sight of him  my dear boy when in the world did you come  this morning by the steamboat train and i am never never going away  you like it then  like it  its the most delightful thing in the universe  why im simply wild about it mr march  i go round saying to myself why have i thrown away my life  why have i never come to saratoga before  its simply supreme and its american down to the ground yes thats what makes it so delightful  no other people could have invented it and it doesnt try to be anything but what we made it  im so glad you look at it in that way  we like it  we discovered it three or four years ago and we never let a summer slip if we can help it without coming here for a week or a month  the place i enlarged has the charm of ruin though its in such obvious repair it has a past its so completely gone by in a society sense  the cottage life here hasnt killed the hotel life as it has at newport and bar harbour but the ideal of cottage life everywhere else has made hotel life at saratoga ungenteel  the hotels are full but at the same time they are society solitudes  how gay it is said the young fellow as he gazed with a pensive smile into the street where all those festive vehicles were coming and going dappled by the leafshadows from the tall trees overhead what air what a sky  the one was indeed sparkling and the other without a cloud for it had rained in the night and it seemed as if the weather could never be hot and close again  i forgot how i had been sweltering about and said  yes it is a saratoga day  its supposed that the sparkle of the air comes from the healthful gases thrown off by the springs  some people say the springs are doctored thats what makes their gases so healthful  why anything might happen here kendricks mused unheedful of me what a scene what a stage  why has nobody done a story about saratoga he asked with a literary turn i knew his thoughts would be taking  all gerald kendrickss thoughts were of literature but sometimes they were not of immediate literary effect though that was never for long  because i suggested one probably couldnt get his young lady characters to come here if they were at all in society  but of course there must be charming presences here accidentally  some young girl say might come here from a country place expecting to see social gaiety  ah but that would be too heartbreaking  not at all  not if she met some young fellow accidentallydont you see  it would be difficult to manage and hasnt it been done  everything has been done my dear fellow  or you might suppose a young lady who comes on here with her father a veteran politician delegate to the republican or democratic conventionall the conventions meet in saratogaand some ardent young delegate falls in love with her  that would be new ground  there you would have the political novel which they wonder every now and then some of us dont write  the smile faded from kendrickss lips and i laughed well then theres nothing for it but the social science congress have a brilliant professor win the heart of a lovely sisterinlaw of another member by a paper he reads before the congress  no youre difficult  are you stopping here  yes are you  i try to give myself the air of it when i am feeling very proud but really we live at a most charming little hotel on a back street out of the whirl and rush that we should prefer to be in if we could afford it  he said it must be delightful and he made the proper inquiries about mrs march  kendricks never forgot the gentleman in the artist and he was as true to the convenances as if they had been principles  that was what made mrs march like his stories so much more than the stories of some people who wrote better  he said he would drop in during the afternoon and i went indoors on the pretext of buying a newspaper  then without engaging rooms for mrs deering and miss gage i hurried home    chapter viii    well did you get the rooms asked my wife as soon as she saw me  she did not quite call it across the street to me as i came up from where she sat on the piazza  no i didnt i said boldly if somewhat breathlessly  why didnt you  you ought to have gone to the states if they were full at the grand union  they were not full unless kendricks got their last room  do you mean that he was there  mr kendricks  if you are hoaxing me basil  i am not my dear indeed im not said i beginning to laugh and this made her doubt me the more  because if you are i shall simply never forgive you  and im in earnest this time she replied  why should i want to hoax you about such a vital thing as that couldnt kendricks come to saratoga as well as we  hes here looking up the ground of a story i should think from what he said  no matter what hes here for hes here and thats enough  i never knew of anything so perfectly providential  did you tell him basil  did you dare  tell him what  you know about miss gage  well i came very near it  i dangled the fact before his eyes once but i caught it away again in time  he never saw it  i thought id better let you tell him  is he coming here to see us  he asked if he might  hes always nice  i dont know that i shall ask him to do anything for them after all im not sure that shes worth it  i wish some commoner person had happened along  kendricks is too precious  i shall have to think about it and dont you tease me basil will you  i dont know  if im not allowed to have any voice in the matter im afraid i shall take it out in teasing  i dont see why miss gage isnt quite as good as kendricks  i believe shes taller and though hes pretty goodlooking i prefer her style of beauty  i dare say his family is better but i fancy shes richer and his family isnt good beyond new york city and her money will go anywhere  its a pretty even thing  good gracious basil you talk as if it were a question of marriage  and you think it is  now i see that youre bent upon teasing and we wont talk any more please  what time did he say he would call  if i maynt talk i cant tell  you may talk that much  well then he didnt say  basil said my wife after a moment if you could be serious i should like very much to talk with you  i know that youre excited by meeting mr kendricks and i know what you thought the instant you saw him  but indeed it wont do my dear  its more than weve any right to ask and i shall not ask it and i shall not let you  she is a stiff awkward village person and i dont believe shes amiable or intelligent and to let a graceful refined superior man like mr kendricks throw away his time upon her would be wicked simply wicked  let those people manage for themselves from this out  of course you mustnt get them rooms at the grand union now for hed be seeing us there with them and feel bound to pay her attention  you must try for them at the states since the matters been spoken of or at congress hall  but theres no hurry we must have time to think whether we shall use mr kendricks with them  i suppose it will do no harm to introduce him  if he stays we cant very well avoid it and i confess i should like to see how she impresses him  of course we shall introduce him  but i insist i shall just do it merely as one human being to another and dont you come in with any of your romantic nonsense basil about her social disappointment  just how much did you give the situation away  i told as well as i could remember  well thats nothing  hell never think of it and you mustnt hint anything of the kind again  i promised devoutly and she went on   it wouldnt be niceit wouldnt be delicate to let him into the conspiracy  that must be entirely our affair dont you see  and i dont want you to take a single step without me  i dont want you even to discuss her with him  will you  because that will tempt you further  that afternoon kendricks came promptly to call like the little gentleman he was and he was more satisfactory about saratoga than he had been in the morning even  mrs march catechised him and she didnt leave an emotion of his unsearched by her vivid sympathy she ended by saying   you must write a story about saratoga  and i have got just the heroine for you  i started but she ignored my start  kendricks laughed delighted and asked is she pretty  must a heroine be pretty  she had better be  otherwise she will have to be tremendously clever and say all sorts of brilliant things and that puts a great burden on the author  if you proclaim boldly at the start that shes a beauty the illustrator has got to look after her and the author has a comparative sinecure  mrs march thought a moment and then she said  well she is a beauty  i dont want to make it too hard for you  when shall i see her kendricks demanded and he feigned an amusing anxiety  well that depends upon how you behave mr kendricks  if you are very very good perhaps i may let you see her this evening  we will take you to call upon her  is it possible  do you mean business  then she isin society  mr kendricks cried mrs march with burlesque severity  do you think that i would offer you a heroine who was not in society  you forget that i am from boston  of course of course  i understand that any heroine of your acquaintance must be in society  but i thoughti didnt knowbut for the momentsaratoga seems to be so tremendously mixed and mr march says there is no society here  but if she is from boston  i didnt say she was from boston mr kendricks  oh i beg your pardon  she is from de witt point said mrs march and she apparently enjoyed his confusion no less than my bewilderment at the course she was taking  i was not going to be left behind though and i said  i discovered this heroine myself kendricks and if there is to be any giving away  now basil  i am going to do it  mrs march would never have cared anything about her if it hadnt been for me  i cant let her impose on you this heroine is no more in society than she is from boston  that is the trouble with her  she has come here for society and she cant find any  oh that was what you were hinting at this morning said kendricks  i thought it a pure figment of the imagination  one doesnt imagine such things as that my dear fellow  one imagines a heroine coming here and having the most magnificent kind of social careerlawnparties lunches teas dinners picnics hopsand going back to de witt point with a dozen offers of marriage  thats the kind of work the imagination does  but this simple and appealing situationthis beautiful young girl with her poor little illusions her secret hopes half hidden from herself her ignorant past her visionary future  now i am going to tell you all about her mr kendricks mrs march broke in upon me with defiance in her eye and she flung out the whole fact with a rapidity of utterance that would have left far behind any attempt of mine  but i made no attempt to compete with her i contented myself with a sarcastic silence which i could see daunted her a little at last  and all that weve done my dear fellowi took in irony the word she left to meis to load ourselves up with these two impossible people to go their security to destiny and answer for their having a good time  were in luck  why i dont know said kendricks and i could see that his fancy was beginning to play with the situation i dont see why it isnt a charming scheme  of course it is cried mrs march taking a little heart from his courage  we cant make out yet whether the girl is interesting i put in maliciously  that is what you say said my wife  she is very shy and of course she wouldnt show out her real nature to you  i found her very interesting  now isabel i protested  she is fascinating the perverse woman persisted  she has a fascinating dulness  kendricks laughed and i jeered at this complex characterisation  you make me impatient to judge for myself he said  will you go with me to call upon them this evening asked mrs march  i shall be delighted  and you can count upon me to aid and abet you in your generous conspiracy mrs march to the best of my ability  theres nothing i should like better than to help you  throw dust in her beautiful eyes i quoted  not at all said my wife  but to spread a beatific haze over everything so that as long as she stays in saratoga she shall see life rosecolour  of course you may say that its a kind of deception  not at all cried the young fellow in his turn  we will make it reality  then there will be no harm in it  what a jesuitical casuist  you had better read what cardinal newman says in his apologia about lying young man  neither of them minded me for just then there was a stir of drapery round the corner of the piazza from where we were sitting and the next moment mrs deering and miss gage showed themselves  we were just talking of you said mrs march  may i present our friend mr kendricks mrs deering  and miss gage  at sight of the young man so well dressed and goodlooking who bowed so prettily to her and then bustled to place chairs for them a certain cloud seemed to lift from miss gages beautiful face and to be at least partly broken on mrs deerings visage  i began to talk to the girl and she answered in good spirits and with more apparent interest in my conversation than she had yet shown while kendricks very properly devoted himself to the other ladies  both his eyes were on them but i felt that he had a third somehow upon her and that the smallest fact of her beauty and grace was not lost upon him  i knew that her rich tender voice was doing its work too through the commonplaces she vouchsafed to me  there was a moment when i saw him lift a questioning eyebrow upon mrs march and saw her answer with a fleeting frown of affirmation  i cannot tell just how it was that before he left us his chair was on the other side of miss gages and i was eliminated from the dialogue  he did not stay too long  there was another tableau of him on foot taking leave of mrs march with a high handshake which had then lately come in and which i saw the girl note and then bowing to her and to mrs deering  dont forget my wife called after him with a ready invention not lost on his quick intelligence that youre going to the concert with us after tea  eight oclock remember  you may be sure i shall remember that he returned gaily    chapter ix    the countenances of the ladies fell instantly when he was gone mrs march said mrs deering with a nervous tremor did mr march get us those rooms at the grand union  nono my wife began and she made a little pause as if to gather plausibility  the grand union was very full and he thought that at the states  because said mrs deering i dont know as we shall trouble him after all  mr deering isnt very well and i guess we have got to go home  go home mrs march echoed and her voice was a tonescene of a toppling hope and a widespread desolation  why you mustnt  we must i guess  it had begun to be very pleasant andi guess i have got to go  i cant feel easy about him  why of course mrs march now assented and she waved her fan thoughtfully before her face  i knew what she was thinking of and i looked at miss gage who had involuntarily taken the pose and expression of the moment when i first saw her at the kiosk in congress park  and miss gage  oh yes i must go too said the girl wistfully forlornly  she had tears in her voice tears of despair and vexation i should have said  thats too bad said mrs march and as she did not offer any solution of the matter i thought it rather heartless of her to go on and rub it in  and we were just planning some things we could do together  it cant be helped now returned the girl  but we shall see you again before you go mrs march asked of both  well i dont know said the girl with a look at mrs deering who now said   i guess so  well let you know when were going  and they got away rather stiffly  why in the world my dear i asked if you werent going to promote their stay need you prolong the agony of their acquaintance  did you feel that about it too  well i wanted to ask you first if you thought it would do  what do  you know get her a room here  because if we do we shall have her literally on our hands as long as we are here  we shall have to have the whole care and responsibility of her and i wanted you to feel just what you were going in for  you know very well i cant do things by halves and that if i undertake to chaperon this girl i shall chaperon her  to the bitter end  yes i understand the conditions of your uncompromising conscience  but i dont believe it will be any such killing matter  there are other semidetached girls in the house she could go round with them  we talked on and as sometimes happens we convinced each other so thoroughly that she came to my ground and i went to hers  then it was easier for us to come together and after making me go to the clerk and find out that he had a vacant room mrs march agreed with me that it would not do at all to have miss gage stay with us the fact that there was a vacant room seemed to settle the question  we were still congratulating ourselves on our escape when mrs deering suddenly reappeared round our corner of the verandah  she was alone and she looked excited  oh it isnt anything she said in answer to the alarm that showed itself in mrs marchs face at sight of her  i hope you wont think its too presuming mrs march and i want you to believe that its something i have thought of by myself and that julia wouldnt have let me come if she had dreamed of such a thing  i do hate so to take her back with me now that shes begun to have a good time and i was wonderingwondering whether it would be asking too much if i tried to get her a room here  i shouldnt exactly like to leave her in the hotel alone though i suppose it would be perfectly proper but mr deering found out when he was trying to get rooms before that there were some young ladies staying by themselves here and i didnt want to ask the clerk for a room unless you felt just right about it  why of course mrs deering  its a public house like any other and you have as much right  but i didnt want you to think that i would do it without asking you and if it is going to be the least bit of trouble to you  the poor thing while she talked stood leaning anxiously over toward mrs march who had risen and pressing the points of her fingers nervously together  it wont mrs deering  it will be nothing but pleasure  why certainly  i shall be delighted to have miss gage here and anything that mr march and i can dowhy we had just been talking of it and mr march has this minute got back from seeing the clerk and she can have a very nice room  we had been intending to speak to you about it as soon as we saw you  i do not know whether this was quite true or not but i was glad mrs march said it from the effect it had upon mrs deering  tears of relief came into her eyes and she said  then i can go home in the morning  i was going to stay on a day or two longer on julias account but i didnt feel just right about mr deering and now i wont have to  there followed a flutter of polite offers and refusals acknowledgments and disavowals and an understanding that i would arrange it all and that we would come to mrs deerings hotel after supper and see miss gage about the when and the how of her coming to us  well isabel i said after it was all over and mrs deering had vanished in a mist of happy tears i suppose this is what you call perfectly providential  do you really believe that miss gage didnt send her back  i know she didnt  but i know that she had to do it just the same as if miss gage had driven her at the point of the bayonet  i laughed at this tragical image  can she be such a terror  she is an ideal  and mrs deering is as afraid as death of her of course she has to live up to her  its probably been the struggle of her life and i can quite imagine her letting her husband die before she would take miss gage back unless she went back satisfied  i dont believe i can imagine so much as that exactly but i can imagine her being afraid of miss gages taking it out of her somehow  now she will take it out of us  i hope you realise that youve done it now my dear  to be sure you will have all your life to repent of your rashness  i shall never repent mrs march retorted hardily  it was the right thing the only thing  we couldnt have let that poor creature stay on when she was so anxious to get back to her husband  no  and i confess basil that i feel a little pity for that poor girl too  it would have been cruel it would have been fairly wicked to let her go home so soon and especially now  oh  and i suppose that by especially now you mean kendricks i said and i laughed mockingly as the novelists say  how sick i am of this stale old lovebusiness between young people  we ought to know betterwere old enough at least you are  she seemed not to feel the gibe  why basil she asked dreamily havent you any romance left in you  romance  bah  its the most ridiculous unreality in the world if you had so much sympathy for that stupid girl in that poor woman in her anxiety about her disappointment why hadnt you a little for her sick husband  but a husband is nothingwhen you have got him  i did sympathise with her  you didnt say so  well she is only his second wife and i dont suppose its anything serious  didnt i really say anything to her  not a word  it is curious i went on how we let this idiotic lovepassion absorb us to the very last  it is wholly unimportant who marries who or whether anybody marries at all  and yet we no sooner have the making of a loveaffair within reach than we revert to the folly of our own youth and abandon ourselves to it as if it were one of the great interests of life  who is talking about love  it isnt a question of that  its a question of making a girl have a pleasant time for a few days and what is the harm of it  girls have a dull enough time at the very best  my heart aches for them and i shall never let a chance slip to help them i dont care what you say  now isabel i returned dont you be a humbug  this is a perfectly plain case and you are going in for a very risky affair with your eyes open  you shall not pretend youre not  very well then if i am going into it with my eyes open i shall look out that nothing happens  and you think prevision will avail  i wish i said that instead of coming home that night and telling you about this girl i had confined my sentimentalising to that young frenchcanadian mother and her dirty little boy who ate the peanut shells  ive no doubt it was really a more tragical case  they looked dreadfully poor and squalid  why couldnt i have amused my idle fancy with their fortunesthe sort of husband and father they had their shabby home the struggle of their life  that is the appeal that a genuine person listens to  nothing does more to stamp me a poseur than the fact that i preferred to bemoan myself for a sulky girl who seemed not to be having a good time  there was truth in my joking but the truth did not save me it lost me rather  yes said my wife it was your fault  i should never have seen anything in her if it had not been for you  it was your coming back and working me up about her that began the whole thing and now if anything goes wrong you will have yourself to thank for it  she seized the opportunity of my having jestingly taken up this load to buckle it on me tight and fast clasping it here tying it there and giving a final pull to the knots that left me scarcely the power to draw my breath much less the breath to protest  i was forced to hear her say again that all her concern from the beginning was for mrs deering and that now if she had offered to do something for miss gage it was not because she cared anything for her but because she cared everything for mrs deering who could never lift up her head again at de witt point if she went back so completely defeated in all the purposes she had in asking miss gage to come with her to saratoga  i did not observe that this wave of compassion carried mrs march so far as to leave her stranded with mrs deering that evening when we called with kendricks and asked her and miss gage to go with us to the congress park concert  mrs deering said that she had to pack that she did not feel just exactly like going and my tender heart ached with a knowledge of her distress  miss gage made a faint false pretence of refusing to come with us too but mrs deering urged her to go and put on the new dress which had just come home so that mrs march could see it  the girl came back looking radiant divine andwill it do she palpitated under my wifes critical glance  do  it will outdo  i never saw anything like it  the connoisseur patted it a little this way and a little that  it is a dream  did the hat come too  it appeared that the hat had come too  miss gage rematerialised with it on after a moments evanescence and looked at my wife with the expression of being something impersonal with a hat on  simply there is nothing to say cried mrs march  the girl put up her hands to it  good gracious  you mustnt take it off  your costume is perfect for the concert  is it really asked the girl joyfully and she seemed to find this the first fitting moment to say for sole recognition of our selfsacrifice im much obliged to you mr march for getting me that room  i begged her not to speak of it and turned an ironical eye upon my wife but she was lost in admiration of the hat  yes she sighed its much better than the one i wanted you to get at first  and she afterward explained that the girl seemed to have a perfect instinct for what went with her style  kendricks kept himself discreetly in the background and with his unfailing right feeling was talking to mrs deering in spite of her not paying much attention to him  i must own that i too was absorbed in the spectacle of miss gage  she went off with us and did not say another word to mrs deering about helping her to pack  perhaps this was best though it seemed heartless it may not have been so heartless as it seemed  i dare say it would have been more suffering to the woman if the girl had missed this chance    chapter x    we had undertaken rather a queer affair but it was not so queer after all when miss gage was fairly settled with us  there were other young girls in that pleasant house who had only one anothers protection and the general safety of the social atmosphere  we could not conceal from ourselves of course that we had done a rather romantic thing and in the light of europe which we had more or less upon our actions rather an absurd thing but it was a comfort to find that miss gage thought it neither romantic nor absurd  she took the affair with an apparent ignorance of anything unusual in itwith so much ignorance indeed that mrs march had her occasional question whether she was duly impressed with what was being done for her  whether this was so or not it is certain that she was as docile and as biddable as need be  she did not always ask what she should do that would not have been in the tradition of village independence but she always did what she was told and did not vary from her instructions a hairsbreadth  i do not suppose she always knew why she might do this and might not do that and i do not suppose that young girls often understand the reasons of the proprieties  they are told that they must and that they must not and this in an astonishing degree suffices them if they are nice girls  of course there was pretty constant question of kendricks in the management of miss gages amusement for that was really what our enterprise resolved itself into  he showed from the first the sweetest disposition to forward all our plans in regard to her and in fact he even anticipated our wishes  i do not mean to give the notion that he behaved from an interested motive in going to the station the morning mrs deering left and getting her ticket for her and checking her baggage and posting her in the changes she would have to make  this was something i ought to have thought of myself but i did not think of it and i am willing that he should have all the credit  i know that he did it out of the lovely generosity of nature which always took me in him  miss gage was there with her and she remained to be consoled after mrs deering departed  they came straight to us from the train and then when he had consigned miss gage to mrs marchs care he offered to go and see that her things were transferred from her hotel to ours they were all ready she said and the bill was paid  he did not come back that day and in fact he delicately waited for some sign from us that his help was wanted  but when he did come he had formulated saratoga very completely and had a better conception of doing it than i had after my repeated sojourns  we went very early in our explorations to the house of pansa which you find in very much better repair at saratoga than you do at pompeii and we contrived to pass a whole afternoon there  my wife and i had been there before more than once but it always pleasantly recalled our wanderyears when we first met in europe and we suffered round after those young things with a patience which i hope will not be forgotten at the day of judgment  when we came to a seat we sat down and let them go off by themselves but my recollection is that there is not much furniture in the house of pansa that you can sit down on and for the most part we all kept together  kendricks and i thought alike about the pompeian house as a model of something that might be done in the way of a seaside cottage in our own country and we talked up a little paper that might be done for every other week with pretty architectural drawings giving an account of our imaginary realisation of the notion  have somebody he said visit people who had been boring him to come down or up or out and see them and find them in a pompeian house with the sea in front and a bluegreen grove of low pines behind  might have a thread of story but mostly talk about how they came to do it and how delightfully livable they found it  you could work it up with some architect who would help you to keep off the grass in the way of technical blunders  with all this tendency to the classic in public architecture i dont see why the pompeian villa shouldnt be the next word for summer cottages  well well see what fulkerson says  he may see an ad in it would you like to do it  why not do it yourself  nobody else could do it so well  thanks for the taffy but the idea was yours  ill do it said kendricks after a moment if you wont  well see  miss gage stared and mrs march said   i didnt suppose the house of pansa would lead to shop with you two  you never can tell which way copy lies i returned and i asked the girl what should you think miss gage of a little paper with a thread of story but mostly talk on a supposititious pompeian cottage  i dont believe i understand said she far too remote from our literary interests as i saw to be ashamed of her ignorance  there i said to kendricks  do you think the general public would  miss gage isnt the general public said my wife who had followed the course of my thought her tone implied that miss gage was wiser and better  would you allow yourself to be drawn i asked dreamily issuing from an aisle of the pine grove as the tutelary goddess of a pompeian cottage  the girl cast a bewildered glance at my wife who said you neednt pay any attention to him miss gage  he has an idea that he is making a joke  we felt that we had done enough for one afternoon when we had done the house of pansa and i proposed that we should go and sit down in congress park and listen to the troy band  i was not without the hope that it would play washington post  my wife contrived that we should fall in behind the young people as we went and she asked what do you suppose she made of it all  probably she thought it was the house of sancho panza  no she hasnt read enough to be so ignorant even as that  its astonishing how much she doesnt know  what can her home life have been like  philistine to the last degree  we people who are near to literature have no conception how far from it most people are  the immense majority of homes as the newspapers call them have no books in them except the bible and a semireligious volume or two things you never see out of such homesand the state business directory  i was astonished when it came out that she knew about every other week  it must have been by accident  the sordidness of her home life must be something unimaginable  the daughter of a village capitalist whos put together his money dollar by dollar as they do in such places from the necessities and follies of his neighbours and has half the farmers of the region by the throat through his mortgagesi dont think that shes one to be desired any more than the daughter of a hundred earls if so much  she doesnt seem sordid herself  oh the taint doesnt show itself at once   if nature put not forth her power about the opening of the flower who is it that would live an hour   and she is a flower beautiful exquisite  yes and she had a mother as well as this father of hers  why shouldnt she be like her mother  i laughed  that is true  i wonder why we always leave the mother out of the count when we sum up the hereditary tendencies  i suppose the mother is as much a parent as the father  quite  and there is no reason why this girl shouldnt have her mothers nature  we dont actually know anything against her fathers nature yet i suggested but if her mother lived a starved and stunted life with him it may account for that effect of disappointed greed which i fancied in her when i first saw her  i dont call it greed in a young girl to want to see something of the world  what do you call it  kendricks and the girl were stopping at the gate of the pavilion and looking round at us  ah hes got enough for one day  hes going to leave her to us now  when we came up he said im going to run off a moment im going up to the bookstore there and he pointed toward one that had spread across the sidewalk just below the congress hall verandah with banks and shelves of novels and a cry of bargains in them on signs sticking up from their rows  i want to see if they have the last days of pompeii  we will find the ladies inside the park i said  i will go with you  mr march wants to see if they have the last number of every other week my wife mocked after us  this was indeed commonly a foible of mine  i had newly become one of the owners of the periodical as well as the editor and i was all the time looking out for it at the newsstands and bookstores and judging their enterprise by its presence or absence  but this time i had another motive though i did not allege it  i suppose its for miss gage i ventured to say by way of prefacing what i wished to say  kendricks im afraid were abusing your good nature  i know youre up here to look about and youre letting us use all your time  you mustnt do it  women have no conscience about these things and you cant expect a woman who has a young lady on her hands to spare you  i give you the hint dont count upon mrs march in this matter  oh i think you are very good to allow me to bother round said the young fellow with that indefatigable politeness of his  he added vaguely its very interesting  seeing it through such a fresh mind i suggested  well ill own that i dont think you could have found a much fresher one  has she read the last days of pompeii  she thought she had at first but it was the fall of granada  how delightful  dont you wish we could read books with that utterly unliterary sense of them  dont you think women generally do he asked evasively  i daresay they do at de witt point  he did not answer i saw that he was not willing to talk the young lady over and i could not help praising his taste to myself at the cost of my own  his delicacy forbade him the indulgence which my own protested against in vain  he showed his taste again in buying a cheap copy of the book which he meant to give her and of course he had to be all the more attentive to her because of my deprecating his selfdevotion    chapter xi    in the intimacy that grew up between my wife and miss gage i found myself less and less included  it seemed to me at times that i might have gone away from saratoga and not been seriously missed by any one but perhaps this was not taking sufficient account of my value as a spectator by whom mrs march could verify her own impressions  the girl had never known a mothers care and it was affecting to see how willing she was to be mothered by the chance kindness of a stranger  she probably felt more and more her ignorance of the world as it unfolded itself to her in terms so altogether strange to the life of de witt point  i was not sure that she would have been so grateful for the efforts made for her enjoyment if they had failed but as the case stood she was certainly grateful my wife said that and i saw it  she seemed to have written home about us to her father for she read my wife part of a letter from him conveying his respects and asking her to thank us for him  she came to me with the cheque it enclosed and asked me to get it cashed for her it was for a handsome amount  but she continued to go about at our cost quite unconsciously till one day she happened to witness a contest of civility between kendricks and myself as to which should pay the carriage we were dismissing  that night she came to mrs march and with many blushes asked to be allowed to pay for the past and future her full share of the expense of our joint pleasures  she said that she had never thought of it before and she felt so much ashamed  she could not be consoled till she was promised that she should be indulged for the future and that i should be obliged to average the outlay already made and let her pay a fourth  when she had gained her point mrs march said that she seemed a little scared and said i havent offended you mrs march have i  because if it isnt right for me to pay  its quite right my dear said my wife and its very nice of you to think of it  you know the girl explained ive never been out a great deal at home even and its always the custom there for the gentlemen to pay for a rideor danceor anything but this is different  mrs march said yes and in the interest of civilisation she did a little missionary work  she told her that in boston the young ladies paid for their tickets to the harvard assemblies and preferred to do it because it left them without even a tacit obligation  miss gage said she had never heard of such a thing before but she could see how much better it was  i do not think she got on with the last days of pompeii very rapidly its immediate interest was superseded by other things  but she always had the book about with her and i fancied that she tried to read it in those moments of relaxation from our pleasuring when she might better have been daydreaming though i dare say she did enough of that too  what amused me in the affair was the celerity with which it took itself out of our hands  in an incredibly short time we had no longer the trouble of thinking what we should do for miss gage that was provided for by the forethought of kendricks and our concern was how each could make the other go with the young people on their excursions and expeditions  we had seen and done all the things that they were doing and it presently bored us to chaperon them after a good deal of talking we arrived at a rough division of duty and i went with them walking and eating and drinking and for anything involving late hours and mrs march presided at such things as carriage exercise concerts and shopping  there are not many public entertainments at saratoga except such as the hotels supply but a series of salvation army meetings did duty as amusements and there was one theatrical performancea performance of east lynne entirely by people of colour  the sentiments and incidents of the heartbreaking melodrama as the coloured mind interpreted them were of very curious effect  it was as if the version were dyed with the same pigment that darkened the players skins  it all came out negro  yet they had tried to make it white i could perceive how they aimed not at the imitation of our nature but at the imitation of our convention it was like the play of children in that  i should have said that nothing could be more false than the motives and emotions of the drama as the author imagined them but i had to own that their rendition by these sincere souls was yet more artificial  there was nothing traditional nothing archaic nothing autochthonic in their poor art  if the scene could at any moment have resolved myself into a walkround with an interspersion of spirituals it would have had the charm of these it would have consoled and edified but as it was i have seldom been so bored  i began to make some sad reflections as that our american society in its endeavour for the effect of european society was of no truer ideal than these coloured comedians and i accused myself of a final absurdity in having come there with these young people who according to our good native usage could have come perfectly well without me  at the end of the first act i broke into their talk with my conclusion that we must not count the histrionic talent among the gifts of the african race just yet  we could concede them music i supposed and there seemed to be hope for them from what they had some of them done in the region of the plastic arts but apparently the stage was not for them and this was all the stranger because they were so imitative  perhaps i said it was an excess of selfconsciousness which prevented their giving themselves wholly to the art and i began to speak of the subjective and the objective of the real and the ideal and whether it was that i became unintelligible as i became metaphysical i found kendricks obviously not following me in the incoherent replies he gave  miss gage had honestly made no attempt to follow me  he asked why didnt i think it was pretty well done  they had enjoyed it very much he said  i could only stare in answer and wonder what had become of the mans tastes or his principles he was either humbugging himself or he was humbugging me  after that i left them alone and suffered through the rest of the play with what relief i could get from laughing when the pathetic emotions of the drama became too poignant  i decided that kendricks was absorbed in the study of his companions mind which must be open to his contemporaneous eye as it could never have been to my oldsighted glasses and i envied him the knowledge he was gaining of that type of american girl  it suddenly came to me that he must be finding his account in this and i felt a little less regret for the waste of civilities of attentions which sometimes seemed to me beyond her appreciation  i for my part gave myself to the study of the types about me and i dwelt long and luxuriously upon the vision of a florid and massive matron in diaphanous evening dress whom i imagined to be revisiting the glimpses of her girlhood in the ancient wateringplace and to be getting all the gaiety she could out of it  these are the figures one mostly sees at saratoga there is very little youth of the present day there but the youth of the past abounds with the belated yellow hair and the purple moustaches which gave a notion of greater wickedness in a former generation  i made my observation that the dress even in extreme cases of elderly prime was very goodin the case of the women i mean the men there as everywhere with us were mostly slovens and i was glad to find that the good taste and the correct fashion were without a colourline there were some mulatto ladies present as stylish as their white sisters or stepsisters  the most amiable of the human race is in great force at saratoga where the vast hotel service is wholly in its hands and it had honoured the effort of the comedians that night with a full house of their own complexion  we who were not of it showed strangely enough in the dark mass who let us lead the applause however as if doubtful themselves where it ought to come in and whom i found willing even to share some misplaced laughter of mine  they formed twothirds of the audience on the floor and they were a cloud in the gallery scarcely broken by a gleam of white  i entertained myself with them a good deal and i thought how much more delightful they were in their own kindly character than in their assumption of white character and i tried to define my suffering from the performance as an effect from my tormented sympathies rather than from my offended tastes  when the long stress was over and we rose and stood to let the crowd get out i asked miss gage if she did not think this must be the case  i do not suppose she was really much more experienced in the theatre than the people on the stage some of whom i doubted to have ever seen a play till they took part in east lynne  but i thought i would ask her that in order to hear what she would say and she said very simply that she had seen so few plays she did not know what to think of it and i could see that she was abashed by the fact  kendricks must have seen it too for he began at once to save her from herself with all his subtle generosity and to turn her shame to praise  my heart which remained sufficiently cold to her warmed more than ever to him and i should have liked to tell her that here was the finest and rarest human porcelain using itself like common clay in her behalf and to demand whether she thought she was worth it  i did not think she was and i had a lurid moment when i was tempted to push on and make her show herself somehow at her worst  we had undertaken a preposterous thing in befriending her as we had done and our course in bringing kendricks in was wholly unjustifiable how could i lead her on to some betrayal of her essential philistinism and make her so impossible in his eyes that even he with all his sweetness and goodness must take the first train from saratoga in the morning  we had of course joined the crowd in pushing forward people always do though they promise themselves to wait till the last one is out i got caught in a dark eddy on the first stairlanding but i could see them farther down and i knew they would wait for me outside the door  when i reached it at last they were nowhere to be seen i looked up this street and down that but they were not in sight    chapter xii    i did not afflict myself very much nor pretend to do so  they knew the way home and after i had blundered about in search of them through the lampshot darkness i settled myself to walk back at my leisure comfortably sure that i should find them on the verandah waiting for me when i reached the hotel  it was quite a thick night and i almost ran into a couple at a corner of our quieter street when i had got to it out of broadway  they seemed to be standing and looking about and when the man said he must have thought we took the first turn and the woman yes that must have been the way i recognised my estrays  i thought i would not discover myself to them but follow on and surprise them by arriving at our steps at the same moment they did and i prepared myself to hurry after them  but they seemed in no hurry and i had even some difficulty in accommodating my pace to the slowness of theirs  wont you take my arm miss gage he asked as they moved on  its so very dark she answered and i knew she had taken it  i can hardly see a step and poor mr march with his glassesi dont know what hell do  oh he only uses them to read with he can see as well as we can in the dark  hes very young in his feelings said the girl he puts me in mind of my own father  hes very young in his thoughts said kendricks and thats much more to the purpose for a magazine editor  there are very few men of his age who keep in touch with the times as he does  still mrs march seems a good deal younger dont you think  i wonder how soon they begin to feel old  oh not till along in the forties i should say  its a good deal in temperament  i dont suppose that either of them realises yet that theyre old and they must be nearly fifty  how strange it must be said the girl fifty years old  twenty seems old enough goodness knows  how should you like to be a dotard of twentyseven kendricks asked and she laughed at his joke  i dont suppose i should mind it so much if i were a man  i had promised myself that if the talk became at all confidential i would drop behind out of earshot but though it was curiously intimate for me to be put apart in the minds of these young people on account of my years as not of the same race or fate as themselves there was nothing in what they said that i might not innocently overhear as far as they were concerned and i listened on  but they had apparently given me quite enough attention  after some mutual laughter at what she said last they were silent a moment and then he said soberly theres something fine in this isolation the dark gives you isnt there  youre as remote in it from our own time and place as if you were wandering in interplanetary space  i suppose we are doing that all the timeon the earth she suggested  yes but how hard it is to realise that we are on the earth now sometimes i have a sense of it though when the moon breaks from one flying cloud to another  then it seems as if i were a passenger on some vast shapeless ship sailing through the air  what he asked with no relevancy that i could perceive was the strangest feeling you ever had  i remembered asking girls such questions when i was young and their not apparently thinking it at all odd  i dont know she returned thoughtfully  there was one time when i was little and it had sleeted and the sun came out just before it set and seemed to set all the woods on fire  i thought the world was burning up  it must have been very weird said kendricks and i thought oh good heavens  has he got to talking of weird things  its strange he added how we all have that belief when we are children that the world is going to burn up  i dont suppose any child escapes it  do you remember that poem of thompsonsthe city of dreadful night manwhere he describes the end of the world  no i never read it  well merely he says when the conflagration began the little flames looked like crocuses breaking through the sod  if it ever happened i fancy it would be quite as simple as that  but perhaps you dont like gloomy poetry  yes yes i do  its the only kind that i care about  then you hate funny poetry  i think its disgusting  papa is always cutting it out of the papers and wanting to send it to me and we have the greatest times  i suppose said kendricks it expresses some moods though  oh yes it expresses some moods and sometimes it makes me laugh in spite of myself and ashamed of anything serious  thats always the effect of a farce with me  but then im ashamed of being ashamed afterward said the girl i suppose you go to the theatre a great deal in new york  its a school of life said kendricks  i mean the audience  i would like to go to the opera once  i am going to make papa take me in the winter  she laughed with a gay sense of power and he said   you seem to be great friends with your father  yes were always together  i always went everywhere with him this is the first time ive been away without him  but i thought id come with mrs deering and see what saratoga was like i had never been here  and is it like what you thought  no  the first week we didnt do anything  then we got acquainted with mr and mrs march and i began to really see something  but i supposed it was all balls and gaiety  we must get up a few if youre so fond of them kendricks playfully suggested  oh i dont know as i am  i never went much at home  papa didnt care to have me  ah do you think it was right for him to keep you all to himself the girl did not answer and they had both halted so abruptly that i almost ran into them  i dont quite make out where we are kendricks seemed to be peering about  i plunged across the street lest he should ask me  i heard him add oh yes i know now and then they pressed forward  we were quite near our hotel but i thought it best to walk round the square and let them arrive first  on the way i amused myself thinking how different the girl had shown herself to him from what she had ever shown herself to my wife or me  she had really this plainminded goddess a vein of poetic feeling some inner beauty of soul answering to the outer beauty of body  she had a romantic attachment to her father and this shed a sort of light on both of them though i knew that it was not always a revelation of character    chapter xiii    when i reached the hotel i found miss gage at the door and kendricks coming out of the office toward her  oh here he is she called to him at sight of me  where in the world have you been he demanded  i had just found out from the clerk that you hadnt come in yet and i was going back for you with a searchlight  oh i wasnt so badly lost as all that i returned  i missed you in the crowd at the door but i knew youd get home somehow and so i came on without you  but my aged steps are not so quick as yours  the words mechanically uttered suggested something and i thought that if they were in for weirdness i would give them as much weirdness as they could ask for  when you get along toward fifty youll find that the foot youve still got out of the grave doesnt work so lively as it used  besides i was interested in the night effect  its so gloriously dark and i had a fine sense of isolation as i came along as if i were altogether out of my epoch and my environment  i felt as if the earth was a sort of flying dutchman and i was the only passenger  it was about the weirdest sensation i ever had  it reminded me i dont know how exactly of the feeling i had when i was young and i saw the sunset one evening through the woods after a sleetstorm  they stared at each other as i went on and i could see kendrickss fine eyes kindle with an imaginative appreciation of the literary quality of the coincidence  but when i added did you ever read a poem about the end of the world by that city of dreadful night man miss gage impulsively caught me by the coat lapel and shook me  ah it was you all the time  i knew there was somebody following us and i might have known who it was  we all gave way in a gale of laughter and sat down on the verandah and had our joke out in full recognition of the fact  when kendricks rose to go at last i said we wont say anything about this little incident to mrs march hey  and then they laughed again as if it were the finest wit in the world and miss gage bade me a joyful goodnight at the head of the stairs as she went off to her room and i to mine  i found mrs march waiting up with a book and as soon as i shut myself in with her she said awfully what were you laughing so about  laughing  did you hear me laughing  the whole house heard you im afraid  you certainly ought to have known better basil  it was very inconsiderate of you  and as i saw she was going on with more of that sort of thing to divert her thoughts from my crime i told her the whole story  it had quite the effect i intended up to a certain point  she even smiled a little as much as a woman could be expected to smile who was not originally in the joke  and they had got to comparing weird experiences she asked  yes the staleness of the thing almost made me sick  do you remember when we first compared our weird experiences  but i suppose they will go on doing it to the end of time and it will have as great a charm for the last man and woman as it had for adam and eve when they compared their weird experiences  and was that what you were laughing at  we were laughing at the wonderful case of telepathy i put up on them  mrs march faced her open book down on the table before her and looked at me with profound solemnity  well then i can tell you my dear it is no laughing matter  if they have got to the weird it is very serious and her talking to him about her family and his wanting to know about her father thats serious toofar more serious than either of them can understand  i dont like it basil we have got a terrible affair on our hands  terrible  yes terrible  as long as he was interested in her simply from a literary point of view though i didnt like that either i could put up with it but now that hes got to telling her about himself and exchanging weird experiences with her its another thing altogether  oh i never wanted kendricks brought into the affair at all  come now isabel  stick to the facts please  no matter  it was you that discovered the girl and then something had to be done  i was perfectly shocked when you told me that mr kendricks was in town because i saw at once that he would have to be got in for it and now we have to think what we shall do  couldnt we think better in the morning  no we must think at once  i shall not sleep tonight anyhow  my peace is gone  i shall have to watch them every instant  beginning at this instant  why not wait till you can see them  oh you cant joke it away my dear  if i find they are really interested in each other i shall have to speak  i am responsible  the young lady i said more to gain time than anything else seems quite capable of taking care of herself  that makes it all the worse  do you think i care for her only its kendricks too that i care for  i dont know that i care for her at all  oh then i think we may fairly leave kendricks to his own devices and im not alarmed for miss gage either though i do care for her a great deal  i dont understand how you can be so heartless about it basil said mrs march plaintively  she is a young girl and she has never seen anything of the world and of course if he keeps on paying her attention in this way she cant help thinking that he is interested in her  men never can see such things as women do  they think that until a man has actually asked a girl to marry him he hasnt done anything to warrant her in supposing that he is in love with her or that she has any right to be in love with him  that is true we cant imagine that she would be so indelicate  i see that youre determined to tease my dear said mrs march and she took up her book with an air of offence and dismissal  if you wont talk seriously i hope you will think seriously and try to realise what weve got in for  such a girl couldnt imagine that we had simply got mr kendricks to go about with her from a romantic wish to make her have a good time and that he was doing it to oblige us and wasnt at all interested in her  it does look a little preposterous even to the outsider i admitted  i am glad you are beginning to see it in that light my dear and if you can think of anything to do by morning i shall be humbly thankful  i dont expect to  perhaps i shall dream of something i said more lightly than i felt  how would it do for you to have a little talk with hera little motherly talkand hint round and warn her not to let her feelings run away with her in kendrickss direction  mrs march faced her book down in her lap and listened as if there might be some reason in the nonsense i was talking  you might say that he was a society man and was in great request and then intimate that there was a prior attachment or that he was the kind of man who would never marry but was really coldhearted with all his sweetness and merely had a passion for studying character  do you think that would do basil she asked  well i thought perhaps you might think so  im afraid it wouldnt she sighed  all that we can do now is to watch them and act promptly if we see that they are really in love either of them  i dont believe i said that i should know that they were in love even if i saw it  i have forgotten the outward signs if i ever knew them  should he give her flowers  hes done it from the start hes brought her boxes of huyler candy and lent her books but i dare say hes been merely complying with our wishes in doing it  i doubt if lovers sigh nowadays  i didnt sigh myself even in my time and i dont believe any passion could make kendricks neglect his dress  he keeps his eyes on her all the time but that may be merely an effort to divine her character  i dont believe i should know indeed i dont  i shall said mrs march    chapter xiv    we were to go the next day to the races and i woke with more anxiety about the weather than about the lovers or potential lovers  but after realising that the day was beautiful on that large scale of loveliness which seems characteristic of the summer days at saratoga where they have them almost the size of the summer days i knew when i was a boy i was sensible of a secondary worry in my mind which presently related itself to kendricks and miss gage it was a haze of trouble merely however such as burns off like a morning fog when the sun gets higher and it was chiefly on my wifes account  i suppose that the great difference between her conscience and one originating outside of new england if any conscience can originate outside of new england is that it cannot leave the moral government of the universe in the hands of divine providence  i was willing to leave so many things which i could not control to the deity who probably could that she accused me of fatalism and i was held to be little better than one of the wicked because i would not forecast the effects of what i did in the lives of others  i insisted that others were also probably in the hands of the somma sapienza e il primo amore and that i was so little aware of the influence of other lives upon my own even where there had been a direct and strenuous effort to affect me that i could not readily believe others had swerved from the line of their destiny because of me especially i protested that i could not hold myself guilty of misfortunes i had not intended even though my faulty conduct had caused them  as to this business of kendricks and miss gage i denied in the dispute i now began tacitly to hold with mrs marchs conscience that my conduct had been faulty  i said that there was no earthly harm in my having been interested by the girls forlornness when i first saw her that i did not do wrong to interest mrs march in her that she did not sin in going shopping with miss gage and mrs deering that we had not sinned either of us in rejoicing that kendricks had come to saratoga or in letting mrs deering go home to her sick husband and leave miss gage on our hands that we were not wicked in permitting the young fellow to help us make her have a good time  in this colloquy i did all the reasoning and mrs marchs conscience was completely silenced but it rose triumphant in my miserable soul when i met miss gage at breakfast looking radiantly happy and disposed to fellowship me in an unusual confidence because as i clearly perceived of our last nights adventure  i said to myself bitterly that happiness did not become her style and i hoped that she would get away with her confounded rapture before mrs march came down  i resolved not to tell mrs march if it fell out so but at the same time as a sort of atonement i decided to begin keeping the sharpest kind of watch upon miss gage for the outward signs and tokens of love  she said when you began to talk that way last night mr march it almost took my breath and if you hadnt gone so far and mentioned about the sunset through the sleety trees i never should have suspected you  ah thats the trouble with men miss gage  and when i said men i fancied she flushed a little  we never know when to stop we always overdo it if it were not for that we should be as perfect as women  perhaps youll give me another chance though  no we shall be on our guard after this  she corrected herself and said i shall always be looking out for you now and she certainly showed herself conscious in the bridling glance that met my keen gaze  good heavens i thought  has it really gone so far and more than ever i resolved not to tell mrs march  i went out to engage a carriage to take us to the races and to agree with the driver that he should wait for us at a certain corner some blocks distant from our hotel where we were to walk and find him  we always did this because there were a number of clergymen in our house and mrs march could not make it seem right to start for the races direct from the door though she held that it was perfectly right for us to go  for the same reason she made the driver stop short of our destination on our return and walked home the rest of the way  almost the first time we practised this deception i was met at the door by the sweetest and dearest of these old divines who said have you ever seen the races here  im told the spectacle is something very fine and i was obliged to own that i had once had a glimpse of them  but it was in vain that i pleaded this fact with mrs march she insisted that the appearance of not going to the races was something that we owed the cloth and no connivance on their part could dispense us from it  as i now went looking up and down the street for the driver who was usually on the watch for me about eleven oclock on a fair day of the races i turned over in my mind the several accidents which are employed in novels to bring young people to a realising sense of their feelings toward each other and wondered which of them i might most safely invoke  i was not anxious to have kendricks and miss gage lovers it would be altogether simpler for us if they were not but if they were the sooner they knew it and we knew it the better i thought of a carriage accident in which he should seize her and leap with her from the flying vehicle while the horses plunged madly on but i did not know what in this case would become of mrs march and me  besides i could think of nothing that would frighten our drivers horses and i dismissed the fleeting notion of getting any others because mrs march liked their being so safe and she had besides interested herself particularly in the driver who had a family and counted upon our custom  the poor fellow came in sight presently and smilingly made the usual arrangement with me and an hour later he delivered us all sound in wind and limb at the racecourse  i watched in vain for signs of uncommon tenderness in the two young people  if anything they were rather stiff and distant with each other and i asked myself whether this might not be from an access of consciousness  kendricks was particularly devoted to mrs march who in the airy detachment with which she responded to his attentions gave me the impression that she had absolutely dismissed her suspicions of the night before or else had heartlessly abandoned the affair to me altogether  if she had really done this then i saw no way out of it for me but by an accident which should reveal them to each other  perhaps some one might insult miss gage some ruffianand kendricks might strike the fellow but this seemed too squalid  there might be a terrible jam and he interpose his person between her and the danger of her being crushed to death or the floor of the grand stand might give way and everybody be precipitated into the space beneath and he fight his way with her senseless form on his arm over the bodies of the mangled and dying any of these things would have availed in a novel and something of the kind would have happened too  but to tell the truth nothing whatever happened and if it had not been for that anxiety on my mind i should have thought it much pleasanter so  even as it was i felt a measure of the hilarity which commonly fills me at a running race and i began to lose in the charm of the gay scene the sense of my responsibility and little by little to abate the vigilance apparently left all to me  the day was beautiful the long heat had burned itself out and there was a clear sparkle in the sunshine which seemed blown across the wide space within the loop of the track by the delicate breeze  a vague remote smell of horses haunted the air with now and then a breath of the pines from the grove shutting the raceground from the highway  we got excellent places as one always may the grand stand is so vast and the young people disposed themselves on the bench in front of us but so near that we were not tempted to talk them over  the newsboys came round with papers and the boys who sold programmes of the races from the bar below there appeared from time to time shining negroes in white linen jackets with trays bearing tall glasses of lemonade and straws tilted in the glasses  bookmakers from the poolrooms took the bets of the ladies who formed by far the greater part of the spectators on the grand stand and contributed with their summer hats and gowns to the gaiety of the ensemble  they were of all types city and country both and of the southern dark as well as the northern fair complexion with so thick a sprinkling of south americans that the spanish gutturals made themselves almost as much heard as the yankee nasals  among them moved two nuns of some mendicant order receiving charity from the fair gamblers who gave for luck without distinction of race or religion  i leaned forward and called kendrickss attention to the nuns and to the admirable literary quality of the whole situation  he was talking to miss gage and he said as impatiently as he ever suffered himself to speak yes yes tremendously picturesque  you ought to get something out of it my dear fellow  dont you feel copy in it  oh splendid of course but its your ground mr march  i shouldnt feel it right to do anything with saratoga after you had discovered it and he turned eagerly again to miss gage  my wife put her hand on my sleeve and frowned and i had so far lost myself in my appreciation of the scene that i was going to ask her what the matter was when a general sensation about me made me look at the track where the horses for the first race had already appeared with their jockeys in vivid silk jackets of various dyes they began to form for the start with the usual tricks and feints till i became very indignant with them though i had no bets pending and did not care in the least which horse won  what i wanted was to see the race the flight and all this miserable manoeuvring was retarding it  now and then a jockey rode his horse far off on the track and came back between the false starts now and then one kept stubbornly behind the rest and would not start with them  how their several schemes and ambitions were finally reconciled i never could tell but at last the starters flag swept down and they were really off  everybody could have seen perfectly well as they sat but everybody rose and watched the swift swoop of the horses bunched together in the distance and scarcely distinguishable by the colours of their riders  the supreme moment came for me when they were exactly opposite the grand stand full half a mile awaythe moment that i remembered from year to year as one of exquisite illusionfor then the horses seemed to lift from the earth as with wings and to skim over the track like a covey of lowflying birds  the finish was tame to this  mrs march and i had our wonted difference of opinion as to which horse had won and we were rather uncommonly controversial because we had both decided upon the same horse as we found only she was talking of the jockeys colours and i was talking of the horses  we appealed to kendricks who said that another horse altogether had won the race and this compromise pacified us  we were all on foot and he suggested we could see better couldnt we if we went farther down in front  and mrs march answered   no we prefer to stay here but you two can go  and when they had promptly availed themselves of her leave she said to me this is killing me dead basil and if it keeps up much longer i dont believe i can live through it  i dont care now and i believe i shall throw them together all i can from this out  the quicker they decide whether theyre in love or not the better  i have some rights too  her whirling words expressed the feeling in my own mind  i had the same sense of being trifled with by these young people who would not behave so conclusively toward each other as to justify our interference on the ground that they were in love nor yet treat each other so indifferently as to relieve us of the strain of apprehension  i had lost all faith in accident by this time and i was quite willing to leave them to their own devices i was so desperate that i said i hoped they would get lost from us as they had from me the night before and never come back but just keep on wandering round for ever  all sorts of vengeful thoughts went through my mind as i saw them leaning toward each other to say something and then drawing apart to laugh in what seemed an indefinite comradery instead of an irrepressible passion  did they think we were going to let this sort of thing go on  what did they suppose our nerves were made of  had they no mercy no consideration  it was quite like the selfishness of youth to wish to continue in that fools paradise but they would find out that middle age had its rights too  i felt capable of asking them bluntly what they meant by it  but when they docilely rejoined us at the end of the races hurrying up with some joke about not letting me get lost this time and miss gage put herself at my wifes side and kendricks dropped into step with me all i had been thinking seemed absurd  they were just two young people who were enjoying a holidaytime together and we were in no wise culpable concerning them  i suggested this to mrs march when we got home and in the need of some relief from the tension she had been in she was fain to accept the theory provisionally though i knew that her later rejection of it would be all the more violent for this respite    chapter xv    there was to be a hop at the grand union that night and i had got tickets for it in virtue of my relation to every other week  i must say the clerk who gave them me was very civil about it he said they were really only for the hotel guests but he was glad to give them to outsiders who applied with proper credentials and he even offered me more tickets than i asked for  miss gage was getting a dress for the hop and it was to be finished that day  i think women really like the scare of thinking their dresses will not be done for a given occasion and so arrange to have them at the last moment  mrs march went with the girl early in the afternoon to have it tried on for the last time and they came home reporting that it was a poem  my wife confided to me that it was not half donemerely begun in factand would never be finished in time in the world  she also assured miss gage that she need not be the least uneasy that there was not an hours work on the dress and that the dressmakers reputation was at stake and she would not dare to fail her  i knew she was perfectly sincere in both these declarations which were indeed merely the expression of two mental attitudes and had no relation to the facts  she added to me that she was completely worn out with anxiety and worry and i must not think of her going to the hop  i would have to do the chaperoning for her and she did hope that i would not forget what i was sent for or get talking with somebody and leave miss gage altogether to kendricks  she said that quite likely there might be friends or acquaintances of his at the hopsuch a large affairwhom he would want to show some attention and i must take charge of miss gage myself and try to find her other partners  she drilled me in the duties of my position until i believed that i was letterperfect and then she said that she supposed i would commit some terrible blunder that would ruin everything  i thought that this was very likely too but i would not admit it  the dress came home at nine oclock and operated a happy diversion from my imaginable shortcomings for it appeared from mrs marchs asides to me that it was a perfect horror in the set and that everybody could see that it had been simply slung together at the last moment and she would never as long as the world stood go to that woman for anything again  i must say i could not myself see anything wrong about the dress  i thought it exquisite in tint and texture a delicate palegreenish film that clung and floated and set off the girls beauty as the leafage of a flower heightens the loveliness of a flower  i did not dare to say this in the face of mrs marchs private despair and i was silent while the girl submitted to be twirled about for my inspection like a statue on a revolving pedestal  kendricks however had no such restrictions upon him and i could see him start with delight in the splendid vision before he spoke  isnt it a poem demanded mrs march  isnt it a perfect lyric  why should you have allowed her to be transported altogether into the ideal  wasnt she far enough from us before he asked and i found myself wishing that he would be either less or more articulate  he ought to have been mute with passion or else he ought to have been frankly voluble about the girls gown and gone on about it longer  but he simply left the matter there and though i kept him carefully under my eye i could not see that he was concealing any further emotion  she on her part neither blushed nor frowned at his compliment she did nothing by look or gesture to provoke more praise she took it very much as the beautiful evening might so undeniably fine so perfect in its way  she and the evening were equally fitted for the event to which they seemed equally dedicated  the dancing was to be out of doors on a vast planking or platform set up in the heart of that bosky court which the hotel incloses  around this platform drooped the slim tall saratogan trees and over it hung the saratogan sky of a nocturnal blue very rare in our latitude with the stars faint in its depths and by and by a white moon that permitted itself a modest competition with the electric lights effulgent everywhere there was a great crowd of people in the portico the vestibule and the inner piazzas and on the lawn around the platform where the trodden weed sent up the sweet scent of bruised grass in the cool night air  my foolish old heart bounded with a pulse of youth at the thought of all the gay and tender possibilities of such a scene  but the young people under my care seemed in no haste to mingle in it  we oldsters are always fancying youth impatient but there is no time of life which has so much patience  it behaves as if it had eternity before itan eternity of youthinstead of a few days and years and then the frosty poll  we who are young no longer think we would do so and so if we were young as women think they would do so and so if they were men but if we were really young again we should not do at all what we think  we should not hurry to experience our emotions we should not press forward to discharge our duties or repair our mistakes we should not seize the occasion to make a friend or reconcile an enemy we should let weeks and months go by in the realisation of a passion and trust all sorts of contingencies and accidents to help us out with its confession  the thoughts of youth are very long and its conclusions are deliberate and delayed and often withheld altogether  it is age which is tremulously eager in these matters and cannot wait with the fine patience of nature in her growing moods  as soon even as i was in the hotel i was impatient to press through to the place where the dancing was and where i already heard the band playing  i knew very well that when we got there i should have to sit down somewhere on the edge of the platform with the other frumps and fogies and begin taking cold in my dresscoat and want to doze off without being able to while my young people were waltzing together or else promenading up and down ignoring me or recognising me by the offer of a fan and the question whether i was not simply melting i have seen how the poor chaperon fares at such times  but they secure of their fun were by no means desirous to have it over or even to have it begin  they dawdled through the thronged hotel office where other irresponsible pairs were coming and going under the admiring eyes of the hotel loungers and they wandered up and down the waste parlours and sat on tetea tetes just to try them apparently and miss gage verified in the mirrors the beauty which was reflected in all eyes  they amused themselves with the extent of the richlycarpeted and upholstered desolation around them where only a few lonely and aging women lurked about on sofas and ottomans and they fell to playing with their compassion for the plebeian spectators at the long verandah windows trying to penetrate with their forbidden eyes to the hop going on in the court far beyond the intermediary desert of the parlours  when they signified at last that they were ready for me to lead them on to the dance i would so much rather have gone to bed that there are no words for the comparison  then when we got to the place which i should never have been able to reach in the world if it had not been for the young energy and inspiration of kendricks and they had put me in a certain seat with miss gages wraps beside me where they could find me they went off and danced for hours and hours for hours and hours  for ages and ages while i withered away amid mouldering mothers and saw my charges through the dreadful half dreams of such a state whirling in the waltz hopping in the polka sliding in the galop and then endlessly walking up and down between the dances and eating and drinking the chill refreshments that it made my teeth chatter to think of  i suppose they decently came to me from time to time though they seemed to be always dancing for i could afterward remember miss gage taking a wrap from me now and then and quickly coming back to shed it upon my lap again  i got so chilled that if they had not been unmistakably womens wraps i should have bundled them all about my shoulders which i could almost hear creak with rheumatism  i must have fallen into a sort of drowse at last for i was having a dispute with some sort of authority which turned out to be mrs march and upbraiding her with the fact that there were no womens wraps which would also do for a man when the young people stood arm in arm before me and miss gage said that she was tired to death now and they were going  but it appeared that they were only going as far as the parlours for the present for when they reentered the hotel they turned into them and sat down there quite as if that had been the understanding  when i arrived with the wraps i was reminded of something and i said have you two been dancing together the whole evening  they looked at each other as if for the first time they now realised the fact and kendricks said why of course we have  we didnt know anybody  very well then i said you have got me into a scrape  oh poor mr march cried the girl  how have we done it  why mrs march said that mr kendricks would be sure to know numbers of people and i must get you other partners for it wouldnt do for you to dance the whole evening together  she threw herself back in the chair she had taken and laughed as if this were the best joke in the world  he said hardily you see it has done  and if it wouldnt do she gasped why didnt you bring me the other partners  because i didnt know any i said and this seemed to amuse them both so much that i was afraid they would never get their breath  she looked by and by at her dancingcard and as soon as she could wipe the tears from her eyes she said no there is no other name there and this seemed even a better joke than the other from the way they joined in laughing at it  well now i said when they were quiet again this wont do my young friends  its all very well for you and you seem to like it but i am responsible for your having passed a proper evening under my chaperonage and something has got to be done to prove it  they saw the reasonableness of this and they immediately became sober kendricks i asked cant you think of something  no he said he couldnt and then he began to laugh again  i applied to her in the same terms but she only answered oh dont ask me and she went off laughing too  very well then i said i shall have to do something desperate and i shall expect you both to bear me out in it and i dont want any miserable subterfuges when it comes to the point with mrs march  will you let me have your dancingcard miss gage  she detached it and handed it to me  its very fortunate that mr kendricks wrote his name for the first dance only and didnt go on and fill it up  why we didnt think it was worth while she innocently explained  and thats what makes it so perfectly providential as mrs march says  now then i went on as i wrote in the name of a rising young politician who happened just then to have been announced as arriving in saratoga to join some other leaders in arranging the slate of his party for the convention to meet a month later we will begin with a good american  i handed the card to kendricks  do you happen to remember the name of the young french nobleman who danced the third dance with miss gage  no he said but i think i could invent it  and he dashed down an extremely probable marquis while miss gage clapped her hands for joy  oh how glorious how splendid  i asked will you ever give me away the longest day you live  never she promised and i added the name of a south american doctor one of those doctors who seem to be always becoming the presidents of their republics and ordering all their patients of opposite politics to be shot in the plaza  kendricks entered a younger son of an english duke and i contributed the hyphenated surname of a new york swell and between us we soon had all the dances on miss gages card taken by the most distinguished people  we really studied probability in the forgery and we were proud of the air of reality it wore in the carefully differenced handwritings with national traits nicely accented in each    chapter xvi    the fun of it all was that mrs march was not deceived for an instant  oh nonsense she said when she glanced at our pretty deception which we presented with perhaps too perfect seriousness then you danced only the first dance  no no miss gage protested  i danced every dance as long as i stayed  she laughed with her handkerchief to her mouth and her eyes shining above  yes i can testify to that mrs march said kendricks and he laughed wildly too  i must say their laughter throughout was far beyond the mirthfulness of the facts  they both protested that they had had the best time in the world and the gayest time that i had been a mirror of chaperons and followed them round with my eyes wherever they went like a family portrait and that they were the most exemplary young couple at the hop in their behaviour  mrs march asked them all about it and she joined in their fun with a hilarity which i knew from long experience boded me no good  when kendricks had gone away and miss gage had left us for the night with an embrace whose fondness i wondered at from mrs march an awful silence fell upon us in the deserted parlour where she had waited up  i knew that when she broke the silence she would begin with well my dear and this was what she did  she added i hope youre convinced now  i did not even pretend not to understand  you mean that they are in love  i suppose that their weing and using so much would indicate something of the kind  it isnt that alone everything indicates it  she would hardly let go of him with her eyes  i wish sighed mrs march and she let her head droop upon her hand a moment i could be as sure of him as i am of her  wouldnt that double the difficulty i ventured to suggest though till she spoke i had not doubted that it was the case  i should make you speak to him if i were sure of him but as it is i shall speak to her and the sooner the better  tonight i quaked  no i shall let the poor thing have her sleep tonight  but the first thing in the morning i shall speak and i want you to send her up to me as soon as shes had her breakfast  tell her im not well and shall not be down i shall not close my eyes the whole night and now she added i want you to tell me everything that happened this evening  dont omit a word or a look or a motion  i wish to proceed intelligently  i hope i was accurate in the history of the hop which i gave mrs march i am sure i was full  i think my account may be justly described as having a creative truthfulness if no other merit  i had really no wish to conceal anything except the fact that i had not in my utter helplessness even tried to get miss gage any other partners  but in the larger interest of the present situation mrs march seemed to have lost the sense of my dereliction in this respect  she merely asked and it was after you went back to the parlour just before you came home that you wrote those names on her card  kendricks wrote half of them i said  i dare say  well it was very amusing and if the circumstances were different i could have entered into the spirit of it too  but you see yourself basil that we cant let this affair go any further without dealing frankly with her  you cant speak to her and i must  dont you see  i said that i saw but i had suddenly a wild wish that it were practicable for me to speak to miss gage  i should have liked to have a peep into a girls heart at just such a moment when it must be quivering with the unconfessed sense of love and the confident hope of being loved but while as yet nothing was assured nothing was ascertained  if it would not have been shocking if it would not have been sacrilegious it would have been infinitely interesting and from an aesthetic point of view infinitely important  i thought that i should have been willing to undergo all the embarrassment of such an inquiry for the sake of its precious results if it had been at all possible but i acquiesced that it would not be possible  i felt that i was getting off pretty lightly not to have it brought home to me again that i was the cause of all this trouble and that if it had not been for me there would have been as far as mrs march was concerned no miss gage and no love affair of hers to deal with  i debated in my mind a moment whether i had better urge her to let me speak to kendricks after all but i forbore and in the morning i waited about in much perturbation after i had sent miss gage to her until i could know the result of their interview  when i saw the girl come away from her room which she did rather trippingly i went to her and found her by no means the wreck i had expected the ordeal to leave her  did you meet miss gage she asked  yes i returned with tremulous expectation  well dont you think she looks perfectly divine in that gown its one of mme codys and we got it for thirty dollars  it would have been fifty in new york and it was here earlier in the season  i shall always come here for some of my things as soon as the seasons a little past they simply fling them away  well my dear  well what  i didnt speak to her after all  you didnt  dont you think shes in love with him then  dead  well  well i couldnt somehow seem to approach the subject as i had expected to  she was so happy and so good and so perfectly obedient that i couldnt get anything to take hold of  you see i didnt know but she might be a little rebellious or resentful of my interference but in the little gingerly attempts i did make she was so submissive dont you understand  and she was very modest about mr kendricks attentions and so selfdepreciatory that well  look here isabel i broke in this is pretty shameless of you you pretend to be in the greatest kind of fidge about this girl and you make me lie awake all night thinking what youre going to say to her and now you as much as tell me you were so fascinated with the modest way she was in love that you couldnt say anything to her against being in love on our hands in any sort of way  do you call this business  well i dont care if i did encourage her  oh you even encouraged her  i didnt encourage her  i merely praised mr kendricks and said how much you thought of him as a writer  oh then you gave the subject a literary cast  i see  do you think miss gage was able to follow you  that doesnt matter  and what do you propose to do now  i propose to do nothing  i think that i have done all my duty requires and that now i can leave the whole affair to you  it was your affair in the beginning  i dont see why i should worry myself about it  it seems to me that this is a very strange position for a lady to take who was not going to close an eye last night in view of a situation which has not changed in the least except for the worse dont you think you are rather culpably lighthearted all of a sudden  i am lighthearted but if there is any culpability it is yours basil  i reflected but i failed to find any novelty in the fact  very well then what do you propose that i should do  i leave that entirely to your own conscience  and if my conscience has no suggestion to make  thats your affair  i reflected again and then i said more than anything to make her uncomfortable im afraid  i feel perfectly easy in my conscience personally but i have a social duty in the matter and i hope i shall perform it with more fidelity and courage than you have shown i shall speak to kendricks  she said  that is just what you ought to do  im quite surprised  after this touch of irony she added earnestly and i do hope my dear you will use judgment in speaking to him and tact  you mustnt go at it bluntly  remember that mr kendricks is not at all to blame  he began to show her attention to oblige us and if she has fallen in love with him it is our fault  i shall handle him without gloves i said  i shall tell him he had better go away  i was joking but she said seriously yes he must go away  and i dont envy you having to tell him  i suppose you will bungle it of course  well then you must advise me i said and we really began to consider the question  we could hardly exaggerate the difficulty and delicacy of the duty before me  we recognised that before i made any explicit demand of him i must first ascertain the nature of the whole ground and then be governed by the facts  it would be simple enough if i had merely to say that we thought the girls affections were becoming engaged and then appeal to his eager generosity his delicate magnanimity but there were possible complications on his side which must be regarded  i was to ascertain we concluded the exact nature of the situation before i ventured to say anything openly  i was to make my approaches by a series of ambushes before i unmasked my purpose and perhaps i must not unmask it at all  as i set off on my mission which must begin with finding kendricks at his hotel mrs march said she pitied me she called me back to ask whether i thought i had really better do anything  then as i showed signs of weakening she drove me from her with yes yes  you must  you must    chapter xvii    it was still so early that i had my doubts whether i should find kendricks up after the last nights revelry but he met me halfway between our hotel and his  he said he was coming to see how mrs march was bearing miss gages immense success at the ball but perhaps this was not his sole motive  he asked frankly how the young lady was and whether i thought mrs march would consider a lunch at a restaurant by the lake a good notion  when i said i had very little doubt she would and proposed taking a turn in the park before i went back with him he looked at his watch and laughed and said he supposed it was rather early yet and came very willingly with me  we had the pretty place almost to ourselves at that hour  there were a halfdozen or so nursemaids pushing their perambulators about or standing the vehicles across the walk in front of the benches where they sat in the simple belief of all people who have to do with babies that the rest of the world may be fitly discommoded in their behalf  but they did not actively molest us and they scarcely circumscribed our choice of seats  we were by no means driven to the little kiosk in the lake for them and i should rather say that we were fatefully led there so apt were the associations of the place to my purpose  nothing could have been more natural than that i should say as we sat down there this was where i first saw miss gage with her friends and it was by a perfectly natural transition that i should go on to speak in a semihumorous strain of the responsibility which mrs march and myself had incurred by letting our sympathy for her run away with us  i said i supposed that if we had not been willing from the first to try to realise for her some of the expectations we imagined she had in coming to saratoga she never would have fallen to our charge that people really brought a great many more things upon themselves than they were willing to own and that fate was perhaps more the fulfilment of our tacit ambitions than our overt acts this bit of philosophy which i confess i thought fine did not seem to impress kendricks  he merely said that it must be great fun to have the chance of baffling the malice of circumstance in a case like that and i perceived that he felt nothing complex in the situation  in fact i doubt whether youth perceives anything complex in life  to the young life is a very plain case  to be sure they are much more alarmed than their elders at getting tangled up in its web at times but that is because they have not had our experience in getting untangled and think they are never going to get out alive  when they do they think that it is the only tangle they are ever going to be in and do not know that they are simply going on from one to another as long as there is enough of them left to be caught in a mesh  to kendricks we marches were simply two amiable people who had fancied doing a pleasant thing for a beautiful girl that accident had thrown it in our power to befriend and were by no means the trembling arbiters of her destiny we felt ourselves to be  the difference between his objective sense and my subjective sense was the difference between his twentyseven years and my fiftytwo and while this remained i saw that it would be useless to try to get on common ground with him or to give him our point of view  if i were to speak to him at all it must be with authority with the right of one who stood in the place of the girls parents and had her happiness at heart  that is it was something like that but my words say it too bluntly  i found myself beginning i have rather had a notion that her father might come on and take the enterprise off our hands though to tell the truth i had never imagined such a thing which came into my head at that moment through an association with the thought of parents  have you any idea what sort of man he is asked kendricks  oh some little local magnate president of the village and president of the village bank i fancy the chief figure in the place but probably as ignorant of our world as a cherokee  well i dont know said the young fellow  do you think that follows because he doesnt live in it  i could see that he did not quite like what i had said  i suppose ours is rather a small world  the smallest of all worlds i answered  and in the eyes of papa gage if they could once be focused upon it our world would shrivel to an atom  do you think he asked with a manifest anxiety that it would in hers  no she is not the american people and her father is as i fancy him  i make out from the vague hints that brother deering as fulkerson would call him dropped when he talked about him that papa gage is a shrewd practical homekeeping business man with an eye single to the main chance lavish but not generous philistine to the backbone blindly devoted to his daughter and contemptuous of all the myriad mysteries of civilisation that he doesnt understand i dont know why i should be authorised to imagine him personally long and lank with possibly a tobacco habit of some sort  his natural history upon no better authority is that of a hardheaded farmer who found out that farming could never be more than a livelihood and came into the village and began to lend money and get gain till he was in a position to help found the de witt point national bank and then by weight of his moneyed solidity imposed himself upon the free and independent voters of the villagea majority of them under mortgage to himand became its president it isnt a pleasant type but its ideally american  yes said kendricks ruefully  but his daughter i continued is probably altogether different there is something fine about herreally fine  our world wouldnt shrivel in her eye it would probably swell up and fill the universe i added by an impulse that came from nowhere irresistibly upon me  that is if she could see you in it  what do you mean he asked with a start  oh now i must tell you what i mean i said desperately  its you that have complicated this case so dreadfully for us  cant you think why  no i cant he said but he had to say that  his fine sensitive face flamed at once so firered that it could only turn pale for a change when i plunged on  im afraid weve trifled with her happiness and this formulation of the case disgusted me so much that i laughed wildly and added unless weve trifled with yours too  i dont know why you call it trifling with happiness he returned with dignity but without offence  if you will leave her out of the question i will say that you have given me the greatest happiness of my life in introducing me to miss gage  now i demanded may i ask what you mean  you know i wouldnt if i didnt feel bound for her sake and if you hadnt said just what you have said  you neednt answer me unless you like  its pleasant to know that youve not been bored and mrs march and i are infinitely obliged to you for helping us out  kendricks made as if he were going to say something and then he did not  he hung his head lower and lower in the silence which i had to break for himi hope i havent been intrusive my dear fellow this is something i felt bound to speak of  you know we couldnt let it go on  mrs march and i have blamed ourselves a good deal and we couldnt let it go on  but im afraid i havent been as delicate with you  oh delicate  he lifted his head and flashed a face of generous selfreproach upon me  its i that havent been delicate with you  ive been monstrously indelicate  but i never meant to be andandi was coming to see you just now when we metto see you miss gageand ask hertell her that weimust tell you and mrs marchmr march  at the hop last night i asked her to be my wife and as soon as she can hear from her fatherbut the first thing when i woke this morning i saw that i must tell mrs march and you and youyou must forgive usor me rather for it was my fault for not telling you last nightat onceoh thank you thank you  i had seized his hand and was wringing it vehemently in expression of my pleasure in what he had told me  in that first moment i felt nothing but pure joy and an immeasurable relief  i drew my breath a very deep and full one in a sudden absolute freedom from anxieties which had been none the less real and constant because so often burlesqued  afterward considerations presented themselves to alloy my rapture but for that moment as i say it was nothing but rapture  there was no question in it of the lovers fitness for each other of their acceptability to their respective families of their general conduct or of their especial behaviour toward us all that i could realise was that it was a great escape for both of us and a great triumph for me  i had been afraid that i should not have the courage to speak to kendricks of the matter at all much less ask him to go away and here i had actually spoken to him with the splendid result that i need only congratulate him on his engagement to the lady whose unrequited affections i had been wishing him to spare  i dont remember just the terms i used in doing this but they seemed satisfactory to kendricks probably a repetition of the letters of the alphabet would have been equally acceptable  at last i said well now i must go and tell the great news to mrs march and i shook hands with him again we had been shaking hands at halfminutely intervals ever since the first time    chapter xviii    i saw mrs march waiting for me on the hotel verandah  she wore her bonnet and she warned me not to approach and then ran down to meet me  well my dear she said as she pushed her hand through my arm and began to propel me away from the sight and hearing of people on the piazza i hope you didnt make a fool of yourself with kendricks theyre engaged  she apparently expected me to be prostrated by this stroke  yes i said very coolly i was just coming to tell you  how did you know it  who told you  did kendricks  i dont believe it she cried in an excitement not unmixed with resentment  no one told me i said  i simply divined it  she didnt mind that for a moment  well im glad he had the grace to do so and i hope he did it before you asked him any leading questions  without waiting to hear whether this was so or not she went on with an emphasis on the next word that almost blotted it out of the language she came back to me almost the instant you were gone and told me everything  she said she wanted to tell me last night but she hadnt the courage and this morning when she saw that i was beginning to hint up to mr kendricks a little she hadnt the courage at all  i sent her straight off to telegraph for her father  she is behaving splendidly  and now what are we going to do  what the rest of the world isnothing  it seems to me that we are out of the story my dear  at any rate i shant attempt to compete with miss gage in splendid behaviour and i hope you wont  it would be so easy for us  i wonder what papa gage is going to be like  i felt my thrill of apprehension impart itself to her  yes she gasped what if he shouldnt like it  well then thats his affair  but i did not feel so lightly about it as i spoke and from time to time during the day i was overtaken with a cold dismay at the thought of the unknown quantity in the problem  when we returned to the hotel after a tour of the block we saw kendricks in our corner of the verandah with miss gage  they were both laughing convulsively and they ran down to meet us in yet wilder throes of merriment  weve just been comparing notes he said and at the very moment when i was telling you mr march julia was telling mrs march  wonderful case of telepathy i mocked  give it to the psychical research  they both seemed a little daunted and miss gage said i know mr march doesnt like the way weve done  like it cried mrs march contriving to shake me a little with the hand she still had in my arm  of course he likes it  he was just saying you had behaved splendidly  he said he wouldnt attempt to compete with you  but you mustnt regard him in the least  i admired the skill with which isabel saved her conscience in this statement too much to dispute it and i suppose that whatever she had said miss gage would have been reassured  i cannot particularly praise the wisdom of her behaviour during that day or for the matter of that the behaviour of kendricks either  the ideal thing would have been for him to keep away now till her father came but it seemed to me that he was about under our feet all the while and that she so far from making him remain at his own hotel encouraged him to pass the time at ours  without consulting me mrs march asked him to stay to dinner after he had stayed all the forenoon and he made this a pretext for spending the afternoon in our corner of the verandah  she made me give it up to him and miss gage so that they could be alone together though i must say they did not seem to mind us a great deal when we were present he was always leaning on the back of her chair or sitting next her with his hand dangling over it in a manner that made me sick  i wondered if i was ever such an ass as that and i quite lost the respect for kendrickss good sense and good taste which had been the ground of my liking for him  i felt myself withdrawn from the affair farther and farther in sympathy since it had now passed beyond my control and i resented the strain of the responsibility which i had thrown off i found only for a moment and must continue to suffer until the girls father appeared and finally relieved me  the worst was that i had to bear it alone  it was impossible to detach mrs marchs interest from miss gage as a girl who had been made love to long enough to enable her to realise her as a daughter with filial ties and duties she did try in a perfunctory way to do it but i could see that she never gave her mind to it  i could not even make her share my sense of my own culpability a thing she was only too willing to do in most matters  she admitted that it was absurd for me to have let my fancy play about the girl when i first saw her until we felt that i must do something for her but i could not get her to own that we had both acted preposterously in letting mrs deering leave miss gage in our charge  in the first place she denied that she had been left in our charge  she had simply been left in the hotel where we were staying and we should have been perfectly free to do nothing for her  but when kendricks turned up so unexpectedly it was quite natural we should ask him to be polite to her  mrs march saw nothing strange in all that  what was i worrying about  what she had been afraid of was that he had not been in love with the girl when she was so clearly in love with him  but now  and suppose her father doesnt like it  not like mr kendricks  she stared at me and i could see how infatuated she was  i was myself always charmed with the young fellow  he was not only good and generous and handsome and cleveri never thought him a firstclass talentbut he was beautifully well bred and he was very well born as those things go with us  that is he came of people who had not done much of anything for a generation and had acquired merit with themselves for it  they were not very rich but they had a right to think that he might have done nothing or done something better than literature and i wish i could set forth exactly the terms tacit and explicit in which his mother and sisters condoned his dereliction to me at a reception where he presented me to them  in virtue of his wish to do something he had become a human being and they could not quite follow him but they were very polite in tolerating me and trying to make me feel that i was not at all odd though he was so queer in being proud of writing for my paper as they called it  he was so unlike them all that i liked him more than ever after meeting them  still i could imagine a fond father as i imagined miss gages father to be objecting to him on some grounds at least till he knew him and mrs march apparently could not imagine even this  i do not know why i should have prefigured miss gages father as tall and lank  she was not herself so very tall though she was rather tall than short and though she was rather of the diana or girlish type of goddess she was by no means lank  yet it was in this shape that i had always thought of him perhaps through an obscure association with his fellowvillager deering  i had fancied him saturnine of spirit slovenly of dress and lounging of habit upon no authority that i could allege and i was wholly unprepared for the neat small figure of a man very precise of manner and scrupulous of aspect who said how do you do sir  i hope i see you well sir when his daughter presented us to each other the morning after the eventful day described and he shook my hand with his very small dry hand  i could not make out from their manner with each other whether they had been speaking of the great matter in hand or not  i am rather at a loss about people of that philistine make as to what their procedure will be in circumstances where i know just what people of my own sort of sophistication would do  these would come straight at the trouble but i fancy that with the other sort the convention is a preliminary reserve  i found mr gage disposed to prolong with me at least a discussion of the weather and the aspects of saratoga the events of his journey from de witt point and the hardship of having to ride all the way to mooers junction in a stagecoach  i felt more and more while we bandied these futilities as if mr gage had an overdue note of mine and was waiting for me since i could not pay it to make some proposition toward its renewal and he did really tire me out at last so that i said well mr gage i suppose miss gage has told you something of the tremendous situation that has developed itself here  i thought i had better give the affair such smiling character as a jocose treatment might impart and the dry little man twinkled up responsively so far as manner was concerned  well yes yes there has been some talk of it between us and again he left the word to me  mrs march urged your daughter to send for you at once because that was the right and fit thing to do and because we felt that the affair had now quite transcended our powers such as they were and nobody could really cope with it but yourself  i hope you were not unduly alarmed by the summons  not at all  she said in the despatch that she was not sick  i had been anticipating a short visit to saratoga for some days and my business was in a shape so that i could leave  oh i said vaguely i am very glad  mrs march felt as i did that circumstances had given us a certain obligation in regard to miss gage and we were anxious to discharge it faithfully and to the utmost  we should have written to you summoned you before if we could have supposedor been sure but you know these things go on so obscurely and we acted at the very first possible moment  i wish you to understand that  we talked it over a great deal and i hope you will believe that we studied throughoutthat we were most solicitous from beginning to end for miss gages happiness and that if we could have foreseen or imaginedif we could have taken any stepsi trust you will believe  i was furious at myself for being so confoundedly apologetic for i was thinking all the time of the bother and affliction we had had with the girl and there sat that little wooden image accepting my selfinculpations and apparently demanding more of me but i could not help going on in the same strain  we felt especially bound in the matter from the fact that mr kendricks was a personal friend of ours whom we are very fond of and we both are very anxious that you should not suppose that we promoted or that we were not most vigilantthat we were for a moment forgetful of your rights in such an affair  i stopped and mr gage passed his hand across his little meagre smiling mouth  then he is not a connection of yours mr march  bless me no i said in great relief we are not so swell as that  and i tried to give him some notion of kendrickss local quality repeating a list of agglutinated new york surnames to which his was more or less affiliated  they always amuse me those names which more than any in the world give the notion of social straining but i doubt if they affected the imagination of mr gage either in this way or in the way i meanly meant them to affect him  and what did you say his business was he asked with that implication of a previous statement on your part which some people think it so clever to make when they question you  i always hate it and i avenged myself by answering simply bless my soul he has no business and letting him take up the word now or not as he liked  then he is a man of independent means  i could not resist answering independent means  kendricks has no means whatever  but having dealt this blow i could add i believe his mother has some money  they are people who live comfortably  then he has no profession asked mr gage with a little more stringency in his smile  i dont know whether you will call it a profession  he is a writer  ah mr gage softly breathed  does he write for yourpaper  i noted that as to the literary technicalities he seemed not to be much more ignorant than kendrickss own family and i said tolerantly yes he writes for our magazine  magazineyes i beg your pardon he interrupted  and for any others where he can place his material  this apparently did not convey any very luminous idea to mr gages mind and he asked after a moment what kind of things does he write  oh stories sketches poems reviews essaysalmost anything in fact  the light left his face and i perceived that i had carried my revenge too far at least for kendrickss advantage and i determined to take a new departure at the first chance  the chance did not come immediately  and can a man support a wife by that kind of writing asked mr gage  i laughed uneasily  some people do  it depends upon how much of it he can sell  it depends upon how handsomely a wife wishes to be supported  the result isnt usually beyond the dreams of avarice i said with a desperate levity  excuse me returned the little man  do you live in that way  by your writings  no i said with some state which i tried to subdue i am the editor of every other week and part owner  mr kendricks is merely a contributor  ah he breathed again  and if he were successful in selling his writings how much would he probably make in a year  in a year i repeated to gain time  mr kendricks is comparatively a beginner  say fifteen hundredtwo thousand twentyfive hundred  and that would not go very far in new york  no that would not go far in new york  i was beginning to find a certain pleasure in dealing so frankly with this hard little man  i liked to see him suffer and i could see that he did suffer he suffered as a father must who learns that from a pecuniary point of view his daughter is imprudently in love  why should we always regard such a sufferer as a comic figure  he is if we think of it rightly a most serious even tragical figure and at all events a most respectable figure  he loves her and his heart is torn between the wish to indulge her and the wish to do what will be finally best for her  why should our sympathies in such a case be all for the foolish young lovers  they ought in great measure to be for the father too  something like a sense of this smote me and i was ashamed in my pleasure  then i should say mr march that this seems a most undesirable engagement for my daughter  what should you say  i ask you to make the case your own  excuse me i answered i would much rather not make the case my own mr gage and i must decline to have you consult me  i think that in this matter i have done all that i was called upon to do  i have told you what i know of mr kendrickss circumstances and connections  as to his character i can truly say that he is one of the best men i ever knew  i believe in his absolute purity of heart and he is the most unselfish the most generous  mr gage waved the facts aside with his hand  i dont undervalue those things  if i could be master no one should have my girl without them  but they do not constitute a livelihood  from what you tell me of mr kendrickss prospects i am not prepared to say that i think the outlook is brilliant  if he has counted upon my supplying a deficiency  oh excuse me mr gage  your insinuation  excuse me he retorted  i am making no insinuation  i merely wish to say that while my means are such as to enable me to live in comfort at de witt point i am well aware that much more would be needed in new york to enable my daughter to live in the same comfort  im not willing she should live in less  i think it is my duty to say that i am not at all a rich man and if there has been any supposition that i am so it is a mistake that cannot be corrected too soon  this time i could not resent his insinuation for since he had begun to speak i had become guiltily aware of having felt a sort of ease in regard to kendrickss modesty of competence from a belief given me i suspect by the talk of deering that mr gage had plenty of money and could come to the rescue in any amount needed  i could only say mr gage all this is so far beyond my control that i ought not to allow you to say it to me  it is something that you must say to mr kendricks  as i spoke i saw the young fellow come round the corner of the street and mount the hotel steps  he did not see me for he did not look toward the little corner of lawn where mr gage and i had put our chairs for the sake of the morning shade and for the seclusion that the spot afforded us  it was at the angle of the house farthest from our peculiar corner of the piazza whither i had the belief that the girl had withdrawn when she left me to her father  i was sure that kendricks would seek her there far enough beyond eyeshot or earshot of us and i had no doubt that she was expecting him  you are mr kendrickss friend  i have tried much more to be miss gages friend and mrs march it came into my mind that she was most selfishly and shamelessly keeping out of the way and i could not go on and celebrate her magnanimous impartiality her eager and sleepless vigilance  i have no doubt of that said the little man and i am very much obliged to you for all the trouble you have taken on my daughters account  but you are his friend and i can speak to you much more fully and frankly than i could to him  i did not know just what to say to this and he went on  in point of fact i dont think that i shall speak to him at all  that is quite your affair my dear sir i said dryly  it isnt to be supposed that you would seek an interview with him  and if he seeks an interview with me i shall decline it  he looked at me defiantly and yet interrogatively  i could see that he was very angry and yet uncertain  i must say then mr gage that i dont think you would be right  how not right  i should say that in equity he had a full and perfect right to meet you and to talk this matter over with you  he has done you no wrong whatever in admiring your daughter and wishing to marry her its for you and her to decide whether you will let him  but as far as his wish goes and his expression of it to her he is quite within his rights  you must see that yourself  i consider he answered that he has done me a wrong in that very thing  a man without means or any stated occupation he had no business to speak to my daughter without speaking to me  he took advantage of the circumstances  what does he think  does he suppose i am made of money  does he suppose i want to support a soninlaw  i can tell you that if i were possessed of unlimited means i should not do it  i began to suspect that deering was nearer right after all in his representations of the mans financial ability i fancied something of the anxiety the tremor of avarice in his resentment of poor kendrickss possible or rather impossible designs upon his pocket  if he had any profession or any kind of business i should feel differently and i should be willing to assist him to a reasonable degree or if he had a business training i might take him in with me but as it is i should have a helpless burden on my hands and i can tell you i am not going in for that sort of thing  i shall make short work of it i shall decline to meet mr hendricks or kendricks and i shall ask you to say as much to him from me  and i shall decline to be the bearer of any such message from you mr gage i answered and i saw not without pleasure the bewilderment that began to mix with his arrogance  very well then sir he answered after a moment i shall simply take my daughter away with me and that will end it  the prim little grim little man looked at me with his hard eyes and set his lips so close that the beard on the lower one stuck out at me with a sort of additional menace i felt that he was too capable of doing what he said and i lost myself in a sense of his sordidness a sense which was almost without a trace of compassion  it seemed as if i were a long time under the spell of this and the sight of his repugnant face but it could really have been merely a moment when i heard a stir of drapery on the grass near us and the soft rich voice of miss gage saying papa  we both started to our feet  i do not know whether she had heard what he said or not  we had spoken low and in the utmost vehemence of his speech he did not lift his voice  in any case she did not heed what he said  papa she repeated i want you to come up and see mrs march on the piazza  andmr kendricks is there  i had a wild desire to laugh at what followed and yet it was not without its pathos  iihm hm  icannot see mr kendricks just at present  ithe fact is i do not want to see him  it is betternot  i think you had better get ready to go home with me at once daughter  ihmcannot approve of any engagement to mr kendricks and iprefer not to meet him  he stopped  miss gage said nothing and i cannot say that she looked anything she simply clouded up if i may so express the effect that came and remained upon her countenance which was now the countenance she had shown me the first evening i saw her when i saw the deerings cowering in its shadow  i had no need to look at the adamantine little man before her to know that he was softening into wax and in fact i felt a sort of indecency in beholding his inteneration for i knew that it came from his heart and had its consecration through his love for her  that is why i turned away and do not know to this moment just how the change she desired in him was brought about  i will not say that i did not look back from a discreet distance and continue looking until i saw them start away together and move in the direction of that corner of the piazza where kendricks was waiting with mrs march  it appeared from her account that mr gage with no uncommon show of illwill but with merely a natural dryness suffered kendricks to be presented to him and entered upon some preliminary banalities with him such as he had used in opening a conversation with me before these came to a close mrs march had thought it well to leave the three together  afterward when we knew the only result that the affair could have she said the girl has a powerful will  i wonder what the mother was like  yes evidently she didnt get that will from her father  i have still a sense of exhaustion from it in our own case  what do you think it portends for poor kendricks  poor kendricks she repeated thoughtfully  yes in that sense i suppose you might call him poor  it isnt an equal thing as far as nature as character goes  but isnt it always dreadful to see two people who have made up their minds to get married  its very common i suggested  that doesnt change the fact or lessen the risk  she is very beautiful and now he is in love with her beautiful girlhood  but after a while the girlhood will go  and the girl will remain i said
