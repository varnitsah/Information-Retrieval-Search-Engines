13409796	the freelands  by john galsworthy     libertys a glorious feastburns     prologue   one early april afternoon in a worcestershire field the only field in that immediate landscape which was not down in grass a man moved slowly athwart the furrows sowinga big man of heavy build swinging his hairy brown arm with the grace of strength he wore no coat or hat a waistcoat open over a bluechecked cotton shirt flapped against belted corduroys that were somewhat the color of his square palebrown face and dusty hair his eyes were sad with the swimming yet fixed stare of epileptics his mouth heavylipped so that but for the yearning eyes the face would have been almost brutal he looked as if he suffered from silence the elmtrees bordering the field though only just in leaf showed dark against a white sky a light wind blew carrying already a scent from the earth and growth pushing up for the year was early the green malvern hills rose in the west and not far away shrouded by trees a long country house of weathered brick faced to the south save for the man sowing and some rooks crossing from elm to elm no life was visible in all the green land and it was quietwith a strange a brooding tranquillity the fields and hills seemed to mock the scars of road and ditch and furrow scraped on them to mock at barriers of hedge and wallbetween the green land and white sky was a conspiracy to disregard those small activities so lonely was it so plunged in a groundbass of silence so much too big and permanent for any figure of man  across and across the brown loam the laborer doggedly finished out his task scattered the few last seeds into a corner and stood still thrushes and blackbirds were just beginning that evensong whose blitheness as nothing else on earth seems to promise youth forever to the land he picked up his coat slung it on and heaving a straw bag over his shoulder walked out on to the grassbordered road between the elms  tryst bob tryst  at the gate of a creepered cottage amongst fruittrees high above the road a youth with black hair and palebrown face stood beside a girl with frizzy brown hair and cheeks like poppies  have you had that notice  the laborer answered slowly  yes mr derek if she dont go ive got to  what a dd shame  the laborer moved his head as though he would have spoken but no words came  dont do anything bob well see about that  evenin mr derek evenin miss sheila and the laborer moved on  the two at the wicket gate also turned away a blackhaired woman dressed in blue came to the wicket gate in their place there seemed no purpose in her standing there it was perhaps an evening custom some ceremony such as moslems observe at the muezzincall and any one who saw her would have wondered what on earth she might be seeing gazing out with her dark glowing eyes above the white grassbordered roads stretching empty this way and that between the elmtrees and green fields while the blackbirds and thrushes shouted out their hearts calling all to witness how hopeful and young was life in this english countryside     chapter i   mayday afternoon in oxford street and felix freeland a little late on his way from hampstead to his brother johns house in porchester gardens felix freeland author wearing the very first gray top hat of the season a compromise thatlike many other things in his life and worksbetween individuality and the accepted view of things aestheticism and fashion the critical sense and authority after the meeting at johns to discuss the doings of the family of his brother morton freelandbetter known as todhe would perhaps look in on the caricatures at the english gallery and visit one duchess in mayfair concerning the george richard memorial and so not the soft felt hat which really suited authorship nor the black top hat which obliterated personality to the point of pain but this gray thing with narrowish black band very suitable in truth to a face of a pale buff color to a moustache of a deep buff color streaked with a few gray hairs to a black braided coat cut away from a buffcolored waistcoat to his neat bootsnot patent leatherfaintly buffed with mayday dust even his eyes freeland gray were a little buffed over by sedentary habit and the number of things that he was conscious of for instance that the people passing him were distressingly plain both men and women plain with the particular plainness of those quite unaware of it it struck him forcibly while he went along how very queer it was that with so many plain people in the country the population managed to keep up even as well as it did to his wonderfully keen sense of defect it seemed little short of marvellous a shambling shoddy crew this crowd of shoppers and labor demonstrators a conglomeration of hopelessly mediocre visages what was to be done about it ah what indeedsince they were evidently not aware of their own dismal mediocrity hardly a beautiful or a vivid face hardly a wicked one never anything transfigured passionate terrible or grand nothing greek early italian elizabethan not even beefy beery broad old georgian something clutchedin and squashedout about it allon that collective face something of the look of a man almost comfortably and warmly wrapped round by a snake at the very beginning of its squeeze it gave felix freeland a sort of faint excitement and pleasure to notice this for it was his business to notice things and embalm them afterward in ink and he believed that not many people noticed it so that it contributed in his mind to his own distinction which was precious to him precious and encouraged to be so by the press whichas he well knewmust print his name several thousand times a year and yet as a man of culture and of principle how he despised that kind of fame and theoretically believed that a mans real distinction lay in his oblivion of the worlds opinion particularly as expressed by that flighty creature the fourth estate but here again as in the matter of the gray top hat he had instinctively compromised taking in press cuttings which described himself and his works while he never failed to describe those descriptionsgood bad and indifferentas that stuff and their writers as those fellows  not that it was new to him to feel that the country was in a bad way on the contrary it was his established belief and one for which he was prepared to furnish due and proper reasons in the first place he traced it to the horrible hold industrialism had in the last hundred years laid on the nation draining the peasantry from the land and in the second place to the influence of a narrow and insidious officialism sapping the independence of the people  this was why in going to a conclave with his brother john high in government employ and his brother stanley a captain of industry possessor of the morton plough works he was conscious of a certain superiority in that he at all events had no hand in this paralysis which was creeping on the country  and getting more buffcolored every minute he threaded his way on till past the marble arch he secured the elbowroom of hyde park here groups of young men with chivalrous idealism were jeering at and chivying the broken remnants of a suffrage meeting felix debated whether he should oppose his body to their bodies his tongue to theirs or whether he should avert his consciousness and hurry on but that instinct which moved him to wear the gray top hat prevailing he did neither and stood instead looking at them in silent anger which quickly provoked endearmentssuch as take it off or keep it on or what cheer toppy but nothing more acute and he meditated culture could culture ever make headway among the blind partisanships the handtomouth mentality the cheap excitements of this town life the faces of these youths the tone of their voices the very look of their bowler hats said no you could not culturalize the impermeable texture of their vulgarity and they were the coming manhood of the nationthis inexpressibly distasteful lot of youths the country had indeed got too far away from the land and this essential towny commonness was not confined to the classes from which these youths were drawn he had even remarked it among his own sons school and college friendsan impatience of discipline an insensibility to everything but excitement and having a good time a permanent mental indigestion due to a permanent diet of titbits what aspiration they possessed seemed devoted to securing for themselves the plums of official or industrial life his boy alan even was infected in spite of home influences and the atmosphere of art in which he had been so sedulously soaked he wished to enter his uncle stanleys plough works seeing in it a soft thing  but the last of the womanbaiters had passed by now and conscious that he was really behind time felix hurried on   in his studya pleasant room if rather tidyjohn freeland was standing before the fire smoking a pipe and looking thoughtfully at nothing he was in fact thinking with that continuity characteristic of a man who at fifty has won for himself a place of permanent importance in the home office starting life in the royal engineers he still preserved something of a military look about his figure and grave visage with steady eyes and drooping moustache both a shade grayer than those of felix and a forehead bald from justness and knowing where to lay his hand on papers his face was thinner his head narrower than his brothers and he had acquired a way of making those he looked at doubt themselves and feel the sudden instability of all their facts he wasas has been saidthinking his brother stanley had wired to him that morning am motoring up today on business can you get felix to come at six oclock and talk over the position at tods what position at tods he had indeed heard something vagueof those youngsters of tods and some fuss they were making about the laborers down there he had not liked it too much of a piece with the general unrest and these new democratic ideas that were playing old harry with the country for in his opinion the country was in a bad way partly owing to industrialism with its rotting effect upon physique partly to this modern analytic intellectualism with its destructive and anarchic influence on morals it was difficult to overestimate the mischief of those two factors and in the approaching conference with his brothers one of whom was the head of an industrial undertaking and the other a writer whose books extremely modern he never read he was perhaps vaguely conscious of his own cleaner hands hearing a car come to a halt outside he went to the window and looked out yes it was stanley   stanley freeland who had motored up from beckethis country place close to his plough works in worcestershirestood a moment on the pavement stretching his long legs and giving directions to his chauffeur he had been stopped twice on the road for notexceeding the limit as he believed and was still a little ruffled was it not his invariable principle to be moderate in speed as in all other things and his feeling at the moment was stronger even than usual that the country was in a bad way eaten up by officialism with its absurd limitations of speed and the liberty of the subject and the advanced ideas of these new writers and intellectuals always talking about the rights and sufferings of the poor there was no progress along either of those roads he had it in his heart as he stood there on the pavement to say something pretty definite to john about interference with the liberty of the subject and he wouldnt mind giving old felix a rap about his precious destructive doctrines and continual girding at the upper classes vested interests and all the rest of it if he had something to put in their place that would be another matter capital and those who controlled it were the backbone of the countrywhat there was left of the country apart from these dd officials and aesthetic fellows and with a contraction of his straight eyebrows above his straight gray eyes straight blunt nose blunter moustaches and blunt chin he kept a tight rein on his blunt tongue not choosing to give way even to his own anger  then perceiving felix comingin a white topper by jovehe crossed the pavement to the door and tall square personable rang the bell   chapter ii   well whats the matter at tods  and felix moved a little forward in his chair his eyes fixed with interest on stanley who was about to speak  its that wife of his of course it was all very well so long as she confined herself to writing and talk and that land society or whatever it was she founded the one that snuffed out the other day but now shes getting herself and those two youngsters mixed up in our local broils and really i think tods got to be spoken to  its impossible for a husband to interfere with his wifes principles so felix  principles the word came from john  certainly kirsteens a woman of great character revolutionary by temperament why should you expect her to act as you would act yourselves  when felix had said that there was a silence  then stanley muttered poor old tod  felix sighed lost for a moment in his last vision of his youngest brother it was four years ago now a summer eveningtod standing between his youngsters derek and sheila in a doorway of his white blacktimbered creepered cottage his sunburnt face and blue eyes the serenest things one could see in a days march  why poor he said tods much happier than we are youve only to look at him  ah said stanley suddenly dyou remember him at fathers funeralwithout his hat and his head in the clouds finelookin chap old todpity hes such a child of nature  felix said quietly  if youd offered him a partnership stanleyit would have been the making of him  tod in the plough works my hat  felix smiled at sight of that smile stanley grew red and john refilled his pipe it is always the devil to have a brother more sarcastic than oneself  how old are those two john said abruptly  sheilas twenty derek nineteen  i thought the boy was at an agricultural college  finished  whats he like  a blackhaired fiery fellow not a bit like tod  john muttered thats her celtic blood her father old colonel moray was just that sort by george he was a regular black highlander whats the trouble exactly  it was stanley who answered that sort of agitation business is all very well until it begins to affect your neighbors then its time it stopped you know the mallorings who own all the land round tods well theyve fallen foul of the mallorings over what they call injustice to some laborers questions of morality involved i dont know all the details a mans got notice to quit over his deceased wifes sister and some girl or other in another cottage has kicked overjust ordinary country incidents what i want is that tod should be made to see that his family mustnt quarrel with his nearest neighbors in this way we know the mallorings well theyre only seven miles from us at becket it doesnt do sooner or later it plays the devil all round and the airs full of agitation about the laborers and the land and all the rest of itonly wants a spark to make real trouble  and having finished this oration stanley thrust his hands deep into his pockets and jingled the money that was there  john said abruptly  felix youd better go down  felix was sitting back his eyes for once withdrawn from his brothers faces  odd he said really odd that with a perfectly unique person like tod for a brother we only see him once in a blue moon  its because he is so dd unique  felix got up and gravely extended his hand to stanley  by jove he said youve spoken truth and to john he added well i will go and let you know the upshot  when he had departed the two elder brothers remained for some moments silent then stanley said  old felix is a bit tryin with the fuss they make of him in the papers his heads swelled  john did not answer one could not in so many words resent ones own brother being made a fuss of and if it had been for something real such as discovering the source of the black river conquering bechuanaland curing bluemange or being made a bishop he would have been the first and most loyal in his appreciation but for the sort of thing felix made upfiction and critical acid destructive sort of stuff pretending to show john freeland things that he hadnt seen beforeas if felix couldnot at all the jolly old romance which one could read well enough and enjoy till it sent you to sleep after a good days work no that felix should be made a fuss of for such work as that really almost hurt him it was not quite decent violating deep down ones sense of form ones sense of health ones traditions though he would not have admitted it he secretly felt too that this fuss was dangerous to his own point of view which was of course to him the only real one and he merely said  will you stay to dinner stan   chapter iii   if john had those sensations about felix sowhen he was away from johnhad felix about himself he had never quite grown out of the feeling that to make himself conspicuous in any way was bad form in common with his three brothers he had been through the mills of gentilitythose unique grinding machines of education only found in his native land tod to be sure had been publicly sacked at the end of his third term for climbing on to the headmasters roof and filling up two of his chimneys with football pants from which he had omitted to remove his name felix still remembered the august scenethe horrid thrill of it the ominous sound of that freeland minimus the ominous sight of poor little tod emerging from his obscurity near the roof of the speech room and descending all those steps how very small and rosy he had looked his bright hair standing on end and his little blue eyes staring up very hard from under a troubled frown and the august hand holding up those sooty pants and the august voice these appear to be yours freeland minimus were you so good as to put them down my chimneys and the little piping yes sir  may i ask why freeland minimus  i dont know sir  you must have had some reason freeland minimus  it was the end of term sir  ah you must not come back here freeland minimus you are too dangerous to yourself and others go to your place  and poor little tod ascending again all those steps cheeks more terribly rosy than ever eyes bluer from under a still more troubled frown little mouth hard set and breathing so that you could hear him six forms off true the new head had been goaded by other outrages the authors of which had not omitted to remove their names but the want of humor the amazing want of humor as if it had not been a sign of firstrate stuff in tod and to this day felix remembered with delight the little bubbling hiss that he himself had started squelched at once but rippling out again along the rows like tiny scattered lines of fire when a conflagration is suppressed expulsion had been the salvation of tod orhis damnation which god would know but felix was not certain having himself been fifteen years acquiring mill philosophy and another fifteen years getting rid of it he had now begun to think that after all there might be something in it a philosophy that took everything including itself at face value and questioned nothing was sedative to nerves too highly strung by the continual examination of the insides of oneself and others with a view to their alteration tod of course having been sent to germany after his expulsion as one naturally would be and then put to farming had never properly acquired mill manner and never sloughed it off and yet he was as sedative a man as you could meet  emerging from the tube station at hampstead he moved toward home under a sky stranger than one might see in a whole year of evenings between the pinetrees on the ridge it was opaque and colored like pinkish stone and all around violent purple with flames of the young green and white spring blossom lit against it spring had been dull and unimaginative so far but this evening it was all fire and gathered torrents felix wondered at the waiting passion of that sky  he reached home just as those torrents began to fall  the old house beyond the spaniards road save for mice and a faint underlying savor of woodrot in two rooms well satisfied the aesthetic sense felix often stood in his hall study bedroom and other apartments admiring the rich and simple glow of themadmiring the rarity and look of studied negligence about the stuffs the flowers the books the furniture the china and then quite suddenly the feeling would sweep over him by george do i really own all this when my ideal is bread and water and on feast days a little bit of cheese true he was not to blame for the niceness of his thingsflora did it but stillthere they were a little hard to swallow for an epicurean it might of course have been worse for if flora had a passion for collecting it was a very chaste one and though what she collected cost no little money it always looked as if it had been inherited andas everybody knowswhat has been inherited must be put up with whether it be a coronet or a cruetstand  to collect old things and write poetry it was a career one would not have ones wife otherwise she might for instance have been like stanleys wife clara whose career was wealth and station or johns wife anne whose career had been cut short or even tods wife kirsteen whose career was revolution noa wife who had two and only two children and treated them with affectionate surprise who was never out of temper never in a hurry knew the points of a book or play could cut your hair at a pinch whose hand was dry figure still good verse tolerable andabove allwho wished for no better fate than fate had given herwas a wife not to be sneezed at and felix never had he had depicted so many sneezing wives and husbands in his books and knew the value of a happy marriage better perhaps than any one in england he had laid marriage low a dozen times wrecked it on all sorts of rocks and had the greater veneration for his own which had begun early manifested every symptom of ending late and in the meantime walked down the years holding hands fast and by no means forgetting to touch lips  hanging up the gray top hat he went in search of her he found her in his dressingroom surrounded by a number of little bottles which she was examining vaguely and putting one by one into an inherited wastepaper basket having watched her for a little while with a certain pleasure he said  yes my dear  noticing his presence and continuing to put bottles into the basket she answered  i thought i musttheyre what dear mothers given us  there they laylittle bottles filled with white and brown fluids white and blue and brown powders green and brown and yellow ointments black lozenges buff plasters blue and pink and purple pills all beautifully labelled and corked  and he said in a rather faltering voice  bless her how she does give her things away havent we used any  not one and they have to be cleared away before theyre stale for fear we might take one by mistake  poor mother  my dear shes found something newer than them all by now  felix sighed  the nomadic spirit i have it too  and a sudden vision came to him of his mothers carved ivory face kept free of wrinkles by sheer willpower its firm chin slightly aquiline nose and measured brows its eyes that saw everything so quickly so fastidiously its compressed mouth that smiled sweetly with a resolute but pathetic acceptation of the piece of fine lace sometimes black sometimes white over her gray hair of her hands so thin now always moving a little as if all the composure and care not to offend any eye by allowing time to ravage her face were avenging themselves in that constant movement of her figure that was short but did not seem so still quickmoving still alert and always dressed in black or gray a vision of that exact fastidious wandering spirit called frances fleeming freelandthat spirit strangely compounded of domination and humility of acceptation and cynicism precise and actual to the point of desert dryness generous to a point that caused her family to despair and always beyond all things brave  flora dropped the last little bottle and sitting on the edge of the bath let her eyebrows rise how pleasant was that impersonal humor which made her superior to other wives  younomadic how  mother travels unceasingly from place to place person to person thing to thing i travel unceasingly from motive to motive mind to mind my native air is also desert airhence the sterility of my work  flora rose but her eyebrows descended  your work she said is not sterile  that my dear said felix is prejudice and perceiving that she was going to kiss him he waited without annoyance for a woman of fortytwo with two children and three books of poemsand not knowing which had taken least out of herwith hazelgray eyes wavy eyebrows darker than they should have been a glint of red in her hair wavy figure and lips quaint halfhumorous indolence quaint halfhumorous warmthwas she not as satisfactory a woman as a man could possibly have married  i have got to go down and see tod he said i like that wife of his but she has no sense of humor how much better principles are in theory than in practice  flora repeated softly as if to herself  im glad i have none she was at the window leaning out and felix took his place beside her the air was full of scent from wet leaves alive with the song of birds thanking the sky suddenly he felt her arm round his ribs either it or theywhich he could not at the moment tellseemed extraordinarily soft   between felix and his young daughter nedda there existed the only kind of love except a mothers which has much permanencelove based on mutual admiration though why nedda with her starry innocence should admire him felix could never understand not realizing that she read his books and even analyzed them for herself in the diary which she kept religiously writing it when she ought to have been asleep he had therefore no knowledge of the way his written thoughts stimulated the ceaseless questioning that was always going on within her the thirst to know why this was and that was not why for instance her heart ached so some days and felt light and eager other days why when people wrote and talked of god they seemed to know what he was and she never did why people had to suffer and the world be black to so many millions why one could not love more than one man at a time whya thousand things felixs books supplied no answers to these questions but they were comforting for her real need as yet was not for answers but ever for more questions as a young birds need is for opening its beak without quite knowing what is coming out or going in when she and her father walked or sat or went to concerts together their talk was neither particularly intimate nor particularly voluble they made to each other no great confidences yet each was certain that the other was not boreda great thing and they squeezed each others little fingers a good dealvery warming now with his son alan felix had a continual sensation of having to keep up to a mark and never succeedinga feeling as in his favorite nightmare of trying to pass an examination for which he had neglected to prepare of having to preserve in fact form proper to the father of alan freeland with nedda he had a sense of refreshment the delight one has on a spring day watching a clear stream a bank of flowers birds flying and nedda with her fatherwhat feeling had she to be with him was like a long stroking with a touch of tickle in it to read his books a long tickle with a nice touch of stroking now and then when one was not expecting it  that night after dinner when alan had gone out and flora into a dream she snuggled up alongside her father got hold of his little finger and whispered  come into the garden dad ill put on goloshes its an awfully nice moon  the moon indeed was palest gold behind the pines so that its radiance was a mere shower of pollen just a brushing of white mothdown over the reeds of their little dark pond and the black blur of the flowering currant bushes and the young limetrees not yet in full leaf quivered ecstatically in that moonwitchery still letting fall raindrops of the past spring torrent with soft hissing sounds a real sense in the garden of god holding his breath in the presence of his own youth swelling growing trembling toward perfection somewhere a birda thrush they thoughtmixed in its little mind as to night and day was queerly chirruping and felix and his daughter went along the dark wet paths holding each others arms not talking much for in him very responsive to the moods of nature there was a flattered feeling with that young arm in his of spring having chosen to confide in him this whispering rustling hour and in nedda was so much of that nights unutterable youthno wonder she was silent then somehowneither responsiblethey stood motionless how quiet it was but for a distant dog or two and the stilly shiveringdown of the water drops and the far vibration of the millionvoiced city how quiet and soft and fresh then nedda spoke  dad i do so want to know everything  not rousing even a smile with its sublime immodesty that aspiration seemed to felix infinitely touching what less could youth want in the very heart of spring and watching her face put up to the night her parted lips and the moongleam fingering her white throat he answered  itll all come soon enough my pretty  to think that she must come to an end like the rest having found out almost nothing having discovered just herself and the particle of god that was within her but he could not of course say this  i want to feel cant i begin  how many millions of young creatures all the world over were sending up that white prayer to climb and twine toward the stars andfall to earth again and nothing to be answered but  time enough nedda  but dad there are such heaps of things such heaps of people and reasons andand life and i know nothing dreams are the only times it seems to me that one finds out anything  as for that my child i am exactly in your case whats to be done for us  she slid her hand through his arm again  dont laugh at me  heaven forbid i meant it youre finding out much quicker than i its all folkmusic to you still to me strauss and the rest of the tired stuff the variations my mind spinswouldnt i just swap them for the tunes your mind is making  i dont seem making tunes at all i dont seem to have anything to make them of take me down to see the tods dad  why not and yet just as in this spring night felix felt so much so very much lying out there behind the still and moony dark such marvellous holding of breath and waiting sentiency so behind this innocent petition he could not help the feeling of a lurking fatefulness that was absurd and he said if you wish it by all means youll like your uncle tod as to the others i cant say but your aunt is an experience and experiences are what you want it seems  fervently without speech nedda squeezed his arm   chapter iv   stanley freelands country house becket was almost a show place it stood in its park and pastures two miles from the little town of transham and the morton plough works close to the ancestral home of the moretons his mothers familythat home burned down by roundheads in the civil war the sitecertain vagaries in the groundmrs stanley had caused to be walled round and consecrated so to speak with a stone medallion on which were engraved the aged moreton armsarrows and crescent moons in proper juxtaposition peacocks toothat bird parlant from the old moreton crestwere encouraged to dwell there and utter their cries as of passionate souls lost in too comfortable surroundings  by one of those freaks of which nature is so prodigal stanleyowner of this native moreton soilleast of all four freeland brothers had the moreton cast of mind and body that was why he made so much more money than the other three put together and had been able with the aid of claras undoubted genius for rank and station to restore a strain of moreton blood to its rightful position among the county families of worcestershire bluff and without sentiment he himself set little store by that smiling up his sleevefor he was both kindly and prudentat his wife who had been a tomson it was not in stanley to appreciate the peculiar flavor of the moretons that something which in spite of their naivete and narrowness had really been rather fine to him such moretons as were left were dry enough sticks clean out of it they were of a breed that was already gone the simplest of all country gentlemen dating back to the conquest without one solitary conspicuous ancestor save the one who had been physician to a king and perished without issuemarrying from generation to generation exactly their own equals living simple pious parochial lives never in trade never making money having a tradition and a practice of gentility more punctilious than the socalled aristocracy constitutionally paternal and maternal to their dependents constitutionally so convinced that those dependents and all indeed who were not gentry were of different clay that they were entirely simple and entirely without arrogance carrying with them even now a sort of early atmosphere of archery and homemade cordials lavender and love of clergy together with frequent use of the word nice a peculiar regularity of feature and a complexion that was rather parchmenty high church people and tories naturally to a man and woman by sheer inbred absence of ideas and sheer inbred conviction that nothing else was nice but withal very considerate of others really plucky in bearing their own ills not greedy and not wasteful  of becket as it now was they would not have approved at all by what chance edmund moreton stanleys mothers grandfather in the middle of the eighteenth century had suddenly diverged from family feeling and ideals and taken that not quite nice resolution to make ploughs and money would never now be known the fact remained together with the plough works a man apparently of curious energy and character considering his origin he had dropped the e from his name andthough he continued the family tradition so far as to marry a fleeming of worcestershire to be paternal to his workmen to be known as squire and to bring his children up in the older moreton nicenesshe had yet managed to make his ploughs quite celebrated to found a little town and die still handsome and cleanshaved at the age of sixtysix of his four sons only two could be found sufficiently without the e to go on making ploughs stanleys grandfather stuart morton indeed had tried hard but in the end had reverted to the congenital instinct for being just a moreton an extremely amiable man he took to wandering with his family and died in france leaving one daughterfrances stanleys motherand three sons one of whom absorbed in horses wandered to australia and was killed by falling from them one of whom a soldier wandered to india and the embraces of a snake and one of whom wandered into the embraces of the holy roman church  the morton plough works were dry and dwindling when stanleys father seeking an opening for his son put him and money into them from that moment they had never looked back and now brought stanley the sole proprietor an income of full fifteen thousand pounds a year he wanted it for clara his wife had that energy of aspiration which before now has raised women to positions of importance in the counties which are not their own and caused incidentally many acres to go out of cultivation not one plough was used on the whole of becket not even a morton ploughthese indeed were unsuitable to english soil and were all sent abroad it was the cornerstone of his success that stanley had completely seen through the talkedof revival of english agriculture and sedulously cultivated the foreign market this was why the becket diningroom could contain without straining itself large quantities of local magnates and celebrities from london all deploring the condition of the land and discussing without end the regrettable position of the agricultural laborer except for literary men and painters present in small quantities to leaven the lump becket was in fact a rallying point for the advanced spirits of land reformone of those places where they were sure of being well done at weekends and of congenial and even stimulating talk about the undoubted need for doing something and the designs which were being entertained upon the land by either party this very heart of english country that the old moretons in their paternal way had so religiously farmed making out of its lush grass and waving corn a simple and by no means selfish or ungenerous subsistence was now entirely lawns park coverts and private golf course together with enough grass to support the kine which yielded that continual stream of milk necessary to claras entertainments and children all female save little francis and still of tender years of gardeners keepers cowmen chauffeurs footmen stablemenfull twenty were supported on those fifteen hundred acres that formed the little becket demesne of agricultural laborers properthat vexed individual so much in the air so reluctant to stay on the land and so difficult to house when he was there there were fortunately none so that it was possible for stanley whose wife meant him to put up for the division and his guests who were frequently in parliament to hold entirely unbiassed and impersonal views upon the whole question so long as they were at becket  it was beautiful there too with the bright open fields hedged with great elms and that everrich serenity of its grass and trees the white house timbered with dark beams in true worcestershire fashion and addedto from time to time had preserved thanks to a fine architect an oldfashioned air of spacious presidency above its gardens and lawns on the long artificial lake with innumerable rushy nooks and waterlilies and coverture of leaves floating flat and bright in the sun the halftame wild duck and shy waterhens had remote little worlds and flew and splashed when all becket was abed quite as if the human spirit with its monkeytricks and its little divine flame had not yet been born  under the shade of a copperbeech just where the drive cut through into its circle before the house an old lady was sitting that afternoon on a campstool she was dressed in gray alpaca light and cool and had on her irongray hair a piece of black lace a number of hearth and home and a little pair of scissors suspended by an inexpensive chain from her waist rested on her knee for she had been meaning to cut out for dear felix a certain recipe for keeping the head cool but as a fact she sat without doing so very still save that now and then she compressed her pale fine lips and continually moved her pale fine hands she was evidently waiting for something that promised excitement even pleasure for a little roseleaf flush had quavered up into a face that was colored like parchment and her gray eyes under regular and stilldark brows very far apart between which there was no semblance of a wrinkle seemed noting little definite things about her almost unwillingly as an arabs or a red indians eyes will continue to note things in the present however their minds may be set on the future so sat frances fleeming freeland nee morton waiting for the arrival of her son felix and her grandchildren alan and nedda  she marked presently an old man limping slowly on a stick toward where the drive debouched and thought at once he oughtnt to be coming this way i expect he doesnt know the way round to the back poor man hes very lame he looks respectable too she got up and went toward him remarking that his face with nice gray moustaches was wonderfully regular almost like a gentlemans and that he touched his dusty hat with quite oldfashioned courtesy and smilingher smile was sweet but criticalshe said youll find the best way is to go back to that little path and past the greenhouses have you hurt your leg  my legs been like that mm fifteen year come michaelmas  how did it happen  ploughin the bone was injured an now they say the muscles dried up in a manner of speakin  what do you do for it the very best thing is this  from the recesses of a deep pocket placed where no one else wore such a thing she brought out a little pot  you must let me give it you put it on when you go to bed and rub it well in youll find it act splendidly  the old man took the little pot with dubious reverence  yes mm he said thank you mm  what is your name  gaunt  and where do you live  over to joyfields mm  joyfieldsanother of my sons lives theremr morton freeland but its seven miles  i got a lift halfway  and have you business at the house the old man was silent the downcast rather cynical look of his lined face deepened and frances freeland thought hes overtired they must give him some tea and an egg what can he want coming all this way hes evidently not a beggar  the old man who was not a beggar spoke suddenly  i know the mr freeland at joyfields hes a good gentleman too  yes he is i wonder i dont know you  im not much about owin to my leg its my granddaughter in service here i come to see  oh yes what is her name  gaunt her name is  i shouldnt know her by her surname  alice  ah in the kitchen a nice pretty girl i hope youre not in trouble  again the old man was silent and again spoke suddenly  thats as you look at it mm he said ive got a matter of a few words to have with her about the family her father he couldnt come so i come instead  and how are you going to get back  ill have to walk i expect without i can pick up with a cart  frances freeland compressed her lips with that leg you should have come by train  the old man smiled  i hadnt the fare like he said i only gets five shillins a week from the council and two o that i pays over to my son  frances freeland thrust her hand once more into that deep pocket and as she did so she noticed that the old mans left boot was flapping open and that there were two buttons off his coat her mind was swiftly calculating it is more than seven weeks to quarter day of course i cant afford it but i must just give him a sovereign  she withdrew her hand from the recesses of her pocket and looked at the old mans nose it was finely chiselled and the same yellow as his face it looks nice and quite sober she thought in her hand was her purse and a bootlace she took out a sovereign  now if i give you this she said you must promise me not to spend any of it in the publichouse and this is for your boot and you must go back by train and get those buttons sewn on your coat and tell cook from me please to give you some tea and an egg and noticing that he took the sovereign and the bootlace very respectfully and seemed altogether very respectable and not at all coarse or beerylooking she said  goodby dont forget to rub what i gave you into your leg every night and every morning and went back to her campstool sitting down on it with the scissors in her hand she still did not cut out that recipe but remained as before taking in small definite things and feeling with an inner trembling that dear felix and alan and nedda would soon be here and the little flush rose again in her cheeks and again her lips and hands moved expressing and compressing what was in her heart and close behind her a peacock straying from the foundations of the old moreton house uttered a cry and moved slowly spreading its tail under the lowhanging boughs of the copperbeeches as though it knew those dark burnished leaves were the proper setting for its parlant magnificence   chapter v   the day after the little conference at johns felix had indeed received the following note   dear felix  when you go down to see old tod why not put up with us at becket any time will suit and the car can take you over to joyfields when you like give the pen a rest clara joins in hoping youll come and mother is still here no use i suppose to ask flora  yours ever  stanley   during the twenty years of his brothers sojourn there felix had been down to becket perhaps once a year and latterly alone for flora having accompanied him the first few times had taken a firm stand  my dear she said i feel all body there  felix had rejoined  no bad thing once in a way  but flora had remained firm life was too short she did not get on well with clara neither did felix feel too happy in his sisterinlaws presence but the gray tophat instinct had kept him going there for one ought to keep in touch with ones brothers  he replied to stanley   dear stanley  delighted if i may bring my two youngsters well arrive tomorrow at fourfifty  yours affectionately  felix   travelling with nedda was always jolly one could watch her eyes noting inquiring and when occasion served have ones little finger hooked in and squeezed travelling with alan was convenient the young man having a way with railways which felix himself had long despaired of acquiring neither of the children had ever been at becket and though alan was seldom curious and nedda too curious about everything to be specially so about this yet felix experienced in their company the sensations of a new adventure  arrived at transham that little town upon a hill which the morton plough works had created they were soon in stanleys car whirling into the sleepy peace of a worcestershire afternoon would this young bird nestling up against him echo floras verdict i feel all body there or would she take to its fatted luxury as a duck to water and he said by the way your aunts bigwigs set in on a saturday are you for staying and seeing the lions feed or do we cut back  from alan he got the answer he expected  if theres golf or something i suppose we can make out all right from nedda what sort of bigwigs are they dad  a sort youve never seen my dear  then i should like to stay only about dresses  what war paint have you  only two white evenings and mums gave me her mechlin  twill serve  to felix nedda in white evenings was starry and all that man could desire  only dad do tell me about them beforehand  my dear i will and god be with you this is where becket begins  the car had swerved into a long drive between trees not yet fullgrown but decorously trying to look more than their twenty years to the right about a group of older elms rooks were in commotion for stanleys three keepers wives had just baked their annual rook pies and the birds were not yet happy again those elms had stood there when the old moretons walked past them through cornfields to church of a sunday away on the left above the lake the little walled mound had come in view something in felix always stirred at sight of it and squeezing neddas arm he said  see that silly wall behind there grannys ancients lived gone nownew housenew lakenew treesnew everything  but he saw from his little daughters calm eyes that the sentiment in him was not in her  i like the lake she said theres grannyoh and a peacock  his mothers embrace with its frail energy and the pressure of her soft dry lips filled felix always with remorse why could he not give the simple and direct expression to his feeling that she gave to hers he watched those lips transferred to nedda heard her say oh my darling how lovely to see you do you know this for midgebites a hand diving deep into a pocket returned with a little silvercoated stick having a bluish end felix saw it rise and hover about neddas forehead and descend with two little swift dabs it takes them away at once  oh but granny theyre not midgebites theyre only from my hat  it doesnt matter darling it takes away anything like that  and he thought mother is really wonderful  at the house the car had already disgorged their luggage only one man but he absolutely the butler awaited them and they entered at once conscious of claras special potpourri its fragrance steamed from blue china in every nook and crevice a sort of baptism into luxury clara herself in the outer morningroom smelled a little of it quick and dark of eye capable comely perfectly buttoned one of those women who know exactly how not to be superior to the general taste of the period in addition to that great quality she was endowed with a fine nose an instinct for coordination not to be excelled and a genuine love of making people comfortable so that it was no wonder that she had risen in the ranks of hostesses till her house was celebrated for its ease even among those who at their weekends liked to feel all body in regard to that characteristic of becket not even felix in his ironies had ever stood up to clara the matter was too delicate frances freeland indeednot because she had any philosophic preconceptions on the matter but because it was not nice dear to be wasteful even if it were only of roseleaves or to have too much decoration such as japanese prints in places where they humsometimes told her daughterinlaw frankly what was wrong without however making the faintest impression upon clara for she was not sensitive and as she said to stanley it was only mother  when they had drunk that special chinese tea all the rage but which no one really liked in the inner morning or afternoon roomfor the drawingrooms were too large to be comfortable except at weekendsthey went to see the children a special blend of stanley and clara save the little francis who did not seem to be entirely body then clara took them to their rooms she lingered kindly in neddas feeling that the girl could not yet feel quite at home and looking in the soapdish lest she might not have the right verbena and about the dressingtable to see that she had pins and scent and plenty of potpourri and thinking the child is prettya nice girl not like her mother explaining carefully how because of the approaching weekend she had been obliged to put her in a very simple room where she would be compelled to cross the corridor to her bath she asked her if she had a quilted dressinggown and finding that she had not left her saying she would send oneand could she do her frocks up or should sirrett come  abandoned the girl stood in the middle of the room so far more simple than she had ever slept in with its warm fragrance of roseleaves and verbena its aubusson carpet white silkquilted bed sofa cushioned windowseat dainty curtains and little nickel box of biscuits on little spindly table there she stood and sniffed stretched herself and thought its jollyonly it smells too much and she went up to the pictures one by one they seemed to go splendidly with the room and suddenly she felt homesick ridiculous of course yet if she had known where her fathers room was she would have run out to it but her memory was too tangled up with stairs and corridorsto find her way down to the hall again was all she could have done  a maid came in now with a blue silk gown very thick and soft could she do anything for miss freeland no thanks she could not only did she know where mr freelands room was  which mr freeland miss the young or the old  oh the old having said which nedda felt unhappy her dad was not old no miss but ill find out itll be in the walnut wing but with a little flutter at the thought of thus setting people to run about wings nedda murmured oh thanks no it doesnt matter  she settled down now on the cushion of the windowseat to look out and take it all in right away to that line of hills gone blue in the haze of the warm evening that would be malvern and there farther to the south the tods lived joyfields a pretty name and it was lovely country all round green and peaceful with its white timbered houses and cottages people must be very happy living herehappy and quiet like the stars and the birds not like the crowds in london thronging streets and shops and hampstead heath not like the people in all those disgruntled suburbs that led out for miles where london ought to have stopped but had not not like the thousands and thousands of those poor creatures in bethnal green where her slum work lay the natives here must surely be happy only were there any natives she had not seen any away to the right below her window were the first trees of the fruit garden for many of them spring was over but the appletrees had just come into blossom and the low sun shining through a gap in some far elms was slanting on their creamy pink christening themnedda thoughtwith drops of light and lovely the blackbirds singing sounded in the perfect hush how wonderful to be a bird going where you would and from high up in the air seeing everything flying down a sunbeam drinking a raindrop sitting on the very top of a tall tree running in grass so high that you were hidden laying little perfect bluegreen eggs or puregray speckly ones never changing your dress yet always beautiful surely the spirit of the world was in the birds and the clouds roaming floating and in the flowers and trees that never smelled anything but sweet never looked anything but lovely and were never restless why was one restless wanting things that did not comewanting to feel and know wanting to love and be loved and at that thought which had come to her so unexpectedlya thought never before shaped so definitelynedda planted her arms on the windowsill with sleeves fallen down and let her hands meet cupshaped beneath her chin love to have somebody with whom she could share everythingsome one to whom and for whom she could give upsome one she could protect and comfortsome one who would bring her peace peace restfrom what ah that she could not make clear even to herself love what would love be like her father loved her and she loved him she loved her mother and alan on the whole was jolly to herit was not that what was itwhere was itwhen would it come and wake her and kiss her to sleep all in one come and fill her as with the warmth and color the freshness light and shadow of this beautiful may evening flood her as with the singing of those birds and the warm light sunning the apple blossoms and she sighed thenas with all young things whose attention after all is but as the hovering of a butterflyher speculation was attracted to a thin highshouldered figure limping on a stick away from the house down one of the paths among the appletrees he wavered not knowing it seemed his way and nedda thought poor old man how lame he is she saw him stoop screened as he evidently thought from sight and take something very small from his pocket he gazed rubbed it put it back what it was she could not see then pressing his hand down he smoothed and stretched his leg his eyes seemed closed so a stone man might have stood till very slowly he limped on passing out of sight and turning from the window nedda began hurrying into her evening things  when she was ready she took a long time to decide whether to wear her mothers lace or keep it for the bigwigs but it was so nice and creamy that she simply could not take it off and stood turning and turning before the glass to stand before a glass was silly and oldfashioned but nedda could never help it wanting so badly to be nicer to look at than she was because of that something that some day was coming  she was in fact pretty but not merely prettythere was in her face something alive and sweet something clear and swift she had still that way of a child raising its eyes very quickly and looking straight at you with an eager innocence that hides everything by its very wonder and when those eyes looked down they seemed closedtheir dark lashes were so long her eyebrows were wide apart arching with a slight angle and slanting a little down toward her nose her forehead under its burntbrown hair was candid her firm little chin just dimpled altogether a face difficult to take ones eyes off but nedda was far from vain and her face seemed to her too short and broad her eyes too dark and indeterminate neither gray nor brown the straightness of her nose was certainly comforting but it too was short being creamy in the throat and browning easily she would have liked to be marblewhite with blue dreamy eyes and fair hair or else like a madonna and was she tall enough only five foot five and her arms were too thin the only things that gave her perfect satisfaction were her legs which of course she could not at the moment see they really were rather jolly then in a panic fearing to be late she turned and ran out fluttering into the maze of stairs and corridors   chapter vi   clara mrs stanley freeland was not a narrow woman either in mind or body and years ago soon indeed after she married stanley she had declared her intention of taking up her sisterinlaw kirsteen in spite of what she had heard were the womans extraordinary notions those were the days of carriages pairs coachmen grooms and with her usual promptitude ordering out the lot she had set forth it is safe to say she had never forgotten that experience  imagine an old white timbered cottage with a thatched roof and no single line about it quite straight a cottage crazy with age buried up to the thatch in sweetbrier creepers honeysuckle and perched high above crossroads a cottage almost unapproachable for beehives and their beesan insect for which clara had an aversion imagine on the rough pebbled approach to the door of this cottage and clara had on thin shoes a peculiar cradle with a darkeyed baby that was staring placidly at two bees sleeping on a coverlet made of a rough linen such as clara had never before seen imagine an absolutely naked little girl of three sitting in a tub of sunlight in the very doorway clara had turned swiftly and closed the wicket gate between the pebbled pathway and the mossed steps that led down to where her coachman and her footman were sitting very still as was the habit of those people she had perceived at once that she was making no common call then with real courage she had advanced and looking down at the little girl with a fearful smile had tickled the door with the handle of her green parasol a woman younger than herself a girl indeed appeared in a low doorway she had often told stanley since that she would never forget her first sight she had not yet had another of tods wife a brown face and black hair fiery gray eyes eyes all light under black lashes and such a strange smile bare brown shapely arms and neck in a shirt of the same rough creamy linen and from under a bright blue skirt bare brown shapely ankles and feet a voice so soft and deadly that as clara said what with her eyes it really gave me the shivers and my dear she had pursued whitewashed walls bare brick floors not a picture not a curtain not even a fireiron cleanoh horribly they must be the most awful cranks the only thing i must say that was nice was the smell sweetbrier and honey coffee and baked applesreally delicious i must try what i can do with it but that womangirl i suppose she isstumped me im sure shed have cut my head off if id attempted to open my mouth on ordinary topics the children were rather ducks but imagine leaving them about like that amongst the bees kirsteen she looked it never again and tod i didnt see at all i suppose he was mooning about amongst his creatures  it was the memory of this visit now seventeen years ago that had made her smile so indulgently when stanley came back from the conference she had said at once that they must have felix to stay and for her part she would be only too glad to do anything she could for those poor children of tods even to asking them to becket and trying to civilize them a little but as for that woman therell be nothing to be done with her i can assure you and i expect tod is completely under her thumb  to felix who took her in to dinner she spoke feelingly and in a low voice she liked felix in spite of his wife and respected himhe had a name lady malloringshe told himthe mallorings owned of course everything round joyfieldshad been telling her that of late tods wife had really become quite rabid over the land question the tods were hand in glove with all the cottagers she clara had nothing to say against any one who sympathized with the condition of the agricultural laborer quite the contrary becket was almost as felix knewthough perhaps it wasnt for her to say sothe centre of that movement but there were ways of doing things and one did so deprecate women like this kirsteenwhat an impossibly celtic nameputting her finger into any pie that really was of national importance nothing could come of anything done that sort of way if felix had any influence with tod it would be a mercy to use it in getting those poor young creatures away from home to mix a little with people who took a sane view of things she would like very much to get them over to becket but with their notions it was doubtful whether they had evening clothes she had of course never forgotten that naked mite in the tub of sunlight nor the poor baby with its bees and its rough linen felix replied deferentiallyhe was invariably polite and only just ironic enough in the houses of othersthat he had the very greatest respect for tod and that there could be nothing very wrong with the woman to whom tod was so devoted as for the children his own young people would get at them and learn all about what was going on in a way that no fogey like himself could in regard to the land question there were of course many sides to that and he for one would not be at all sorry to observe yet another after all the tods were in real contact with the laborers and that was the great thing it would be very interesting  yes clara quite saw all that butand here she sank her voice so that there was hardly any leftas felix was going over there she really must put him au courant with the heart of this matter lady malloring had told her the whole story it appeared there were two cases a family called gaunt an old man and his son who had two daughtersone of them alice quite a nice girl was kitchenmaid here at becket but the other sisterwilmetwell she was one of those girls that as felix must know were always to be found in every village she was leading the young men astray and lady malloring had put her foot down telling her bailiff to tell the farmer for whom gaunt worked that he and his family must go unless they sent the girl away somewhere that was one case and the other was of a laborer called tryst who wanted to marry his deceased wifes sister of course whether mildred malloring was not rather too churchy and puritanicalnow that a deceased wifes sister was legalclara did not want to say but she was undoubtedly within her rights if she thought it for the good of the village this man tryst was a good workman and his farmer had objected to losing him but lady malloring had of course not given way and if he persisted he would get put out all the cottages about there were sir gerald mallorings so that in both cases it would mean leaving the neighborhood in regard to village morality as felix knew the line must be drawn somewhere  felix interrupted quietly  i draw it at lady malloring  well i wont argue that with you but it really is a scandal that tods wife should incite her young people to stir up the villagers goodness knows where that maynt lead tods cottage and land you see are freehold the only freehold thereabouts and his being a brother of stanleys makes it particularly awkward for the mallorings  quite so murmured felix  yes but my dear felix when it comes to infecting those simple people with inflated ideas of their rights its serious especially in the country im told theres really quite a violent feeling i hear from alice gaunt that the young tods have been going about saying that dogs are better off than people treated in this fashion which of course is all nonsense and making far too much of a small matter dont you think so  but felix only smiled his peculiar sweetish smile and answered  im glad to have come down just now  clara who did not know that when felix smiled like that he was angry agreed  yes she said youre an observer you will see the thing in right perspective  i shall endeavor to what does tod say  oh tod never seems to say anything at least i never hear of it  felix murmured  tod is a well in the desert  to which deep saying clara made no reply not indeed understanding in the least what it might signify  that evening when alan having had his fill of billiards had left the smokingroom and gone to bed felix remarked to stanley  i say what sort of people are these mallorings  stanley who was settling himself for the twenty minutes of whiskey potash and a review with which he commonly composed his mind before retiring answered negligently  the mallorings oh about the best type of landowner weve got  what exactly do you mean by that  stanley took his time to answer for below his bluff goodnature he had the tenacious if somewhat slow precision of an english man of business mingled with a certain mistrust of old felix  well he said at last they build good cottages yellow brick dd ugly i must say look after the character of their tenants give em rebate of rent if theres a bad harvest encourage stockbreedin and machinerytheyve got some of my ploughs but the people dont like em and as a matter of fact theyre righttheyre not made for these small fields set an example goin to church patronize the rifle range buy up the pubs when they can and run em themselves send out jelly and let people over their place on bank holidays dash it all i dont know what they dont do why  are they liked  liked no i should hardly think they were liked respected and all that mallorings a steady fellow keen man on housing and a gentleman shes a bit too much perhaps on the pious side theyve got one of the finest georgian houses in the country altogether theyre what you call model  but not human  stanley slightly lowered the review and looked across it at his brother it was evident to him that old felix was in one of his freethinking moods  theyre domestic he said and fond of their children and pleasant neighbors i dont deny that theyve got a tremendous sense of duty but we want that in these days  duty to what  stanley raised his level eyebrows it was a stumper without great care he felt that he would be getting over the border into the uncharted land of speculation and philosophy wandering on paths that led him nowhere  if you lived in the country old man he said you wouldnt ask that sort of question  you dont imagine said felix that you or the mallorings live in the country why you landlords are every bit as much town dwellers as i amthought habit dress faith souls all town stuff there is no country in england now for us of the upper classes its gone i repeat duty to what  and rising he went over to the window looking out at the moonlit lawn overcome by a sudden aversion from more talk of what use were words from a mind tuned in one key to a mind tuned in another and yet so ingrained was his habit of discussion that he promptly went on  the mallorings ive not the slightest doubt believe it their duty to look after the morals of those who live on their property there are three things to be said about that oneyou cant make people moral by adopting the attitude of the schoolmaster twoit implies that they consider themselves more moral than their neighbors threeits a theory so convenient to their security that they would be exceptionally good people if they did not adopt it but from your account they are not so much exceptionally as just typically good people what you call their sense of duty stanley is really their sense of selfpreservation coupled with their sense of superiority  hm said stanley i dont know that i quite follow you  i always hate an odor of sanctity id prefer them to say frankly this is my property and youll jolly well do what i tell you on it  but my dear chap after all they really are superior  that said felix i emphatically question put your mallorings to earn their living on fifteen to eighteen shillings a week and where would they be the mallorings have certain virtues no doubt natural to their fortunate environment but of the primitive virtues of patience hardihood perpetual almost unconscious selfsacrifice and cheerfulness in the face of a hard fate they are no more the equals of the people they pretend to be superior to than i am your equal as a man of business  hang it was stanleys answer what a dd old heretic you are  felix frowned am i be honest take the life of a malloring and take it at its best see how it stands comparison in the ordinary virtues with those of an averagely good specimen of a farmlaborer your malloring is called with a cup of tea at say seven oclock out of a nice clean warm bed he gets into a bath that has been got ready for him into clothes and boots that have been brushed for him and goes down to a room where theres a fire burning already if its a cold day writes a few letters perhaps before eating a breakfast of exactly what he likes nicely prepared for him and reading the newspaper that best comforts his soul when he has eaten and read he lights his cigar or his pipe and attends to his digestion in the most sanitary and comfortable fashion then in his study he sits down to steady direction of other people either by interview or by writing letters or what not in this way between directing people and eating what he likes he passes the whole day except that for two or three hours sometimes indeed seven or eight hours he attends to his physique by riding motoring playing a game or indulging in a sport that he has chosen for himself and at the end of all that he probably has another bath that has been made ready for him puts on clean clothes that have been put out for him goes down to a good dinner that has been cooked for him smokes reads learns and inwardly digests or else plays cards billiards and acts host till he is sleepy and so to bed in a clean warm bed in a clean fresh room is that exaggerated  no but when you talk of his directing other people you forget that he is doing what they couldnt  he may be doing what they couldnt but ordinary directive ability is not born in a man its acquired by habit and training suppose fortune had reversed them at birth the gaunt or tryst would by now have it and the malloring would not the accident that they were not reversed at birth has given the malloring a thousandfold advantage  its no joke directing things muttered stanley  no work is any joke but i just put it to you simply as work without taking in the question of reward would you dream for a minute of swapping your work with the work of one of your workmen no well neither would a malloring with one of his gaunts so that my boy for work which is intrinsically more interesting and pleasurable the malloring gets a hundred to a thousand times more money  all this is rank socialism my dear fellow  no rank truth now to take the life of a gaunt he gets up summer and winter much earlier out of a bed that he cannot afford time or money to keep too clean or warm in a small room that probably has not a large enough window into clothes stiff with work and boots stiff with clay makes something hot for himself very likely brings some of it to his wife and children goes out attending to his digestion crudely and without comfort works with his hands and feet from half past six or seven in the morning till past five at night except that twice he stops for an hour or so and eats simple things that he would not altogether have chosen to eat if he could have had his will he goes home to a tea that has been got ready for him and has a cleanup without assistance smokes a pipe of shag reads a newspaper perhaps two days old and goes out again to work for his own good in his vegetable patch or to sit on a wooden bench in an atmosphere of beer and baccy and so dead tired but not from directing other people he drowses himself to early lying again in his doubtful bed is that exaggerated  i suppose not but he  has his compensations clean consciencefreedom from worryfresh air all the rest of it i know clean conscience granted but so has your malloring it would seem freedom from worryyes except when a pair of boots is wanted or one of the children is ill then he has to make up for lost time with a vengeance fresh airand wet clothes with a good chance of premature rheumatism candidly which of those two lives demands more of the virtues on which human life is foundedcourage and patience hardihood and selfsacrifice and which of two men who have lived those two lives well has most right to the word superior  stanley dropped the review and for fully a minute paced the room without reply then he said  felix youre talking flat revolution  felix who faintly smiling had watched him up and down up and down the turkey carpet answered  not so i am by no means a revolutionary person because with all the goodwill in the world i have been unable to see how upheavals from the bottom or violence of any sort is going to equalize these lives or do any good but i detest humbug and i believe that so long as you and your mallorings go on blindly dosing yourselves with humbug about duty and superiority so long will you see things as they are not and until you see things as they are purged of all that sickening cant you will none of you really move to make the conditions of life more and ever more just for mark you stanley i who do not believe in revolution from the bottom the more believe that it is up to us in honour to revolutionize things from the top  hm said stanley thats all very well but the more you give the more they want till theres no end to it  felix stared round that room where indeed one was all body  by george he said ive yet to see a beginning but anyway if you give in a grudging spirit or the spirit of a schoolmaster what can you expect if you offer out of real goodwill so it is taken and suddenly conscious that he had uttered a constructive phrase felix cast down his eyes and added  i am going to my clean warm bed good night old man  when his brother had taken up his candlestick and gone stanley uttering a dubious sound sat down on the lounge drank deep out of his tumbler and once more took up his review   chapter vii   the next day stanleys car fraught with felix and a note from clara moved swiftly along the grassbordered roads toward joyfields lying back on the cushioned seat the warm air flying at his face felix contemplated with delight his favorite countryside certainly this garden of england was very lovely its greenness trees and large pied lazy cattle its very emptiness of human beings even was pleasing  nearing joyfields he noted the mallorings park and their long georgian house carefully fronting south there too was the pond of what village there was with the usual ducks on it and three wellremembered cottages in a row neat and trim of the old thatched sort but evidently restored out of the door of one of them two young people had just emerged going in the same direction as the car felix passed them and turned to look yes it was they he stopped the car they were walking with eyes straight before them frowning and felix thought nothing of tod in either of them regular celts  the girls vivid open face crisp brown untidy hair cheeks brimful of color thick lips eyes that looked up and out as a skye terriers eyes look out of its shagginessindeed her whole figure struck felix as almost frighteningly vital and she walked as if she despised the ground she covered the boy was even more arresting what a strange paledark face with its black uncovered hair its straight black brows what a proud swanseyed thinlipped straightnosed young devil marching like a very highlander though still rather runup from sheer youthfulness they had come abreast of the car by now and leaning out he said  you dont remember me im afraid the boy shook his head wonderful eyes he had but the girl put out her hand  of course derek its uncle felix  they both smiled now the girl friendly the boy rather drawn back into himself and feeling strangely small and ill at ease felix murmured  im going to see your father can i give you a lift home  the answer came as he expected  no thanks then as if to tone it down the girl added  weve got something to do first youll find him in the orchard  she had a ringing voice full of warmth lifting his hat felix passed on they were a couple strange attractive almost frightening kirsteen had brought his brother a formidable little brood  arriving at the cottage he went up its mossy stones and through the wicket gate there was little change indeed since the days of claras visit save that the beehives had been moved farther out nor did any one answer his knock and mindful of the girls words youll find him in the orchard he made his way out among the trees the grass was long and starred with petals felix wandered over it among bees busy with the appleblossom at the very end he came on his brother cutting down a peartree tod was in shirtsleeves his brown arms bare almost to the shoulders how tremendous the fellow was what resounding and terrific blows he was dealing down came the tree and tod drew his arm across his brow this great burnt curlyheaded fellow was more splendid to look upon than even felix had remembered and so well built that not a movement of his limbs was heavy his cheekbones were very broad and high his brows thick and rather darker than his bright hair so that his deepset very blue eyes seemed to look out of a thicket his level white teeth gleamed from under his tawny moustache and his brown unshaven cheeks and jaw seemed covered with gold powder catching sight of felix he came forward  fancy he said old gladstone spending his leisure cutting down treesof all melancholy jobs  felix did not quite know what to answer so he put his arm within his brothers tod drew him toward the tree  sit down he said then looking sorrowfully at the peartree he murmured  seventy yearsand down in seven minutes now we shall burn it well it had to go this is the third year its had no blossom  his speech was slow like that of a man accustomed to think aloud felix admired him askance i might live next door he thought for all the notice hes taken of my turning up  i came over in stanleys car he said met your two coming alongfine couple they are  ah said tod and there was something in the way he said it that was more than a mere declaration of pride or of affection then he looked at felix  what have you come for old man  felix smiled quaint way to put it  for a talk  ah said tod and he whistled  a largish wellmade dog with a sleek black coat white underneath and a black tail whitetipped came running up and stood before tod with its head rather to one side and its yellowbrown eyes saying i simply must get at what youre thinking you know  go and tell your mistress to comemistress  the dog moved his tail lowered it and went off  a gypsy gave him to me said tod best dog that ever lived  every one thinks that of his own dog old man  yes said tod but this is  he looks intelligent  hes got a soul said tod the gypsy said he didnt steal him but he did  do you always know when people arent speaking the truth then  yes  at such a monstrous remark from any other man felix would have smiled but seeing it was tod he only asked how  people who arent speaking the truth look you in the face and never move their eyes  some people do that when they are speaking the truth  yes but when they arent you can see them struggling to keep their eyes straight a dog avoids your eye when hes something to conceal a man stares at you listen  felix listened and heard nothing  a wren and screwing up his lips tod emitted a sound look  felix saw on the branch of an appletree a tiny brown bird with a little beak sticking out and a little tail sticking up and he thought tods hopeless  that fellow said tod softly has got his nest there just behind us again he emitted the sound felix saw the little bird move its head with a sort of infinite curiosity and hop twice on the branch  i cant get the hen to do that tod murmured  felix put his hand on his brothers armwhat an arm  yes he said but look here old mani really want to talk to you  tod shook his head wait for her he said  felix waited tod was getting awfully eccentric living this queer outoftheway life with a cranky woman year after year never reading anything never seeing any one but tramps and animals and villagers and yet sitting there beside his eccentric brother on that fallen tree he had an extraordinary sense of rest it was perhaps but the beauty and sweetness of the day with its dappling sunlight brightening the appleblossoms the windflowers the woodsorrel and in the blue sky above the fields those clouds so unimaginably white all the tiny noises of the orchard too struck on his ear with a peculiar meaning a strange fulness as if he had never heard such sounds before tod who was looking at the sky said suddenly  are you hungry  and felix remembered that they never had any proper meals but when hungry went to the kitchen where a woodfire was always burning and either heated up coffee and porridge that was already made with boiled eggs and baked potatoes and apples or devoured bread cheese jam honey cream tomatoes butter nuts and fruit that were always set out there on a wooden table under a muslin awning he remembered too that they washed up their own bowls and spoons and plates and having finished went outside and drew themselves a draught of water queer life and deuced uncomfortablealmost chinese in its reversal of everything that every one else was doing  no he said im not  i am here she is  felix felt his heart beatingclara was not alone in being frightened of this woman she was coming through the orchard with the dog a remarkablelooking womanoh certainly remarkable she greeted him without surprise and sitting down close to tod said im glad to see you  why did this family somehow make him feel inferior the way she sat there and looked at him so calmly still more the way she narrowed her eyes and wrinkled her lips as if rather malicious thoughts were rising in her soul her hair as is the way of fine soft almost indigocolored hair was already showing threads of silver her whole face and figure thinner than he had remembered but a striking woman stillwith wonderful eyes her dressfelix had scanned many a crank in his daywas not so alarming as it had once seemed to clara its coarsewoven deepblue linen and needleworked yoke were pleasing to him and he could hardly take his gaze from the kingfisherblue band or fillet that she wore round that silverthreaded black hair  he began by giving her claras note the wording of which he had himself dictated   dear kirsteen  though we have not seen each other for so long i am sure you will forgive my writing it would give us so much pleasure if you and the two children would come over for a night or two while felix and his young folk are staying with us it is no use i fear to ask tod but of course if he would come too both stanley and myself would be delighted  yours cordially  clara freeland   she read it handed it to tod who also read it and handed it to felix nobody said anything it was so altogether simple and friendly a note that felix felt pleased with it thinking i expressed that well  then tod said go ahead old man youve got something to say about the youngsters havent you  how on earth did he know that but then tod had a sort of queer prescience  well he brought out with an effort dont you think its a pity to embroil your young people in village troubles weve been hearing from stanley  kirsteen interrupted in her calm staccato voice with just the faintest lisp  stanley would not understand  she had put her arm through tods but never removed her eyes from her brotherinlaws face  possibly said felix but you must remember that stanley john and myself represent ordinarywhat shall we saylevelheaded opinion  with which we have nothing in common im afraid  felix glanced from her to tod the fellow had his head on one side and seemed listening to something in the distance and felix felt a certain irritation  its all very well he said but i think you really have got to look at your childrens future from a larger point of view you dont surely want them to fly out against things before theyve had a chance to see life for themselves  she answered  the children know more of life than most young people theyve seen it close to theyve seen its realities they know what the tyranny of the countryside means  yes yes said felix but youth is youth  they are not too young to know and feel the truth  felix was impressed how those narrowing eyes shone what conviction in that faintly lisping voice  i am a fool for my pains he thought and only said  well what about this invitation anyway  yes it will be just the thing for them at the moment  the words had to felix a somewhat sinister import he knew well enough that she did not mean by them what others would have meant but he said when shall we expect them tuesday i suppose would be best for clara after her weekend is there no chance of you and tod  she quaintly wrinkled her lips into not quite a smile and answered  tod shall say do you hear tod  in the meadow it was there yesterdayfirst time this year  felix slipped his arm through his brothers  quite so old man  what said tod ah lets go in im awfully hungry  sometimes out of a calm sky a few drops fall the twigs rustle and far away is heard the muttering of thunder the traveller thinks a storm somewhere about then all once more is so quiet and peaceful that he forgets he ever had that thought and goes on his way careless  so with felix returning to becket in stanleys car that womans face those two young heathensthe unconscious tod  there was mischief in the air above that little household but once more the smooth gliding of the cushioned car the soft peace of the meadows so permanently at grass the churches mansions cottages embowered among their elms the slowflapping flight of the rooks and crows lulled felix to quietude and the faint far muttering of that thunder died away  nedda was in the drive when he returned gazing at a nymph set up there by clara it was a good thing procured from berlin well known for sculpture and beginning to green over already as though it had been there a long timea pretty creature with shoulders drooping eyes modestly cast down and a sparrow perching on her head  well dad  theyre coming  when  on tuesdaythe youngsters only  you might tell me a little about them  but felix only smiled his powers of description faltered before that task and proud of those powers he did not choose to subject them to failure   chapter viii   not till three oclock that saturday did the bigwigs begin to come lord and lady britto first from erne by car then sir gerald and lady malloring also by car from joyfields an early afternoon train brought three members of the lower house who liked a round of golfcolonel martlett mr sleesor and sir john fanfarwith their wives also miss bawtrey an american who went everywhere and moorsome the landscapepainter a short very heavy man who went nowhere and that in almost perfect silence which he afterward avenged by a train almost sure to bring no one else came literature in public affairs alone henry wiltram whom some believed to have been the very first to have ideas about the land he was followed in the last possible train by cuthcott the advanced editor in his habitual hurry and lady maude ughtred in her beauty clara was pleased and said to stanley while dressing that almost every shade of opinion about the land was represented this weekend she was not she said afraid of anything if she could keep henry wiltram and cuthcott apart the house of commons men would of course be all right stanley assented theyll be fed up with talk but how about brittohe can sometimes be very nasty and cuthcotts been pretty rough on him in his rag  clara had remembered that and she was putting lady maude on one side of cuthcott and moorsome on the other so that he would be quite safe at dinner and afterwardstanley must look out  what have you done with nedda stanley asked  given her to colonel martlett with sir john fanfar on the other side they both like something fresh she hoped however to foster a discussion so that they might really get further this weekend the opportunity was too good to throw away  hm stanley murmured felix said some very queer things the other night he too might make ructions  oh noclara persistedfelix had too much good taste she thought that something might be coming out of this occasion something as it were national that would bear fruit and watching stanley buttoning his braces she grew enthusiastic for think how splendidly everything was represented britto with his view that the thing had gone too far and all the little efforts we might make now were no good with canada and those great spaces to outbid anything we could do though she could not admit that he was right there was a lot in what he said he had great giftsand some day mightwho knew then there was sir johnclara pursuedwho was almost the father of the new tory policy assist the farmers to buy their own land and colonel martlett representing the older tory policy of what the devil would happen to the landowners if they did secretly clara felt sure he would never go into a lobby to support that he had said to her look at my brother jamess property if we bring this policy in and the farmers take advantage his house might stand there any day without an acre round it quite trueit might the same might even happen to becket  stanley grunted  exactlyclara went on and that was the beauty of having got the mallorings theirs was such a steady point of view and she was not sure that they werent right and the whole thing really a question of model proprietorship  hm stanley muttered felix will have his knife into that  clara did not think that mattered the thing was to get everybodys opinion even mr moorsomes would be valuableif he werent so terrifically silent for he must think a lot sitting all day as he did painting the land  hes a heavy ass said stanley  yes but clara did not wish to be narrow that was why it was so splendid to have got mr sleesor if anybody knew the radical mind he did and he could give full force to what one always felt was at the bottom of itthat the radicals real supporters were the urban classes so that their policy must not go too far with the land for fear of seeming to neglect the towns for after all in the end it was out of the pockets of the towns that the land would have to be financed and nobody really could expect the towns to get anything out of it stanley paused in the adjustment of his tie his wife was a shrewd woman  youve hit it there he said wiltram will give it him hot on that though  of course clara assented and it was magnificent that they had got henry wiltram with his idealism and his really heavy corn tax not caring what happened to the stunted products of the townsand they truly were stunted for all that the radicals and the halfpenny press saidtill at all costs we could grow our own food there was a lot in that  yes stanley muttered and if he gets on to it shant i have a jolly time of it in the smokingroom i know what cuthcotts like with his shirt out  claras eyes brightened she was very curious herself to see mr cuthcott with histhat is to hear him expound the doctrine he was always writing up namely that the land was gone and short of revolution there was nothing for it but garden cities she had heard he was so cutting and ferocious that he really did seem as if he hated his opponents she hoped he would get a chanceperhaps felix could encourage him  what about the women stanley asked suddenly will they stand a political powwow one must think of them a bit  clara had she was taking a farewell look at herself in the faraway mirror through the door into her bedroom it was a mistakeshe addedto suppose that women were not interested in the land lady britto was most intelligent and mildred malloring knew every cottage on her estate  pokes her nose into em often enough stanley muttered  lady fanfar again and mrs sleesor and even hilda martlett were interested in their husbands and miss bawtrey of course interested in everything as for maude ughtred all talk would be the same to her she was always weekending stanley need not worryit would be all right some real work would get done some real advance be made so saying she turned her fine shoulders twice once this way and once that and went out she had never told even stanley her ambition that at becket under her aegis should be laid the foundationstone of the real scheme whatever it might be that should regenerate the land stanley would only have laughed even though it would be bound to make him lord freeland when it came to be known some day  to the eyes and ears of nedda that evening at dinner all was new indeed and all wonderful it was not that she was unaccustomed to society or to conversation for to their house at hampstead many people came uttering many words but both the people and the words were so very different after the first blush the first reconnaissance of the two bigwigs between whom she sat her eyes would stray and her ears would only half listen to them indeed half her ears she soon found out were quite enough to deal with colonel martlett and sir john fanfar across the azaleas she let her glance come now and again to anchor on her fathers face and exchanged with him a most enjoyable blink she tried once or twice to get through to alan but he was always eating he looked very like a young uncle stanley this evening  what was she feeling short quick stabs of selfconsciousness as to how she was looking a sort of stunned excitement due to sheer noise and the number of things offered to her to eat and drink keen pleasure in the consciousness that colonel martlett and sir john fanfar and other men especially that nice one with the straggly moustache who looked as if he were going to bite glanced at her when they saw she wasnt looking if only she had been quite certain that it was not because they thought her too young to be there she felt a sort of continual exhilaration that this was the great worldthe world where important things were said and done together with an intense listening expectancy and a sense most unexpected and almost frightening that nothing important was being said or would be done but this she knew to be impudent on sunday evenings at home people talked about a future existence about nietzsche tolstoy chinese pictures postimpressionism and would suddenly grow hot and furious about peace and strauss justice marriage and de maupassant and whether people were losing their souls through materialism and sometimes one of them would get up and walk about the room but tonight the only words she could catch were the names of two politicians whom nobody seemed to approve of except that nice one who was going to bite once very timidly she asked colonel martlett whether he liked strauss and was puzzled by his answer rather those tales of hoffmann are rippin dont you think you go to the opera much she could not of course know that the thought which instantly rose within her was doing the governing classes a grave injusticealmost all of whom save colonel martlett knew that the tales of hoffmann were by one offenbach but beyond all things she felt she would never never learn to talk as they were all talkingso quickly so continuously so without caring whether everybody or only the person they were talking to heard what they said she had always felt that what you said was only meant for the person you said it to but here in the great world she must evidently not say anything that was not meant for everybody and she felt terribly that she could not think of anything of that sort to say and suddenly she began to want to be alone that however was surely wicked and wasteful when she ought to be learning such a tremendous lot and yet what was there to learn and listening just sufficiently to colonel martlett who was telling her how great a man he thought a certain general she looked almost despairingly at the one who was going to bite he was quite silent at that moment gazing at his plate which was strangely empty and nedda thought he has jolly wrinkles about his eyes only they might be heart disease and i like the color of his face so nice and yellow only that might be liver but i do like himi wish id been sitting next to him he looks real from that thought of the reality of a man whose name she did not know she passed suddenly into the feeling that nothing else of this about her was real at all neither the talk nor the faces not even the things she was eating it was all a queer buzzing dream nor did that sensation of unreality cease when her aunt began collecting her gloves and they trooped forth to the drawingroom there seated between mrs sleesor and lady britto with lady malloring opposite and miss bawtrey leaning over the piano toward them she pinched herself to get rid of the feeling that when all these were out of sight of each other they would become silent and have on their lips a little bitter smile would it be like that up in their bedrooms or would it only be on her neddas own lips that this little smile would come it was a question she could not answer nor could she very well ask it of any of these ladies she looked them over as they sat there talking and felt very lonely and suddenly her eyes fell on her grandmother frances freeland was seated halfway down the long room in a sandalwood chair somewhat insulated by a surrounding sea of polished floor she sat with a smile on her lips quite still save for the continual movement of her white hands on her black lap to her gray hair some lace of chantilly was pinned with a little diamond brooch and hung behind her delicate but rather long ears and from her shoulders was depended a silvery garment of stuff that looked like the mail shirt of a fairy reaching the ground on either side a tacit agreement had evidently been come to that she was incapable of discussing the land or those other subjects such as the french murder the russian opera the chinese pictures and the doings of one l  whose fate was just then in the air so that she sat alone  and nedda thought how much more of a lady she looks than anybody here theres something deep in her to rest on that isnt in the bigwigs perhaps its because shes of a different generation and getting up she went over and sat down beside her on a little chair  frances freeland rose at once and said  now my darling you cant be comfortable in that tiny chair you must take mine  oh no granny please  oh yes but you must its so comfortable and ive simply been longing to sit in the chair youre in now darling to please me  seeing that a prolonged struggle would follow if she did not get up nedda rose and changed chairs  do you like these weekends granny  frances freeland seemed to draw her smile more resolutely across her face with her perfect articulation in which there was however no trace of bigwiggery she answered  i think theyre most interesting darling its so nice to see new people of course you dont get to know them but its very amusing to watch especially the headdresses and sinking her voice just look at that one with the feather going straight up did you ever see such a guy and she cackled with a very gentle archness gazing at that almost priceless feather trying to reach god nedda felt suddenly how completely she was in her grandmothers little camp how entirely she disliked bigwiggery  frances freelands voice brought her round  do you know darling ive found the most splendid thing for eyebrows you just put a little on every night and it keeps them in perfect order i must give you my little pot  i dont like grease granny  oh but this isnt grease darling its a special thing and you only put on just the tiniest touch  diving suddenly into the recesses of something she produced an exiguous round silver box prizing it open she looked over her shoulder at the bigwigs then placed her little finger on the contents of the little box and said very softly  you just take the merest touch and you put it on like that and it keeps them together beautifully let me nobodyll see  quite well understanding that this was all part of her grandmothers passion for putting the best face upon things and having no belief in her eyebrows nedda bent forward but in a sudden flutter of fear lest the bigwigs might observe the operation she drew back murmuring oh granny darling not just now  at that moment the men came in and under cover of the necessary confusion she slipped away into the window  it was pitchblack outside with the moon not yet up the bloomy peaceful dark out there wistaria and early roses clustering in had but the ghost of color on their blossoms nedda took a rose in her fingers feeling with delight its soft fragility its coolness against her hot palm here in her hand was a living thing here was a little soul and out there in the darkness were millions upon millions of other little souls of little flamelike or coiledup shapes alive and true  a voice behind her said  nothing nicer than darkness is there  she knew at once it was the one who was going to bite the voice was proper for him having a nice smothery sound and looking round gratefully she said  do you like dinnerparties  it was jolly to watch his eyes twinkle and his thin cheeks puff out he shook his head and muttered through that straggly moustache  youre a niece arent you i know your father hes a big man  hearing those words spoken of her father nedda flushed  yes he is she said fervently  her new acquaintance went on  hes got the gift of truthcan laugh at himself as well as others thats what makes him precious these hummingbirds here tonight couldnt raise a smile at their own tomfoolery to save their silly souls  he spoke still in that voice of smothery wrath and nedda thought he is nice  theyve been talking about the landhe raised his hands and ran them through his palish hairthe land heavenly father the land why look at that fellow  nedda looked and saw a man like richard coeur de lion in the history books with a strawcolored moustache just going gray  sir gerald malloringhope hes not a friend of yours divine right of landowners to lead the land by the nose and our friend britto  nedda following his eyes saw a robust quickeyed man with a suave insolence in his dark cleanshaved face  because at heart hes just a supercilious ruffian too coldblooded to feel hell demonstrate that its no use to feelwaste of valuable timeha valuableto act in any direction and thats a man they believe things of and poor henry wiltram with his pathetic grow our own foodmaximum use of the land as foodproducer and let the rest take care of itself as if we werent all long past that feeble individualism as if in these days of world markets the land didnt stand or fall in this country as a breedingground of health and stamina and nothing else well well  arent they really in earnest then asked nedda timidly  miss freeland this land question is a perfect tragedy bar one or two they all want to make the omelette without breaking eggs well by the time they begin to think of breaking them mark metherell be no eggs to break we shall be all park and suburb the real men on the land what few are left are dumb and helpless and these fellows here for one reason or another dont mean businesstheyll talk and tinker and topdressthats all does your father take any interest in this he could write something very nice  he takes interest in everything said nedda please go on mrmr she was terribly afraid he would suddenly remember that she was too young and stop his nice angry talk  cuthcott im an editor but i was brought up on a farm and know something about it you see we english are grumblers snobs to the backbone want to be something better than we are and education nowadays is all in the direction of despising what is quiet and humdrum we never were a stayathome lot like the french thats at the back of this businessthey may treat it as they like radicals or tories but if they cant get a fundamental change of opinion into the national mind as to what is a sane and profitable life if they cant work a revolution in the spirit of our education theyll do no good therell be lots of talk and tinkering tariffs and tommyrot and underneath the landbred men dying dying all the time no madam industrialism and vested interests have got us bar the most strenuous national heroism theres nothing for it now but the garden city  then if we were all heroic the land could still be saved  mr cuthcott smiled  of course we might have a european war or something that would shake everything up but short of that when was a country ever consciously and homogeneously heroicexcept china with its opium when did it ever deliberately change the spirit of its education the trend of its ideas when did it ever of its own free will lay its vested interests on the altar when did it ever say with a convinced and resolute heart i will be healthy and simple before anything i will not let the love of sanity and natural conditions die out of me when miss freeland when  and looking so hard at nedda that he almost winked he added  you have the advantage of me by thirty years youll see what i shall notthe last of the english peasant did you ever read erewhon where the people broke up their machines it will take almost that sort of national heroism to save whats left of him even  for answer nedda wrinkled her brows horribly before her there had come a vision of the old lame man whose name she had found out was gaunt standing on the path under the appletrees looking at that little something he had taken from his pocket why she thought of him thus suddenly she had no idea and she said quickly  its awfully interesting i do so want to hear about the land i only know a little about sweated workers because i see something of them  its all of a piece said mr cuthcott not politics at all but religiontouches the point of national selfknowledge and faith the point of knowing what we want to become and of resolving to become it your father will tell you that we have no more idea of that at present than a cat of its own chemical composition as for these good people here tonighti dont want to be disrespectful but if they think theyre within a hundred miles of the land question im aim a jingomore i cant say  and as if to cool his head he leaned out of the window  nothing is nicer than darkness as i said just now because you can only see the way you must go instead of a hundred and fifty ways you might in darkness your soul is something like your own in daylight lamplight moonlight never  neddas spirit gave a jump he seemed almost at last to be going to talk about the things she wanted above all to find out her cheeks went hot she clenched her hands and said resolutely  mr cuthcott do you believe in god  mr cuthcott made a queer deep little noise it was not a laugh however and it seemed as if he knew she could not bear him to look at her just then  hm he said every one does thataccording to their natures some call god it some him some her nowadaysthats all you might as well askdo i believe that im alive  yes said nedda but which do you call god  as she asked that he gave a wriggle and it flashed through her he must think me an awful enfant terrible his face peered round at her queer and pale and puffy with nice straight eyes and she added hastily  it isnt a fair question is it only you talked about darkness and the only wayso i thought  quite a fair question my answer is of course all three but the point is rather does one wish to make even an attempt to define god to oneself frankly i dont im content to feel that there is in one some kind of instinct toward perfection that one will still feel i hope when the lights are going out some kind of honour forbidding one to let go and give up thats all ive got i really dont know that i want more  nedda clasped her hands  i like that she said onlywhat is perfection mr cuthcott  again he emitted that deep little sound  ah he repeated what is perfection awkward thatisnt it  is itnedda rushed the words outis it always to be sacrificing yourself or is itis it always to beto be expressing yourself  to someone to somethe other to somehalf one half the other  but which is it to me  ah that youve got to find out for yourself theres a sort of metronome inside uswonderful selladjusting little machine most delicate bit of mechanism in the worldpeople call it consciencethat records the proper beat of our tempos i guess thats all we have to go by  nedda said breathlessly  yes and its frightfully hard isnt it  exactly mr cuthcott answered thats why people devised religions and other ways of having the thing done secondhand we all object to trouble and responsibility if we can possibly avoid it where do you live  in hampstead  your father must be a standby isnt he  oh yes dads splendid only you see i am a good deal younger than he there was just one thing i was going to ask you are these very bigwigs  mr cuthcott turned to the room and let his screwedup glance wander he looked just then particularly as if he were going to bite  if you take em at their own valuation yes if at the countrys soso if at mine ha i know what youd like to ask should i be a bigwig in their estimation not i as you knock about miss freeland youll find out one thingall bigwiggery is founded on scratch my back and ill scratch yours seriously these are only tenpenny ones but the mischief is that in the matter of the land the men who really are in earnest are precious scarce nothing short of a rising such as there was in 1832 would make the land question real even for the moment not that i want to see onegod forbid those poor doomed devils were treated worse than dogs and would be again  before nedda could pour out questions about the rising in 1832 stanleys voice said  cuthcott i want to introduce you  her new friend screwed his eyes up tighter and muttering something put out his hand to her  thank you for our talk i hope we shall meet again any time you want to know anythingill be only too glad good night  she felt the squeeze of his hand warm and dry but rather soft as of a man who uses a pen too much saw him following her uncle across the room with his shoulders a little hunched as if preparing to inflict and ward off blows and with the thought he must be jolly when he gives them one she turned once more to the darkness than which he had said there was nothing nicer it smelled of newmown grass was full of little shiverings of leaves and all colored like the bloom of a black grape and her heart felt soothed   chapter ix   when i first saw derek i thought i should never feel anything but shy and hopeless in four days only in four days the whole world is different and yet if it hadnt been for that thunderstorm i shouldnt have got over being shy in time he has never loved anybodynor have i it cant often be like thatit makes it solemn theres a picture somewherenot a good one i knowof a young highlander being taken away by soldiers from his sweetheart derek is fiery and wild and shy and proud and darklike the man in that picture that last day along the hillsalong and alongwith the wind in our faces i could have walked forever and then joyfields at the end their mothers wonderful im afraid of her but uncle tod is a perfect dear i never saw any one before who noticed so many things that i didnt and nothing that i did i am sure he has in him what mr cuthcott said we were all losingthe love of simple natural conditions and then the moment when i stood with derek at the end of the orchard to say goodby the field below covered with those moonywhite flowers and the cows all dark and sleepy the holy feeling down there was wonderful and in the branches over our heads too and the velvety starry sky and the dewiness against ones face and the great broad silenceit was all worshipping something and i was worshippingworshipping happiness i was happy and i think he was perhaps i shall never be so happy again when he kissed me i didnt think the whole world had so much happiness in it i know now that im not cold a bit i used to think i was i believe i could go with him anywhere and do anything he wanted what would dad think only the other day i was saying i wanted to know everything one only knows through love its love that makes the world all beautifulmakes it like those pictures that seem to be wrapped in gold makes it like a dreamno not like a dreamlike a wonderful tune i suppose thats glamoura goldeny misty lovely feeling as if my soul were wandering about with hisnot in my body at all i want it to go on and on wanderingoh i dont want it back in my body all hard and inquisitive and aching i shall never know anything so lovely as loving him and being loved i dont want anything morenothing stay with me pleasehappiness dont go away and leave me they frighten me though he frightens metheir idealism wanting to do great things and fight for justice if only id been brought up more like thatbut everythings been so different its their mother i think even more than themselves i seem to have grown up just looking on at life as at a show watching it thinking about it trying to understandnot living it at all i must get over that i will i believe i can tell the very moment i began to love him it was in the schoolroom the second evening sheila and i were sitting there just before dinner and he came in a rage looking splendid that footman put out everything just as if i were a babyasked me for suspenders to fasten on my socks hung the things on a chair in order as if i couldnt find out for myself what to put on first turned the tongues of my shoes outcurled them over then derek looked at me and said do they do that for youand poor old gaunt whos sixtysix and lame has three shillings a week to buy him everything just think of that if we had the pluck of flies and he clenched his fists but sheila got up looked hard at me and said thatll do derek then he put his hand on my arm and said its only cousin nedda i began to love him then and i believe he saw it because i couldnt take my eyes away but it was when sheila sang the red sarafan after dinner that i knew for certain the red sarafanits a wonderful song all space and yearning and yet such calmits the song of the soul and he was looking at me while she sang how can he love me i am nothingno good for anything alan calls him a runup kid all legs and wings sometimes i hate alan hes conventional and stodgythe funny thing is that he admires sheila shell wake him up shell stick pins into him no i dont want alan hurti want every one in the world to be happy happyas i am the next day was the thunderstorm i never saw lightning so nearand didnt care a bit if he were struck i knew i should be that made it all right when you love you dont care if only the something must happen to you both when it was over and we came out from behind the stack and walked home through the fields all the beasts looked at us as if we were new and had never been seen before and the air was ever so sweet and that long red line of cloud low down in the purple and the elmtrees so heavy and almost black he put his arm round me and i let him it seems an age to wait till they come to stay with us next week if only mother likes them and i can go and stay at joyfields will she like them its all so different to what it would be if they were ordinary but if he were ordinary i shouldnt love him its because theres nobody like him that isnt a loverish fancyyou only have to look at him against alan or uncle stanley or even dad everything he does is so different the way he walks and the way he stands drawn back into himself like a stag and looks out as if he were burning and smouldering inside even the way he smiles dad asked me what i thought of him that was only the second day i thought he was too proud then and dad said he ought to be in a highland regiment pitygreat pity he is a fighter of course i dont like fighting but if im not ready to hell stop loving me perhaps ive got to learn o darkness out there help me and stars help me o god make me brave and i will believe in you forever if you are the spirit that grows in things in spite of everything until theyre like the flowers so perfect that we laugh and sing at their beauty grow in me too make me beautiful and brave then i shall be fit for him alive or dead and thats all i want every evening i shall stand in spirit with him at the end of that orchard in the darkness under the trees above the white flowers and the sleepy cows and perhaps i shall feel him kiss me again im glad i saw that old man gaunt it makes what they feel more real to me he showed me that poor laborer tryst too the one who mustnt marry his wifes sister or have her staying in the house without marrying her why should people interfere with others like that it does make your blood boil derek and sheila have been brought up to be in sympathy with the poor and oppressed if they had lived in london they would have been even more furious i expect and its no use my saying to myself i dont know the laborer i dont know his hardships because he is really just the country half of what i do know and see here in london when i dont hide my eyes one talk showed me how desperately they feel at night in sheilas room when we had gone up just we four alan began it they didnt want to i could see but he was criticising what some of those bigwigs had saidthe varsity makes boys awfully conceited it was such a lovely night we were all in the big long window a little bat kept flying past and behind the copperbeech the moon was shining on the lake derek sat in the windowsill and when he moved he touched me to be touched by him gives me a warm shiver all through i could hear him gritting his teeth at what alan saidfrightfully sententious just like a newspaper we cant go into land reform from feeling we must go into it from reason then derek broke out walk through this country as weve walked see the pigsties the people live in see the water they drink see the tiny patches of ground they have see the way their roofs let in the rain see their peeky children see their patience and their hopelessness see them working day in and day out and coming on the parish at the end see all that and then talk about reason reason its the cowards excuse and the rich mans excuse for doing nothing its the excuse of the man who takes jolly good care not to see for fear that he may come to feel reason never does anything its too reasonable the thing is to act then perhaps reason will be jolted into doing something but sheila touched his arm and he stopped very suddenly she doesnt trust us i shall always be being pushed away from him by her hes just twenty and i shall be eighteen in a week couldnt we marry now at once then whatever happened i couldnt be cut off from him if i could tell dad and ask him to help me but i cantit seems desecration to talk about it even to dad all the way up in the train today coming back home i was struggling not to show anything though its hateful to keep things from dad love alters everything it melts up the whole world and makes it afresh love is the sun of our spirits and its the wind ah and the rain too but i wont think of that i wonder if hes told aunt kirsteen   chapter x   while nedda sat long past midnight writing her heart out in her little white lilaccurtained room of the old house above the spaniards road derek of whom she wrote was walking along the malvern hills hurrying upward in the darkness the stars were his companions though he was no poet having rather the fervid temper of the born swordsman that expresses itself in physical ecstasies he had come straight out from a stormy midnight talk with sheila what was he doinghad been the burden of her cryfalling in love just at this moment when they wanted all their wits and all their time and strength for this struggle with the mallorings it was foolish it was weak and with a sweet soft sort of girl who could be no use hotly he had answered what business was it of hers as if one fell in love when one wished she didnt knowher blood didnt run fast enough sheila had retorted ive more blood in my big toe than nedda in all her body a lot of use youll be with your heart mooning up in london and crouched together on the end of her bed gazing fixedly up at him through her hair she had chanted mockingly here we go gathering wool and starswool and starswool and stars  he had not deigned to answer but had gone out furious with her striding over the dark fields scrambling his way through the hedges toward the high loom of the hills up on the short grass in the cooler air with nothing between him and those swarming stars he lost his rage it never lasted longhers was more enduring with the innate lordliness of a brother he already put it down to jealousy sheila was hurt that he should want any one but her as if his love for nedda would make any difference to their resolution to get justice for tryst and the gaunts and show those landed tyrants once for all that they could not ride roughshod  nedda with her dark eyes so quick and clear so loving when they looked at him nedda soft and innocent the touch of whose lips had turned his heart to something strange within him and wakened such feelings of chivalry nedda to see whom for half a minute he felt he would walk a hundred miles  this boys education had been administered solely by his mother till he was fourteen and she had brought him up on mathematics french and heroism his extensive reading of history had been focussed on the personality of heroes chiefly knights errant and revolutionaries he had carried the worship of them to the agricultural college where he had spent four years and a rather rough time there had not succeeded in knocking romance out of him he had found that you could not have such beliefs comfortably without fighting for them and though he ended his career with the reputation of a rebel and a champion of the weak he had had to earn it to this day he still fed himself on stories of rebellions and fine deeds the figures of spartacus montrose hofer garibaldi hampden and john nicholson were more real to him than the people among whom he lived though he had learned never to mentionespecially not to the matteroffact sheilahis encompassing cloud of heroes but when he was alone he pranced a bit with them and promised himself that he too would reach the stars so you may sometimes see a little grave boy walking through a field unwatched as he believes suddenly fling his feet and his head every which way an active nature romantic without being dreamy and bookloving is not too prone to the attacks of love such a one is likely to survive unscathed to a maturer age but nedda had seduced him partly by the appeal of her touchingly manifest love and admiration and chiefly by her eyes through which he seemed to see such a loyal and loving little soul looking she had that indefinable something which lovers know that they can never throw away and he had at once made of her secretly the crown of his active romanticismthe lady waiting for the spoils of his lance queer is the heart of a boystrange its blending of reality and idealism  climbing at a great pace he reached malvern beacon just as it came dawn and stood there on the top watching he had not much aesthetic sense but he had enough to be impressed by the slow paling of the stars over space that seemed infinite so little were its dreamy confines visible in the may morning haze where the quivering crimson flags and spears of sunrise were forging up in a march upon the sky that vision of the english land at dawn wide and mysterious hardly tallied with mr cuthcotts view of a future dedicate to park and garden city while derek stood there gazing the first lark soared up and began its ecstatic praise save for that song silence possessed all the driven dark right out to the severn and the sea and the fastnesses of the welsh hills and the wrekin away in the north a black point in the gray for a moment dark and light hovered and clung together would victory wing back into night or on into day then as a town is taken all was over in one overmastering rush and light proclaimed derek tightened his belt and took a beeline down over the slippery grass he meant to reach the cottage of the laborer tryst before that early bird was away to the fields he meditated as he went bob tryst was all right if they only had a dozen or two like him a dozen or two whom they could trust and who would trust each other and stand firm to form the nucleus of a strike which could be timed for hay harvest what slaves these laborers still were if only they could be relied on if only they would stand together slavery it was slavery so long as they could be turned out of their homes at will in this fashion his rebellion against the conditions of their lives above all against the manifold petty tyrannies that he knew they underwent came from use of his eyes and ears in daily contact with a class among whom he had been more or less brought up in sympathy with and yet not of them he had the queer privilege of feeling their slights as if they were his own together with feelings of protection and even of contempt that they should let themselves be slighted he was near enough to understand how they must feel not near enough to understand why feeling as they did they did not act as he would have acted in truth he knew them no better than he should  he found tryst washing at his pump in the early morning light the big laborers square stubborn face with its strange doglike eyes had a sodden hungry lost look cutting short ablutions that certainly were never protracted he welcomed derek and motioned him to pass into the kitchen the young man went in and perched himself on the windowsill beside a pot of bridal wreath the cottage was one of the mallorings and recently repaired a little fire was burning and a teapot of stewed tea sat there beside it four cups and spoons and some sugar were put out on a deal table for tryst was in fact brewing the morning draught of himself and children who still lay abed upstairs the sight made derek shiver and his eyes darken he knew the full significance of what he saw  did you ask him again bob  yes i asked im  what did he say  said as orders was plain so long as you lives there he says along of yourself alone you cant have her come back  did you say the children wanted looking after badly did you make it clear did you say mrs tryst wished it before she  i said that  what did he say then  sorry for you mlad but thems mladys orders an i cant go contrary i dont wish to go into things he says you know bettern i how far tis gone when she was ere before but seein as mlady dont never give in to deceased wifes sister marryin if she come back tis certain to be the other thing so as that wont do neither you go elsewhere he says  having spoken thus at length tryst lifted the teapot and poured out the dark tea into the three cups  will ee have some sir  derek shook his head  taking the cups tryst departed up the narrow stairway and derek remained motionless staring at the bridal wreath till the big man came down again and retiring into a far corner sat sipping at his own cup  bob said the boy suddenly do you like being a dog put to what company your master wishes  tryst set his cup down stood up and crossed his thick armsthe swift movement from that stolid creature had in it something sinister but he did not speak  do you like it bob  ill not say what i feels mr derek thats for me what i doesll be for others praps  and he lifted his strange lowering eyes to dereks for a full minute the two stared then derek said  look out then be ready and getting off the sill he went out  on the bright slimy surface of the pond three ducks were quietly revelling in that hour before man and his damned soul the dog rose to put the fear of god into them in the sunlight against the green duckweed their whiteness was truly marvellous difficult to believe that they were not white all through passing the three cottages in the last of which the gaunts lived he came next to his own home but did not turn in and made on toward the church it was a very little one very old and had for him a curious fascination never confessed to man or beast to his mother and sheila more intolerant as became women that little lichened gray stone building was the very emblem of hypocrisy of a creed preached not practised to his father it was nothing for it was not alive and any tramp dog bird or fruittree meant far more but in derek it roused a peculiar feeling such as a man might have gazing at the shores of a native country out of which he had been thrown for no fault of his owna yearning deeply muffled up in pride and resentment not infrequently he would come and sit brooding on the grassy hillock just above the churchyard churchgoing with its pageantry its tradition dogma and demand for blind devotion would have suited him very well if only blind devotion to his mother had not stood across that threshold he could not bring himself to bow to that which viewed his rebellious mother as lost and yet the deep fibres of heredity from her papistic highland ancestors and from old pious moretons drew him constantly to this spot at times when no one would be about it was his enemy this little church the fold of all the instincts and all the qualities against which he had been brought up to rebel the very home of patronage and property and superiority the school where his friends the laborers were taught their place and yet it had that queer ironical attraction for him in some such sort had his pet hero montrose rebelled and then been drawn despite himself once more to the side of that against which he had taken arms  while he leaned against the rail gazing at that ancient edifice he saw a girl walk into the churchyard at the far end sit down on a gravestone and begin digging a little hole in the grass with the toe of her boot she did not seem to see him and at his ease he studied her face one of those broad bright english country faces with deepset rogue eyes and red thick soft lips smiling on little provocation in spite of her disgrace in spite of the fact that she was sitting on her mothers grave she did not look depressed and derek thought wilmet gaunt is the jolliest of them all she isnt a bit a bad girl as they say its only that she must have fun if they drive her out of here shell still want fun wherever she is shell go to a town and end up like those girls i saw in bristol and the memory of those night girls with their rouged faces and cringing boldness came back to him with horror  he went across the grass toward her  she looked round as he came and her face livened  well wilmet  youre an early bird mr derek  havent been to bed  oh  been up malvern beacon to see the sun rise  youre tired i expect  no  must be fine up there youd see a long ways from there near to london i should think do you know london mr derek  no  they say tis a funny place too her rogue eyes gleamed from under a heavy frown itd not be all do this an do that an you bad girl an you little hussy in london they say theres room for moren one sort of girl there  all towns are beastly places wilmet  again her rogues eyes gleamed i don know so much about that mr derek im going where i wont be chivied about and pointed at like what i am here  your dads stuck to you you ought to stick to him  ah dad hes losin his place for me but that dont stop his tongue at home tis no use to nag menag me suppose one of mladys daughters had a bit of funthey say theres lots as doive heard talesthered be none comin to chase her out of her home no my girl you cant live here no more endangerin the young men you go away best for yous where theyll teach you to beave go on out with you i dont care where you go but you just go tis as if girls were all pats o buttersame square same pattern on it same weight an all  derek had come closer he put his hand down and gripped her arm her eloquence dried up before the intentness of his face and she just stared up at him  now look here wilmet you promise me not to scoot without letting us know well get you a place to go to promise  a little sheepishly the roguegirl answered  i promise only im goin  suddenly she dimpled and broke into her broad smile  mr derek dyou know what they saythey say youre in love you was seen in th orchard ah tis all right for you and her but if any one kiss and hug me i got to go  derek drew back among the graves as if he had been struck with a whip  she looked up at him with coaxing sweetness  dont you mind me mr derek and dont you stay here neither if they saw you here with me theyd say awlook endangerin another young manpoor young man good mornin mr derek  the rogue eyes followed him gravely then once more began examining the grass and the toe of her boot again began kicking a little hole but derek did not look back   chapter xi   it is in the nature of men and angels to pursue with death such birds as are uncommon such animals as are rare and society had no use for one like tod so uncut to its pattern as to be practically unconscious of its existence not that he had deliberately turned his back on anything he had merely begun as a very young man to keep bees the better to do that he had gone on to the cultivation of flowers and fruit together with just enough farming as kept his household in vegetables milk butter and eggs living thus amongst insects birds cows and the peace of trees he had become queer his was not a very reflective mind it distilled but slowly certain large conclusions and followed intently the minute happenings of his little world to him a bee a bird a flower a tree was wellnigh as interesting as a man yet men women and especially children took to him as one takes to a newfoundland dog because though capable of anger he seemed incapable of contempt and to be endowed with a sort of permanent wonder at things then too he was good to look at which counts for more than a little in the scales of our affections indeed the slight air of absence in his blue eyes was not chilling as is that which portends a wandering of its owner on his own business people recognized that it meant some bee or other in that bonnet or elsewhere some sound or scent or sight of life suddenly perceivedalways of life he had often been observed gazing with peculiar gravity at a dead flower bee bird or beetle and if spoken to at such a moment would say gone touching a wing or petal with his finger to conceive of what happened after death did not apparently come within the few large conclusions of his reflective powers that quaint grief of his in the presence of the death of things that were not human had more than anything fostered a habit among the gentry and clergy of the neighborhood of drawing up the mouth when they spoke of him and slightly raising the shoulders for the cottagers to be sure his eccentricity consisted rather in his being a gentleman yet neither eating flesh drinking wine nor telling them how they ought to behave themselves together with the way he would sit down on anything and listen to what they had to tell him without giving them the impression that he was proud of himself for doing so in fact it was the extraordinary impression he made of listening and answering without wanting anything either for himself or for them that they could not understand how on earth it came about that he did not give them advice about their politics religion morals or monetary states was to them a neverending mystery and though they were too well bred to shrug their shoulders there did lurk in their dim minds the suspicion that the good gentleman as they called him was a tiddybit off he had of course done many practical little things toward helping them and their beasts but always as it seemed by accident so that they could never make up their minds afterward whether he remembered having done them which in fact he probably did not and this seemed to them perhaps the most damning fact of all about his beingwell about his beingnot quite all there another worrying habit he had too that of apparently not distinguishing between them and any tramps or strangers who might happen along and come across him this was in their eyes undoubtedly a fault for the village was after all their village and he as it were their property to crown all there was a story full ten years old now which had lost nothing in the telling of his treatment of a cattledrover to the village it had an eerie look that windmilllike rage let loose upon a man who after all had only been twisting a bullocks tail and running a spiked stick into its softer parts as any drover might people saidthe postman and a wagoner had seen the business raconteurs born so that the tale had perhaps lost nothingthat he had positively roared as he came leaping down into the lane upon the man a stout and thickset fellow taken him up like a baby popped him into a furzebush and held him there people said that his own bare arms had been pricked to the very shoulder from pressing the drover down into that uncompromising shrub and the mans howls had pierced the very heavens the postman to this day would tell how the mere recollection of seeing it still made him sore all over of the words assigned to tod on this occasion the mildest and probably most true were by the lord god if you treat a beast like that again ill cut your liver out you hellhearted sweep  the incident which had produced a somewhat marked effect in regard to the treatment of animals all round that neighborhood had never been forgotten nor in a sense forgiven in conjunction with the extraordinary peace and mildness of his general behavior it had endowed tod with mystery and people especially simple folk cannot bring themselves to feel quite at home with mystery children onlyto whom everything is so mysterious that nothing can betreated him as he treated them giving him their hands with confidence but children even his own as they grew up began to have a little of the village feeling toward tod his world was not theirs and what exactly his world was they could not grasp possibly it was the sense that they partook of his interest and affection too much on a level with any other kind of living thing that might happen to be about which discomfited their understanding they held him however in a certain reverence  that early morning he had already done a good two hours work in connection with broad beans of which he grew perhaps the best in the whole county and had knocked off for a moment to examine a spiders web this marvellous creation which the dew had visited and clustered over as stars over the firmament was hung on the gate of the vegetable garden and the spider a large and active one was regarding tod with the misgiving natural to its species intensely still tod stood absorbed in contemplation of that bright and dusty miracle then taking up his hoe again he went back to the weeds that threatened his broad beans now and again he stopped to listen or to look at the sky as is the way of husbandmen thinking of nothing enjoying the peace of his muscles  please sir fathers got into a fit again  two little girls were standing in the lane below the elder who had spoken in that small anxious voice had a pale little face with pointed chin her hair the color of overripe corn hung fluffy on her thin shoulders her flowerlike eyes with something motherly in them already were the same hue as her paleblue almost clean overall she had her smaller chubbier sister by the hand and having delivered her message stood still gazing up at tod as one might at god tod dropped his hoe  biddy come with me susie go and tell mrs freeland or miss sheila  he took the frail little hand of the elder tryst and ran they ran at the childs pace the one so very massive the other such a whiff of flesh and blood  did you come at once biddy  yes sir  where was he taken  in the kitchenjust as i was cookin breakfast  ah is it a bad one  yes sir awful badhes all foamy  what did you do for it  susie and me turned him over and billys seein he dont get his tongue down his throatlike what you told us and we ran to you susie was frightened he hollered so  past the three cottages whence a woman at a window stared in amaze to see that queer couple running past the pond where the ducks whiter than ever in the brightening sunlight dived and circled carelessly into the tryst kitchen there on the brick floor lay the distressful man already struggling back out of epilepsy while his little frightened son sat manfully beside him  towels and hot water biddy  with extraordinary calm rapidity the small creature brought what might have been two towels a basin and the kettle and in silence she and tod steeped his forehead  eyes look better biddy  he dont look so funny now sir  picking up that form almost as big as his own tod carried it up impossibly narrow stairs and laid it on a dishevelled bed  phew open the window biddy  the small creature opened what there was of window  now go down and heat two bricks and wrap them in something and bring them up  trysts boots and socks removed tod rubbed the large warped feet while doing this he whistled and the little boy crept upstairs and squatted in the doorway to watch and listen the morning air overcame with its sweetness the natural odor of that small room and a bird or two went flirting past the small creature came back with the bricks wrapped in petticoats of her own and placing them against the soles of her fathers feet she stood gazing at tod for all the world like a little mother dog with puppies  you cant go to school today biddy  is susie and billy to go  yes theres nothing to be frightened of now hell be nearly all right by evening but some one shall stay with you  at this moment tryst lifted his hand and the small creature went and stood beside him listening to the whispering that emerged from his thick lips  father says im to thank you please  yes have you had your breakfasts  the small creature and her smaller brother shook their heads  go down and get them  whispering and twisting back they went and by the side of the bed tod sat down in trysts eyes was that same look of doglike devotion he had bent on derek earlier that morning tod stared out of the window and gave the mans big hand a squeeze of what did he think watching a limetree outside and the sunlight through its foliage painting bright the rooms newly whitewashed wall already grayspotted with damp again watching the shadows of the leaves playing in that sunlight almost cruel that lovely shadow game of outside life so full and joyful so careless of man and suffering too gay almost too alive of what did he think watching the chase and dart of shadow on shadow as of gray butterflies fluttering swift to the sack of flowers while beside him on the bed the big laborer lay  when kirsteen and sheila came to relieve him of that vigil he went downstairs there in the kitchen biddy was washing up and susie and billy putting on their boots for school they stopped to gaze at tod feeling in his pockets for they knew that things sometimes happened after that today there came out two carrots some lumps of sugar some cord a bill a pruning knife a bit of wax a bit of chalk three flints a pouch of tobacco two pipes a matchbox with a single match in it a sixpence a necktie a stick of chocolate a tomato a handkerchief a dead bee an old razor a bit of gauze some tow a stick of caustic a reel of cotton a needle no thimble two dock leaves and some sheets of yellowish paper he separated from the rest the sixpence the dead bee and what was edible and in delighted silence the three little trysts gazed till biddy with the tip of one wet finger touched the bee  not good to eat biddy  at those words one after the other cautiously the three little trysts smiled finding that tod smiled too they broadened and billy burst into chuckles then clustering in the doorway grasping the edibles and the sixpence and consulting with each other they looked long after his big figure passing down the road   chapter xii   still later that same morning derek and sheila moved slowly up the mallorings wellswept drive their lips were set as though they had spoken the last word before battle and an old cock pheasant running into the bushes close by rose with a whir and skimmed out toward his covert scared perhaps by something uncompromising in the footsteps of those two  only when actually under the shelter of the porch which some folk thought enhanced the old greektemple effect of the mallorings house derek broke through that taciturnity  what if they wont  wait and see and dont lose your head derek the man who stood there when the door opened was tall grave wore his hair in powder and waited without speech  will you ask sir gerald and lady malloring if miss freeland and mr derek freeland could see them please and will you say the matter is urgent  the man bowed left them and soon came back  my lady will see you miss sir gerald is not in this way  past the statuary flowers and antlers of the hall they traversed a long cool corridor and through a white door entered a white room not very large and very pretty two children got up as they came in and flapped out past them like young partridges and lady malloring rose from her writingtable and came forward holding out her hand the two young freelands took it gravely for all their hostility they could not withstand the feeling that she would think them terrible young prigs if they simply bowed and they looked steadily at one with whom they had never before been at quite such close quarters lady malloring who had originally been the honorable mildred killory a daughter of viscount silport was tall slender and not very striking with very fair hair going rather gray her expression in repose was pleasant a little anxious only by her eyes was the suspicion awakened that she was a woman of some character they had that peculiar look of belonging to two worlds so often to be met with in english eyes a look of selfdenying aspiration tinctured with the suggestion that denial might not be confined to self  in a quite friendly voice she said  can i do anything for you and while she waited for an answer her glance travelled from face to face of the two young people with a certain curiosity after a silence of several seconds sheila answered  not for us thank you for others you can  lady mallorings eyebrows rose a little as if there seemed to her something rather unjust in those wordsfor others  yes she said  sheila whose hands were clenched and whose face had been fiery red grew suddenly almost white  lady malloring will you please let the gaunts stay in their cottage and trysts wifes sister come to live with the children and him  lady malloring raised one hand the motion quite involuntary ended at the tiny cross on her breast she said quietly  im afraid you dont understand  yes said sheila still very pale we understand quite well we understand that you are acting in what you believe to be the interests of morality all the same wont you do  im very sorry but i cant  may we ask why  lady malloring started and transferred her glance to derek  i dont know she said with a smile that i am obliged to account for my actions to you two young people besides you must know why quite well  sheila put out her hand  wilmet gaunt will go to the bad if you turn them out  i am afraid i think she has gone to the bad already and i do not mean her to take others there with her i am sorry for poor tryst and i wish he could find some nice woman to marry but what he proposes is impossible  the blood had flared up again in sheilas cheeks she was as red as the comb of a turkeycock  why shouldnt he marry his wifes sister its legal now and youve no right to stop it  lady malloring bit her lips she looked straight and hard at sheila  i do not stop it i have no means of stopping it only he cannot do it and live in one of our cottages i dont think we need discuss this further  i beg your pardon  the words had come from derek lady malloring paused in her walk toward the bell with his peculiar thinlipped smile the boy went on  we imagined you would say no we really came because we thought it fair to warn you that there may be trouble  lady malloring smiled  this is a private matter between us and our tenants and we should be so glad if you could manage not to interfere  derek bowed and put his hand within his sisters arm but sheila did not move she was trembling with anger  who are you she suddenly burst out to dispose of the poor body and soul who are you to dictate their private lives if they pay their rent that should be enough for you  lady malloring moved swiftly again toward the bell she paused with her hand on it and said  i am sorry for you two you have been miserably brought up  there was a silence then derek said quietly  thank you we shall remember that insult to our people dont ring please were going  in a silence if anything more profound than that of their approach the two young people retired down the drive they had not yet learnedmost difficult of lessonshow to believe that people could in their bones differ from them it had always seemed to them that if only they had a chance of putting directly what they thought the other side must at heart agree and only go on saying they didnt out of mere selfinterest they came away therefore from this encounter with the enemy a little dazed by the discovery that lady malloring in her bones believed that she was right it confused them and heated the fires of their anger  they had shaken off all private dust before sheila spoke  theyre all like thatcant see or feelsimply certain theyre superior it makesit makes me hate them its terrible ghastly and while she stammered out those little stabs of speech tears of rage rolled down her cheeks  derek put his arm round her waist  all right no good groaning lets think seriously what to do  there was comfort to the girl in that curiously sudden reversal of their usual attitudes  whatevers done he went on has got to be startling its no good pottering and protesting any more and between his teeth he muttered men of england wherefore plough   in the room where the encounter had taken place mildred malloring was taking her time to recover from very childhood she had felt that the essence of her own goodness the essence of her duty in life was the doing of good to others from very childhood she had never doubted that she was in a position to do this and that those to whom she did good although they might kick against it as inconvenient must admit that it was their good the thought they dont admit that i am superior had never even occurred to her so completely was she unselfconscious in her convinced superiority it was hard indeed to be flung against such outspoken rudeness it shook her more than she gave sign of for she was not by any means an insensitive womanshook her almost to the point of feeling that there was something in the remonstrance of those dreadful young people yet how could there be when no one knew better than she that the laborers on the malloring estate were better off than those on nine out of ten estates better paid and better housed andbetter looked after in their morals was she to give up thatwhen she knew that she was better able to tell what was good for them than they were themselves after all without stripping herself naked of every thought experience and action since her birth how could she admit that she was not better able and slowly in the white room with the mossgreen carpet she recovered till there was only just a touch of soreness left at the injustice implicit in their words those two had been miserably brought up had never had a chance of finding their proper place of understanding that they were just two callow young things for whom life had some fearful knocks in store she could even feel now that she had meant that saying i am sorry for you two she was sorry for them sorry for their want of manners and their point of view neither of which they could help of course with a mother like that for all her gentleness and sensibility there was much practical directness about mildred malloring for her a page turned was a page turned an idea absorbed was never disgorged she was of religious temperament ever trimming her course down the exact channel marked out with buoys by the port authorities and really incapable of imagining spiritual wants in others that could not be satisfied by what satisfied herself and this pathetic strength she had in common with many of her fellow creatures in every class sitting down at the writingtable from which she had been disturbed she leaned her thin rather long gentle but stubborn face on her hand thinking these gaunts were a source of irritation in the parish a kind of open sore it would be better if they could be got rid of before quarter day up to which she had weakly said they might remain far better for them to go at once if it could be arranged as for the poor fellow tryst thinking that by plunging into sin he could improve his lot and his poor childrens it was really criminal of those freelands to encourage him she had refrained hitherto from seriously worrying gerald on such points of village policyhis hands were so full but he must now take his part and she rang the bell  tell sir gerald id like to see him please as soon as he gets back  sir gerald has just come in my lady  now then  gerald malloringan excellent fellow as could be seen from his face of strictly norman architecture with blue stainedglass windows rather deep set inhad only one defect he was not a poet not that this would have seemed to him anything but an advantage had he been aware of it his was one of those highprincipled natures who hold that breadth is synonymous with weakness it may be said without exaggeration that the few meetings of his life with those who had a touch of the poet in them had been exquisitely uncomfortable silent almost taciturn by nature he was a great reader of poetry and seldom went to sleep without having digested a page or two of wordsworth milton tennyson or scott byron save such poems as don juan or the waltz he could but did not read for fear of setting a bad example burns shelley and keats he did not care for browning pained him except by such things as how they brought the good news from ghent to aix and the cavalier tunes while of omar khayyam and the hound of heaven he definitely disapproved for shakespeare he had no real liking though he concealed this from humility in the face of accepted opinion his was a firm mind sure of itself but not selfassertive his points were so good and he had so many of them that it was only when he met any one touched with poetry that his limitations became apparent it was rare however and getting more so every year for him to have this unpleasant experience  when summoned by his wife he came in with a wrinkle between his straight brows he had just finished a mornings work on a drainage scheme like the really good fellow that he was she greeted him with a little special smile nothing could be friendlier than the relations between these two affection and trust undeviating undemonstrativeness identity of feeling as to religion children property and in regard to views on the question of sex a really strange unanimity considering that they were man and woman  its about these gaunts gerald i feel they must go at once theyre only creating bad feeling by staying till quarter day i have had the young freelands here  those young pups  cant it be managed  malloring did not answer hastily he had that best point of the good englishman a dislike to being moved out of a course of conduct by anything save the appeal of his own conscience  i dont know he said why we should alter what we thought was just must give him time to look round and get a job elsewhere  i think the general state of feeling demands it its not fair to the villagers to let the freelands have such a handle for agitating labors badly wanted everywhere he cant have any difficulty in getting a place if he likes  no only i rather admire the fellow for sticking by his girl though he is such a landlawyer i think its a bit harsh to move him suddenly  so did i till i saw from those young furies what harm its doing they really do infect the cottagers you know how discontent spreads and trysttheyre egging him on too  malloring very thoughtfully filled a pipe he was not an alarmist if anything he erred on the side of not being alarmed until it was all over and there was no longer anything to be alarmed at his imagination would then sometimes take fire and he would say that such and such or so and so was dangerous  id rather go and have a talk with freeland he said hes queer but hes not at all a bad chap  lady malloring rose and took one of his realleather buttons in her hand  my dear gerald mr freeland doesnt exist  dont know about that a man can always come to life if he likes in his own family  lady malloring was silent it was true for all their unanimity of thought and feeling for all the latitude she had in domestic and village affairs gerald had a habit of filling his pipe with her decisions quite honestly she had no objection to their becoming smoke through his lips though she might wriggle just a little to her credit she did entirely carry out in her life her professed belief that husbands should be the forefronts of their wives for all that there burst from her lips the words  that freeland woman when i think of the mischief shes always done here by her example and her irreligioni cant forgive her i dont believe youll make any impression on mr freeland hes entirely under her thumb  smoking slowly and looking just over the top of his wifes head malioring answered  ill have a try and dont you worry  lady malloring turned away her soreness still wanted salve  those two young people she murmured said some very unpleasant things to me the boy i believe might have some good in him but the girl is simply terrible  hm i think just the reverse you know  theyll come to awful grief if theyre not brought up sharp they ought to be sent to the colonies to learn reality  malloring nodded  come out mildred and see how theyre getting on with the new vinery and they went out together through the french window  the vinery was of their own designing and of extraordinary interest in contemplation of its lofty glass and aluminiumcased pipes the feeling of soreness left her it was very pleasant standing with gerald looking at what they had planned together there was a soothing sense of reality about that visit after the mornings happening with its disappointment its reminder of immorality and discontent and of folk ungrateful for what was done for their good and squeezing her husbands arm she murmured  its really exactly what we thought it would be gerald   chapter xiii   about five oclock of that same afternoon gerald malloring went to see tod an openair man himself who often deplored the long hours he was compelled to spend in the special atmosphere of the house of commons he rather envied tod his existence in this cottage crazed from age and clothed with wistaria rambler roses sweetbrier honeysuckle and virginia creeper freeland had in his opinion quite a jolly life of itthe poor fellow not being able of course to help having a cranky wife and children like that he pondered as he went along over a talk at becket when stanley still under the influence of felixs outburst had uttered some rather queer sayings for instance he had supposed that they meaning apparently himself and malloring were rather unable to put themselves in the position of these trysts and gaunts he seemed to speak of them as one might speak generically of hodge which had struck malloring as singular it not being his habit to see anything in common between an individual case especially on his own estate and the ethics of a general proposition the place for general propositions was undoubtedly the house of commons where they could be supported one way or the other out of blue books he had little use for them in private life where innumerable things such as human nature and all that came into play he had stared rather hard at his host when stanley had followed up that first remark with im bound to say i shouldnt care to have to get up at half past five and go out without a bath what that had to do with the land problem or the regulation of village morality malloring had been unable to perceive it all depended on what one was accustomed to and in any case threw no light on the question as to whether or not he was to tolerate on his estate conduct of which his wife and himself distinctly disapproved at the back of national life there was always this problem of individual conduct especially sexual conductwithout regularity in which the family as the unit of national life was gravely threatened to put it on the lowest ground and he did not see how to bring it home to the villagers that they had got to be regular without making examples now and then  he had hoped very much to get through his call without coming across freelands wife and children and was greatly relieved to find tod seated on a windowsill in front of his cottage smoking and gazing apparently at nothing in taking the other corner of the windowsill the thought passed through his mind that freeland was really a very finelooking fellow tod was indeed about mallorings own height of six feet one with the same fairness and straight build of figure and feature but tods head was round and massive his hair crisp and uncut mallorings head long and narrow his hair smooth and closecropped tods eyes blue and deepset seemed fixed on the horizon mallorings blue and deepset on the nearest thing they could light on tod smiled as it were without knowing malloring seemed to know what he was smiling at almost too well it was comforting however that freeland was as shy and silent as himself for this produced a feeling that there could not be any real difference between their points of view perceiving at last that if he did not speak they would continue sitting there dumb till it was time for him to go malloring said  look here freeland about my wife and yours and tryst and the gaunts and all the rest of it its a pity isnt it this is a small place you know whats your own feeling  tod answered  a man has only one life  malloring was a little puzzled  in this world i dont follow  live and let live  a part of malloring undoubtedly responded to that curt saying a part of him as strongly rebelled against it and which impulse he was going to follow was not at first patent  you see you keep apart he said at last you couldnt say that so easily if you had like us to take up the position in which we find ourselves  why take it up  malloring frowned how would things go on  all right said tod  malloring got up from the sill this was laisserfaire with a vengeance such philosophy had always seemed to him to savor dangerously of anarchism and yet twenty years experience as a neighbor had shown him that tod was in himself perhaps the most harmless person in worcestershire and held in a curious esteem by most of the people about he was puzzled and sat down again  ive never had a chance to talk things over with you he said there are a good few people freeland who cant behave themselves were not bees you know  he stopped having an uncomfortable suspicion that his hearer was not listening  first ive heard this year said tod  for all the rudeness of that interruption malloring felt a stir of interest he himself liked birds unfortunately he could hear nothing but the general chorus of their songs  thought theyd gone murmured tod  malloring again got up look here freeland he said i wish youd give your mind to this you really ought not to let your wife and children make trouble in the village  confound the fellow he was smiling there was a sort of twinkle in his smile too that malloring found infectious  no seriously he said you dont know what harm you maynt do  have you ever watched a dog looking at a fire asked tod  yes often why  he knows better than to touch it  you mean youre helpless but you oughtnt to be  the fellow was smiling again  then you dont mean to do anything  tod shook his head  malloring flushed now look here freeland he said forgive my saying so but this strikes me as a bit cynical dyou think i enjoy trying to keep things straight  tod looked up  birds he said animals insects vegetable lifethey all eat each other more or less but they dont fuss about it  malloring turned abruptly and went down the path fuss he never fussed fuss the word was an insult addressed to him if there was one thing he detested more than another whether in public or private life it was fussing did he not belong to the league for suppression of interference with the liberty of the subject was he not a member of the party notoriously opposed to fussy legislation had any one ever used the word in connection with conduct of his before if so he had never heard them was it fussy to try and help the church to improve the standard of morals in the village was it fussy to make a simple decision and stick to it the injustice of the word really hurt him and the more it hurt him the slower and more dignified and upright became his march toward his drive gate  wild geese in the morning sky had been forerunners very heavy clouds were sweeping up from the west and rain beginning to fall he passed an old man leaning on the gate of a cottage garden and said good evening  the old man touched his hat but did not speak  hows your leg gaunt  tis much the same sir gerald  rain coming makes it shoot i expect  it do  malloring stood still the impulse was on him to see if after all the gaunts affair could not be disposed of without turning the old fellow and his son out  look here he said about this unfortunate business why dont you and your son make up your minds without more ado to let your granddaughter go out to service youve been here all your lives i dont want to see you go  the least touch of color invaded the old mans carved and grayish face  askin your pardon he said my son sticks by his girl and i sticks by my son  oh very well you know your own business gaunt i spoke for your good  a faint smile curled the corners of old gaunts mouth downward beneath his gray moustaches  thank you kindly he said  malloring raised a finger to his cap and passed on though he felt a longing to stride his feelings off he did not increase his pace knowing that the old mans eyes were following him but how pigheaded they were seeing nothing but their own point of view well he could not alter his decision they would go at the june quarternot a day before nor after  passing trysts cottage he noticed a fly drawn up outside and its driver talking to a woman in hat and coat at the cottage doorway she avoided his eye  the wifes sister again he thought so that fellows going to be an ass too hopeless stubborn lot and his mind passed on to his scheme for draining the bottom fields at cantley bromage this village trouble was too small to occupy for long the mind of one who had so many duties  old gaunt remained at the gate watching till the tall figure passed out of sight then limped slowly down the path and entered his sons cottage tom gaunt not long in from work was sitting in his shirtsleeves reading the papera short thickset man with small eyes round ruddy cheeks and humorous lips indifferently concealed by a ragged moustache even in repose there was about him something talkative and disputatious he was clearly the kind of man whose eyes and wit would sparkle above a pewter pot a good workman he averaged out an income of perhaps eighteen shillings a week counting the two shillings worth of vegetables that he grew his erring daughter washed for two old ladies in a bungalow so that with old gaunts five shillings from the parish the total resources of this family of five including two small boys at school was seven and twenty shillings a week quite a sum his comparative wealth no doubt contributed to the reputation of tom gaunt well known as local wag and disturber of political meetings his method with these gatherings whether liberal or tory had a certain masterly simplicity by interjecting questions that could not be understood and commenting on the answers received he insured perpetual laughter with the most salutary effects on the overconsideration of any political question together with a tendency to make his neighbors say ah tom gaunt hes a proper caution he is an encomium dear to his ears what he seriously thought about anything in this world no one knew but some suspected him of voting liberal because he disturbed their meetings most his loyalty to his daughter was not credited to affection it was like tom gaunt to stick his toes in and kickthe quality for choice to look at him and old gaunt one would not have thought they could be son and father a relationship indeed ever dubious as for his wife she had been dead twelve years some said he had joked her out of life others that she had gone into consumption he was a readerperhaps the only one in all the village and could whistle like a blackbird to work hard but without too great method to drink hard but with perfect method and to talk nineteen to the dozen anywhere except at homewas his mode of life in a word he was a character  old gaunt sat down in a wooden rockingchair and spoke  sir gerald eve ajust passed  sir gerald e can goo to hell theyll know un there by is little ears  eve aspoke about us stoppin so as mettie goes out to sarvice  eve aspoke about what e dont know bout then let un do what they like they cant put tom gaunt about he can get work anywheretom gaunt can an dont you forget that old man  the old man placing his thin brown hands on his knees was silent and thoughts passed through and through him if so be as tom goes therell be no one asll take me in for less than three bob a week two bob a week thats what ill ave to feed metwo bob a weektwo bob a week but if so bes i go with tom ill ave to reglar sit down under he for me bread and butter and he contemplated his son  where are you goin then he said  tom gaunt rustled the greenish paper he was reading and his little hard gray eyes fixed his father  who said i was going  old gaunt smoothing and smoothing the lined thin cheeks of the parchmenty thinnosed face that frances freeland had thought to be almost like a gentlemans answered i thart you said you was goin  you think too much thenthats what tis you think too much old man  with a slight deepening of the sardonic patience in his face old gaunt rose took a bowl and spoon down from a shelf and very slowly proceeded to make himself his evening meal it consisted of crusts of bread soaked in hot water and tempered with salt pepper onion and a touch of butter and while he waited crouched over the kettle his son smoked his grayish clay and read his greenish journal an old clock ticked and a little cat purred without provocation on the ledge of the tightclosed window then the door opened and the roguegirl appeared she shook her shoulders as though to dismiss the wetting she had got took off her turndown speckly straw hat put on an apron and rolled up her sleeves her arms were full and firm and red the whole of her was full and firm from her rosy cheeks to her stout ankles she was superabundant with vitality the strangest contrast to her shadowy thin old grandfather about the preparation of her fathers tea she moved with a sort of brooding stolidity out of which would suddenly gleam a twinkle of roguesweetness as when she stopped to stroke the little cat or to tickle the back of her grandfathers lean neck in passing having set the tea she stood by the table and said slowly teas ready father im goin to london  tom gaunt put down his pipe and journal took his seat at the table filled his mouth with sausage and said youre goin where i tell you  im goin to london  tom gaunt stayed the morsel in one cheek and fixed her with his little wild boars eye  yere goin to catch the stick he said look here my girl tom gaunts been put about enough along of you already dont you make no mistake  im goin to london repeated the roguegirl stolidly you can get alice to come over  oh can i yere not goin till i tell you dont you think it  im goin i saw mr derek this mornin theyll get me a place there  tom gaunt remained with his fork as it were transfixed the effort of devising contradiction to the chief supporters of his own rebellion was for the moment too much for him he resumed mastication  youll go where i want you to go and dont you think you can tell me where that is  in the silence that ensued the only sound was that of old gaunt supping at his crustybroth then the roguegirl went to the window and taking the little cat on her breast sat looking out into the rain having finished his broth old gaunt got up and behind his sons back he looked at his granddaughter and thought  goin to london twud be best for us all we shudn need to be movin then goin to london but he felt desolate   chapter xiv   when spring and first love meet in a girls heart then the birds sing  the songs that blackbirds and dustycoated thrushes flung through neddas window when she awoke in hampstead those may mornings seemed to have been sung by herself all night whether the sun were flashing on the leaves or raindrops sieving through on a souwest wind the same warmth glowed up in her the moment her eyes opened whether the lawn below were a field of bright dew or dry and darkish in a shiver of east wind her eyes never grew dim all day and her blood felt as light as ostrich feathers  stormed by an attack of his cacoethes scribendi after those few blank days at becket felix saw nothing amiss with his young daughter the great observer was not observant of things that other people observed neither he nor flora occupied with matters of more spiritual importance could tell offhand for example on which hand a weddingring was worn they had talked enough of becket and the tods to produce the impression on floras mind that one day or another two young people would arrive in her house on a visit but she had begun a poem called dionysus at the well and felix himself had plunged into a satiric allegory entitled the last of the laborers nedda therefore walked alone but at her side went always an invisible companion in that long imaginary walkingout she gave her thoughts and the whole of her heart and to be doing this never surprised her who before had not given them whole to anything a bee knows the first summer day and clings intoxicated to its flowers so did nedda know and cling she wrote him two letters and he wrote her one it was not poetry indeed it was almost all concerned with wilmet gaunt asking nedda to find a place in london where the girl could go but it ended with the words   your lover  derek   this letter troubled nedda she would have taken it at once to felix or to flora if it had not been for the first words dearest nedda and those last three except her mother she instinctively distrusted women in such a matter as that of wilmet gaunt feeling they would want to know more than she could tell them and not be too tolerant of what they heard casting about at a loss she thought suddenly of mr cuthcott  at dinner that day she fished round carefully felix spoke of him almost warmly what cuthcott could have been doing at becket of all places he could not imaginethe last sort of man one expected to see there a good fellow rather desperate perhaps as men of his age were apt to get if they had too many women or no woman about them  which said nedda had mr cuthcott  oh none how had he struck nedda and felix looked at his little daughter with a certain humble curiosity he always felt that the young instinctively knew so much more than he did  i liked him awfully he was like a dog  ah said felix he is like a dogvery honest he grins and runs about the city and might be inclined to bay the moon  i dont mind that nedda thought so long as hes not superior  hes very human felix added  and having found out that he lived in grays inn nedda thought i will ill ask him  to put her project into execution she wrote this note   dear mr cuthcott  you were so kind as to tell me you wouldnt mind if i bothered you about things ive got a very bothery thing to know what to do about and i would be so glad of your advice it so happens that i cant ask my father and mother i hope you wont think me very horrible wasting your time and please say no if youd rather  yours sincerely  nedda freeland   the answer came   dear miss freeland  delighted but if very bothery better save time and ink and have a snack of lunch with me tomorrow at the elgin restaurant close to the british museum quiet and respectable no flowers by request one oclock  very truly yours  giles cuthcott   putting on no flowers and with a fastbeating heart nedda went on her first lonely adventure to say truth she did not know in the least how ever she was going to ask this almost strange man about a girl of doubtful character but she kept saying to herself i dont carehe has nice eyes and her spirit would rise as she got nearer because after all she was going to find things out and to find things out was jolly the new warmth and singing in her heart had not destroyed but rather heightened her sense of the extraordinary interest of all things that be and very mysterious to her that morning was the kaleidoscope of oxford street and its innumerable girls and women each going about her business with a life of her own that was not neddas for men she had little use just now they had acquired a certain insignificance not having grayblack eyes that smoked and flared nor harris tweed suits that smelled delicious only once on her journey from oxford circus she felt the sense of curiosity rise in her in relation to a man and this was when she asked a policeman at tottenham court road and he put his head down fully a foot to listen to her so huge so broad so red in the face so stolid it seemed wonderful to her that he paid her any attention if he were a human being could she really be one too but that after all was no more odd than everything why for instance the spring flowers in that womans basket had been born why that high white cloud floated over why and what was nedda freeland  at the entrance of the little restaurant she saw mr cuthcott waiting in a brown suit with his pale but freckled face and his gnawedat sandy moustache and his eyes that looked out and beyond he was certainly no beauty but nedda thought hes even nicer than i remembered and im sure he knows a lot  at first to be sitting opposite to him in front of little plates containing red substances and small fishes was so exciting that she simply listened to his rapid rather stammering voice mentioning that the english had no idea of life or cookery that god had so made this country by mistake that everything even the sun knew it what however would she drink chardonnet it wasnt bad here  she assented not liking to confess that she did not know what chardonnet might be and hoping it was some kind of sherbet she had never yet drunk wine and after a glass felt suddenly extremely strong  well said mr cuthcott and his eyes twinkled whats your botheration i suppose you want to strike out for yourself my daughters did that without consulting me  oh have you got daughters  yesfunny ones older than you  thats why you understand then  mr cuthcott smiled they were a liberal education  and nedda thought poor dad i wonder if i am  yes mr cuthcott murmured who would think a gosling would ever become a goose  ah said nedda eagerly isnt it wonderful how things grow  she felt his eyes suddenly catch hold of hers  youre in love he said  it seemed to her a great piece of luck that he had found that out it made everything easy at once and her words came out pellmell  yes and i havent told my people yet i dont seem able hes given me something to do and i havent much experience  a funny little wriggle passed over mr cuthcotts face yes yes go on tell us about it  she took a sip from her glass and the feeling that he had been going to laugh passed away  its about the daughter of a laborer down there in worcestershire where he lives not very far from becket hes my cousin derek the son of my other uncle at joyfields he and his sister feel most awfully strongly about the laborers  ah said mr cuthcott the laborers queer how theyre in the air all of a sudden  this girl hasnt been very good and she has to go from the village or else her family have he wants me to find a place for her in london  i see and she hasnt been very good  not very she knew that her cheeks were flushing but her eyes felt steady and seeing that his eyes never moved she did not mind she went on  its sir gerald mallorings estate lady malloringwont  she heard a snap mr cuthcotts mouth had closed  oh he said say no more  he can bite nicely she thought  mr cuthcott who had begun lightly thumping the little table with his open hand broke out suddenly  that petty bullying in the country i know it my god those prudes those prisms theyre the ruination of half the girls on the he looked at nedda and stopped short if she can do any kind of work ill find her a place in fact shed better come for a start under my old housekeeper let your cousin know she can turn up any day name wilmet gaunt right you are he wrote it on his cuff  nedda rose to her feet having an inclination to seize his hand or stroke his head or something she subsided again with a fervid sigh and sat exchanging with him a happy smile at last she said  mr cuthcott is there any chance of things like that changing  changing he certainly had grown paler and was again lightly thumping the table changing by gum its got to change this dd plutoaristocratic ideal the weeds so grown up that its choking us yes miss freeland whether from inside or out i dont know yet but theres a blazing row coming things are going to be made new before long  under his thumps the little plates had begun to rattle and leap and nedda thought i do like him  but she said anxiously  you believe theres something to be done then derek is simply full of it i want to feel like that too and i mean to  his face grew twinkly he put out his hand and wondering a little whether he meant her to nedda timidly stretched forth her own and grasped it  i like you he said love your cousin and dont worry  neddas eyes slipped into the distance  but im afraid for him if you saw him youd know  ones always afraid for the fellows that are worth anything there was another young freeland at your uncles the other night  my brother alan  oh your brother well i wasnt afraid for him and it seemed a pity have some of this its about the only thing they do well here  oh thank you no ive had a lovely lunch mother and i generally have about nothing and clasping her hands she added  this is a secret isnt it mr cuthcott  dead  he laughed and his face melted into a mass of wrinkles nedda laughed also and drank up the rest of her wine she felt blissful  yes said mr cuthcott theres nothing like loving how long have you been at it  only five days but its everything  mr cuthcott sighed thats right when you cant love the only thing is to hate  oh said nedda  mr cuthcott again began banging on the little table look at them look at them his eyes wandered angrily about the room wherein sat some few who had passed though the mills of gentility what do they know of life where are their souls and sympathies they havent any id like to see their blood flow the silly brutes  nedda looked at them with alarm and curiosity they seemed to her somewhat like everybody she knew she said timidly do you think our blood ought to flow too  mr cuthcott relapsed into twinkles rather mine first  he is human thought nedda and she got up im afraid i ought to go now its been awfully nice thank you so very much goodby  he shook her firm little hand with his frail thin one and stood smiling till the restaurant door cut him off from her view  the streets seemed so gorgeously full of life now that neddas head swam she looked at it all with such absorption that she could not tell one thing from another it seemed rather long to the tottenham court road though she noted carefully the names of all the streets she passed and was sure she had not missed it she came at last to one called poultry poultry she thought i should have remembered thatpoultry and she laughed it was so sweet and feathery a laugh that the driver of an old fourwheeler stopped his horse he was old and anxiouslooking with a gray beard and deep folds in his red cheeks  poultry she said please am i right for the tottenham court road  the old man answered glory no miss youre goin east  east thought nedda id better take him and she got in she sat in the fourwheeler smiling and how far this was due to chardonnet she did not consider she was to love and not worry it was wonderful in this mood she was put down still smiling at the tottenham court road tube and getting out her purse she prepared to pay the cabman the fare would be a shilling but she felt like giving him two he looked so anxious and worn in spite of his red face he took them looked at her and said thank you miss i wanted that  oh murmured nedda then please take this too its all i happen to have except my tube fare  the old man took it and water actually ran along his nose  god bless yer he said and taking up his whip he drove off quickly  rather choky but still glowing nedda descended to her train it was not till she was walking to the spaniards road that a cloud seemed to come over her sky and she reached home dejected  in the garden of the freelands old house was a nook shut away by berberis and rhododendrons where some bees were supposed to make honey but knowing its destination and belonging to a union made no more than they were obliged in this retreat which contained a rustic bench nedda was accustomed to sit and read she went there now and her eyes began filling with tears why must the poor old fellow who had driven her look so anxious and call on god to bless her for giving him that little present why must people grow old and helpless like that grandfather gaunt she had seen at becket why was there all the tyranny that made derek and sheila so wild and all the grinding poverty that she herself could see when she went with her mother to their girls club in bethnal green what was the use of being young and strong if nothing happened nothing was really changed so that one got old and died seeing still the same things as before what was the use even of loving if love itself had to yield to death the trees how they grew from tiny seeds to great and beautiful things and then slowly slowly dried and decayed away to dust what was the good of it all what comfort was there in a god so great and universal that he did not care to keep her and derek alive and loving forever and was not interested enough to see that the poor old cabdriver should not be haunted day and night with fear of the workhouse for himself and an old wife perhaps neddas tears fell fast and how far this was chardonnet no one could tell  felix seeking inspiration from the sky in regard to the last of the laborers heard a noise like sobbing and searching found his little daughter sitting there and crying as if her heart would break the sight was so unusual and so utterly disturbing that he stood rooted quite unable to bring her help should he sneak away should he go for flora what should he do like many men whose work keeps them centred within themselves he instinctively avoided everything likely to pain or trouble him for this reason when anything did penetrate those mechanical defences he became almost strangely tender loath for example to believe that any one was ill if once convinced of it he made so good a nurse that flora at any rate was in the habit of getting well with suspicious alacrity thoroughly moved now he sat down on the bench beside nedda and said  my darling  she leaned her forehead against his arm and sobbed the more  felix waited patting her far shoulder gently  he had often dealt with such situations in his books and now that one had come true was completely at a loss he could not even begin to remember what was usually said or done and he only made little soothing noises  to nedda this tenderness brought a sudden sharp sense of guilt and yearning she began  its not because of that im crying dad but i want you to know that derek and i are in love  the words you what in those few days rose and got as far as felixs teeth he swallowed them and went on patting her shoulder nedda in love he felt blank and ashy that special feeling of owning her more than any one else which was so warming and delightful so really preciousit would be gone what right had she to take it from him thus without warning then he remembered how odious he had always said the elderly were to spoke the wheels of youth and managed to murmur  good luck to you my pretty  he said it conscious that a father ought to be saying  youre much too young and hes your cousin but what a father ought to say appeared to him just then both sensible and ridiculous nedda rubbed her cheek against his hand  it wont make any difference dad i promise you  and felix thought not to you only to me but he said  not a scrap my love what were you crying about  about the world it seems so heartless  and she told him about the water that had run along the nose of the old fourwheeler man  but while he seemed to listen felix thought i wish to god i were made of leather then i shouldnt feel as if id lost the warmth inside me i mustnt let her see fathers are queeri always suspected that there goes my work for a good week then he answered  no my dear the world is not heartless its only arranged according to certain necessary contraries no pain no pleasure no dark no light and the rest of it if you think it couldnt be arranged differently  as he spoke a blackbird came running with a chuckle from underneath the berberis looked at them with alarm and ran back nedda raised her face  dad i mean to do something with my life  felix answered  yes thats right  but long after nedda had fallen into dreams that night he lay awake with his left foot enclosed between floras trying to regain that sense of warmth which he knew he must never confess to having lost   chapter xv   flora took the news rather with the air of a motherdog that says to her puppy oh very well young thing go and stick your teeth in it and find out for yourself sooner or later this always happened and generally sooner nowadays besides she could not help feeling that she would get more of felix to her a matter of greater importance than she gave sign of but inwardly the news had given her a shock almost as sharp as that felt by him was she really the mother of one old enough to love was the child that used to cuddle up to her in the windowseat to be read to gone from her that used to rush in every morning at all inconvenient moments of her toilet that used to be found sitting in the dark on the stairs like a little sleepy owl because forsooth it was so cosey  not having seen derek she did not as yet share her husbands anxiety on that score though his description was dubious  upstanding young cockerel swinging his sporran and marching to pipesa fine spurn about him born to trouble if i know anything trying to sweep the sky with his little broom  is he a prig  noo theres simplicity about his scorn and he seems to have been brought up on facts not on literature like most of these young monkeys the cousinship i dont think matters kirsteen brings in too strong an outstrain hes her son not tods but perhaps he added sighing it wont last  flora shook her head it will last she said neddas deep  and if nedda held so would fate no one would throw nedda over they naturally both felt that dionysus at the well no less than the last of the laborers had a light week of it  though in a sense relieved at having parted with her secret nedda yet felt that she had committed desecration suppose derek should mind her people knowing  on the day that he and sheila were to come feeling she could not trust herself to seem even reasonably calm she started out meaning to go to the south kensington museum and wander the time away there but once outofdoors the sky seemed what she wanted and turning down the hill on the north side she sat down under a gorse bush here tramps coming in to london passed the night under the stars here was a vision however dim of nature and nature alone could a little soothe her ecstatic nerves  how would he greet her would he be exactly as he was when they stood at the edge of tods orchard above the dreamy darkening fields joining hands and lips moved as they had never been moved before  may blossom was beginning to come out along the hedge of the private grounds that bordered that bit of cockney common and from it warmed by the sun the scent stole up to her familiar like so many children of the cultured classes with the pagan and fairytales of nature she forgot them all the moment she was really by herself with earth and sky in their breadth their soft and stirring continuity they rejected bookish fancy and woke in her rapture and yearning a sort of long delight a neverappeased hunger crouching hands round knees she turned her face to get the warmth of the sun and see the white clouds go slowly by and catch all the songs that the birds sang and every now and then she drew a deep breath it was true what dad had said there was no real heartlessness in nature it was warm beating breathing and if things ate each other what did it matter they had lived and died quickly helping to make others live the sacred swing and circle of it went on forever full and harmonious under the lighted sky under the friendly stars it was wonderful to be alive and all done by love love more more more love and then death if it must come for after all to nedda death was so far away so unimaginably dim and distant that it did not really count  while she sat letting her fingers that were growing slowly black scrabble the grass and fern a feeling came on her of a presence a creature with wings above and around that seemed to have on its face a long mysterious smile of which she nedda was herself a tiny twinkle she would bring derek here they two would sit together and let the clouds go over them and she would learn all that he really thought and tell him all her longings and fears they would be silent too loving each other too much to talk she made elaborate plans of what they were to do and see beginning with the east end and the national gallery and ending with sunrise from parliament hill but she somehow knew that nothing would happen as she had designed if only the first moment were not different from what she hoped  she sat there so long that she rose quite stiff and so hungry that she could not help going home and stealing into the kitchen it was three oclock and the old cook as usual asleep in an armchair with her apron thrown up between her face and the fire what would cookie say if she knew in that oven she had been allowed to bake in fancy perfect little doll loaves while cookie baked them in reality here she had watched the mysterious making of pink cream had burned countless goes of toffy and cocoanut ice and tasted all kinds of loveliness dear old cookie stealing about on tiptoe seeking what she might devour she found four small jam tarts and ate them while the cook snored softly then by the table that looked so like a great loafplatter she stood contemplating cook old darling with her fat pale crumply face hung to the dresser opposite was a little mahogany lookingglass tilted forward nedda could see herself almost down to her toes i mean to be prettier than i am she thought putting her hands on her waist i wonder if i can pull them in a bit sliding her fingers under her blouse she began to pull at certain strings they would not budge they were loose yes really too comfortable she would have to get the next size smaller and dropping her chin she rubbed it on the lace edging of her chest where it felt warm and smelled piny had cookie ever been in love her gray hairs were coming poor old duck the windows where a protection of wire gauze kept out the flies were opened wide and the sun shone in and dimmed the fire the kitchen clock ticked like a conscience a faint perfume of fryingpan and mint scented the air and for the first time since this new sensation of love had come to her nedda felt as if a favorite book read through and done with were dropping from her hands the lovely times in that kitchen in every nook of that old house and garden would never come again gone she felt suddenly cast down to sadness they had been lovely times to be deserting in spirit all that had been so good to herit seemed like a crime she slid down off the table and passing behind the cook put her arms round those substantial sides without meaning to out of sheer emotion she pressed them somewhat hard and as from a concertina emerges a jerked and drawnout chord so from the cook came a long quaking sound her apron fell her body heaved and her drowsy flat soft voice greasy from pondering over dishes murmured  ah miss nedda its you my dear bless your pretty eart  but down neddas cheeks behind her rolled two tears  cookie oh cookie and she ran out  and the first moment it was like nothing she had dreamed of strange stiff one darting look and then eyes down one convulsive squeeze then such a formal shake of hot dry hands and off he had gone with felix to his room and she with sheila to hers bewildered biting down consternation trying desperately to behave like a little lady as her old nurse would have put itbefore sheila especially whose hostility she knew by instinct she had earned all that evening furtive watching formal talk and underneath a ferment of doubt and fear and longing all a mistake an awful mistake did he love her heaven if he did not she could never face any one again he could not love her his eyes were like those of a swan when its neck is drawn up and back in anger terriblehaving to show nothing having to smile at sheila at dad and mother and when at last she got to her room she stood at the window and at first simply leaned her forehead against the glass and shivered what had she done had she dreamed it alldreamed that they had stood together under those boughs in the darkness and through their lips exchanged their hearts she must have dreamed it dreamed that most wonderful false dream and the walk home in the thunderstorm and his arm round her and her letters and his letterdreamed it all and now she was awake from her lips came a little moan and she sank down huddled and stayed there ever so long numb and chilly undressgo to bed not for the world by the time the morning came she had got to forget that she had dreamed for very shame she had got to forget that no one should see her cheeks and ears and lips were burning but her body felt icy cold thenwhat time she did not know at allshe felt she must go out and sit on the stairs they had always been her comforters those wide shallow cosey stairs out and down the passage past all their roomshis the lastto the dark stairs eerie at night where the scent of age oozed out of the old house all doors below above were closed it was like looking down into a well to sit with her head leaning against the banisters and silent so silentjust those faint creakings that come from nowhere as it might be the breathing of the house she put her arms round a cold banister and hugged it hard it hurt her and she embraced it the harder the first tears of selfpity came welling up and without warning a great sob burst out of her alarmed at the sound she smothered her mouth with her arm no good they came breaking out a door opened all the blood rushed to her heart and away from it and with a little dreadful gurgle she was silent some one was listening how long that terrible listening lasted she had no idea then footsteps and she was conscious that it was standing in the dark behind her a foot touched her back she gave a little gasp dereks voice whispered hoarsely  what who are you  and below her breath she answered nedda  his arms wrenched her away from the banister his voice in her ear said  nedda darling nedda  but despair had sunk too deep she could only quiver and shake and try to drive sobbing out of her breath then most queer not his words nor the feel of his arms comforted herany one could pitybut the smell and the roughness of his norfolk jacket so he too had not been in bed he too had been unhappy and burying her face in his sleeve she murmured  oh derek why  i didnt want them all to see i cant bear to give it away nedda come down lower and lets love each other  softly stumbling clinging together they went down to the last turn of the wide stairs how many times had she not sat there in white frocks her hair hanging down as now twisting the tassels of little programmes covered with hieroglyphics only intelligible to herself talking spasmodically to spasmodic boys with budding tails while chinese lanterns let fall their rose and orange light on them and all the other little couples as exquisitely devoid of ease ah it was worth those hours of torture to sit there together now comforting each other with hands and lips and whisperings it was more as much more than that moment in the orchard as sun shining after a spring storm is more than sun in placid midjuly to hear him say nedda i love you to feel it in his hand clasped on her heart was much more now that she knew how difficult it was for him to say or show it except in the dark with her alone many a long day they might have gone through together that would not have shown her so much of his real heart as that hour of whispering and kisses  he had known she was unhappy and yet he couldnt it had only made him more dumb it was awful to be like that but now that she knew she was glad to think that it was buried so deep in him and kept for her alone and if he did it again she would just know that it was only shyness and pride and he was not a brute and a beast as he insisted but suppose she had chanced not to come out would she ever have lived through the night and she shivered  are you cold darling put on my coat  it was put on her in spite of all effort to prevent him never was anything so warm so delicious wrapping her in something more than harris tweed and the hall clock strucktwo  she could just see his face in the glimmer that filtered from the skylight at the top and she felt that he was learning her learning all that she had to give him learning the trust that was shining through her eyes there was just enough light for them to realize the old house watching from below and from abovea glint on the dark floor there on the dark wall here a blackness that seemed to be inhabited by some spirit so that their hands clutched and twitched when the tiny tiny noises of time playing in wood and stone clicked out  that stare of the old house with all its knowledge of lives past of youth and kisses spent and gone of hopes spun and faiths abashed the old house cynical stirred in them desire to clutch each other close and feel the thrill of peering out together into mystery that must hold for them so much of love and joy and trouble and suddenly she put her fingers to his face passed them softly clingingly over his hair forehead eyes traced the sharp cheekbones down to his jaw round by the hard chin up to his lips over the straight bone of his nose lingering back to his eyes again  now if i go blind i shall know you give me one kiss derek you must be tired  buried in the old dark house that kiss lasted long then tiptoeingshe in frontpausing at every creak holding breath they stole up to their rooms and the clock struckthree   chapter xvi   felix nothing if not modern had succumbed already to the feeling that youth ruled the roost whatever his misgivings his and floras sense of loss nedda must be given a free hand derek gave no outward show of his condition and but for his little daughters happy serenity felix would have thought as she had thought that first night he had a feeling that his nephew rather despised one so soaked in mildness and reputation as felix freeland and he got on better with sheila not because she was milder but because she was devoid of that scornful tang which clung about her brother no sheila was not mild richcolored downright of speech with her mane of short hair she was a no less startling companion the smile of felix had never been more whimsically employed than during that tenday visit the evening john freeland came to dinner was the highwater mark of his alarmed amusement mr cuthcott also bidden at neddas instigation seemed to take a mischievous delight in drawing out those two young people in face of their official uncle the pleasure of the dinner to felixand it was not too greatwas in watching neddas face she hardly spoke but how she listened nor did derek say much but what he did say had a queer sarcastic twinge about it  an unpleasant young man was johns comment afterward how the deuce did he ever come to be tods son sheila of course is one of these hotheaded young women that make themselves a nuisance nowadays but shes intelligible by the way that fellow cuthcotts a queer chap  one subject of conversation at dinner had been the morality of revolutionary violence and the saying that had really upset john had been dereks conflagration firstmorality afterward he had looked at his nephew from under brows which a constant need for rejecting petitions to the home office had drawn permanently down and in toward the nose and made no answer  to felix these words had a more sinister significance with his juster appreciation both of the fiery and the official points of view his far greater insight into his nephew than ever john would have he saw that they were more than a mere arrow of controversy and he made up his mind that night that he would tackle his nephew and try to find out exactly what was smouldering within that crisp black pate  following him into the garden next morning he said to himself no ironythats fatal man to manor boy to boywhichever it is but on the garden path alongside that young spreadeagle whose dark glowering selfcontained face he secretly admired he merely began  how do you like your uncle john  he doesnt like me uncle felix  somewhat baffled felix proceeded  i say derek fortunately or unfortunately ive some claim now to a little knowledge of you youve got to open out a bit to me what are you going to do with yourself in life you cant support nedda on revolution  having drawn this bow at a venture he paused doubtful of his wisdom a glance at dereks face confirmed his doubt it was closer than ever more defiant  theres a lot of money in revolution uncle felixother peoples  dash the young brute there was something in him he swerved off to a fresh line  how do you like london  i dont like it but uncle felix dont you wish you were seeing it for the first time what books youd write  felix felt that unconscious thrust go home revolt against staleness and clipped wings against the terrible security of his too solid reputation smote him  what strikes you most about it then he asked  that it ought to be jolly well blown up everybody seems to know that toothey look it anyway and yet they go on as if it oughtnt  why ought it to be blown up  well whats the good of anything while london and all these other big towns are sitting on the countrys chest england must have been a fine place once though  some of us think it a fine place still  of course it is in a way but anything new and keen gets sat on englands like an old tomcat by the fire too jolly comfortable for anything  at this support to his own theory that the country was going to the dogs owing to such as john and stanley felix thought out of the mouths of babes but he merely said youre a cheerful young man  its got cramp derek muttered cant even give women votes fancy my mother without a vote and going to wait till every laborer is off the land before it attends to them its like the port you gave us last night uncle felix wonderful crust  and what is to be your contribution to its renovation  dereks face instantly resumed its peculiar defiant smile and felix thought young beggar hes as close as wax after their little talk however he had more understanding of his nephew his defiant selfsufficiency seemed more genuine  in spite of his sensations when dining with felix john freeland little if not punctilious decided that it was incumbent on him to have the young tods to dinner especially since frances freeland had come to stay with him the day after the arrival of those two young people at hampstead she had reached porchester gardens faintly flushed from the prospect of seeing darling john with one large cane trunk and a handbag of a pattern which the man in the shop had told her was the best thing out it had a clasp which had worked beautifully in the shop but which for some reason on the journey had caused her both pain and anxiety convinced however that she could cure it and open the bag the moment she could get to that splendid new pair of pincers in her trunk which a man had only yesterday told her were the latest she still felt that she had a soft thing and dear john must have one like it if she could get him one at the stores tomorrow  john who had come away early from the home office met her in that dark hall to which he had paid no attention since his young wife died fifteen years ago embracing him with a smile of love almost timorous from intensity frances freeland looked him up and down and catching what light there was gleaming on his temples determined that she had in her bag as soon as she could get it open the very thing for dear johns hair he had such a nice moustache and it was a pity he was getting bald brought to her room she sat down rather suddenly feeling as a fact very much like faintinga condition of affairs to which she had never in the past and intended never in the future to come making such a fuss owing to that nice new patent clasp she had not been able to get at her smellingsalts nor the little flask of brandy and the one hardboiled egg without which she never travelled and for want of a cup of tea her soul was nearly dying within her dear john would never think she had not had anything since breakfast she travelled always by a slow train disliking motion and she would not for the world let him knowso near dinnertime giving a lot of trouble she therefore stayed quite quiet smiling a little for fear he might suspect her seeing john however put her bag down in the wrong place she felt stronger  no darlingnot therein the window  and while he was changing the position of the bag her heart swelled with joy because his back was so straight and with the thought what a pity the dear boy has never married again it does so keep a man from getting moony with all that writing and thinking he had to do such important work too it would have been so good for him especially at night she would not have expressed it thus in wordsthat would not have been quite nicebut in thought frances freeland was a realist  when he was gone and she could do as she liked she sat stiller than ever knowing by long experience that to indulge oneself in private only made it more difficult not to indulge oneself in public it really was provoking that this nice new clasp should go wrong just this once and that the first time it was used and she took from her pocket a tiny prayerbook and holding it to the light read the eighteenth psalmit was a particularly good one that never failed her when she felt lowshe used no glasses and up to the present had avoided any line between the brows knowing it was her duty to remain as nice as she could to look at so as not to spoil the pleasure of people round about her then saying to herself firmly i do not i will not want any teabut i shall be glad of dinner she rose and opened her cane trunk though she knew exactly where they were she was some time finding the pincers because there were so many interesting things above them each raising a different train of thought a pair of fieldglasses the very latestthe man had saidfor darling derek they would be so useful to keep his mind from thinking about things that it was no good thinking about and for dear flora how wonderful that she could write poetrypoetry a really splendid and perfectly new little pill she herself had already taken two and they had suited her to perfection for darling felix a new kind of eau de cologne made in worcester because that was the only scent he would use for her pet nedda a piece of point de venise that she really could not be selfish enough to keep any longer especially as she was particularly fond of it for alan a new kind of tinopener that the dear boy would like enormously he was so nice and practical for sheila such a nice new novel by mr and mrs whirlinghama bright wholesome tale with such a good description of quite a new country in itthe dear child was so clever it would be a change for her then actually resting on the pincers she came on her passbook recently made up containing little or no balance just enough to get darling john that bag like hers with the new clasp which would be so handy for his papers when he went travelling and having reached the pincers she took them in her hand and sat down again to be quite quiet a moment with her stilldark eyelashes resting on her ivory cheeks and her lips pressed to a colorless line for her head swam from stooping over in repose with three flies circling above her fine gray hair she might have served a sculptor for a study of the stoic spirit then going to the bag her compressed lips twitching her gray eyes piercing into its clasp with a kind of distrustful optimism she lifted the pincers and tweaked it hard  if the atmosphere of that dinner to which all six from hampstead came was less disturbed than john anticipated it was due to his sense of hospitality and to every ones feeling that controversy would puzzle and distress granny that there were things about which people differed frances freeland well knew but that they should so differ as to make them forget to smile and have good manners would not have seemed right to her at all and of this in her presence they were all conscious so that when they had reached the asparagus there was hardly anything left that could by any possibility be talked about and thisfor fear of seeming awkwardthey at once proceeded to discuss flora remarking that london was very full john agreed  frances freeland smiling said  its so nice for derek and sheila to be seeing it like this for the first time  sheila said  why isnt it always as full as this  john answered  in august practically empty they say a hundred thousand people at least go away  double remarked felix  the figures are variously given my estimate  one in sixty that shows you  at this interruption of dereks john frowned slightly what does it show you he said  derek glanced at his grandmother  oh nothing  of course it shows you exclaimed sheila what a heartless great place it is all the world goes out of town and londons empty but if you werent told so youd never know the difference  derek muttered i think it shows more than that  under the table flora was touching johns foot warningly nedda attempting to touch dereks felix endeavoring to catch johns eye alan trying to catch sheilas john biting his lip and looking carefully at nothing only frances freeland was smiling and gazing lovingly at dear derek thinking he would be so handsome when he had grown a nice black moustache and she said  yes dear what were you going to say  derek looked up  do you really want it granny  nedda murmured across the table no derek  frances freeland raised her brows quizzically she almost looked arch  but of course i do darling i want to hear immensely its so interesting  derek was going to say motherevery one at once looked at felix who had thus broken inthat all we westend peoplejohn and i and flora and stanley and even youall we people born in purple and fine linen are so accustomed to think were all that matters that when were out of london theres nobody in it he meant to say that this is appalling enough but that what is still more appalling is the fact that we really are all that matters and that if people try to disturb us we can and jolly well will take care they dont disturb us long is that what you meant derek  derek turned a rather startled look on felix  what he meant to say went on felix was that age and habit vested interests culture and security sit so heavy on this countrys chest that aspiration may wriggle and squirm but will never get from under that for all we pretend to admire enthusiasm and youth and the rest of it we push it out of us just a little faster than it grows up is that what you meant derek  youll try to but you wont succeed  im afraid we shall and with a smile too so that you wont see us doing it  i call that devilish  i call it natural look at a man whos growing old notice how very gracefully and gradually he does it take my hairyour aunt says she cant tell the difference from month to month and there it is or rather isntlittle by little  frances freeland who during felixs long speech had almost closed her eyes opened them and looked piercingly at the top of his head  darling she said ive got the very thing for it you must take some with you when you go tonight john is going to try it  checked in the flow of his philosophy felix blinked like an owl surprised  mother he said you only have the gift of keeping young  oh my dear im getting dreadfully old i have the greatest difficulty in keeping awake sometimes when people are talking but i mean to fight against it its so dreadfully rude and ugly too i catch myself sometimes with my mouth open  flora said quietly granny i have the very best thing for thatquite new  a sweet but rather rueful smile passed over frances freelands face now she said youre chaffing me and her eyes looked loving  it is doubtful if john understood the drift of felixs exordium it is doubtful if he had quite listenedhe having so much to not listen to at the home office that the practice was growing on him a vested interest to john was a vested interest culture was culture and security was certainly securitynone of them were symbols of age further the social questionat least so far as it had to do with outbreaks of youth and enthusiasmwas too familiar to him to have any general significance whatever what with women labor people and the rest of it he had no time for philosophya dubious process at the best a man who had to get through so many daily hours of real work did not dissipate his energy in speculation but though he had not listened to felixs remarks they had ruffled him there is no philosophy quite so irritating as that of a brother true no doubt that the country was in a bad way but as to vested interests and security that was all nonsense the guilty causes were free thought and industrialism  having seen them all off to hampstead he gave his mother her goodnight kiss he was proud of her a wonderful woman who always put a good face on everything even her funny way of always having some new thing or other to do you goodeven that was all part of her wanting to make the best of things she never lost her form  john worshipped that kind of stoicism which would die with its head up rather than live with its tail down perhaps the moment of which he was most proud in all his life was that when at the finish of his school mile he overheard a vulgar bandsman say i like that young s running he breathes through his  nose at that moment if he had stooped to breathe through his mouth he must have won as it was he had lost in great distress and perfect form  when then he had kissed frances freeland and watched her ascend the stairs breathless because she would breathe through her nose to the very last step he turned into his study lighted his pipe and sat down to a couple of hours of a report upon the forces of constabulary available in the various counties in the event of any further agricultural rioting such as had recently taken place on a mild scale in one or two districts where there was still danish blood he worked at the numbers steadily with just that engineers touch of mechanical invention which had caused him to be so greatly valued in a department where the evolution of twelve policemen out of ten was constantly desired his mastery of figures was highly prized for while it had not any of that flamboyance which has come from america and the game of poker it possessed a kind of english optimism only dangerous when as rarely happened it was put to the test he worked two full pipes long and looked at the clock twelve no good knocking off just yet he had no liking for bed this many a long year having from loyalty to memory and a drier sense of what became one in the home department preserved his form against temptations of the flesh yet somehow tonight he felt no spring no inspiration in his handling of county constabulary a kind of english stolidity about them baffled himten of them remained ten and leaning that forehead whose height so troubled frances freeland on his neat hand he fell to brooding those young people with everything before them did he envy them or was he glad of his own age fifty fifty already a fogey an official fogey for all the world like an umbrella that every day some one put into a stand and left there till it was time to take it out again neatly rolled too with an elastic and button and this fancy which had never come to him before surprised him one day he too would wear out slit all up his seams and they would leave him at home or give him away to the butler  he went to the window a scent ofof may or something and nothing in sight save houses just like his own he looked up at the strip of sky privileged to hang just there he had got a bit rusty with his stars there however certainly was venus and he thought of how he had stood by the ships rail on that honeymoon trip of his twenty years ago giving his young wife her first lesson in counting the stars and something very deep down very mossed and crusted over in johns heart beat and stirred and hurt him neddahe had caught her looking at that young fellow just as anne had once looked at him john freeland now an official fogey an umbrella in a stand there was a policeman how ridiculous the fellow looked putting one foot before the other flirting his lantern and trying the area gates this confounded scent of hawthorncould it be hawthorngot here into the heart of london the look in that girls eyes what was he about to let them make him feel as though he could give his soul for a face looking up into his own for a breast touching his and the scent of a womans hair hang it he would smoke a cigarette and go to bed he turned out the light and began to mount the stairs they creaked abominablythe felt must be wearing out a woman about the place would have kept them quiet reaching the landing of the second floor he paused a moment from habit to look down into the dark hall a voice thin sweet almost young said  is that you darling johns heart stood still whatwas that then he perceived that the door of the room that had been his wifes was open and remembered that his mother was in there  what arent you asleep mother  frances freelands voice answered cheerfully oh no dear im never asleep before two come in  john entered propped very high on her pillows in perfect regularity his mother lay her carved face was surmounted by a piece of fine lace her thin white fingers on the turnover of the sheet moved in continual interlocking her lips smiled  theres something you must have she said i left my door open on purpose give me that little bottle darling  john took from a small table by the bed a still smaller bottle frances freeland opened it and out came three tiny white globules  now she said pop them in youve no idea how theyll send you to sleep theyre the most splendid things perfectly harmless just let them rest on the tongue and swallow  john let them restthey were sweetishand swallowed  how is it then he said that you never go to sleep before two  frances freeland corked the little bottle as if enclosing within it that awkward question  they dont happen to act with me darling but thats nothing its the very thing for any one who has to sit up so late and her eyes searched his face yesthey seemed to sayi know you pretend to have work but if you only had a dear little wife  i shall leave you this bottle when i go kiss me  john bent down and received one of those kisses of hers that had such sudden vitality in the middle of them as if her lips were trying to get inside his cheek from the door he looked back she was smiling composed again to her stoic wakefulness  shall i shut the door mother  please darling  with a little lump in his throat john closed the door   chapter xvii   the london which derek had said should be blown up was at its maximum of life those may days even on this outer rampart of hampstead people engines horses all had a touch of the spring fever indeed especially on this rampart of hampstead was there increase of the effort to believe that nature was not dead and embalmed in books the poets painters talkers who lived up there were at each other all the time in their great game of makebelieve how could it be otherwise when there was veritably blossom on the trees and the chimneys were ceasing to smoke how otherwise when the sun actually shone on the ponds but the four young people for alan joined inhypnotized by sheila did not stay in hampstead chiefly on top of tram and bus they roamed the wilderness bethnal green and leytonstone kensington and lambeth st jamess and soho whitechapel shoreditch west ham and piccadilly they traversed the whole antheap at its most ebullient moment they knew their whitman and their dostoievsky sufficiently to be aware that they ought to love and delight in everythingin the gentleman walking down piccadilly with a flower in his buttonhole and in the lady sewing that buttonhole in bethnal green in the orator bawling himself hoarse close to the marble arch the coster loading his barrow in covent garden and in uncle john freeland rejecting petitions in whitehall all these things of course together with the long lines of little gray houses in camden town long lines of carts with bobtail horses rattling over blackfriars bridge long smells drifting behind taxicabsall these things were as delightful and as stimulating to the soul as the clouds that trailed the heavens the fronds of the lilac and leonardos cartoon in the diploma gallery all were equal manifestations of that energy in flower known as life they knew that everything they saw and felt and smelled ought equally to make them long to catch creatures to their hearts and cry hosanna and nedda and alan bred in hampstead even knew that to admit that these things did not all move them in the same way would be regarded as a sign of anaemia neverthelessmost queerlythese four young people confessed to each other all sorts of sensations besides that hosanna one they even confessed to rage and pity and disgust one moment and to joy and dreams the next and they differed greatly as to what excited which it was truly odd the only thing on which they did seem to agree was that they were having a thundering good time a sort of sense of blow everything was in their wings and this was due not to the fact that they were thinking of and loving and admiring the little gray streets and the gentleman in piccadillyas no doubt in accordance with modern culture they should have beenbut to the fact that they were loving and admiring themselves and that entirely without the trouble of thinking about it at all the practice too of dividing into couples was distinctly precious to them for though they never failed to start out together they never failed to come home two by two in this way did they put to confusion whitman and dostoievsky and all the other thinkers in hampstead in the daytime they all save alan felt that london ought to be blown up but at night it undermined their philosophies so that they sat silent on the tops of their respective buses with arms twined in each others for then a something seemed to have floated up from that mass of houses and machines of men and trees and to be hovering above them violetcolored caught between the stars and the lights a spirit of such overpowering beauty that it drenched even alan in a kind of awe after all the huge creature that sat with such a giants weight on the countrys chest the monster that had spoiled so many fields and robbed so many lives of peace and health could fly at night upon blue and gold and purple wings murmur a passionate lullaby and fall into deep sleep  one such night they went to the gallery at the opera to supper at an oystershop under alans pilotage and then set out to walk back to hampstead timing themselves to catch the dawn they had not gone twenty steps up southampton row before alan and sheila were forty steps in front a fellowfeeling had made derek and nedda stand to watch an old man who walked tortuous extremely happy bidding them all come and when they moved on it was very slowly just keeping sight of the others across the lumbered dimness of covent garden where tarpaulincovered carts and barrows seemed to slumber under the blink of lamps and watchmens lanterns across long acre they came into a street where there was not a soul save the two others a long way ahead walking with his arm tightly laced with hers touching her all down one side derek felt that it would be glorious to be attacked by nightbirds in this dark lonely street to have a splendid fight and drive them off showing himself to nedda for a man and her protector but nothing save one black cat came near and that ran for its life he bent round and looked under the blue veilthing that wrapped neddas head her face seemed mysteriously lovely and her eyes lifted so quickly mysteriously true she said  derek i feel like a hill with the sun on it  i feel like that yellow cloud with the wind in it  i feel like an appletree coming into blossom  i feel like a giant  i feel like a song  i feel i could sing you  on a river floating along  a wide one with great plains on each side and beasts coming down to drink and either the sun or a yellow moon shining and some one singing too far off  the red sarafan  lets run  from that yellow cloud sailing in moonlight a spurt of rain had driven into their faces and they ran as fast as their blood was flowing and the raindrops coming down jumping half the width of the little dark streets clutching each others arms and peering round into her face so sweet and breathless into her eyes so dark and dancing he felt he could run all night if he had her there to run beside him through the dark into another street they dashed and again another till she stopped panting  where are we now  neither knew a policeman put them right for portland place half past one and it would be dawn soon after three they walked soberly again now into the outer circle of regents park talked soberly too discussing sublunary matters and every now and then their arms round each other gave little convulsive squeezes the rain had stopped and the moon shone clear by its light the trees and flowers were clothed in colors whose blood had spilled away the towns murmur was dying the house lights dead already they came out of the park into a road where the latest taxis were rattling past a face a bare neck silk hat or shirtfront gleamed in the windowsquares and now and then a laugh came floating through they stopped to watch them from under the lowhanging branches of an acaciatree and derek gazing at her face still wet with rain so young and round and soft thought and she loves me suddenly she clutched him round the neck and their lips met  they talked not at all for a long time after that kiss walking slowly up the long empty road while the whitish clouds sailed across the dark river of the sky and the moon slowly sank this was the most delicious part of all that long walk home for the kiss had made them feel as though they had no bodies but were just two spirits walking side by side this is its curious effect sometimes in first love between the very young   having sent flora to bed felix was sitting up among his books there was no need to do this for the young folk had latchkeys but having begun the vigil he went on with it a volume about eastern philosophies on his knee a bowl of narcissus blooms giving forth unexpected whiffs of odor beside him and he sank into a long reverie  could it be saidas was said in this eastern bookthat mans life was really but a dream could that be said with any more truth than it had once been said that he rose again in his body to perpetual life could anything be said with truth save that we knew nothing and was that not really what had always been said by manthat we knew nothing but were just blown over and about the world like soughs of wind in obedience to some immortal unknowable coherence but had that want of knowledge ever retarded what was known as the upward growth of man had it ever stopped man from working fighting loving dying like a hero if need were had faith ever been anything but embroidery to an instinctive heroism so strong that it needed no such trappings had faith ever been anything but anodyne or gratification of the aesthetic sense or had it really body and substance of its own was it something absolute and solid that hefelix freelandhad missed or again was it perhaps but the natural concomitant of youth a naive effervescence with which thought and brooding had to part and turning the page of his book he noticed that he could no longer see to read the lamp had grown too dim and showed but a decorative glow in the bright moonlight flooding through the study window he got up and put another log on the fire for these last nights of may were chilly  nearly three where were these young people had he been asleep and they come in sure enough in the hall alans hat and sheilas cloakthe darkred one he had admired when she went forthwere lying on a chair but of the other twonothing he crept upstairs their doors were open they certainly took their timethese young lovers and the same sore feeling which had attacked felix when nedda first told him of her love came on him badly in that small of the night when his vitality was lowest all the hours she had spent clambering about him or quietly resting on his knee with her head tucked in just where his arm and shoulder met listening while he read or told her stories and now and again turning those clear eyes of hers wide open to his face to see if he meant it the wilful little tugs of her hand when they two went exploring the customs of birds or bees or flowers all her daddy i love yous and her rushes to the front door and long hugs when he came back from a travel all those later crookings of her little finger in his and the times he had sat when she did not know it watching her and thinking that little creature with all thats before her is my very own daughter to take care of and share joy and sorrow with each one of all these seemed to come now and tweak at him as the songs of blackbirds tweak the heart of one who lies unable to get out into the spring his lamp had burned itself quite out the moon was fallen below the clump of pines and away to the northeast something stirred in the stain and texture of the sky felix opened the window what peace out there the chill scentless peace of night waiting for dawns renewal of warmth and youth through that bay window facing north he could see on one side the town still wan with the light of its lamps on the other the country whose dark bloom was graying fast suddenly a tiny bird twittered and felix saw his two truants coming slowly from the gate across the grass his arm round her shoulders hers round his waist with their backs turned to him they passed the corner of the house across where the garden sloped away there they stood above the wide country their bodies outlined against a sky fast growing light evidently waiting for the sun to rise silent they stood while the birds one by one twittered out their first calls and suddenly felix saw the boy fling his hand up into the air the sun far away on the gray horizon was a flare of red   chapter xviii   the anxieties of the lady mallorings of this life concerning the moral welfare of their humbler neighbors are inclined to march in front of events the behavior in trysts cottage was more correct than it would have been in nine out of ten middle or upper class demesnes under similar conditions between the big laborer and that woman who since the epileptic fit had again come into residence there had passed nothing whatever that might not have been witnessed by biddy and her two nurslings for love is an emotion singularly dumb and undemonstrative in those who live the life of the fields passion a feeling severely beneath the thumb of a propriety born of the agelong absence of excitants opportunities and the aesthetic sense and those two waited almost as a matter of course for the marriage which was forbidden them in this parish the most they did was to sit and look at one another  on the day of which felix had seen the dawn at hampstead sir geralds agent tapped on the door of trysts cottage and was answered by biddy just in from school for the midday meal  your father home my dear  no sir aunties in  ask your auntie to come and speak to me  the motherchild vanished up the narrow stairs and the agent sighed a strongbuilt leatheryskinned man in a brown suit and leggings with a bristly little moustache and yellow whites to his eyes he did not as he had said to his wife that morning like the job a little bit and while he stood there waiting susie and billy emerged from the kitchen and came to stare at him the agent returned that stare till a voice behind him said yes sir  that woman was certainly no great shakes to look at a fresh decent faithful sort of body and he said gruffly mornin miss sorry to say my orders are to make a clearance here i suppose tryst didnt think we should act on it but im afraid ive got to put his things out you know now where are you all going thats the point  i shall go home i suppose but tryst and the childrenwe dont know  the agent tapped his leggings with a ridingcane so youve been expecting it he said with relief thats right and staring down at the motherchild he added well what dyou say my dear you look full of sense you do  biddy answered ill go and tell mr freeland sir  ah youre a bright maid hell know where to put you for the time bein have you had your dinner  no sir its just ready  better have itbetter have it first no hurry whatve you got in the pot that smells so good  bubble and squeak sir  bubble and squeak ah and with those words the agent withdrew to where in a farm wagon drawn up by the side of the road three men were solemnly pulling at their pipes he moved away from them a little for as he expressed it to his wife afterward look bad you know look badanybody seeing me those three little childrenthats where it is if our friends at the hall had to do these jobs for themselves there wouldnt be any to do  presently from his discreet distance he saw the motherchild going down the road toward tods in her blue pinny and corncolored hair nice little thing pretty little thing too pity great pity and he went back to the cottage on his way a thought struck him so that he wellnigh shivered suppose the little thing brought back that mrs freeland the lady who always went about in blue without a hat phew mr freelandhe was another sort a bit off certainlyharmless quite harmless but that lady and he entered the cottage the woman was washing up seemed a sensible body when the two kids cleared off to school he could go to work and get it over the sooner the better before people came hanging round a job of this kind sometimes made nasty blood his yellowish eyes took in the nature of the task before him funny jamup they did get about them to be sure every blessed little thing theyd ever bought and more too have to take precious good care nothing got smashed or the law would be on the other leg and he said to the woman  now miss can i begin  i cant stop you sir  no he thought you cant stop me and i blamed well wish you could but he said got an old wagon out here thought id save him damage by weather or anything well put everything in that and run it up into the empty barn at marrow and leave it and there theyll be for him when he wants em  the woman answered youre very kind im sure  perceiving that she meant no irony the agent produced a sound from somewhere deep and went out to summon his men  with the best intentions however it is not possible even in villages so scattered that they cannot be said to exist to do anything without every ones knowing and the work of putting out the household goods of the tryst family and placing them within the wagon was not an hour in progress before the road in front of the cottage contained its knot of watchers old gaunt first alonefor the roguegirl had gone to mr cuthcotts and tom gaunt was at work the old man had seen evictions in his time and looked on silently with a faint sardonic grin four children so small that not even school had any use for them as yet soon gathered round his legs followed by mothers coming to retrieve them and there was no longer silence then came two laborers on their way to a job a stonebreaker and two more women it was through this little throng that the motherchild and kirsteen passed into the fastbeinggutted cottage  the agent was standing by trysts bed keeping up a stream of comment to two of his men who were taking that aged bed to pieces it was his habit to feel less when he talked more but no one could have fallen into a more perfect taciturnity than he when he saw kirsteen coming up those narrow stairs in so small a space as this room where his head nearly touched the ceiling was it fair to be confronted by that ladyhe put it to his wife that same eveningwas it fair he had seen a mother wild duck look like that when you took away its youngsnaky fierce about the neck and its dark eye he had seen a mare going to bite look not half so vicious there she stood andlet me have itnot a bit too much the lady for that you knowjust looked at me and said very quiet ah mr simmons and are you really doing this and put her hand on that little girl of his orders are orders maam what could i say ah she said yes orders are orders but they neednt be obeyed as to that maam i saidmind you shes a lady you cant help feeling that im a working man the same as tryst here got to earn my living so have slavedrivers mr simmons every profession i said has got its dirty jobs maam and thats a fact and will have she said so long as professional men consent to do the dirty work of their employers and where should i be i should like to know i said if i went on that lay ive got to take the rough with the smooth well she said mr freeland and i will take tryst and the little ones in at present goodhearted people do a lot for the laborers in their way all the same shes a bit of a vixen picture of a woman too standin there shows blood mind you once said all overno nagging she took the little girl off with her and pretty small i felt knowing id got to finish that job and the folk outside gettin nastier all the timenot sayin much of course but lookin a lot the agent paused in his recital and gazed fixedly at a bluebottle crawling up the windowpane stretching out his thumb and finger he nipped it suddenly and threw it in the grate blest if that fellow himself didnt turn up just as i was finishing i was sorry for the man you know there was his home turned outodoors big man too you blankyblank he says if id been here you shouldnt ha done this thought he was goin to hit me come tryst i said its not my doing you know ah he said i know that and itll be blanky well the worse for them rough tongue no class of man at all he is yes he said let em look out ill be even with em yet none o that i told him you know which side the laws buttered im making it easy for you too keeping your things in the wagon ready to shift any time he gave me a lookhes got very queer eyes swimmin sad sort of eyes like a man in liquorand he said ive been here twenty years he said my wife died here and all of a sudden he went as dumb as a fish never let his eyes off us though while we finished up the last of it made me feel funny seein him glowering like that all the time hell savage something over this you mark my words again the agent paused and remained as though transfixed holding that face of his whose yellow had run into the whites of the eyes as still as wood hes got some feeling for the place i suppose he said suddenly or maybe theyve put it into him about his rights theres plenty of em like that well anyhow nobody likes his private affairs turned inside out for every one to gape at i wouldnt myself and with that deeply felt remark the agent put out his leatheryyellow thumb and finger and nipped a second bluebottle  while the agent was thus recounting to his wife the days doings the evicted tryst sat on the end of his bed in a groundfloor room of tods cottage he had taken off his heavy boots and his feet in their thick soiled socks were thrust into a pair of tods carpet slippers he sat without moving precisely as if some one had struck him a blow in the centre of the forehead and over and over again he turned the heavy thought theyve turned me out o therei done nothing and they turned me out o there blast themthey turned me out o there  in the orchard tod sat with a grave and puzzled face surrounded by the three little trysts and at the wicket gate kirsteen awaiting the arrival of derek and sheilasummoned home by telegramstood in the evening glow her blueclad figure still as that of any worshipper at the muezzincall   chapter xix   a fire causing the destruction of several ricks and an empty cowshed occurred in the early morning of thursday on the home farm of sir gerald mallorings estate in worcestershire grave suspicions of arson are entertained but up to the present no arrest has been made the authorities are in doubt whether the occurrence has any relation with recent similar outbreaks in the eastern counties   so stanley read at breakfast in his favorite paper and the little leader thereon   the outbreak of fire on sir gerald mallorings worcestershire property may or may not have any significance as a symptom of agrarian unrest we shall watch the upshot with some anxiety certain it is that unless the authorities are prepared to deal sharply with arson or other cases of deliberate damage to the property of landlords we may bid goodby to any hope of ameliorating the lot of the laborer   and so on  if stanley had risen and paced the room there would have been a good deal to be said for him for though he did not know as much as felix of the nature and sentiments of tods children he knew enough to make any but an englishman uneasy the fact that he went on eating ham and said to clara half a cup was proof positive of that mysterious quality called phlegm which had long enabled his country to enjoy the peace of a weedy duckpond  stanley a man of some intelligencewitness his grasp of the secret of successful ploughmaking none for the home markethad often considered this important proposition of phlegm people said england was becoming degenerate and hysterical growing soft and nervous and towny and all the rest of it in his view there was a good deal of bosh about that look he would say at the weight that chauffeurs put on look at the house of commons and the size of the upper classes if there were growing up little shrill types of working men and socialists and new women and halfpenny papers and a rather larger crop of professors and longhaired chapsall the better for the rest of the country the flesh all these skimpy ones had lost solid people had put on the country might be suffering a bit from officialism and the tendency of modern thought but the breed was not changing john bull was there all right under his moustache take it off and clap on little sidewhiskers and you had as many bulls as you liked any day there would be no social upheaval so long as the climate was what it was and with this simple formula and a kind of very deepdown throaty chuckle he would pass to a subject of more immediate importance there was something indeed rather masterly in his grasp of the fact that rain might be trusted to put out any firegive it time and he kept a special vessel in a special corner which recorded for him faithfully the number of inches that fell and now and again he wrote to his paper to say that there were more inches in his vessel than there had been for thirty years his conviction that the country was in a bad way was nothing but a skin affection causing him local irritation rather than affecting the deeper organs of his substantial body  he did not readily confide in clara concerning his own family having in a marked degree the truly domestic quality of thinking it superior to his wifes she had been a tomson not one of the tomsons and it was quite a question whether he or she were trying to forget that fact the faster but he did say to her as he was getting into the car  its just possible i might go round by tods on my way home i want a run  she answered be careful what you say to that woman i dont want her here by any chance the young ones were quite bad enough  and when he had put in his day at the works he did turn the nose of his car toward tods travelling along grassbordered roads the beauty of this england struck his not too sensitive spirit and made him almost gasp it was that moment of the year when the countryside seems to faint from its own loveliness from the intoxication of its scents and sounds creamywhite may splashed here and there with crimson flooded the hedges in breaking waves of flowerfoam the fields were all buttercup glory every tree had its cuckoo calling every bush its blackbird or thrush in full evensong swallows were flying rather low and the sky whose moods they watch had the slumberous surcharged beauty of a long fine day with showers not far away some orchards were still in blossom and the great wild bees hunting over flowers and grasses warm to their touch kept the air deeply murmurous movement light color song scent the warm air and the fluttering leaves were confused till one had almost become the other  and stanley thought for he was not rhapsodic wonderful pretty country the way everythings looked afteryou never see it abroad  but the car a creature with little patience for natural beauty had brought him to the crossroads and stood panting slightly under the cliffbank whereon grew tods cottage so loaded now with lilac wistaria and roses that from the road nothing but a peak or two of the thatched roof could be seen  stanley was distinctly nervous it was not a weakness his face and figure were very capable of showing but he felt that dryness of mouth and quivering of chest which precede adventures of the soul advancing up the steps and pebbled path which clara had trodden once just nineteen years ago and he himself but three times as yet in all he cleared his throat and said to himself easy old man what is it after all she wont bite and in the very doorway he came upon her  what there was about this woman to produce in a man of common sense such peculiar sensations he no more knew after seeing her than before felix on returning from his visit had said shes like a song of the hebrides sung in the middle of a programme of english ballads the remark as any literary mans might had conveyed nothing to stanley and that in a farfetched way still when she said will you come in he felt heavier and thicker than he had ever remembered feeling as a glass of stout might feel coming across a glass of claret it was perhaps the gaze of her eyes whose color he could not determine under eyebrows that waved in the middle and twitched faintly or a dress that was blue with the queerest effect of another color at the back of it or perhaps the feeling of a torrent flowing there under a coat of ice that might give way in little holes so that your leg went in but not the whole of you something anyway made him feel both small and heavythat awkward combination for a man accustomed to associate himself with cheerful but solid dignity in seating himself by request at a table in what seemed to be a sort of kitchen he experienced a singular sensation in the legs and heard her say as it might be to the air  biddy dear take susie and billy out  and thereupon a little girl with a sad and motherly face came crawling out from underneath the table and dropped him a little courtesy then another still smaller girl came out and a very small boy staring with all his eyes  all these things were against stanley and he felt that if he did not make it quite clear that he was there he would soon not know where he was  i came he said to talk about this business up at mallorings and encouraged by having begun he added whose kids were those  a level voice with a faint lisp answered him  they belong to a man called tryst he was turned out of his cottage on wednesday because his dead wifes sister was staying with him so weve taken them in did you notice the look on the face of the eldest  stanley nodded in truth he had noticed something though what he could not have said  at nine years old she has to do the housework and be a mother to the other two besides going to school this is all because lady malloring has conscientious scruples about marriage with a deceased wifes sister  certainlythought stanleythat does sound a bit thick and he asked  is the woman here too  no shes gone home for the present  he felt relief  i suppose mallorings point is he said whether or not youre to do what you like with your own property for instance if you had let this cottage to some one you thought was harming the neighborhood wouldnt you terminate his tenancy  she answered still in that level voice  her action is cowardly narrow and tyrannical and no amount of sophistry will make me think differently  stanley felt precisely as if one of his feet had gone through the ice into water so cold that it seemed burning hot sophistry in a plain man like himself he had always connected the word with felix he looked at her realizing suddenly that the association of his brothers family with the outrage on mallorings estate was probably even nearer than he had feared  look here kirsteen he said uttering the unlikely name with resolution for after all she was his sisterinlaw did this fellow set fire to mallorings ricks  he was aware of a queer flash a quiver a something all over her face which passed at once back to its intent gravity  we have no reason to suppose so but tyranny produces revenge as you know  stanley shrugged his shoulders its not my business to go into the rights and wrongs of whats been done but as a man of the world and a relative i do ask you to look after your youngsters and see they dont get into a mess theyre an inflammable young coupleyoung blood you know  having made this speech stanley looked down with a feeling that it would give her more chance  you are very kind he heard her saying in that quiet faintly lisping voice but there are certain principles involved  and suddenly his curious fear of this woman took shape principles he had unconsciously been waiting for that word than which none was more like a red rag to him  what principles can possibly be involved in going against the law  and where the law is unjust  stanley was startled but he said remember that your principles as you call them may hurt other people besides yourself tod and your children most of all how is the law unjust may i ask  she had been sitting at the table opposite but she got up now and went to the hearth for a woman of fortytwoas he supposed she would beshe was extraordinarily lithe and her eyes fixed on him from under those twitching wavy brows had a curious glow in their darkness the few silver threads in the mass of her overfine black hair seemed to give it extra vitality the whole of her had a sort of intensity that made him profoundly uncomfortable and he thought suddenly poor old tod fancy having to go to bed with that woman  without raising her voice she began answering his question  these poor people have no means of setting law in motion no means of choosing where and how they will live no means of doing anything except just what they are told the mallorings have the means to set the law in motion to choose where and how to live and to dictate to others that is why the law is unjust with every independent pound a year this equal law of yoursvaries  phew said stanley thats a proposition  i give you a simple case if i had chosen not to marry tod but to live with him in free love we could have done it without inconvenience we have some independent income we could have afforded to disregard what people thought or did we could have bought as we did buy our piece of land and our cottage out of which we could not have been turned since we dont care for society it would have made absolutely no difference to our present position but tryst who does not even want to defy the lawwhat happens to him what happens to hundreds of laborers all over the country who venture to differ in politics religion or morals from those who own them  by george thought stanley its true in a way i never looked at it quite like that but the feeling that he had come to persuade her to be reasonable and the deeply rooted englishry of him conspired to make him say  thats all very well but you see its only a necessary incident of propertyholding you cant interfere with plain rights  you meanan evil inherent in propertyholding  if you like i dont split words the lesser of two evils whats your remedy you dont want to abolish property youve confessed that property gives you your independence  again that curious quiver and flash  yes but if people havent decency enough to see for themselves how the law favors their independence they must be shown that it doesnt pay to do to others as they would hate to be done by  and you wouldnt try reasoning  they are not amenable to reason  stanley took up his hat  well i think some of us are i see your point but you know violence never did any good it isntisnt english  she did not answer and nonplussed thereby he added lamely i should have liked to have seen tod and your youngsters remember me to them clara sent her regards and looking round the room in a rather lost way he held out his hand  he had an impression of something warm and dry put into it with even a little pressure  back in the car he said to his chauffeur go home the other way batter past the church  the vision of that kitchen with its brick floor its black oak beams bright copper pans the flowers on the windowsill the great open hearth and the figure of that woman in her blue dress standing before it with her foot poised on a log clung to his minds eye with curious fidelity and those three kids popping out like thatproof that the whole thing was not a rather bad dream queer business he thought bad business that womans uncommonly all there though lot in what she said too where the deuce should we all be if there were many like her and suddenly he noticed in a field to the right a number of men coming along the hedge toward the roadevidently laborers what were they doing he stopped the car there were fifteen or twenty of them and back in the field he could see a girls red blouse where a little group of four still lingered by george he thought those must be the young tods going it and curious to see what it might mean stanley fixed his attention on the gate through which the men were bound to come first emerged a fellow in corduroys tied below the knee with long brown moustaches decorating a face that for all its haggardness had a jovial look next came a sturdy little redfaced bowlegged man in shirtsleeves rolled up walking alongside a big dark fellow with a cap pushed up on his head who had evidently just made a joke then came two old men one of whom was limping and three striplings another big man came along next in a little clearance as it were between main groups he walked heavily and looked up lowering at the car the fellows eyes were queer and threatening and sadgiving stanley a feeling of discomfort then came a short square man with an impudent loquacious face and a bit of swagger in his walk he too looked up at stanley and made some remark which caused two thinfaced fellows with him to grin sheepishly a spare old man limping heavily with a yellow face and drooping gray moustaches walked next alongside a warped bent fellow with yellowish hair all over his face whose expression struck stanley as halfidiotic then two more striplings of seventeen or so whittling at bits of sticks an active cleanshorn chap with drawnin cheeks and last of all a small man by himself without a cap on a round head covered with thin light hair moving at a dothere dotthere walk as though he had beasts to drive  stanley noted that allsave the big man with the threatening sad eyes the old yellowfaced man with a limp and the little man who came out last lost in his imaginary beastslooked at the car furtively as they went their ways and stanley thought english peasant poor devil who is he what is he whod miss him if he did die out whats the use of all this fuss about him hes done for glad ive nothing to do with him at becket anyway back to the land independent peasantry not much shant say that to clara though knock the bottom out of her weekends and to his chauffeur he muttered  get on batter  so through the peace of that country all laid down in grass through the dignity and loveliness of trees and meadows this may evening with the birds singing under a sky surcharged with warmth and color he sped home to dinner   chapter xx   but next morning turning on his back as it came dawn stanley thought with the curious intensity which in those small hours so soon becomes fear by jove i dont trust that woman a yard i shall wire for felix and the longer he lay on his back the more the conviction bored a hole in him there was a kind of fever in the air nowadays that women seemed to catch as children caught the measles what did it all mean england used to be a place to live in one would have thought an old country like this would have got through its infantile diseases hysteria no one gave in to that still one must look out arson was about the limit and stanley had a vision suddenly of his ploughworks in flames why not the ploughs were not for the english market who knew whether these laboring fellows mightnt take that as a grievance if trouble began to spread this somewhat farfetched notion having started to burrow threw up a really horrid molehill on stanley and it was only the habit in the human mind of saying suddenly to fears stop im tired of you that sent him to sleep about half past four  he did not however neglect to wire to felix   if at all possible come down again at once awkward business at joyfields   nor on the charitable pretext of employing two old fellows past ordinary work did he omit to treble his nightwatchman  on wednesday the day of which he had seen the dawn rise felix had already been startled on returning from his constitutional to discover his niece and nephew in the act of departure all the explanation vouchsafed had been awfully sorry uncle felix mothers wired for us save for the general uneasiness which attended on all actions of that woman felix would have felt relieved at their going they had disturbed his life slipped between him and nedda so much so that he did not even expect her to come and tell him why they had gone nor feel inclined to ask her so little breaks the fine coherence of really tender ties the deeper the quality of affection the more it starts and puffs and from sheer sensitive feeling each for the other spares attempt to get back into touch  his paperthough he did not apply to it the word favorite having that proper literary feeling toward all newspapers that they took him in rather than he themgave him on friday morning precisely the same news of the rickburning as it gave to stanley at breakfast and to john on his way to the home office to john less in the know it merely brought a knitting of the brow and a vague attempt to recollect the numbers of the worcestershire constabulary to felix it brought a feeling of sickness men whose work in life demands that they shall daily whip their nerves run as a rule a little in advance of everything and goodness knows what he did not see at that moment he said no word to nedda but debated with himself and flora what if anything was to be done flora whose sense of humor seldom deserted her held the more comfortable theory that there was nothing to be done as yet soon enough to cry when milk was spilled he did not agree but unable to suggest a better course followed her advice on saturday however receiving stanleys wire he had much difficulty in not saying to her i told you so the question that agitated him now was whether or not to take nedda with him flora said yes the child will be the best restraining influence if there is really trouble brewing some feeling fought against this in felix but suspecting it to be mere jealousy he decided to take her and to the girls rather puzzled delight they arrived at becket that day in time for dinner it was not too reassuring to find john there too stanley had also wired to him the matter must indeed be serious  the usual weekend was in progress clara had made one of her greatest efforts a bulgarian had providentially written a book in which he showed beyond doubt that persons fed on brown bread potatoes and margarine gave the most satisfactory results of all it was a discovery of the first value as a topic for her dinnertableseeming to solve the whole vexed problem of the laborers almost at one stroke if they could only be got to feed themselves on this perfect programme what a saving of the situation on those three edibles the bulgarian saidand he had been well translateda family of five could be maintained at full efficiency for a shilling per day why that would leave nearly eight shillings a week in many cases more for rent firing insurance the mans tobacco and the childrens boots there would be no more of that terrible pinching by the mothers to feed the husband and children properly of which one heard so much no more lamentable deterioration in our stock brown bread potatoes margarinequite a great deal could be provided for seven shillings and what was more delicious than a wellbaked potato with margarine of good quality the carbohydratesor was it hybocardratesah yes the kybohardrateswould be present in really sufficient quantity little else was talked of all through dinner at her end of the table above the flowers which frances freeland always insisted on arrangingand very charminglywhen she was thereover bare shoulders and white shirtfronts those words bombed and rebombed brown bread potatoes margarine carbohydrates calorific they mingled with the creaming sizzle of champagne with the soft murmur of wellbred deglutition white bosoms heaved and eyebrows rose at them and now and again some bigwig versed in science murmured the word fats an agricultural population fed to the point of efficiency without disturbance of the existing state of things eureka if only into the bargain they could be induced to bake their own brown bread and cook their potatoes well faces flushed eyes brightened and teeth shone it was the best the most stimulating dinner ever swallowed in that room nor was it until each male guest had eaten drunk and talked himself into torpor suitable to the company of his wife that the three brothers could sit in the smokingroom together undisturbed  when stanley had described his interview with that woman his glimpse of the red blouse and the laborers meeting there was a silence before john said  it might be as well if tod would send his two youngsters abroad for a bit  felix shook his head  i dont think he would and i dont think theyd go but we might try to get those two to see that anything the poor devils of laborers do is bound to recoil on themselves fourfold i suppose he added with sudden malice a laborers rising would have no chance  neither john nor stanley winced  rising why should they rise  they did in 32  in 32 repeated john agriculture had its importance then now it has none besides theyve no cohesion no power like the miners or railway men rising no chance no earthly weight of metals dead against it  felix smiled  money and guns guns and money confess with me brethren that were glad of metal  john stared and stanley drank off his whiskey and potash felix really was a bit too thick sometimes then stanley said  wonder what tod thinks of it all will you go over felix and advise that our young friends be more considerate to these poor beggars  felix nodded and with good night old man all round and no shaking of the hands the three brothers dispersed  but behind felix as he opened his bedroom door a voice whispered  dad and there in the doorway of the adjoining room was nedda in her dressinggown  do come in for a minute ive been waiting up you are late  felix followed her into her room the pleasure he would once have had in this midnight conspiracy was superseded now and he stood blinking at her gravely in that blue gown with her dark hair falling on its lace collar and her face so round and childish she seemed more than ever to have defrauded him hooking her arm in his she drew him to the window and felix thought she just wants to talk to me about derek dog in the manger that i am here goes to be decent so he said  well my dear  nedda pressed his hand with a little coaxing squeeze  daddy darling i do love you  and though felix knew that she had grasped what he was feeling a sort of warmth spread in him she had begun counting his fingers with one of her own sitting close beside him the warmth in felix deepened but he thought she must want a good deal out of me then she began  why did we come down again i know theres something wrong its hard not to know when youre anxious and she sighed that little sigh affected felix  id always rather know the truth dad aunt clara said something about a fire at the mallorings  felix stole a look at her yes there was a lot in this child of his depth warmth and strength to hold to things no use to treat her as a child and he answered  my dear theres really nothing beyond what you knowour young man and sheila are hotheads and things over there are working up a bit we must try and smooth them down  dad ought i to back him whatever he does  what a question the more so that one cannot answer superficially the questions of those whom one loves  ah he said at last i dont know yet some things its not your duty to do thats certain it cant be right to do things simply because he does themthats not realhowever fond one is  no i feel that only its so hard to know what i do really thinktheres always such a lot trying to make one feel that only whats nice and cosey is right  and felix thought ive been brought up to believe that only russian girls care for truth it seems i was wrong the saints forbid i should be a stumblingblock to my own daughter searching for it and yetwheres it all leading is this the same child that told me only the other night she wanted to know everything shes a woman now so much for love and he said  lets go forward quietly without expecting too much of ourselves  yes dad only i distrust myself so  no one ever got near the truth who didnt  can we go over to joyfields tomorrow i dont think i could bear a whole day of bigwigs and eating with this hanging  poor bigwigs all right well go and now bed and think of nothing  her whisper tickled his ear  you are a darling to me dad  he went out comforted  and for some time after she had forgotten everything he leaned out of his window smoking cigarettes and trying to see the body and soul of night how quiet she wasnight with her mystery bereft of moon in whose darkness seemed to vibrate still the song of the cuckoos that had been calling so all day and whisperings of leaves communed with felix   chapter xxi   what tod thought of all this was perhaps as much of an enigma to tod as to his three brothers and never more so than on that sunday morning when two police constables appeared at his door with a warrant for the arrest of tryst after regarding them fixedly for full thirty seconds he said wait and left them in the doorway  kirsteen was washing breakfast things which had a leadless glaze and trysts three children extremely tidy stood motionless at the edge of the little scullery watching  when she had joined him in the kitchen tod shut the door  two policemen he said want tryst are they to have him  in the life together of these two there had from the very start been a queer understanding as to who should decide what it had become by now so much a matter of instinct that combative consultations which bulk so large in married lives had no place in theirs a frowning tremor passed over her face  i suppose they must derek is out leave it to me tod and take the tinies into the orchard  tod took the three little trysts to the very spot where derek and nedda had gazed over the darkening fields in exchanging that first kiss and sitting on the stump of the appletree he had cut down he presented each of them with an apple while they ate he stared and his dog stared at him how far there worked in tod the feelings of an ordinary man watching three small children whose only parent the law was just taking into its charge it would be rash to say but his eyes were extremely blue and there was a frown between them  well biddy he said at last  biddy did not reply the habit of being a mother had imposed on her together with the gravity of her little pale oval face a peculiar talent for silence but the roundcheeked susie said  billy can eat cores  after this statement silence was broken only by munching till tod remarked  what makes things  the children having the instinct that he had not asked them but himself came closer he had in his hand a little beetle  this beetle lives in rotten wood nice chap isnt he  we kill beetles were afraid of them so susie  they were now round tod so close that billy was standing on one of his large feet susie leaning her elbows on one of his broad knees and biddys slender little body pressed against his huge arm  no said tod beetles are nice chaps  the birds eats them remarked billy  this beetle said tod eats wood it eats through trees and the trees get rotten  biddy spoke  then they dont give no more apples tod put the beetle down and billy got off his foot to tread on it when he had done his best the beetle emerged and vanished in the grass tod who had offered no remonstrance stretched out his hand and replaced billy on his foot  what about my treading on you billy he said  why  im big and youre little  on billys square face came a puzzled defiance if he had not been early taught his station he would evidently have found some poignant retort an intoxicated humblebee broke the silence by buzzing into biddys fluffedout corngold hair tod took it off with his hand  lovely chap isnt he  the children who had recoiled drew close again while the drunken bee crawled feebly in the cage of tods large hand  bees sting said biddy i fell on a bee and it stang me  you stang it first said tod this chap wouldnt stingnot for worlds stroke it  biddy put out her little pale finger but stayed it a couple of inches from the bee  go on said tod  opening her mouth a little biddy went on and touched the bee  its soft she said why dont it buzz  i want to stroke it too said susie and billy stamped a little on tods foot  no said tod only biddy  there was perfect silence till the dog rising approached its nose black with a splash of pinky whiteness on the end of the bridge as if to love the bee  no said tod the dog looked at him and his yellowbrown eyes were dark with anxiety  itll sting the dogs nose said biddy and susie and billy came yet closer  it was at this moment when the heads of the dog the bee tod biddy susie and billy might have been contained within a noose three feet in diameter that felix dismounted from stanleys car and coming from the cottage caught sight of that little idyll under the dappled sunlight green and blossom it was something from the core of life out of the heartbeat of thingslike a rare picture or song the revelation of the childlike wonder and delight to which all other things are but the supernumerary casingsa little pool of simplicity into which fever and yearning sank and were for a moment drowned and quite possibly he would have gone away without disturbing them if the dog had not growled and wagged his tail  but when the children had been sent down into the field he experienced the usual difficulty in commencing a talk with tod how far was his big brother within reach of mere unphilosophic statements how far was he going to attend to facts  we came back yesterday he began nedda and i you know all about derek and nedda i suppose  tod nodded  what do you think of it  hes a good chap  yes murmured felix but a firebrand this business at malloringswhats it going to lead to tod we must look out old man couldnt you send derek and sheila abroad for a bit  wouldnt go  but after all theyre dependent on you  dont say that to them i should never see them again  felix who felt the instinctive wisdom of that remark answered helplessly  whats to be done then  sit tight and tods hand came down on felixs shoulder  but suppose they get into real trouble stanley and john dont like it and theres mother and felix added with sudden heat besides i cant stand nedda being made anxious like this  tod removed his hand felix would have given a good deal to have been able to see into the brain behind the frowning stare of those blue eyes  cant help by worrying what must be will look at the birds  the remark from any other man would have irritated felix profoundly coming from tod it seemed the unconscious expression of a really felt philosophy and after all was he not right what was this life they all lived but a ceaseless worrying over what was to come was not all mans unhappiness caused by nervous anticipations of the future was not that the disease and the misfortune of the age perhaps of all the countless ages man had lived through  with an effort he recalled his thoughts from that far flight what if tod had rediscovered the secret of the happiness that belonged to birds and lilies of the fieldsuch overpowering interest in the moment that the future did not exist why not were not the only minutes when he himself was really happy those when he lost himself in work or love and why were they so few for want of pressure to the square moment yes all unhappiness was fear and lack of vitality to live the present fully that was why love and fighting were such poignant ecstasiesthey lived their present to the full and so it would be almost comic to say to those young people go away do nothing in this matter in which your interest and your feelings are concerned dont have a present because youve got to have a future and he said  id give a good deal for your power of losing yourself in the moment old boy  thats all right said tod he was examining the bark of a tree which had nothing the matter with it so far as felix could see while his dog who had followed them carefully examined tod both were obviously lost in the moment and with a feeling of defeat felix led the way back to the cottage  in the brickfloored kitchen derek was striding up and down while around him in an equilateral triangle stood the three women sheila at the window kirsteen by the open hearth nedda against the wall opposite derek exclaimed at once  why did you let them father why didnt you refuse to give him up  felix looked at his brother in the doorway where his curly head nearly touched the wood tods face was puzzled rueful he did not answer  any one could have said he wasnt here we could have smuggled him away now the brutes have got him i dont know that though and he made suddenly for the door  tod did not budge no he said  derek turned his mother was at the other door at the window the two girls  the comedy of this scene if there be comedy in the face of grief was for the moment lost on felix  its come he thought what now  derek had flung himself down at the table and was burying his head in his hands sheila went up to him  dont be a fool derek  however right and natural that remark it seemed inadequate  and felix looked at nedda the blue motor scarf she had worn had slipped off her dark head her face was white her eyes fixed immovably on derek seemed waiting for him to recognize that she was there the boy broke out again  it was treachery we took him in and now weve given him up they wouldnt have touched us if wed got him away not they  felix literally heard the breathing of tod on one side of him and of kirsteen on the other he crossed over and stood opposite his nephew  look here derek he said your mother was quite right you might have put this off for a day or two but it was bound to come you dont know the reach of the law come my dear fellow its no good making a fuss thats childishthe thing is to see that the man gets every chance  derek looked up probably he had not yet realized that his uncle was in the room and felix was astonished at his really haggard face as if the incident had bitten and twisted some vital in his body  he trusted us  felix saw kirsteen quiver and flinch and understood why they had none of them felt quite able to turn their backs on that display of passion something deep and unreasoning was on the boys side something that would not fit with common sense and the habits of civilized society something from an arabs tent or a highland glen then tod came up behind and put his hands on his sons shoulders  come he said milks spilt  all right said derek gruffly and he went to the door  felix made nedda a sign and she slipped out after him   chapter xxii   nedda her blue headgear trailing followed along at the boys side while he passed through the orchard and two fields and when he threw himself down under an ashtree she too subsided waiting for him to notice her  i am here she said at last  at that ironic little speech derek sat up  itll kill him he said  butto burn things derek to light horrible cruel flames and burn things even if they arent alive  derek said through his teeth  its i who did it if id never talked to him hed have been like the others they were taking him in a cart like a calf  nedda got possession of his hand and held it tight  that was a bitter and frightening hour under the faintly rustling ashtree while the wind sprinkled over her flakes of the may blossom just past its prime love seemed now so little a thing seemed to have lost warmth and power seemed like a suppliant outside a door why did trouble come like this the moment one felt deeply  the church bell was tolling they could see the little congregation pass across the churchyard into that weekly dream they knew too well and presently the drone emerged mingling with the voices outside of sighing trees and trickling water of the rub of wings birds songs and the callings of beasts everywhere beneath the sky  in spite of suffering because love was not the first emotion in his heart the girl could only feel he was right not to be loving her that she ought to be glad of what was eating up all else within him it was ungenerous unworthy to want to be loved at such a moment yet she could not help it this was her first experience of the eternal tug between self and the loved one pulled in the hearts of lovers would she ever come to feel happy when he was just doing what he thought was right and she drew a little away from him then perceived that unwittingly she had done the right thing for he at once tried to take her hand again and this was her first lesson too in the nature of man if she did not give her hand he wanted it but she was not one of those who calculate in love so she gave him her hand at once that went to his heart and he put his arm round her till he could feel the emotion under those stays that would not be drawn any closer in this nest beneath the ashtree they sat till they heard the organ wheeze and the furious sound of the last hymn and saw the brisk comingforth with its air of thank god and now to eat till at last there was no stir again about the little churchno stir at all save that of natures ceaseless thanksgiving  tod his brown face still rueful had followed those two out into the air and sheila had gone quickly after him thus left alone with his sisterinlaw felix said gravely  if you dont want the boy to get into real trouble do all you can to show him that the last way in the world to help these poor fellows is to let them fall foul of the law its madness to light flames you cant put out what happened this morning did the man resist  her face still showed how bitter had been her mortification and he was astonished that she kept her voice so level and emotionless  no he went with them quite quietly the back door was open he could have walked out i did not advise him to im glad no one saw his face except myself you see she added hes devoted to derek and derek knows it thats why he feels it so and will feel it more and more the boy has a great sense of honour felix  under that tranquillity felix caught the pain and yearning in her voice yes this woman really felt and saw she was not one of those who make disturbance with their brains and powers of criticism rebellion leaped out from the heat in her heart but he said  is it right to fan this flame do you think any good end is being served waiting for her answer he found himself gazing at the ghost of dark down on her upper lip wondering that he had never noticed it before  very low as if to herself she said  i would kill myself today if i didnt believe that tyranny and injustice must end  in our time  perhaps not  are you content to go on working for an utopia that you will never see  while our laborers are treated and housed more like dogs than human beings while the best life under the sunbecause life on the soil might be the best lifeis despised and starved and made the plaything of peoples tongues neither i nor mine are going to rest  the admiration she inspired in felix at that moment was mingled with a kind of pity he said impressively  do you know the forces you are up against have you looked into the unfathomable heart of this trouble understood the tug of the towns the call of money to money grasped the destructive restlessness of modern life the abysmal selfishness of people when you threaten their interests the agelong apathy of those you want to help have you grasped all these  and more  felix held out his hand then he said you are truly brave  she shook her head  it got bitten into me very young i was brought up in the highlands among the crofters in their worst days in some ways the people here are not so badly off but theyre still slaves  except that they can go to canada if they want and save old england  she flushed i hate irony  felix looked at her with everincreasing interest she certainly was of the kind that could be relied on to make trouble  ah he murmured dont forget that when we can no longer smile we can only swell and burst it is some consolation to reflect that by the time weve determined to do something really effectual for the ploughmen of england therell be no ploughmen left  i cannot smile at that  and studying her face felix thought youre right there youll get no help from humor  early that afternoon with nedda between them felix and his nephew were speeding toward transham  the little towna hamlet when edmund moreton dropped the e from his name and put up the works which stanley had so much enlargedhad monopolized by now the hill on which it stood living entirely on its ploughs it yet had but little of the true look of a british factory town having been for the most part built since ideas came into fashion with its red roofs and chimneys it was only moderately ugly and here and there an old white timbered house still testified to the fact that it had once been country on this fine sunday afternoon the population were in the streets and presented all that long narrowheadedness that twist and distortion of feature that perfect absence of beauty in face figure and dress which is the glory of the briton who has been for three generations in a town and my greatgrandfatherthought felixdid all this god rest his soul  at a rather new church on the very top they halted and went in to inspect the morton memorials there they were in dedicated corners edmund and his wife catherinecharles edmund and his wife florencemaurice edmund and his wife dorothy clara had set her foot down against stanley and his wife clara being in the fourth her soul was above ploughs and she of course intended to be buried at becket as clara dowager lady freeland for her efforts in regard to the land felix who had a tendency to note how things affected other people watched dereks inspection of these memorials and marked that they excited in him no tendency to ribaldry the boy indeed could hardly be expected to see in them what felix sawan epitome of the great perhaps fatal change that had befallen his native country a record of the beginning of that farback fever whose course ran ever faster which had emptied country into town and slowly surely changed the whole spirit of life when edmund moreton about 1780 took the infection disseminated by the development of machinery and left the farming of his acres to make money that thing was done which they were all now talking about trying to undo with their cries of back to the land back to peace and sanity in the shade of the elms back to the simple and patriarchal state of feeling which old documents disclose back to a time before these little squashed heads and bodies and features jutted every which way before there were long squashed streets of gray houses long squashed chimneys emitting smokeblight long squashed rows of graves and long squashed columns of the daily papers back to wellfed countrymen who could not read with common rights and a kindly feeling for old moretons who had a kindly feeling for them back to all that a dream sirs a dream there was nothing for it now butprogress progress on with the dance let engines rip and the little squashheaded fellows with them commerce literature religion science politics all taking a hand what a glorious chance had money ugliness and ill will such were the reflections of felix before the brass tablet                    in loving memory of                      edmund morton                          and                    his devoted wife                       catherine             at rest in the lord  ad 1816   from the church they went about their proper business to interview a mr pogram of the firm of pogram  collet solicitors in whose hands the interests of many citizens of transham and the country round were almost securely deposited he occupied curiously enough the house where edmund morton himself had lived conducting his works on the one hand and the squirearchy of the parish on the other incorporated now into the line of a long loose street it still stood rather apart from its neighbors behind some large shrubs and trees of the holmoak variety  mr pogram who was finishing his sunday afterlunch cigar was a short cleanshaved man with strong cheeks and those rather lustful grayblue eyes which accompany a sturdy figure he rose when they were introduced and uncrossing his fat little thighs asked what he could do for them  felix propounded the story of the arrest so far as might be in words of one syllable avoiding the sentimental aspect of the question and finding it hard to be on the side of disorder as any modern writer might there was something however about mr pogram that reassured him the small fellow looked a fighterlooked as if he would sympathize with trysts want of a woman about him the tusky but softhearted little brute kept nodding his round sparsely covered head while he listened exuding a smell of lavenderwater cigars and guttapercha when felix ceased he said rather dryly  sir gerald malloring yes sir geralds country agents i rather think are messrs porter of worcester quite so  and a conviction that mr pogram thought they should have been messrs pogram  collet of transham confirmed in felix the feeling that they had come to the right man  i gather mr pogram said and he looked at nedda with a glance from which he obviously tried to remove all earthly desires that you sir and your nephew wish to go and see the man mrs pogram will be delighted to show miss freeland our garden your greatgrandfather sir on the mothers side lived in this house delighted to meet you often heard of your books mrs pogram has read onelet me seethe bannister was it  the balustrade felix answered gently  mr pogram rang the bell quite so he said assizes are just over so that he cant come up for trial till august or september pitygreat pity bail in cases of arsonfor a laborer very doubtful ask your mistress to come please  there entered a faded rose of a woman on whom mr pogram in his time had evidently made a great impression a vista of two or three little pograms behind her was hastily removed by the maid and they all went into the garden  through here said mr pogram coming to a side door in the garden wall we can make a short cut to the police station as we go along i shall ask you one or two blunt questions and he thrust out his under lip  for instance whats your interest in this matter  before felix could answer derek had broken in  my uncle has come out of kindness its my affair sir the man has been tyrannously treated  mr pogram cocked his eye yes yes no doubt no doubt hes not confessed i understand  no but  mr pogram laid a finger on his lips  never say die thats what were here for so he went on youre a rebel socialist perhaps dear me well were all of us something nowadaysim a humanitarian myself often say to mrs pogramhumanitys the thing in this ageand so it is well now what line shall we take and he rubbed his hands shall we have a try at once to upset what evidence theyve got we should want a strong alibi our friends here will commit if they cannobody likes arson i understand he was sleeping in your cottage his room now was it on the ground floor  yes but  mr pogram frowned as who should say ah be careful he had better reserve his defence and give us time to turn round he said rather shortly  they had arrived at the police station and after a little parley were ushered into the presence of tryst  the big laborer was sitting on the stool in his cell leaning back against the wall his hands loose and open at his sides his gaze passed at once from felix and mr pogram who were in advance to derek and the dumb soul seemed suddenly to look through as one may see all there is of spirit in a dog reach out to its master this was the first time felix had seen him who had caused already so much anxiety and that broad almost brutal face with the yearning fidelity in its tragic eyes made a powerful impression on him it was the sort of face one did not forget and might be glad of not remembering in dreams what had put this yearning spirit into so gross a frame destroying its solid coherence why could not tryst have been left by nature just a beerloving serf devoid of grief for his dead wife devoid of longing for the nearest he could get to her again devoid of susceptibility to this young mans influence and the thought of all that was before the mute creature sitting there in heavy hopeless patience stung felixs heart so that he could hardly bear to look him in the face  derek had taken the mans thick brown hand felix could see with what effort the boy was biting back his feelings  this is mr pogram bob a solicitor wholl do all he can for you  felix looked at mr pogram the little man was standing with arms akimbo his face the queerest mixture of shrewdness and compassion and he was giving off an almost needlessly strong scent of guttapercha  yes my man he said you and i are going to have a talk when these gentlemen have done with you and turning on his heel he began to touch up the points of his little pink nails with a penknife in front of the constable who stood outside the cell door with his professional air of giving a man a chance  invaded by a feeling apt to come to him in zoos that he was watching a creature who had no chance to escape being watched felix also turned but though his eyes saw not his ears could not help hearing  forgive me bob its i who got you into this  no sir naught to forgive ill soon be back and then theyll see  by the reddening of mr pograms ears felix formed the opinion that the little man also could hear  tell her not to fret mr derek id like a shirt in case ive got to stop the children needn know where i be though i ant ashamed  it may be a longer job than you think bob  in the silence that followed felix could not help turning the laborers eyes were moving quickly round his cell as if for the first time he realized that he was shut up suddenly he brought those big hands of his together and clasped them between his knees and again his gaze ran round the cell felix heard the clearing of a throat close by and more than ever conscious of the scent of guttapercha grasped its connection with compassion in the heart of mr pogram he caught dereks muttered dont ever think were forgetting you bob and something that sounded like and dont ever say you did it then passing felix and the little lawyer the boy went out his head was held high but tears were running down his cheeks felix followed  a bank of clouds graywhite was rising just above the redtiled roofs but the sun still shone brightly and the thought of the big laborer sitting there knocked and knocked at felixs heart mournfully miserably he had a warmer feeling for his young nephew than he had ever had mr pogram rejoined them soon and they walked on together  well said felix  mr pogram answered in a somewhat grumpy voice  not guilty and reserve defence you have influence young man dumb as a waiter poor devil and not another word did he say till they had reentered his garden  here the ladies surrounded by many little pograms were having tea and seated next the little lawyer whose eyes were fixed on nedda felix was able to appreciate that in happier mood he exhaled almost exclusively the scent of lavenderwater and cigars   chapter xxiii   on their way back to becket after the visit to tryst felix and nedda dropped derek halfway on the road to joyfields they found that the becket household already knew of the arrest woven into a dirge on the subject of the land the last town doings and adventures on golf courses it formed the genial topic of the dinnertable for the bulgarian with his carbohydrates was already a wonder of the past the bigwigs of this weekend were quite a different lot from those of three weeks ago and comparatively homogeneous having only three different plans for settling the land question none of which fortunately involved any more real disturbance of the existing state of things than the potato brownbread plan for all were based on the belief held by the respectable press and constructive portions of the community that omelette can be made without breaking eggs on one thing alone the whole house party was agreedthe importance of the question indeed a sincere conviction on this point was like the card one produces before one is admitted to certain functions no one came to becket without it or if he did he begged borrowed or stole it the moment he smelled claras special potpourri in the hall and though he sometimes threw it out of the railwaycarriage window in returning to town there was nothing remarkable about that the conversational debauch of the first nights dinnerand alas there were only two even at becket during a weekendhad undoubtedly revealed the feeling which had set in of late that there was nothing really wrong with the condition of the agricultural laborer the only trouble being that the unreasonable fellow did not stay on the land it was believed that henry wiltram in conjunction with colonel martlett was on the point of promoting a policy for imposing penalties on those who attempted to leave it without good reason such reason to be left to the discretion of impartial district boards composed each of one laborer one farmer and one landowner decision going by favor of majority and though opinion was rather freely expressed that since the voting would always be two to one against this might trench on the liberty of the subject many thought that the interests of the country were so much above this consideration that something of the sort would be found after all to be the best arrangement the cruder early notions of resettling the land by fostering peasant proprietorship with habitable houses and security of tenure were already under a cloud since it was more than suspected that they would interfere unduly with the game laws and other soundly vested interests mere penalization of those who or whose fathers before them had at great pains planted so much covert enclosed so much common and laid so much country down in grass was hardly a policy for statesmen a section of the guests and that perhaps strongest because most silent distinctly favored this new departure of henry wiltrams coupled with his swinging corn tax it was indubitably a stout platform  a second section of the guests spoke openly in favor of lord settlehams policy of goodwill the whole thing they thought must be voluntary and they did not see any reason why if it were left to the kindness and good intentions of the landowner there should be any land question at all boards would be formed in every county on which such model landowners as sir gerald malloring or lord settleham himself would sit to apply the principles of goodwill against this policy the only criticism was levelled by felix he could have agreed he said if he had not noticed that lord settleham and nearly all landowners were thoroughly satisfied with their existing goodwill and averse to any changes in their education that might foster an increase of it ifhe askedlandowners were so full of goodwill and so satisfied that they could not be improved in that matter why had they not already done what was now proposed and settled the land question he himself believed that the land question like any other was only capable of settlement through improvement in the spirit of all concerned but he found it a little difficult to credit lord settleham and the rest of the landowners with sincerity in the matter so long as they were unconscious of any need for their own improvement according to him they wanted it both ways and so far as he could see they meant to have it  his use of the word sincere in connection with lord settleham was at once pounced on he could not know lord settlehamone of the most sincere of men felix freely admitted that he did not and hastened to explain that he did not question theerparliamentary sincerity of lord settleham and his followers he only ventured to doubt whether they realized the hold that human nature had on them his experience he said of the houses where they had been bred and the seminaries where they had been trained had convinced him that there was still a conspiracy on foot to blind lord settleham and those others concerning all this and since they were themselves part of the conspiracy there was very little danger of their unmasking it at this juncture felix was felt to have exceeded the limit of fair criticism and only that toleration toward literary men of a certain reputation in country houses as persons brought there to say clever and irresponsible things prevented people from taking him seriously  the third section of the guests unquestionably more static than the others confined themselves to pointing out that though the land question was undoubtedly serious nothing whatever would result from placing any further impositions upon landowners for after all what was land simply capital invested in a certain way and very poorly at that and what was capital simply a means of causing wages to be paid and whether they were paid to men who looked after birds and dogs loaded your guns beat your coverts or drove you to the shoot or paid to men who ploughed and fertilized the land what did it matter to dictate to a man to whom he was to pay wages was in the last degree unenglish everybody knew the fate which had come or was coming upon capital it was being driven out of the country by leaps and boundsthough to be sure it still perversely persisted in yielding every year a larger revenue by way of income tax and it would be dastardly to take advantage of land just because it was the only sort of capital which could not fly the country in times of need stanley himself thoughas became a hosthe spoke little and argued not at all was distinctly of this faction and clara sometimes felt uneasy lest her efforts to focus at becket all interest in the land question should not quite succeed in outweighing the passivity of her husbands attitude but knowing that it is bad policy to raise the whip too soon she trusted to her genius to bring him with one run at the finish as they say and was content to wait  there was universal sympathy with the mallorings if a model landlord like malloring had trouble with his people whowho should be immune arson it was the last word felix who secretly shared neddas horror of the insensate cruelty of flames listened nevertheless to the jubilation that they had caught the fellow with profound disturbance for the memory of the big laborer seated against the wall his eyes haunting round his cell quarrelled fiercely with his natural abhorrence of any kind of violence and his equally natural dislike of what brought anxiety into his own lifeand the life almost as precious of his little daughter scarcely a word of the evenings conversation but gave him in high degree the feeling how glib all this is how far from reality how fatted up with shell after shell of comfort and security what do these people know what do they realize of the pressure and beat of raw life that lies behindwhat do even i who have seen this prisoner know for us its as simple as killing a rat that eats our corn or a flea that sucks our blood arson destructive brutelock him up and something in felix said for order for security this may be necessary but something also said our smug attitude is odious  he watched his little daughter closely and several times marked the color rush up in her face and once could have sworn he saw tears in her eyes if the temper of this talk were trying to him hardened at a hundred dinnertables what must it be to a young and ardent creature and he was relieved to find on getting to the drawingroom that she had slipped behind the piano and was chatting quietly with her uncle john  as to whether this or that man liked her nedda perhaps was not more ignorant than other women and she had noted a certain warmth and twinkle in uncle johns eyes the other evening a certain rather jolly tendency to look at her when he should have been looking at the person to whom he was talking so that she felt toward him a trustful kindliness not altogether unmingled with a sense that he was in that office which controls the destinies of those who get into trouble the motives even of statesmen they say are mixed how much more so then of girls in love tucked away behind a steinway which instinct told her was not for use she looked up under her lashes at her uncles still military figure and said softly  it was awfully good of you to come too uncle john  and john gazing down at that round dark head and those slim pretty white shoulders answered  not at allvery glad to get a breath of fresh air  and he stealthily tightened his white waistcoata rite neglected of late the garment seemed to him at the moment unnecessarily loose  you have so much experience uncle do you think violent rebellion is ever justifiable  i do not  nedda sighed im glad you think that she murmured because i dont think it is either i do so want you to like derek uncle john becauseits a secret from nearly every onehe and i are engaged  john jerked his head up a little as though he had received a slight blow the news was not palatable he kept his form however and answered  oh really ah  nedda said still more softly please dont judge him by the other night he wasnt very nice then i know  john cleared his throat  instinct warned her that he agreed and she said rather sadly  you see were both awfully young it must be splendid to have experience  over johns face with its double line between the brows its double line in the thin cheeks its single firm line of mouth beneath a gray moustache there passed a little grimace  as to being young he said thatll change for theerbetter only too fast  what was it in this girl that reminded him of that one with whom he had lived but two years and mourned fifteen was it her youth was it that quick way of lifting her eyes and looking at him with such clear directness or the way her hair grew or what  do you like the people here uncle john  the question caught john as it were between wind and water indeed all her queries seemed to be trying to incite him to those wide efforts of mind which bring into use the philosophic nerve and it was long since he had generalized afresh about either things or people having fallen for many years past into the habit of reaching his opinions down out of some pigeonhole or other to generalize was a youthful practice that one took off as one takes certain garments off babies when they come to years of discretion but since he seemed to be in for it he answered rather shortly not at all  nedda sighed again  nor do i they make me ashamed of myself  john whose dislike of the bigwigs was that of the dogged worker of this life for the dogged talkers wrinkled his brows  hows that  they make me feel as if i were part of something heavy sitting on something else and all the time talking about how to make things lighter for the thing its sitting on  a vague recollection of somebodysome writer a dangerous onehaving said something of this sort flitted through john  do you think england is done for unclei mean about the land  in spite of his conviction that the country was in a bad way john was deeply intimately shocked by that simple little question done for never whatever might be happening underneath there must be no confession of that no the country would keep its form the country would breathe through its nose even if it did lose the race it must never know or let others know even if it were beaten and he said  what on earth put that into your head  only that it seems funny if were getting richer and richer and yet all the time farther and farther away from the life that every one agrees is the best for health and happiness father put it into my head making me look at the little towny people in transham this afternoon i know i mean to begin at once to learn about farm work  you this pretty young thing with the dark head and the pale slim shoulders farm work women were certainly getting queer in his department he had almost daily evidence of that  i should have thought art was more in your line  nedda looked up at him and he was touched by that look so straight and young  its this i dont believe derek will be able to stay in england when you feel very strongly about things it must be awfully difficult to  in bewilderment john answered  why i should have said this was the country of all others for movements and social work andandcranks he paused  yes but those are all for curing the skin and i suppose were really dying of heart disease arent we derek feels that anyway and you see hes not a bit wise not even patientso i expect hell have to go i mean to be ready anyway  and nedda got up only if he does something rash dont let them hurt him uncle john if you can help it  john felt her soft fingers squeezing his almost desperately as if her emotions had for the moment got out of hand and he was moved though he knew that the squeeze expressed feeling for his nephew not for himself when she slid away out of the big room all friendliness seemed to go out with her and very soon after he himself slipped away to the smokingroom there he was alone and lighting a cigar because he still had on his longtailed coat which did not go with that pipe he would so much have preferred he stepped out of the french window into the warm dark night he walked slowly in his evening pumps up a thin path between columbines and peonies late tulips forgetmenots and pansies peering up in the dark with queer monkey faces he had a love for flowers rather starved for a long time past and strangely liked to see them not in the set and orderly masses that should seemingly have gone with his character but in wilder beds where one never knew what flower was coming next once or twice he stopped and bent down ascertaining which kind it was living its little life down there then passed on in that mood of stammering thought which besets men of middle age who walk at nighta mood caught between memory of aspirations spun and over and vision of aspirations that refuse to take shape why should they any morewhat was the use and turning down another path he came on something rather taller than himself that glowed in the darkness as though a great moon or some white round body had floated to within a few feet of the earth approaching he saw it for what it wasa little magnoliatree in the full of its white blossoms those clustering flowerstars printed before him on the dark coat of the night produced in john more feeling than should have been caused by a mere magnoliatree and he smoked somewhat furiously beauty seeking whom it should upset seemed like a girl to stretch out arms and say i am here and with a pang at heart and a long ash on his cigar between lips that quivered oddly john turned on his heel and retraced his footsteps to the smokingroom it was still deserted taking up a review he opened it at an article on the land and fixing his eyes on the first page did not read it but thought that child what folly engaged hm to that young why theyre babes and what is it about her that reminds mereminds mewhat is it lucky devil felixto have her for daughter engaged the little things got her troubles before her wish i had by george yeswish i had and with careful fingers he brushed off the ash that had fallen on his lapel  the little thing who had her troubles before her sitting in her bedroom window had watched his white front and the glowing point of his cigar passing down there in the dark and though she did not know that they belonged to him had thought theres some one nice anyway who likes being out instead of in that stuffy drawingroom playing bridge and talking talking then she felt ashamed of her uncharitableness after all it was wrong to think of them like that they did it for rest after all their hard work and sheshe did not work at all if only aunt kirsteen would let her stay at joyfields and teach her all that sheila knew and lighting her candles she opened her diary to write  life she wrote is like looking at the night one never knows whats coming only suspects as in the darkness you suspect which trees are what and try to see whether you are coming to the edge of anything a moth has just flown into my candle before i could stop it has it gone quite out of the world if so why should it be different for us the same great something makes all life and death all light and dark all love and hatethen why one fate for one living thing and the opposite for another but suppose there is nothing after deathwould it make me say id rather not live it would only make me delight more in life of every kind only human beings brood and are discontented and trouble about future life while derek and i were sitting in that field this morning a bumblebee flew to the bank and tucked its head into the grass and went to sleep just tired out with flying and working at its flowers it simply snoozed its head down and went off we ought to live every minute to the utmost and when were tired out tuck in our heads and sleep if only derek is not brooding over that poor man poor manall alone in the dark with months of misery before him poor soul oh i am sorry for all the unhappiness of people i cant bear to think of it i simply cant and dropping her pen nedda went again to her window and leaned out so sweet the air smelled that it made her ache with delight to breathe it in each leaf that lived out there each flower each blade of grass were sworn to conspiracy of perfume and she thought they must all love each other it all goes together so beautifully then mingled with the incense of the night she caught the savor of woodsmoke it seemed to make the whole scent even more delicious but she thought bewildered smoke cruel fireburning the wood that once grew leaves like those oh it is so mixed it was a thought others have had before her   chapter xxiv   to see for himself how it fared with the big laborer at the hands of preliminary justice felix went into transham with stanley the following morning john having departed early for town the brothers had not further exchanged sentiments on the subject of what stanley called the kickup at joyfields and just as night will sometimes disperse the brooding moods of nature so it had brought to all three the feeling havent we made too much of this havent we been a little extravagant and arent we rather bored with the whole subject arson was arson a man in prison more or less was a man in prison more or less this was especially stanleys view and he took the opportunity to say to felix look here old man the thing is of course to see it in proportion  it was with this intention therefore that felix entered the building where the justice of that neighborhood was customarily dispensed it was a species of small hall somewhat resembling a chapel with distempered walls a platform and benches for the public rather well filled that morningtestimony to the stir the little affair had made felix familiar with the appearance of london police courts noted the efforts that had been made to create resemblance to those models of administration the justices of the peace hastily convoked and four in number sat on the platform with a semicircular backing of high gray screens and a green baize barrier in front of them so that their legs and feet were quite invisible in this way had been preserved the really essential feature of all human justiceat whose feet it is well known one must not look their faces on the contrary were entirely exposed to view and presented that pleasing variety of type and unanimity of expression peculiar to men keeping an open mind below them with his face toward the public was placed a graybearded man at a table also covered with green baize that emblem of authority and to the side at right angles raised into the air sat a little terrier of a man with gingery wired hair obviously the more articulate soul of these proceedings as felix sat down to worship he noticed mr pogram at the green baize table and received from the little man a nod and the faintest whiff of lavender and guttapercha the next moment he caught sight of derek and sheila screwed sideways against one of the distempered walls looking with their frowning faces for all the world like two young devils just turned out of hell they did not greet him and felix set to work to study the visages of justice they impressed him on the whole more favorably than he had expected the one to his extreme left with a graywhiskered face was like a large and sleepy cat of mature age who moved not except to write a word now and then on the paper before him or to hand back a document next to him a man of middle age with bald forehead and dark intelligent eyes seemed conscious now and again of the body of the court and felix thought you have not been a magistrate long the chairman who sat next with the moustache of a heavy dragoon and gray hair parted in the middle seemed on the other hand oblivious of the public never once looking at them and speaking so that they could not hear him and felix thought you have been a magistrate too long between him and the terrier man the last of the four wrote diligently below a clean red face with clipped white moustache and little peaked beard and felix thought retired naval then he saw that they were bringing in tryst the big laborer advanced between two constables his broad unshaven face held high and his lowering eyes through which his strange and tragical soul seemed looking turned this way and that felix who no more than any one else could keep his gaze off the trapped creature felt again all the sensations of the previous afternoon  guilty or not guilty as if repeating something learned by heart tryst answered not guilty sir and his big hands at his sides kept clenching and unclenching the witnesses four in number began now to give their testimony a sergeant of police recounted how he had been first summoned to the scene of burning and afterward arrested tryst sir geralds agent described the eviction and threats uttered by the evicted man two persons a stonebreaker and a tramp narrated that they had seen him going in the direction of the rick and barn at five oclock and coming away therefrom at fivefifteen punctuated by the barking of the terrier clerk all this took time during which there passed through felix many thoughts here was a man who had done a wicked because an antisocial act the sort of act no sane person could defend an act so barbarous stupid and unnatural that the very beasts of the field would turn noses away from it how was it then that he himself could not feel incensed was it that in habitually delving into the motives of mens actions he had lost the power of dissociating what a man did from what he was had come to see him with his thoughts deeds and omissions as a coherent growth and he looked at tryst the big laborer was staring with all his soul at derek and suddenly he saw his nephew stand uptilt his dark head back against the walland open his mouth to speak in sheer alarm felix touched mr pogram on the arm the little square man had already turned he looked at that moment extremely like a frog  gentlemen i wish to say  who are you sit down it was the chairman speaking for the first time in a voice that could be heard  i wish to say that he is not responsible i  silence silence sir sit down  felix saw his nephew waver and sheila pulling at his sleeve then to his infinite relief the boy sat down his sallow face was red his thin lips compressed to a white line and slowly under the eyes of the whole court he grew deadly pale  distracted by fear that the boy might make another scene felix followed the proceedings vaguely they were over soon enough tryst committed defence reserved bail refusedall as mr pogram had predicted  derek and sheila had vanished and in the street outside idle at this hour of a workingday were only the cars of the four magistrates two or three little knots of those who had been in court talking of the case and in the very centre of the street an old darkwhiskered man lame and leaning on a stick  very nearly being awkward said the voice of mr pogram in his ear i say do you thinkno hand himself surely no real hand himself  felix shook his head violently if the thought had once or twice occurred to him he repudiated it with all his force when shaped by anothers mouthand such a mouth so wide and rubbery  no no strange boy extravagant sense of honourtoo sensitive thats all  quite so murmured mr pogram soothingly these young people we live in a queer age mr freeland all sorts of ideas about nowadays young men like thatbetter in the armysafe in the army no ideas there  what happens now said felix  wait said mr pogram nothing else for itwait three monthstwiddle his thumbs bad system rotten  and suppose in the end hes proved innocent  mr pogram shook his little round head whose ears were very red  ah he said often say to my wife wish i werent a humanitarian heart of indiarubberexcellent thingthe greatest blessing well goodmorning anything you want to say at any time let me know and exhaling an overpowering whiff of guttapercha he grasped felixs hand and passed into a house on the door of which was printed in brazen letters edward pogram james collet solicitors agents  on leaving the little humanitarian felix drifted back toward the court the cars were gone the groups dispersed alone leaning on his stick the old darkwhiskered man stood like a jackdaw with a broken wing yearning at that moment for human intercourse felix went up to him  fine day he said  yes sir tis fine enough and they stood silent side by side the gulf fixed by class and habit between soul and human soul yawned before felix as it had never before stirred and troubled he longed to open his heart to this old ragged darkeyed whiskered creature with the game leg who looked as if he had passed through all the thorns and thickets of hard and primitive existence he longed that the old fellow should lay bare to him his heart and for the life of him he could not think of any mortal words which might bridge the unreal gulf between them at last he said  you a native here  no sir from over malvern way livin here with my darter owin to my leg her usband works in this here factory  and im from london felix said  thart you were fine place london they say  felix shook his head not so fine as this worcestershire of yours  the old man turned his quick dark gaze aye he said peoplell be a bit nervylike in towns nowadays the country be a good place for a healthy man too i dont want no better place than the countrynever could abide bein shut in  there arent so very many like you judging by the towns  the old man smiledthat smile was the reverse of a bitter tonic coated with sweet stuff to make it palatable  tes the want of a life takes em he said theres not a many like me theres not so many as cant do without the smell of the earth with these ere newspaperstesnt taught nowadays the boys and gells they goes to school and tes all in favor of the towns there i cant work no more im s good as gone meself but i feel sometimes ill ave to go back i dont like the streets an i guess tes worse in london  ah perhaps felix said there are more of us like you than you think  again the old man turned his dark quick glance  well an i widden say no to that neither ive seen em terrible homesick tes certain sure theres lots would never go ef twasnt so mortial hard on the land tisnt a bare livin after that an theyre put upon right and left theyre put upon tes only a man here and there that as

are they ever going back onto the land  they tark about it i read my newspaper reglar in some places i see theyre makin unions that ant no good  why  the old man smiled again  why think of it the lands different to anythin elsethats why different work different hours four mens work today and ones tomorrow work land wi unions same as theyve got in this ere factory wi their eight hours an their do this an don do that no youve got no weather in factories an suchlike on the land tes a matter o weather on the land a man must be ready for anythin at any time you cant work it no other way tes along o gods comin into it an no use pullin this way an that union says to me you mustnt work after hours hoh ive ad to set up all night wi ship an cattle hundreds o times an no extra for it tes not that way theyll do any good to keep people on the land oh no  how then  well youll want new laws o course to prevent farmers an landowners takin their advantage you want laws to build new cottages but mainly tes a case of hands together cant be no otherthe lands so ticklish if tesnt hands together tes nothing i ad a master once that was never content so longs we wasnt content that farm was better worked than any in the parish  yes but the difficulty is to get masters that can see the other side a man doesnt care much to look at home  the old mans dark eyes twinkled  no an when e does tes generally to say lord ant i right an ant they wrong just thats powerful customary  it is said felix god bless us all  ah you may well say that sir an we want it too a bit more wages wouldnt come amiss neither an a bit more freedom tes a mans liberty e prizes as well as money  did you hear about this arson case  the old man cast a glance this way and that before he answered in a lower voice  they say e was put out of his cottage ive seen men put out for votin liberal ive seen em put out for freethinkin all sorts o things i seen em put out for tes that makes the bad blood a man wants to call is soul is own when alls said an done an e cant not in th old country unless es got the dibs  and yet you never thought of emigrating  thart of itah thart of it hundreds o times but someow cudden never bring mysel to the scratch o not seein th beacon any more i can just see it from ere you know but theres not so many like me an gettin fewer every day  yes murmured felix that i believe  tes a andmade piece o goodsthe land you has to be fond of it same as of your missis and yer chillen these poor pitiful fellows thats workin in this factory makin these here colonial ploughsunions all right for themtes all mechanical but a man on the land es got to put the land first whether tes his own or some one elses or hell never do no good might as well go for a postman any day im keepin of you though with my tattle  in truth felix had looked at the old man for the accursed question had begun to worry him ought he or not to give the lame old fellow something would it hurt his feelings why could he not say simply friend im better off than you help me not to feel so unfairly favored perhaps he might risk it and diving into his trousers pockets he watched the old mans eyes if they followed his hand he would risk it but they did not withdrawing his hand he said  have a cigar  the old fellows dark face twinkled  i don know he said as i ever smoked one but i can have a darned old try  take the lot said felix and shuffled into the others pocket the contents of his cigarcase if you get through one youll want the rest theyre pretty good  ah said the old man shuldn wonder neither  goodby i hope your leg will soon be better  thank ee sir goodby thank ee  looking back from the turning felix saw him still standing there in the middle of the empty street  having undertaken to meet his mother who was returning this afternoon to becket he had still two hours to put away and passing mr pograms house he turned into a path across a cloverfield and sat down on a stile he had many thoughts sitting at the foot of this little townwhich his greatgrandfather had brought about and chiefly he thought of the old man he had been talking to sent there as it seemed to him by providence to afford a prototype for his the last of the laborers wonderful that the old fellow should talk of loving the land whereon he must have toiled for sixty years or so at a number of shillings per week that would certainly not buy the cigars he had shovelled into that ragged pocket wonderful and yet a marvellous sweet thing when all was saidthis land changing its sheen and texture the feel of its air its very scent from day to day this land with myriad offspring of flowers and flying folk the majestic and untiring march of seasons spring and its wistful ecstasy of saplings and its yearning wild windloosened heart gleam and song blossom and cloud and the swift white rain each upturned leaf so little and so glad to flutter each wood and field so full of peeping things summer ah summer when on the solemn old trees the long days shone and lingered and the glory of the meadows and the murmur of life and the scent of flowers bewildered tranquillity till surcharge of warmth and beauty brooded into dark passion and broke and autumn in mellow haze down on the fields and woods smears of gold already on the beeches smears of crimson on the rowans the appletrees still burdened and a flaxblue sky wellnigh merging with the misty air the cattle browsing in the lingering golden stillness not a breath to fan the blue smoke of the weedfiresand in the fields no one movingwho would disturb such mellow peace and winter the long spaces the long dark and yetand yet what delicate loveliness of twig tracery what blur of rose and brown and purple caught in the bare boughs and in the early sunset sky what sharp dark flights of birds in the graywhite firmament who cared what season held in its arms this land that had bred them all  not wonderful that into the veins of those who nursed it tending watching its perpetual fertility should be distilled a love so deep and subtle that they could not bear to leave it to abandon its hills and greenness and birdsongs and all the impress of their forefathers throughout the ages  like so many of his fellowscultured moderns alien to the larger forms of patriotism that rich liquor brewed of maps and figures commercial profit and highcockalorum which served so perfectly to swell smaller headsfelix had a love of his native land resembling love for a woman a kind of sensuous chivalry a passion based on her charm on her tranquillity on the power she had to draw him into her embrace to make him feel that he had come from her from her alone and into her alone was going back and this green parcel of his native land from which the half of his blood came and that the dearest half had a potency over his spirit that he might well be ashamed of in days when the true briton was a townbred creature with a foot of fancy in all four corners of the globe there was ever to him a special flavor about the elmgirt fields the flowery coppices of this country of the old moretons a special fascination in its full whiteclouded skies its grassedged roads its pied and creamy cattle and the bluegreen loom of the malvern hills if god walked anywhere for him it was surely here sentiment without sentiment without that love each for his own corner the land was lost indeed not if all becket blew trumpets till kingdom came would the land be reformed if they lost sight of that to fortify men in love for their motherland to see that insecurity grinding poverty interference petty tyranny could no longer undermine that lovethis was to be surely must be done monotony was that cry true what work now performed by humble men was less monotonous than work on the land what work was even a tenth part so varied never quite the same from day to day now weeding now hay now roots now hedging now corn with sowing reaping threshing stacking thatching the care of beasts and their companionship sheepdipping shearing woodgathering applepicking cidermaking fashioning and tarring gates whitewashing walls carting trenchingnever never two days quite the same monotony the poor devils in factories in shops in mines poor devils driving busses punching tickets cleaning roads baking cooking sewing typing stokers machinetenders bricklayers dockers clerks ah that great company from towns might well cry out monotony true they got their holidays true they had more social lifea point that might well be raised at becket holidays and social life for men on the soil butand suddenly felix thought of the long long holiday that was before the laborer tryst twiddle his thumbsin the words of the little humanitariantwiddle his thumbs in a space twelve feet by seven no sky to see no grass to smell no beast to bear him company no anythingfor what resources in himself had this poor creature no anything but to sit with tragic eyes fixed on the wall before him for eighty days and eighty nights before they tried him and thennot till thenwould his punishment for that moments blind revenge for grievous wrong begin what on this earth of gods was more disproportioned and wickedly extravagant more crassly stupid than the arrangements of his most perfect creature man what a devil was man who could yet rise to such sublime heights of love and heroism what a ferocious brute the most ferocious and coldblooded brute that lived of all creatures most to be stampeded by fear into a callous torturer fearthought felixfear not momentary panic such as makes our brother animals do foolish things conscious calculating fear paralyzing the reason of our minds and the generosity of our hearts a detestable thing tryst has done a hateful act but his punishment will be twentyfold as hateful  and unable to sit and think of it felix rose and walked on through the fields   chapter xxv   he was duly at transham station in time for the london train and after a minute consecrated to looking in the wrong direction he saw his mother already on the platform with her bag an aircushion and a beautifully neat roll  travelling third he thought why will she do these things  slightly flushed she kissed felix with an air of abstraction  how good of you to meet me darling  felix pointed in silence to the crowded carriage from which she had emerged frances freeland looked a little rueful it would have been delightful she said there was a dear baby there and of course i couldnt have the window down so it was rather hot  felix who could just see the dear baby said dryly  so thats how you go about is it have you had any lunch  frances freeland put her hand under his arm now dont fuss darling heres sixpence for the porter theres only one trunkits got a violet label do you know them theyre so useful you see them at once i must get you some  let me take those things you wont want this cushion ill let the air out  im afraid you wont be able dear its quite the best screw ive ever come acrossa splendid thing i cant get it undone  ah said felix and now we may as well go out to the car  he was conscious of a slight stoppage in his mothers footsteps and rather a convulsive squeeze of her hand on his arm looking at her face he discovered it occupied with a process whose secret he could not penetrate a kind of disarray of her features rapidly and severely checked and capped with a resolute smile they had already reached the station exit where stanleys car was snorting frances freeland looked at it then mounting rather hastily sat compressing her lips  when they were off felix said  would you like to stop at the church and have a look at the brasses to your grandfather and the rest of them  his mother who had slipped her hand under his arm again answered  no dear ive seen them the church is not at all beautiful i like the old church at becket so much better it is such a pity your greatgrandfather was not buried there  she had never quite got over the lack of niceness about those ploughs  going as was the habit of stanleys car at considerable speed felix was not at first certain whether the peculiar little squeezes his arm was getting were due to the bounds of the creature under them or to some cause more closely connected with his mother and it was not till they shaved a cart at the turning of the becket drive that it suddenly dawned on him that she was in terror he discovered it in looking round just as she drew her smile over a spasm of her face and throat and leaning out of the car he said  drive very slowly batter i want to look at the trees  a little sigh rewarded him since she had said nothing he said nothing and claras words in the hall seemed to him singularly tactless  oh i meant to have reminded you felix to send the car back and take a fly i thought you knew that mothers terrified of motors and at his mothers answer  oh no i quite enjoyed it dear he thought bless her heart she is a stoic  whether or no to tell her of the kickup at joyfields exercised his mind the question was intricate for she had not yet been informed that nedda and derek were engaged and felix did not feel at liberty to forestall the young people that was their business on the other hand she would certainly glean from clara a garbled understanding of the recent events at joyfields if she were not first told of them by himself and he decided to tell her with the natural trepidation of one who living among principles and theories never quite knew what those for whom each fact is unrelated to anything else under the moon were going to think frances freeland he knew well kept facts and theories especially unrelated or rather modified her facts to suit her theories instead of like felix her theories to suit her facts for example her instinctive admiration for church and state her instinctive theory that they rested on gentility and people who were nice was never for a moment shaken when she saw a halfstarved baby of the slums her heart would impel her to pity and feed the poor little baby if she could but to correlate the creature with millions of other such babies and those millions with the church and state would not occur to her and if felix made an attempt to correlate them for her she would look at him and think dear boy how good he is i do wish he wouldnt let that line come in his forehead it does so spoil it and she would say yes darling i know its very sad only im not clever and if a liberal government chanced to be in power would add of course i do think this government is dreadful i must show you a sermon of the dear bishop of walham i cut it out of the daily mystery he puts things so wellhe always has such nice ideas  and felix getting up would walk a little and sit down again too suddenly then as if entreating him to look over her want of cleverness she would put out a hand that for all its whiteness had never been idle and smooth his forehead it had sometimes touched him horribly to see with what despair she made attempts to follow him in his correlating efforts and with what relief she heard him cease enough to let her say yes dear only i must show you this new kind of expanding cork its simply splendid it bottles up everything and after staring at her just a moment he would acquit her of irony very often after these occasions he had thought and sometimes said mother youre the best conservative i ever met she would glance at him then with a special loving doubtfulness at a loss as to whether or no he had designed to compliment her  when he had given her half an hour to rest he made his way to the blue corridor where a certain room was always kept for her who never occupied it long enough at a time to get tired of it she was lying on a sofa in a loose gray cashmere gown the windows were open and the light breeze just moved in the folds of the chintz curtains and stirred perfume from a bowl of pinksher favorite flowers there was no bed in this bedroom which in all respects differed from any other in claras house as though the spirit of another age and temper had marched in and dispossessed the owner felix had a sensation that one was by no means all body here on the contrary there was not a trace of the body anywhere as if some one had decided that the body was not quite nice no bed no washstand no chest of drawers no wardrobe no mirror not even a jar of claras special potpourri and felix said  this cant be your bedroom mother  frances freeland answered with a touch of deprecating quizzicality  oh yes darling i must show you my arrangements and she rose this she said you see goes under there and that under here and that again goes under this then they all go under that and then i pull this its lovely  but why said felix  oh but dont you see its so nice nobody can tell and it doesnt give any trouble  and when you go to bed  oh i just pop my clothes into this and open that and there i am its simply splendid  i see said felix do you think i might sit down or shall i go through  frances freeland loved him with her eyes and said  naughty boy  and felix sat down on what appeared to be a windowseat  well he said with slight uneasiness for she was hovering i think youre wonderful  frances freeland put away an impeachment that she evidently felt to be too soft  oh but its all so simple darling and felix saw that she had something in her hand and mind  this is my little electric brush itll do wonders with your hair while you sit there ill just try it  a clicking and a whirring had begun to occur close to his ear and something darted like a gadfly at his scalp  i came to tell you something serious mother  yes darling itll be simply lovely to hear it and you mustnt mind this because it really is a firstrate thingquite new  now how is it thought felix that any one who loves the new as she does when its made of matter will not even look at it when its made of mind and while the little machine buzzed about his head he proceeded to detail to her the facts of the state of things that existed at joyfields  when he had finished she said  now darling bend down a little  felix bent down and the little machine began severely tweaking the hairs on the nape of his neck he sat up again rather suddenly  frances freeland was contemplating the little machine  how very provoking its never done that before  quite so felix murmured but about joyfields  oh my dear it is such a pity they dont get on with those mallorings i do think it sad they werent brought up to go to church  felix stared not knowing whether to be glad or sorry that his recital had not roused within her the faintest suspicion of disaster how he envied her that singleminded power of not seeing further than was absolutely needful and suddenly he thought she really is wonderful with her love of church how it must hurt her that we none of us go not even john and yet she never says a word there really is width about her a power of accepting the inevitable never was woman more determined to make the best of a bad job its a great quality and he heard her say  now darling if i give you this you must promise me to use it every morning youll find youll soon have a splendid crop of little young hairs  i know he said gloomily but they wont come to anything age has got my head mother just as its got the lands  oh nonsense you must go on with it thats all  felix turned so that he could look at her she was moving round the room now meticulously adjusting the framed photographs of her family that were the only decoration of the walls how formal chiselled and delicate her face yet how almost fanatically decisive how frail and light her figure yet how indomitably active and the memory assailed him of how four years ago she had defeated double pneumonia without having a doctor simply by lying on her back she leaves trouble he thought until its under her nose then simply tells it that it isnt there theres something very english about that  she was chasing a bluebottle now with a little fan made of wire and coming close to felix said  have you seen these darling youve only to hit the fly and it kills him at once  but do you ever hit the fly  oh yes and she waved the fan at the bluebottle which avoided it without seeming difficulty  i cant bear hurting them but i dont like flies there  the bluebottle flew out of the window behind felix and in at the one that was not behind him he rose  you ought to rest before tea mother  he felt her searching him with her eyes as if trying desperately to find something she might bestow upon or do for him  would you like this wire  with a feeling that he was defrauding love he turned and fled she would never rest while he was there and yet there was that in her face which made him feel a brute to go  passing out of the house sunk in its monday hush no vestige of a bigwig left felix came to that newwalled mound where the old house of the moretons had been burned by soldiers from tewkesbury and gloucester as said the old chronicles dear to the heart of clara and on the wall he sat him down above in the uncut grass he could see the burning blue of a peacocks breast where the heraldic bird stood digesting grain in the repose of perfect breeding and below him gardeners were busy with the gooseberries gardeners and the gooseberries of the great he thought such is the future of our land and he watched them how methodically they went to work how patient and welldonefor they looked after all was it not the ideal future gardeners gooseberries and the great each of the three content in that station of life into which what more could a country want gardeners gooseberries and the great the phrase had a certain hypnotic value why trouble why fuss gardeners gooseberries and the great a perfect land a land dedicate to the weekend gardeners goose and suddenly he saw that he was not alone half hidden by the angle of the wall on a stone of the foundations carefully preserved and nearly embedded in the nettles which clara had allowed to grow because they added age to the appearance was sitting a bigwig one of the settleham faction he had impressed felix alike by his reticence the steady sincerity of his gray eyes a countenance that beneath a simple and delicate urbanity had still in it something of the best type of schoolboy how comes he to have stayed he mused i thought they always fed and scattered and having received an answer to his salutation he moved across and said  i imagined youd gone  ive been having a look round its very jolly here my affections are in the north but i suppose this is pretty well the heart of england  near the big song felix answered therell never be anything more english than shakespeare when alls said and done and he took a steady sidelong squint at his companion this is another of the types ive been looking for he reflected the peculiar dontquitetouchme accent of the aristocratand of those who would behad almost left this particular one as though he secretly aspired to rise superior and only employed it in the nervousness of his first greetings yes thought felix hes just about the very best we can do among those who sit upon the land i would wager theres not a better landlord nor a better fellow in all his class than this one hes chalks away superior to malloring if i know anything of faceswould never have turned poor tryst out if this exception were the rule and yet does he can he go quite far enough to meet the case if notwhat hope of regeneration from above would he give up his shooting could he give up feeling hes a leader would he give up his town house and collecting whatever it is he collects could he let himself sink down and merge till he was just unseen leaven of goodfellowship and goodwill working in the common bread and squinting at that sincere clean charming almost fine face he answered himself unwillingly he could not and suddenly he knew that he was face to face with the tremendous question which soon or late confronts all thinkers sitting beside himwas the highest product of the present system with its charm humanity courage chivalry up to a point its culture and its cleanliness this decidedly rare flower at the end of a tall stalk with dark and tortuous roots and rank foliage was in a sense the sole justification of power wielded from above and was it good enough was it quite good enough like so many other thinkers felix hesitated to reply if only merit and the goods of this world could be finally divorced if the reward of virtue were just mens love and an unconscious selfrespect if only to have nothing were the highest honour and yet to do away with this beside him and put in its placewhat no kissmequick change had a chance of producing anything better to scrap the long growth of man and start afresh was but to say since in the past the best that man has done has not been good enough i have a perfect faith in him for the future no that was a creed for archangels and other extremists safer to work on what we had and he began  next door to this estate im told theres ten thousand acres almost entirely grass and covert owned by lord baltimore who lives in norfolk london cannes and anywhere else that the whim takes him he comes down here twice a year to shoot the case is extremely common surely it spells paralysis if land is to be owned at all in such great lumps owners ought at least to live on the lumps and to pass very high examinations as practical farmers they ought to be the life and soul the radiating sun of their little universes or else they ought to be cleared out how expect keen farming to start from such an example it really looks to me as if the game laws would have to go and he redoubled his scrutiny of the bigwigs face a little furrow in its brow had deepened visibly but nodding he said  the absentee landlord is a curse of course im afraid im a bit of a one myself and im bound to saythough im keen on shootingif the game laws were abolished it might do a lot  you wouldnt move in that direction i suppose  the bigwig smiledcharming rather whimsical that smile  honestly im not up to it the spirit you know but the flesh my line is housing and wages of course  there it is thought felix up to a point theyll movenot up to the point its all fiddling one wont give up his shooting another wont give up his power a third wont give up her weekends a fourth wont give up his freedom our interest in the thing is all lackadaisical a kind of bunfight of pet notions theres no real steam and abruptly changing the subject he talked of pictures to the pleasant bigwig in the sleepy afternoon of how this man could paint and that man couldnt and in the uncut grass the peacock slowly moved displaying his breast of burning blue and below the gardeners worked among the gooseberries   chapter xxvi   nedda borrowing the bicycle of claras maid sirrett had been over to joyfields and only learned on her return of her grandmothers arrival in her bath before dinner there came to her one of those strategic thoughts that even such as are no longer quite children will sometimes conceive she hurried desperately into her clothes and ready full twenty minutes before the gong was due to sound made her way to her grandmothers room frances freeland had just pulled this and to her astonishment that had not gone in properly she was looking at it somewhat severely when she heard neddas knock drawing a screen temporarily over the imperfection she said come in  the dear child looked charming in her white evening dress with one red flower in her hair and while she kissed her she noted that the neck of her dress was just a little too open to be quite nice and at once thought ive got the very thing for that  going to a drawer that no one could have suspected of being there she took from it a little diamond star getting delicate but firm hold of the mechlin at the top of the frock she popped it in so that the neck was covered at least an inch higher and said  now ducky youre to keep that as a little present youve no idea how perfectly it suits you just like this and having satisfied for the moment her sense of niceness and that continual itch to part with everything she had she surveyed her granddaughter lighted up by that red flower and said  how sweet you look  nedda looking down past cheeks colored by pleasure at the new little star on a neck rather browned by her day in the sun murmured  oh granny its much too lovely you mustnt give it to me  these were moments that frances freeland loved best in life and with the untruthfulness in which she only indulged when she gave things away or otherwise benefited her neighbors with or without their will she added its quite wasted i never wear it myself and seeing neddas smile for the girl recollected perfectly having admired it during dinner at uncle johns and at becket itself she said decisively so thats that and settled her down on the sofa but just as she was thinking i have the very thing for the dear childs sunburn nedda said granny dear ive been meaning to tell youderek and i are engaged  for the moment frances freeland could do nothing but tremulously interlace her fingers  oh but darling she said very gravely have you thought  i think of nothing else granny  but has he thought  nedda nodded  frances freeland sat staring straight before her nedda and derek derek and nedda the news was almost unintelligible those two were still for her barely more than little creatures to be tucked up at night engaged marriage between those who were both as near to her almost as her own children had been the effort was for the moment quite too much for her and a sort of pain disturbed her heart then the crowning principle of her existence came a little to her aid no use in making a fuss must put the best face on it whether it were going to come to anything or not and she said  well darling i dont know im sure i dare say its very lovely for you but do you think youve seen enough of him  nedda gave her a swift look then dropped her lashes so that her eyes seemed closed snuggling up she said  no granny i do wish i could see more if only i could go and stay with them a little  and as she planted that dart of suggestion the gong sounded  in frances freeland lying awake till two as was her habit the suggestion grew to this growth not only her custom of putting the best face on things but her incurable desire to make others happy and an instinctive sympathy with loveaffairs all contributed moreover felix had said something about dereks having been concerned in something rash if darling nedda were there it would occupy his mind and help to make him careful never dilatory in forming resolutions she decided to take the girl over with her on the morrow kirsteen had a dear little spare room and nedda should take her bag it would be a nice surprise for them all accordingly next morning not wanting to give any trouble she sent thomas down to the red lion where they had a comfortable fly with a very steady respectable driver and ordered it to come at half past two then without saying anything to clara she told nedda to be ready to pop in her bag trusting to her powers of explaining everything to everybody without letting anybody know anything little difficulties of this sort never bunkered her she was essentially a woman of action and on the drive to joyfields she stilled the girls quavering with  its all right darling itll be very nice for them  she was perhaps the only person in the world who was not just a little bit afraid of kirsteen indeed she was constitutionally unable to be afraid of anything except motorcars and of course earwigs and even them one must put up with her critical sense told her that this woman in blue was just like anybody else besides her father had been the colonel of a highland regiment which was quite nice and one must put the best face on her  in this way pointing out the beauty of each feature of the scenery and not permitting herself or nedda to think about the bag they drove until they came to joyfields  kirsteen alone was in and having sent nedda into the orchard to look for her uncle frances freeland came at once to the point it was so important she thought that darling nedda should see more of dear derek they were very young and if she could stay for a few weeks they would both know their minds so much better she had made her bring her bag because she knew dear kirsteen would agree with her and it would be so nice for them all felix had told her about that poor man who had done this dreadful thing and she thought that if nedda were here it would be a distraction she was a very good child and quite useful in the house and while she was speaking she watched kirsteen and thought she is very handsome and altogether ladylike only it is such a pity she wears that blue thing in her hairit makes her so conspicuous and rather unexpectedly she said  do you know dear i believe i know the very thing to keep your hair from getting loose its such lovely hair and this is quite a new thing and doesnt show at all invented by a very nice hairdresser in worcester its simplicity itself do let me show you quickly going over she removed the kingfisherblue fillet and making certain passes with her fingers through the hair murmured  its so beautifully fine it seems such a pity not to show it all dear now look at yourself and from the recesses of her pocket she produced a little mirror im sure tod will simply love it like that itll be such a nice change for him  kirsteen with just a faint wrinkling of her lips and eyebrows waited till she had finished then she said  yes mother dear im sure he will and replaced the fillet a patient halfsad halfquizzical smile visited frances freelands lips as who should say yes i know you think that im a fussbox but it really is a pity that you wear it so darling  at sight of that smile kirsteen got up and kissed her gravely on the forehead  when nedda came back from a fruitless search for tod her bag was already in the little spare bedroom and frances freeland gone the girl had never yet been alone with her aunt for whom she had a fervent admiration not unmixed with awe she idealized her of course thinking of her as one might think of a picture or statue a symbolic figure standing for liberty and justice and the redress of wrong her nevervarying garb of blue assisted the girls fancy for blue was always the color of ideals and aspirationwas not blue sky the nearest one could get to heavenwere not blue violets the flowers of spring then too kirsteen was a woman with whom it would be quite impossible to gossip or smalltalk with her one could but simply and directly say what one felt and only that over things which really mattered and this seemed to nedda so splendid that it sufficed in itself to prevent the girl from saying anything whatever she longed to all the same feeling that to be closer to her aunt meant to be closer to derek yet with all she knew that her own nature was very different this perhaps egged her on and made her aunt seem all the more exciting she waited breathless till kirsteen said  yes you and derek must know each other better the worst kind of prison in the world is a mistaken marriage  nedda nodded fervently it must be but i think one knows aunt kirsteen  she felt as if she were being searched right down to the soul before the answer came  perhaps i knew myself i have seen others who dida few i think you might  nedda flushed from sheer joy i could never go on if i didnt love i feel i couldnt even if id started  with another long look through narrowing eyes kirsteen answered  yes you would want truth but after marriage truth is an unhappy thing nedda if you have made a mistake  it must be dreadful awful  so dont make a mistake my dearand dont let him  nedda answered solemnly  i wontoh i wont  kirsteen had turned away to the window and nedda heard her say quietly to herself  libertys a glorious feast  trembling all over with the desire to express what was in her nedda stammered  i would never keep anything that wanted to be freenever never i would never try to make any one do what they didnt want to  she saw her aunt smile and wondered whether she had said anything exceptionally foolish but it was not foolishsurely notto say what one really felt  some day nedda all the world will say that with you until then well fight those who wont say it have you got everything in your room you want lets come and see  to pass from becket to joyfields was really a singular experience at becket you were certainly supposed to do exactly what you liked but the tyranny of meals baths scents and other accompaniments of the allbody regime soon annihilated every impulse to do anything but just obey it at joyfields bodily existence was a kind of perpetual skirmish a sort of grudged accompaniment to a state of soul you might be alone in the house at any mealtime you might or might not have water in your jug and as to baths you had to go out to a little whitewashed shed at the back with a brick floor where you pumped on yourself prepared to shout out halloo im here in case any one else came wanting to do the same the conditions were in fact almost perfect for seeing more of one another nobody asked where you were going with whom going or how going you might be away by day or night without exciting curiosity or comment and yet you were conscious of a certain something always there holding the house together some principle of life or perhapsjust a woman in blue there too was that strangest of all phenomena in an english homeno game ever played outdoors or in  the next fortnight while the grass was ripening was a wonderful time for nedda given up to her single passionof seeing more of him who so completely occupied her heart she was at peace now with sheila whose virility forbade that she should dispute pride of place with this soft and truthful guest so evidently immersed in rapture besides nedda had that quality of getting on well with her own sex found in those women who though tenacious are not possessive who though humble are secretly very selfrespecting who though they do not say much about it put all their eggs in one basket above all who disengage no matter what their age a candid but subtle charm  but that fortnight was even more wonderful for derek caught between two passionsboth so fervid for though the passion of his revolt against the mallorings did not pull against his passion for nedda they both tugged at him and this had one curious psychological effect it made his love for nedda more actual less of an idealization now that she was close to him under the same roof he felt the full allurement of her innocent warmth he would have been coldblooded indeed if he had not taken fire and his pride always checking the expression of his feelings they glowed ever hotter underneath  yet over those sunshiny days there hung a shadow as of something kept back not shared between them a kind of waiting menace nedda learned of kirsteen and sheila all the useful things she could the evenings she passed with derek those long evenings of late may and early june this year so warm and golden they walked generally in the direction of the hills a favorite spot was a wood of larches whose green shoots had not yet quite ceased to smell of lemons tall slender things those trees whose stems and dried lower branchgrowth were gray almost sooty up to the feathery green of the tops that swayed and creaked faintly in a wind with a soughing of their branches like the sound of the sea from the shelter of those highland trees rather strange in such a countryside they two could peer forth at the last sunlight goldpowdering the fringed branches at the sunset flush dyeing the sky above the beacon watch light slowly folding gray wings above the hayfields and the elms mark the squirrels scurry along and the pigeons evening flight a stream ran there at the edge and beechtrees grew beside it in the tawnydappled sand bed of that clear water and the graygreen dappled trunks of those beeches with their great sinuous longmuscled roots was that something which man can never tame or garden out of the land the strength of unconquerable fertilitythe remote deep life in natures heart men and women had their spans of existence those trees seemed as if there forever from generation to generation lovers might come and looking on this strength and beauty feel in their veins the sap of the world here the laborer and his master hearing the wind in the branches and the water murmuring down might for a brief minute grasp the lands unchangeable wild majesty and on the far side of that little stream was a field of mooncolored flowers that had for nedda a strange fascination once the boy jumped across and brought her back a handkerchief full they were of two kinds close to the waters edge the marsh orchis and farther back a small marguerite out of this they made a crown of the alternate flowers and a girdle for her waist that was an evening of rare beauty and warm enough already for an early chafer to go blooming in the dusk an evening when they wandered with their arms round each other a long time silent stopping to listen to an owl stopping to point out each star coming so shyly up in the grayviolet of the sky and that was the evening when they had a strange little quarrel sudden as a white squall on a blue sea or the tiff of two birds shooting up in a swift spiral of attack and thenall over would he come tomorrow to see her milking he could not why he could not he would be out ah he never told her where he went he never let her come with him among the laborers like sheila  i cant im pledged not  then you dont trust me  of course i trust you but a promise is a promise you oughtnt to ask me nedda  no but i would never have promised to keep anything from you  you dont understand  oh yes i do love doesnt mean the same to you that it does to me  how do you know what it means to me  i couldnt have a secret from you  then you dont count honour  honour only binds oneself  what dyou mean by that  i include youyou dont include me in yourself thats all  i think youre very unjust i was obliged to promise it doesnt only concern myself  then silent motionless a yard apart they looked fiercely at each other their hearts stiff and sore and in their brains no glimmer of perception of anything but tragedy what more tragic than to have come out of an elysium of warm arms round each other to this sudden hostility and the owl went on hooting and the larches smelled sweet and all around was the same soft dusk wherein the flowers in her hair and round her waist gleamed white but for nedda the world had suddenly collapsed tears rushed into her eyes she shook her head and turned away hiding them passionately a full minute passed each straining to make no sound and catch the faintest sound from the other till in her breathing there was a little clutch his fingers came stealing round touched her cheeks and were wetted his arms suddenly squeezed all breath out of her his lips fastened on hers she answered those lips with her own desperately bending her head back shutting her wet eyes and the owl hooted and the white flowers fell into the dusk off her hair and waist  after that they walked once more enlaced avoiding with what perfect care any allusion to the sudden tragedy giving themselves up to the bewildering ecstasy that had started throbbing in their blood with that kiss longing only not to spoil it and through the sheltering larch wood their figures moved from edge to edge like two little souls in paradise unwilling to come forth  after that evening love had a poignancy it had not quite had before at once deeper sweeter tinged for both of them with the rich darkness of passion and with discovery that love does not mean a perfect merger of one within another for both felt themselves in the right over that little quarrel the boy that he could not must not resign what was not his to resign feeling dimly without being quite able to shape the thought even to himself that a man has a life of action into which a woman cannot always enter with which she cannot always be identified the girl feeling that she did not want any life into which he did not enter so that it was hard that he should want to exclude her from anything for all that she did not try again to move him to let her into the secret of his plans of revolt and revenge and disdained completely to find them out from sheila or her aunt  and the grass went on ripening many and various as the breeds of men or the trees of a forest were the stalks that made up that greenish jungle with the waving fawncolored surface of ryegrass and bromegrass of timothy plantain and yarrow of bentgrass and quakegrass foxtail and the greenhearted trefoil of dandelion dock muskthistle and sweetscented vernal  on the 10th of june tod began cutting his three fields the whole family with nedda and the three tryst children working like slaves old gaunt who looked to the harvests to clothe him for the year came to do his share of raking and any other who could find some evening hours to spare the whole was cut and carried in three days of glorious weather  the lovers were too tired the last evening of hay harvest to go rambling and sat in the orchard watching the moon slide up through the coppice behind the church they sat on tods log deliciously weary in the scent of the newmown hay while moths flitted gray among the blue darkness of the leaves and the whitened trunks of the appletrees gleamed ghostly it was very warm a night of whispering air opening all hearts and derek said  youll know tomorrow nedda  a flutter of fear overtook her what would she know   chapter xxvii   on the 13th of june sir gerald malloring returning home to dinner from the house of commons found on his hall table enclosed in a letter from his agent the following paper   we the undersigned laborers on sir gerald mallorings estate beg respectfully to inform him that we consider it unjust that any laborer should be evicted from his cottage for any reason connected with private life or social or political convictions and we respectfully demand that before a laborer receives notice to quit for any such reason the case shall be submitted to all his fellow laborers on the estate and that in the future he shall only receive such notice if a majority of his fellow laborers record their votes in favor of the notice being given in the event of this demand being refused we regretfully decline to take any hand in getting in the hay on sir gerald mallorings estate   then followed ninetythree signatures or signs of the cross with names printed after them  the agents letter which enclosed this document mentioned that the hay was already ripe for cutting that everything had been done to induce the men to withdraw the demand without success and that the farmers were very much upset the thing had been sprung on them the agent having no notion that anything of the sort was on foot it had been very secretly very cleverly managed and in the agents opinion was due to mr freelands family he awaited sir geralds instructions working double tides with luck and good weather the farmers and their families might perhaps save half of the hay  malloring read this letter twice and the enclosure three times and crammed them deep down into his pocket  it was preeminently one of those moments which bring out the qualities of norman blood and the first thing he did was to look at the barometer it was going slowly down after a month of firstclass weather it would not do that without some sinister intention an old glass he believed in it implicitly he tapped and it sank further he stood there frowning should he consult his wife general friendliness said yes a norman instinct of chivalry and perhaps the deeper norman instinct that when it came to the point women were too violent said no he went upstairs three at a time and came down two and all through dinner he sat thinking it over and talking as if nothing had happened so that he hardly spoke threequarters of the hay at stake if it rained soon a big loss to the farmers a further reduction in rents already far too low should he grin and bear it and by doing nothing show these fellows that he could afford to despise their cowardly device for it was cowardly to let his grass get ripe and play it this low trick but if he left things unfought this time they would try it on again with the cornnot that there was much of that on the estate of a man who only believed in corn as a policy  should he make the farmers sack the lot and get in other labor but where agricultural laborers were made not born and it took a deuce of a lot of making at that should he suspend wages till they withdrew their demand that might dobut he would still lose the hay the hay after all anybody pretty well could make hay it was the least skilled of all farm work so long as the farmers were there to drive the machines and direct why not act vigorously and his jaws set so suddenly on a piece of salmon that he bit his tongue the action served to harden a growing purpose so do small events influence great suspend those fellows wages get down strikebreakers save the hay and if there were a rowwell let there be a row the constabulary would have to act it was characteristic of his really norman spirit that the notion of agreeing to the demand or even considering whether it were just never once came into his mind he was one of those comprising nowadays nearly all his class together with their press who habitually referred to his country as a democratic power a champion of democracybut did not at present suspect the meaning of the word nor to say truth was it likely they ever would nothing however made him more miserable than indecision and so now that he was on the point of deciding and the decision promised vigorous consequences he felt almost elated closing his jaws once more too firmly this time on lamb he bit his tongue again it was impossible to confess what he had done for two of his children were there expected to eat with that wellbred detachment which precludes such happenings and he rose from dinner with his mind made up instead of going back to the house of commons he went straight to a strikebreaking agency no grass should grow under the feet of his decision thence he sought the one postoffice still open despatched a long telegram to his agent another to the chief constable of worcestershire and feeling he had done all he could for the moment returned to the house where they were debating the rural housing question he sat there paying only moderate attention to a subject on which he was acknowledged an authority tomorrow in all probability the papers would have got hold of the affair how he loathed people poking their noses into his concerns and suddenly he was assailed very deep down by a feeling with which in his firmness he had not reckoneda sort of remorse that he was going to let a lot of loafing blackguards down onto his land to toss about his grass and swill their beastly beer above it and all the real love he had for his fields and coverts all the fastidiousness of an english gentleman and to do him justice the qualms of a conscience telling him that he owed better things than this to those born on his estate assaulted him in force he sat back in his seat driving his long legs hard against the pew in front his thick wavy still brown hair was beautifully parted above the square brow that frowned over deepset eyes and a perfectly straight nose now and again he bit into a side of his strawcolored moustache or raised a hand and twisted the other side without doubt one of the handsomest and perhaps the most normanlooking man in the whole house there was a feeling among those round him that he was thinking deeply and so he was but he had decided and he was not a man who went back on his decisions  morning brought even worse sensations those ruffians that he had ordered downthe farmers would never consent to put them up they would have to camp camp on his land it was then that for two seconds the thought flashed through him ought i to have considered whether i could agree to that demand gone in another flash if there was one thing a man could not tolerate it was dictation out of the question but perhaps he had been a little hasty about strikebreakers was there not still time to save the situation from that if he caught the first train the personal touch was everything if he put it to the men on the spot with these strikebreakers up his sleeve surely they must listen after all they were his own people and suddenly he was overcome with amazement that they should have taken such a step what had got into them spiritless enough as a rule in all conscience the sort of fellows who hadnt steam even to join the miniature riflerange that he had given them and visions of them as he was accustomed to pass them in the lanes slouching along with their straw bags their hoes and their shamefaced greetings passed before him yes it was all that fellow freelands family the men had been put up to itput up to it the very wording of their demand showed that very bitterly he thought of the unneighborly conduct of that woman and her cubs it was impossible to keep it from his wife and so he told her rather to his surprise she had no scruples about the strikebreakers of course the hay must be saved and the laborers be taught a lesson all the unpleasantness he and she had gone through over tryst and that gaunt girl must not go for nothing it must never be said or thought that the freeland woman and her children had scored over them if the lesson were once driven home they would have no further trouble  he admired her firmness though with a certain impatience women never quite looked ahead never quite realized all the consequences of anything and he thought by george id no idea she was so hard but then she always felt more strongly about tryst and that gaunt girl than i did  in the hall the glass was still going down he caught the 915 wiring to his agent to meet him at the station and to the impresario of the strikebreakers to hold up their departure until he telegraphed the threemile drive up from the station fully half of which was through his own land put him in possession of all the agent had to tell nasty spirit abroadmen dumb as fishesthe farmers puzzled and angry had begun cutting as best they could not a man had budged he had seen young mr and miss freeland going about the thing had been worked very cleverly he had suspected nothingutterly unlike the laborers as he knew them they had no real grievance either yes they were going on with all their other workmilking horses and that it was only the hay they wouldnt touch their demand was certainly a very funny onevery funnyhad never heard of anything like it amounted almost to security of tenure the tryst affair no doubt had done it malloring cut him short  till theyve withdrawn this demand simmons i cant discuss that or anything  the agent coughed behind his hand  naturally only perhaps there might be a way of wording it that would satisfy them never do to really let them have such decisions in their hands of course  they were just passing tods the cottage wore its usual air of embowered peace and for the life of him malloring could not restrain a gesture of annoyance  on reaching home he sent gardeners and grooms in all directions with word that he would be glad to meet the men at four oclock at the home farm much thought and interviews with several of the farmers who all but onea shaky fellow at bestwere for giving the laborers a sharp lesson occupied the interval though he had refused to admit the notion that the men could be chicaned as his agent had implied he certainly did wonder a little whether a certain measure of security might not in some way be guaranteed which would still leave him and the farmers a free hand but the more he meditated on the whole episode the more he perceived how intimately it interfered with the fundamental policy of all good landownersof knowing what was good for their people better than those people knew themselves  as four oclock approached he walked down to the home farm the sky was lightly overcast and a rather chill draughty rustling wind had risen resolved to handle the men with the personal touch he had discouraged his agent and the farmers from coming to the conference and passed the gate with the bracedup feeling of one who goes to an encounter in that very spickandspan farmyard ducks were swimming leisurely on the greenish pond white pigeons strutting and preening on the eaves of the barn and his keen eye noted that some tiles were out of order up there four oclock ah here was a fellow coming and instinctively he crisped his hands that were buried in his pockets and ran over to himself his opening words then with a sensation of disgust he saw that the advancing laborer was that incorrigible land lawyer gaunt the short square man with the ruffled head and the little brightgray eyes saluted uttered an afternoon sir gerald in his teasing voice and stood still his face wore the jeering twinkle that had disconcerted so many political meetings two lean fellows rather alike with lined faces and bitten drooped moustaches were the next to come through the yard gate they halted behind gaunt touching their forelocks shuffling a little and looking sidelong at each other and malloring waited five past four ten past then he said  dyou mind telling the others that im here  gaunt answered  if so be as you was waitin for the meetin i fancy as ow youve got it sir gerald  a wave of anger surged up in malloring dyeing his face brickred so he had come all that way with the best intentionsto be treated like this to meet this land lawyer who he could see was only here to sharpen his tongue and those two scarecrowlooking chaps who had come to testify no doubt to his discomfiture and he said sharply  so thats the best you can do to meet me is it  gaunt answered imperturbably  i think it is sir gerald  then youve mistaken your man  i dont think so sir gerald  without another look malloring passed the three by and walked back to the house in the hall was the agent whose face clearly showed that he had foreseen this defeat malloring did not wait for him to speak  make arrangements the strikebreakers will be down by noon tomorrow i shall go through with it now simmons if i have to clear the whole lot out youd better go in and see that theyre ready to send police if theres any nonsense ill be down again in a day or two and without waiting for reply he passed into his study there while the car was being got ready he stood in the window very sore thinking of what he had meant to do thinking of his good intentions thinking of what was coming to the country when a man could not even get his laborers to come and hear what he had to say and a sense of injustice of anger of bewilderment harrowed his very soul   chapter xxviii   for the first two days of this new kickup that fellow freelands family undoubtedly tasted the sweets of successful mutiny the fellow himself alone shook his head he like nedda had known nothing and there was to him something unnatural and rather awful in this conduct toward dumb crops  from the moment he heard of it he hardly spoke and a perpetual little frown creased a brow usually so serene in the early morning of the day after malloring went back to town he crossed the road to a field where the farmer aided by his family and one of mallorings gardeners was already carrying the hay and taking up a pitchfork without a word to anybody he joined in the work the action was deeper revelation of his feeling than any expostulation and the young people watched it rather aghast  its nothing derek said at last father never has understood and never will that you cant get things without fighting he cares more for trees and bees and birds than he does for human beings  that doesnt explain why he goes over to the enemy when its only a lot of grass  kirsteen answered  he hasnt gone over to the enemy sheila you dont understand your father to neglect the land is sacrilege to him it feeds ushe would saywe live on it weve no business to forget that but for the land we should all be dead  thats beautiful said nedda quickly and true  sheila answered angrily  it may be true in france with their bread and wine people dont live off the land here they hardly eat anything they grow themselves how can we feel like that when were all brought up on mongrel food besides its simply sentimental when there are real wrongs to fight about  your father is not sentimental sheila its too deep with him for that and too unconscious he simply feels so unhappy about the waste of that hay that he cant keep his hands off it  derek broke in mothers right and it doesnt matter except that weve got to see that the men dont follow his example theyve a funny feeling about him  kirsteen shook her head  you neednt be afraid hes always been too strange to them  well im going to stiffen their backs coming sheila and they went  left as she seemed always to be in these days of open mutiny nedda said sadly  what is coming aunt kirsteen  her aunt was standing in the porch looking straight before her a trail of clematis had drooped over her fine black hair down on to the blue of her linen dress she answered without turning  have you ever seen on jubilee nights bonfire to bonfire from hill to hill to the end of the land this is the first lighted  nedda felt something clutch her heart what was that figure in blue priestess prophetess and for a moment the girl felt herself swept into the vision those dark glowing eyes were seeing some violent exalted inexorable flaming vision then something within her revolted as though one had tried to hypnotize her into seeing what was not true as though she had been forced for the moment to look not at what was really there but at what those eyes saw projected from the soul behind them and she said quietly  i dont believe aunt kirsteen i dont really believe i think it must go out  kirsteen turned  you are like your father she saida doubter  nedda shook her head  i cant persuade myself to see what isnt there i never can aunt kirsteen  without reply save a quiver of her brows kirsteen went back into the house and nedda stayed on the pebbled path before the cottage unhappy searching her own soul did she fail to see because she was afraid to see because she was too dull to see or because as she had said there was really nothing thereno flames to leap from hill to hill no lift no tearing in the sky that hung over the land and she thought londonall those big towns their smoke the things they make the things we want them to make that we shall always want them to make arent they there for every laborer whos a slave dad says there are five town workers who are just as much slaves and all those bigwigs with their great houses and their talk and their interest in keeping things where they are arent they there i donti cant believe anything much can happen or be changed oh i shall never see visions and dream dreams and from her heart she sighed  in the meantime derek and sheila were going their round on bicycles to stiffen the backs of the laborers they had hunted lately always in a couple desiring no complications having decided that it was less likely to provoke definite assault and opposition from the farmers to their mother was assigned all correspondence to themselves the verbal exhortations the personal touch it was past noon and they were already returning when they came on the charabancs containing the head of the strikebreaking column the two vehicles were drawn up opposite the gate leading to marrow farm and the agent was detaching the four men destined to that locality with their campinggear by the open gate the farmer stood eying his new material askance dejected enough creatures they lookedpoor devils picked up at ten pound the dozen who by the mingled apathy and sheepish amusement on their faces might never have seen a pitchfork or smelled a field of clover in their lives  the two young freelands rode slowly past the boys face scornfully drawn back into itself the girls flaming scarlet  dont take notice derek said well soon stop that  and they had gone another mile before he added  weve got to make our round again thats all  the words of mr pogram you have influence young man were just there was about derek the sort of quality that belongs to the good regimental officer men followed and asked themselves why the devil they had afterward and if it be said that no worse leader than a fiery young fool can be desired for any movement it may also be said that without youth and fire and folly there is usually no movement at all  late in the afternoon they returned home dead beat that evening the farmers and their wives milked the cows tended the horses did everything that must be done not without curses and next morning the men with gaunt and a big dark fellow called tulley for spokesmen again proffered their demand the agent took counsel with malloring by wire his answer concede nothing was communicated to the men in the afternoon and received by gaunt with the remark i thart we should be hearin that please to thank sir gerald the men concedes their gratitood  that night it began to rain nedda waking could hear the heavy drops pattering on the sweetbrier and clematis thatching her open window the scent of raincooled leaves came in drifts and it seemed a shame to sleep she got up put on her dressinggown and went to thrust her nose into that bath of dripping sweetness dark as the clouds had made the night there was still the faint light of a moon somewhere behind the leaves of the fruittrees joined in the long gentle hissing and now and again rustled and sighed sharply a cock somewhere as by accident let off a single crow there were no stars all was dark and soft as velvet and nedda thought the world is dressed in living creatures trees flowers grass insects ourselveswoven togetherthe world is dressed in life i understand uncle tods feeling if only it would rain till they have to send these strikebreakers back because theres no hay worth fighting about suddenly her heart beat fast the wicket gate had clicked there was something darker than the darkness coming along the path scared but with all protective instinct roused she leaned out straining to see a faint grating sound from underneath came up to her a window being opened and she flew to her door she neither barred it however nor cried out for in that second it had flashed across her suppose its he gone out to do something desperate as tryst did if it were he would come upstairs and pass her door going to his room she opened it an inch holding her breath at first nothing was it fancy or was some one noiselessly rifling the room downstairs but surely no one would steal of uncle tod who everybody knew had nothing valuable then came a sound as of bootless feet pressing the stairs stealthily and the thought darted through her if it isnt he what shall i do and thenwhat shall i doif it is  desperately she opened the door clasping her hands on the place whence her heart had slipped down to her bare feet but she knew it was he before she heard him whisper nedda and clutching him by the sleeve she drew him in and closed the door he was wet through dripping so wet that the mere brushing against him made her skin feel moist through its thin coverings  where have you been what have you been doing oh derek  there was just light enough to see his face his teeth the whites of his eyes  cutting their tentropes in the rain hooroosh  it was such a relief that she just let out a little gasping oh and leaned her forehead against his coat then she felt his wet arms round her his wet body pressed to hers and in a second he was dancing with her a sort of silent ecstatic war dance suddenly he stopped went down on his knees pressing his face to her waist and whispering what a brute what a brute making her wet poor little nedda  nedda bent over him her hair covered his wet head her hands trembled on his shoulders her heart felt as if it would melt right out of her she longed so to warm and dry him with herself and in turn his wet arms clutched her close his wet hands could not keep still on her then he drew back and whispering oh nedda nedda fled out like a dark ghost oblivious that she was damp from head to foot nedda stood swaying her eyes closed and her lips just open then putting out her arms she drew them suddenly in and clasped herself  when she came down to breakfast the next morning he had gone out already and uncle tod too her aunt was writing at the bureau sheila greeted her gruffly and almost at once went out nedda swallowed coffee ate her egg and bread and honey with a heavy heart a newspaper lay open on the table she read it idly till these words caught her eye   the revolt which has paralyzed the hay harvest on sir gerald mallorings worcestershire estate and led to the introduction of strikebreakers shows no sign of abatement a very wanton spirit of mischief seems to be abroad in this neighborhood no reason can be ascertained for the arson committed a short time back nor for this further outbreak of discontent the economic condition of the laborers on this estate is admittedly rather above than below the average   and at once she thought mischief what a shame were people then to know nothing of the real cause of the revoltnothing of the tryst eviction the threatened eviction of the gaunts were they not to know that it was on principle and to protest against that sort of petty tyranny to the laborers all over the country that this rebellion had been started for liberty only simple liberty not to be treated as though they had no minds or souls of their ownwerent the public to know that if they were allowed to think that it was all wanton mischiefthat derek was just a mischiefmakerit would be dreadful some one must write and make this known her father but dad might think it too personalhis own relations mr cuthcott into whose household wilmet gaunt had gone ah mr cuthcott who had told her that he was always at her service why not and the thought that she might really do something at last to help made her tingle all over if she borrowed sheilas bicycle she could catch the nineoclock train to london see him herself make him do something perhaps even bring him back with her she examined her purse yes she had money she would say nothing here because of course he might refuse at the back of her mind was the idea that if a real newspaper took the part of the laborers dereks position would no longer be so dangerous he would be as it were legally recognized and that in itself would make him more careful and responsible whence she got this belief in the legalizing power of the press it is difficult to say unless that reading newspapers but seldom she still took them at their own valuation and thought that when they said we shall do this or we must do that they really were speaking for the country and that fortyfive millions of people were deliberately going to do something whereas in truth as was known to those older than nedda they were speaking and not too conclusively at that for single anonymous gentlemen in a hurry who were not going to do anything she knew that the press had power great powerfor she was always hearing thatand it had not occurred to her as yet to examine the composition of that power so as to discover that while the press certainly had a certain monopoly of expression and that same spirit of body which makes police constables swear by one another it yet contained within its ring fence the sane and advisable futility of a perfectly balanced contradiction so that its only functions practically speaking were the dissemination of news seventenths of which would have been happier in obscurity andirritation of the dutch not of course that the press realized this nor was it probable that any one would tell it for it had powergreat power  she caught her trainglowing outwardly from the speed of her ride and inwardly from the heat of adventure and the thought that at last she was being of some use  the only other occupants of her thirdclass compartment were a friendly looking man who might have been a sailor or other wanderer on leave and his thin driedup blackclothed cottage woman of an old mother they sat opposite each other the son looked at his mother with beaming eyes and she remarked an i says to him says i i says what i says so e says to me he says yes he says thats what i say he says and nedda thought what an old dear and the son looks nice too i do like simple people  they got out at the first stop and she journeyed on alone taking a taxicab from paddington she drove toward grays inn but now that she was getting close she felt very nervous how expect a busy man like mr cuthcott to spare time to come down all that way it would be something though if she could get him even to understand what was really happening and why so that he could contradict that man in the other paper it must be wonderful to be writing daily what thousands and thousands of people read yes it must be a very sacredfeeling life to be able to say things in that particularly authoritative way which must take such a lot of people inthat is make such a lot of people think in the same way it must give a man a terrible sense of responsibility make him feel that he simply must be noble even if he naturally wasnt yes it must be a wonderful profession and only fit for the highest in addition to mr cuthcott she knew as yet but three young journalists and those all weekly  at her timid ring the door was opened by a broadcheeked girl enticingly compact in apron and black frock whose bright color thick lips and rogue eyes came of anything but london it flashed across nedda that this must be the girl for whose sake she had faced mr cuthcott at the luncheontable and she said are you wilmet gaunt  the girl smiled till her eyes almost disappeared and answered yes miss  im nedda freeland miss sheilas cousin ive just come from joyfields how are you getting on  fine thank you miss plenty of life here  nedda thought thats what derek said of her bursting with life and so she is and she gazed doubtfully at the girl whose prim black dress and apron seemed scarcely able to contain her  is mr cuthcott in  no miss hell be down at the paper two hundred and five floodgate street  oh thought nedda with dismay i shall never venture there and glancing once more at the girl whose rogue slits of eyes deep sunk between checkbones and brow seemed to be quizzing her and saying you and mr derekoh i know she went sadly away and first she thought she would go home to hampstead then that she would go back to the station then after all why shouldnt i go and try they cant eat me i will  she reached her destination at the luncheonhour so that the offices of the great evening journal were somewhat deserted producing her card she was passed from hand to hand till she rested in a small bleak apartment where a young woman was typing fast she longed to ask her how she liked it but did not dare the whole atmosphere seemed to her charged with a strenuous solemnity as though everything said we have powergreat power and she waited sitting by the window which faced the street on the buildings opposite she could read the name of another great evening journal why it was the one which had contained the paragraph she had read at breakfast she had bought a copy of it at the station its temperament she knew was precisely opposed to that of mr cuthcotts paper over in that building no doubt there would be the same strenuously loaded atmosphere so that if they opened the windows on both sides little puffs of power would meet in midair above the heads of the passersby as might the broadsides of old threedeckers above the green green sea  and for the first time an inkling of the great comic equipoise in floodgate street and human affairs stole on neddas consciousness they puffed and puffed and only made smoke in the middle that must be why dad always called them those fellows she had scarcely however finished beginning to think these thoughts when a handbell sounded sharply in some adjoining room and the young woman nearly fell into her typewriter readjusting her balance she rose and going to the door passed out in haste through the open doorway nedda could see a large and pleasant room whose walls seemed covered with prints of men standing in attitudes such that she was almost sure they were statesmen and at a table in the centre the back of mr cuthcott in a twiddly chair surrounded by sheets of paper reposing on the floor shining like autumn leaves on a pool of water she heard his voice smothery hurried but still pleasant say take these miss mayne take these begin on them begin confound it whats the time and the young womans voice half past one mr cuthcott and a noise from mr cuthcotts throat that sounded like an adjuration to the deity not to pass over something then the young woman dipped and began gathering those leaves of paper and over her comely back nedda had a clear view of mr cuthcott hunching one brown shoulder as though warding something off and of one of his thin hands ploughing up and throwing back his brown hair on one side and heard the sound of his furiously scratching pen and her heart pattered it was so clear that he was giving them one and had no time for her and involuntarily she looked at the windows beyond him to see if there were any puffs of power issuing therefrom but they were closed she saw the young woman rise and come back toward her putting the sheets of paper in order and as the door was closing from the twiddly chair a noise that seemed to couple god with the condemnation of silly souls when the young woman was once more at the typewriter she rose and said have you given him my card yet  the young woman looked at her surprised as if she had broken some rule of etiquette and answered no  then dont please i can see that hes too busy i wont wait  the young woman abstractedly placed a sheet of paper in her typewriter  very well she said good morning  and before nedda reached the door she heard the clickclick of the machine reducing mr cuthcott to legibility  i was stupid to come she thought he must be terribly overworked poor man he does say lovely things and crestfallen she went along the passages and once more out into floodgate street she walked along it frowning till a man who was selling newspapers said as she passed mind ye dont smile lydy  seeing that he was selling mr cuthcotts paper she felt for a coin to buy one and while searching scrutinized the newsvenders figure almost entirely hidden by the words         great housing scheme        hope for the million   on a buffcolored board while above it his face that had not quite blood enough to be scorbutic was wrapped in the expression of those philosophers to whom a hope would be fatal he was in fact just what he lookeda street stoic and a dim perception of the great social truth the smell of half a loaf is not better than no bread flickered in neddas brain as she passed on was that what derek was doing with the laborersgiving them half the smell of a liberty that was not there and a sudden craving for her father came over her hehe only was any good because he only loved her enough to feel how distracted and unhappy she was feeling how afraid of what was coming so making for a tube station she took train to hampstead  it was past two and felix on the point of his constitutional he had left becket the day after neddas rather startling removal to joyfields and since then had done his level best to put the whole tryst affair with all its somewhat sinister relevance to her life and his own out of his mind as something beyond control he had but imperfectly succeeded  flora herself not too presentminded had in these days occasion to speak to him about the absentminded way in which he fulfilled even the most domestic duties and alan was always saying to him buck up dad with neddas absorption into the little joyfields whirlpool the sun shone but dimly for felix and a somewhat febrile attention to the last of the laborers had not brought it up to his expectations he fluttered under his buff waistcoat when he saw her coming in at the gate she must want something of him for to this pitch of resignation as to his little daughters love for him had he come and if she wanted something of him things would be going wrong again down there nor did the warmth of her embrace and her oh dad it is nice to see you remove that instinctive conviction though delicacy born of love forbade him to ask her what she wanted talking of the sky and other matters thinking how pretty she was looking he waited for the new inevitable proof that youth was first and a mere father only second fiddle now a note from stanley had already informed him of the strike the news had been something of a relief strikes at all events were respectable and legitimate means of protest and to hear that one was in progress had not forced him out of his laborious attempt to believe the whole affair only a molehill he had not however heard of the strikebreakers nor had he seen any newspaper mention of the matter and when she had shown him the paragraph recounted her visit to mr cuthcott and how she had wanted to take him back with her to see for himselfhe waited a moment then said almost timidly should i be of any use my dear she flushed and squeezed his hand in silence and he knew he would  when he had packed a handbag and left a note for flora he rejoined her in the hall  it was past seven when they reached their destination and taking the station fly drove slowly up to joyfields under a showery sky   chapter xxix   when felix and nedda reached tods cottage the three little trysts whose activity could never be quite called play were all the living creatures about the house  where is mrs freeland biddy  we dont know a man came and she went  and miss sheila  she went out in the mornin and mr freelands gone  susie added the dogs gone too  then help me to get some tea  yes  with the assistance of the motherchild and the hindrance of susie and billy nedda made and laid tea with an anxious heart the absence of her aunt who so seldom went outside the cottage fields and orchard disturbed her and while felix refreshed himself she fluttered several times on varying pretexts to the wicket gate  at her third visit from the direction of the church she saw figures coming on the roaddark figures carrying something followed by others walking alongside what sun there had been had quite given in to heavy clouds the light was dull the elmtrees dark and not till they were within two hundred yards could nedda make out that these were figures of policemen then alongside that which they were carrying she saw her aunts blue dress what were they carrying like that she dashed down the steps and stopped no if it were he they would bring him in she rushed back again distracted she could see now a form stretched on a hurdle it was he  dad quick  felix came startled at that cry to find his little daughter on the path wringing her hands and flying back to the wicket gate they were close now she saw them begin to mount the steps those behind raising their arms so that the hurdle should be level derek lay on his back with head and forehead swathed in wet blue linen torn from his mothers skirt and the rest of his face very white he lay quite still his clothes covered with mud terrified nedda plucked at kirsteens sleeve  what is it  concussion the stillness of that blueclothed figure so calm beside her gave her strength to say quietly  put him in my room aunt kirsteen theres more air there and she flew upstairs flinging wide her door making the bed ready snatching her night things from the pillow pouring out cold water sprinkling the air with eau de cologne then she stood still perhaps they would not bring him there yes they were coming up they brought him in and laid him on the bed she heard one say doctorll be here directly maam let him lie quiet then she and his mother were alone beside him  undo his boots said kirsteen  neddas fingers trembled and she hated them for fumbling so while she drew off those muddy boots then her aunt said softly hold him up dear while i get his things off  and with a strange rapture that she was allowed to hold him thus she supported him against her breast till he was freed and lying back inert then and only then she whispered  how long before he  kirsteen shook her head and slipping her arm round the girl murmured courage nedda  the girl felt fear and love rush up desperately to overwhelm her she choked them back and said quite quietly i will i promise only let me help nurse him  kirsteen nodded and they sat down to wait  that quarter of an hour was the longest of her life to see him thus living yet not living with the spirit driven from him by a cruel blow perhaps never to come back curious how things still got themselves noticed when all her faculties were centred in gazing at his face she knew that it was raining again heard the swish and drip and smelled the cool wet perfume through the scent of the eau de cologne that she had spilled she noted her aunts arm as it hovered wetting the bandage the veins and rounded whiteness from under the loose blue sleeve slipped up to the elbow one of his feet lay close to her at the beds edge she stole her hand beneath the sheet that foot felt very cold and she grasped it tight if only she could pass life into him through her hot hand she heard the ticking of her little travellingclock and was conscious of flies wheeling close up beneath the white ceiling of how one by one they darted at each other making swift zigzags in the air and something in her she had not yet known came welling up softening her eyes her face even the very pose of her young bodythe hidden passion of a motherliness that yearned so to kiss the place to make him well to nurse and tend restore and comfort him and with all her might she watched the movements of those rounded arms under the blue sleeveshow firm and exact they were how soft and quiet and swift bathing the dark head then from beneath the bandage she caught sight suddenly of his eyes and her heart turned sick oh they were not quite closed as if he hadnt life enough to close them she bit into her lip to stop a cry it was so terrible to see them without light why did not that doctor come over and over and over again within her the prayer turned let him live oh let him live  the blackbirds out in the orchard were tuning up for evening it seemed almost dreadful they should be able to sing like that all the world was going on just the same if he died the world would have no more light for her than there was now in his poor eyesand yet it would go on the same how was that possible it was not possible because she would die too she saw her aunt turn her head like a startled animal some one was coming up the stairs it was the doctor wiping his wet facea young man in gaiters how youngdreadfully young no there was a little gray at the sides of his hair what would he say and nedda sat with hands tight clenched in her lap motionless as a young crouching sphinx an interminable testing and questioning and answer never smokednever dranknever been ill the blowah here just here concussionyes then long staring into the eyes the eyelids lifted between thumb and finger and at last how could he talk so loud yet it was a comfort toohe would not talk like that if derek were going to diehair cut shortericewatch him like a lynx this and that if he came to nothing else to be done and then those blessed words  but dont worry too much i think itll be all right she could not help a little sigh escaping her clenched teeth  the doctor was looking at her his eyes were nice  sister  cousin  ah well ill get back now and send you out some ice at once  more talk outside the door nedda alone with her lover crouched forward on her knees and put her lips to his they were not so cold as his foot and the first real hope and comfort came to her watch him like a lynxwouldnt she but how had it all happened and where was sheila and uncle tod  her aunt had come back and was stroking her shoulder there had been fighting in the barn at marrow farm they had arrested sheila derek had jumped down to rescue her and struck his head against a grindstone her uncle had gone with sheila they would watch turn and turn about nedda must go now and eat something and get ready to take the watch from eight to midnight  following her resolve to make no fuss the girl went out the police had gone the motherchild was putting her little folk to bed and in the kitchen felix was arranging the wherewithal to eat he made her sit down and kept handing things watching like a cat to see that she put them in her mouth in the way from which only flora had suffered hitherto he seemed so anxious and unhappy and so awfully sweet that nedda forced herself to swallow what she thought would never go down a dry and choky throat he kept coming up and touching her shoulder or forehead once he said  its all right you know my pet concussion often takes two days  two days with his eyes like that the consolation was not so vivid as felix might have wished but she quite understood that he was doing his best to give it she suddenly remembered that he had no room to sleep in he must use dereks no that it appeared was to be for her when she came off duty felix was going to have an allnight sitting in the kitchen he had been looking forward to an allnight sitting for many years and now he had got his chance it was a magnificent opportunitywithout your mother my dear to insist on my sleeping and staring at his smile nedda thought hes like grannyhe comes out under difficulties if only i did  the ice arrived by motorcycle just before her watch began it was some comfort to have that definite thing to see to how timorous and humble are thoughts in a sickroom above all when the sick are stretched behind the muffle of unconsciousness withdrawn from the watcher by halfdeath and yet for him or her who loves there is at least the sense of being alone with the loved one of doing all that can be done and in some strange way of twining hearts with the exiled spirit to nedda sitting at his feet and hardly ever turning eyes away from his still face it sometimes seemed that the flown spirit was there beside her and she saw into his soul in those hours of watching as one looking into a stream sees the leopardlike dapple of its sand and darkstrewn floor just reached by sunlight she saw all his pride courage and impatience his reserve and strange unwilling tenderness as she had never seen them and a queer dreadful feeling moved her that in some previous existence she had looked at that face dead on a field of battle frowning up at the stars that was absurdthere were no previous existences or was it prevision of what would come some day  when at half past nine the light began to fail she lighted two candles in tall thin iron candlesticks beside her they burned without flicker those spires of yellow flame slowly conquering the dying twilight till in their soft radiance the room was full of warm dusky shadows the night outside ever a deeper black two or three times his mother came looked at him asked her if she should stay and receiving a little silent shake of the head went away again at eleven oclock when once more she changed the icecap his eyes had still no lustre and for a moment her courage failed her utterly it seemed to her that he could never win back that death possessed the room already possessed those candleflames the ticking of the clock the dark dripping night possessed her heart could he be gone before she had been his gone where she sank down on her knees covering her eyes what good to watch if he were never coming back a long timeit seemed hourspassed thus with the feeling growing deeper in her that no good would come while she was watching and behind the barrier of her hands she tried desperately to rally courage if things werethey were one must look them in the face she took her hands away his eyes was it light in them was it they were seeingsurely they saw and his lips made the tiniest movement in that turmoil of exultation she never knew how she managed to continue kneeling there with her hands on his but all her soul shone down to him out of her eyes and drew and drew at his spirit struggling back from the depths of him for many minutes that struggle lasted then he smiled it was the feeblest smile that ever was on lips but it made the tears pour down neddas cheeks and trickle off on to his hands then with a stoicism that she could not believe in so hopelessly unreal it seemed so utterly the negation of the tumult within her she settled back again at his feet to watch and not excite him and still his lips smiled that faint smile and his opened eyes grew dark and darker with meaning  so at midnight kirsteen found them   chapter xxx   in the early hours of his allnight sitting felix had first only memories and then kirsteen for companion  i worry most about tod she said he had that look in his face when he went off from marrow farm he might do something terrible if they illtreat sheila if only she has sense enough to see and not provoke them  surely she will felix murmured  yes if she realizes but she wont im afraid even i have only known him look like that three times tod is so gentlepassion stores itself in him and when it comes its awful if he sees cruelty he goes almost mad once he would have killed a man if i hadnt got between them he doesnt know what hes doing at such moments i wishi wish he were back its hard one cant pierce through and see him  gazing at her eyes so dark and intent felix thought if you cant pierce throughnone can  he learned the story of the disaster  early that morning derek had assembled twenty of the strongest laborers and taken them a round of the farms to force the strikebreakers to desist there had been several fights in all of which the strikebreakers had been beaten derek himself had fought three times in the afternoon the police had come and the laborers had rushed with derek and sheila who had joined them into a barn at marrow farm barred it and thrown mangolds at the police when they tried to force an entrance one by one the laborers had slipped away by a rope out of a ventilationhole high up at the back and they had just got sheila down when the police appeared on that side too derek who had stayed to the last covering their escape with mangolds had jumped down twenty feet when he saw them taking sheila and pitching forward hit his head against a grindstone then just as they were marching sheila and two of the laborers away tod had arrived and had fallen in alongside the policemenhe and the dog it was then she had seen that look on his face  felix who had never beheld his big brother in berserk mood could offer no consolation nor had he the heart to adorn the tale and inflict on this poor woman his reflection this you see is what comes of the ferment you have fostered this is the reward of violence he longed rather to comfort her she seemed so lonely and in spite of all her stoicism so distraught and sad his heart went out too to tod how would he himself have felt walking by the side of policemen whose arms were twisted in neddas but so mixed are the minds of men that at this very moment there was born within him the germ of a real revolt against the entry of his little daughter into this family of hotheads it was more now than mere soreness and jealousy it was fear of a danger hitherto but sniffed at but now only too sharply savored  when she left him to go upstairs felix stayed consulting the dark night as ever in hours of ebbed vitality the shapes of fear and doubt grew clearer and more positive they loomed huge out there among the appletrees where the dripdrip of the rain made music but his thoughts were still nebulous not amounting to resolve it was no moment for resolveswith the boy lying up there between the tides of chance and goodness knew what happening to tod and sheila the air grew sharper he withdrew to the hearth where a wood fire still burned gray ash red glow scent oozing from it and while he crouched there blowing it with bellows he heard soft footsteps and saw nedda standing behind him transformed  but in the midst of all his glad sympathy felix could not help thinking better for you perhaps if he had never returned from darkness  she came and crouched down by him  let me sit with you dad it smells so good  very well but you must sleep  i dont believe ill ever want to sleep again  and at the glow in her felix glowed too what is so infectious as delight they sat a long time talking as they had not talked since the first fatal visit to becket of how love and mountains works of art and doing things for others were the only sources of happiness except scents and lying on ones back looking through treetops at the sky and tea and sunlight flowers and hard exercise oh and the sea of how when things went hard one prayedbut what did one pray to was it not to something in oneself it was of no use to pray to the great mysterious force that made one thing a cabbage and the other a king for that could obviously not be weakminded enough to attend and gradually little pauses began to creep into their talk then a big pause and nedda who would never want to sleep again was fast asleep  felix watched those long dark lashes resting on her cheeks the slow soft rise of her breast the touching look of trust and goodness in that young face abandoned to oblivion after these hours of stress watched the little tired shadows under the eyes the tremors of the justparted lips and getting up stealthy as a cat he found a light rug and ever more stealthily laid it over her she stirred at that smiled up at him and instantly went off again and he thought poor little sweetheart she was tired and a passionate desire to guard her from trials and troubles came on him  at four oclock kirsteen slipped in again and whispered she made me promise to come for her how pretty she looks sleeping  yes felix answered pretty and good  nedda raised her head stared up at her aunt and a delighted smile spread over her face is it time again how lovely then before either could speak or stop her she was gone  she is more in love kirsteen murmured than i ever saw a girl of her age  she is more in love felix answered than is good to see  she is not truer than derek is  that may be but she will suffer from him  women who love must always suffer  her cheeks were sunken shadowy she looked very tired when she had gone to get some sleep felix restored the fire and put on a kettle meaning to make himself some coffee morning had broken clear and sparkling after the long rain and full of scent and song what glory equalled this early morning radiance the dewy wonder of everything what hour of the day was such a web of youth and beauty as this when all the stars from all the skies had fallen into the grass a cold nose was thrust into his hand and he saw beside him tods dog the animal was wet and lightly moved his whitetipped tail while his darkyellow eyes inquired of felix what he was going to give a dog to eat then felix saw his brother coming in tods face was wild and absent as a man with all his thoughts turned on something painful in the distance his ruffled hair had lost its brightness his eyes looked as if driven back into his head he was splashed with mud and wet from head to foot he walked up to the hearth without a word  well old man said felix anxiously  tod looked at him but did not answer  come said felix tell us  locked up said tod in a voice unlike his own i didnt knock them down  heavens i should hope not  i ought to have  felix put his hand within his brothers arm  they twisted her arms one of them pushed her from behind i cant understand it how was it i didnt i cant understand  i can said felix they were the law if they had been mere men youd have done it fast enough  i cant understand tod repeated ive been walking ever since  felix stroked his shoulder  go upstairs old man kirsteens anxious  tod sat down and took his boots off  i cant understand he said once more then without another word or even a look at felix he went out and up the stairs  and felix thought poor kirsteen ah welltheyre all about as queer one as the other how to get nedda out of it  and with that question gnawing at him he went out into the orchard the grass was drenching wet so he descended to the road two woodpigeons were crooning to each other truest of all sounds of summer there was no wind and the flies had begun humming in the air cleared of dust the scent of hay was everywhere what about those poor devils of laborers now they would get the sack for this and he was suddenly beset with a feeling of disgust this world where men and women too held what they had took what they could this world of seeing only one thing at a time this world of force and cunning of struggle and primitive appetites of such good things too such patience endurance heroismand yet at heart so unutterably savage  he was very tired but it was too wet to sit down so he walked on now and again he passed a laborer going to work but very few in all those miles and they quite silent did they ever really whistle felix thought were they ever jolly ploughmen or was that always a fiction surely if they cant give tongue this morning they never can he crossed a stile and took a slanting path through a little wood the scent of leaves and sap the dapple of sunlightall the bright early glow and beauty struck him with such force that he could have cried out in the sharpness of sensation at that hour when man was still abed and the land lived its own life how full and sweet and wild that life seemed how in love with itself truly all the trouble in the world came from the manifold disharmonies of the selfconscious animal called man  then coming out on the road again he saw that he must be within a mile or two of becket and finding himself suddenly very hungry determined to go there and get some breakfast   chapter xxxi   duly shaved with one of stanleys razors bathed and breakfasted felix was on the point of getting into the car to return to joyfields when he received a message from his mother would he please go up and see her before he went  he found her looking anxious and endeavoring to conceal it  having kissed him she drew him to her sofa and said now darling come and sit down here and tell me all about this dreadful business and taking up an odorator she blew over him a little cloud of scent its quite a new perfume isnt it delicious  felix who dreaded scent concealed his feelings sat down and told her and while he told her he was conscious of how pathetically her fastidiousness was quivering under those gruesome detailsfighting with policemen fighting with common men prisonfor a lady conscious too of her still more pathetic effort to put a good face on it when he had finished she remained so perfectly still with lips so hard compressed that he said  its no good worrying mother  frances freeland rose pulled something hard and a cupboard appeared she opened it and took out a travellingbag  i must go back with you at once she said  i dont think its in the least necessary and youll only knock yourself up  oh nonsense darling i must  knowing that further dissuasion would harden her determination felix said im going in the car  that doesnt matter i shall be ready in ten minutes oh and do you know this its splendid for taking lines out under the eyes she was holding out a little round box with the lid off just wet your finger with it and dab it gently on  touched by this evidence of her deep desire that he should put as good a face on it as herself felix dabbed himself under the eyes  thats right now wait for me dear i shant be a minute ive only to get my things theyll all go splendidly in this little bag  in a quarter of an hour they had started during that journey frances freeland betrayed no sign of tremor she was going into action and therefore had no patience with her nerves  are you proposing to stay mother felix hazarded because i dont think theres a room for you  oh thats nothing darling i sleep beautifully in a chair it suits me better than lying down felix cast up his eyes and made no answer  on arriving they found that the doctor had been there expressed his satisfaction and enjoined perfect quiet tod was on the point of starting back to transham where sheila and the two laborers would be brought up before the magistrates felix and kirsteen took hurried counsel now that mother whose nursing was beyond reproach had come it would be better if they went with tod all three started forthwith in the car  left alone frances freeland took her baga noticeably old one without any patent clasp whatever so that she could open itwent noiselessly upstairs tapped on dereks door and went in a faint but cheerful voice remarked halloo granny  frances freeland went up to the bed smiled down on him ineffably laid a finger on his lips and said in the stillest voice you mustnt talk darling then she sat down in the window with her bag beside her half a tear had run down her nose and she had no intention that it should be seen she therefore opened her bag and having taken out a little bottle beckoned nedda  now darling she whispered you must just take one of these its nothing new theyre what my mother used to give me at your age and for one hour you must go out and get some fresh air and then you can come back  must i granny  yes you must keep up your strength kiss me  nedda kissed a cheek that seemed extraordinarily smooth and soft received a kiss in the middle of her own and having stayed a second by the bed looking down with all her might went out  frances freeland in the window wasted no thoughts but began to run over in her mind the exact operations necessary to defeat this illness of darling dereks her fingers continually locked and interlocked themselves with fresh determinations her eyes fixed on imaginary foods methods of washing and ways of keeping him quiet had an almost fanatical intensity like a good general she marshalled her means of attack and fixed them in perfect order now and then she gazed into her bag making quite sure that she had everything and nothing that was newfangled or liable to go wrong for into action she never brought any of those patent novelties that delighted her soul in times of peace for example when she herself had pneumonia and no doctor for two months it was well known that she had lain on her back free from every kind of remedy employing only courage nature and beef tea or some such simple sustenance  having now made her mental dispositions she got up without sound and slipped off a petticoat that she suspected of having rustled a little when she came in folding and popping it where it could not be suspected any more she removed her shoes and put on very old velvet slippers she walked in these toward the bed listening to find out whether she could hear herself without success then standing where she could see when his eyes opened she began to take stock that pillow wasnt very comfortable a little table was wanted on both sides instead of on one there was no odorator and she did not see one of those arrangements all these things would have to be remedied  absorbed in this reconnoitring she failed to observe that darling derek was looking at her through eyelashes that were always so nice and black he said suddenly in that faint and cheerful voice  all right granny im going to get up tomorrow  frances freeland whose principle it was that people should always be encouraged to believe themselves better than they were answered yes darling of course youll be up in no time itll be delightful to see you in a chair tomorrow but you mustnt talk  derek sighed closed his eyes and went off into a faint  it was in moments such as these that frances freeland was herself her face flushed a little and grew terribly determined conscious that she was absolutely alone in the house she ran to her bag took out her sal volatile applied it vigorously to his nose and poured a little between his lips she did other things to him and not until she had brought him round and the best of it was already made did she even say to herself its no use fussing i must make the best of it  then having discovered that he felt quite comfortableas he saidshe sat down in a chair to fan him and tremble vigorously she would not have allowed that movement of her limbs if it had in any way interfered with the fanning but since on the contrary it seemed to be of assistance she certainly felt it a relief for whatever age her spirit might be her body was seventythree  and while she fanned she thought of derek as a little blackhaired blazinggrayeyed slip of a sallow boy all little thin legs and arms moving funnily like a foals he had been such a dear gentlemanlike little chap it was dreadful he should be forgetting himself so and getting into such trouble and her thoughts passed back beyond him to her own four little sons among whom she had been so careful not to have a favorite but to love them all equally and she thought of how their holland suits wore out especially in the elastic and got green behind almost before they were put on and of how she used to cut their hairs spending at least threequarters of an hour on each because she had never been quick at it while they sat so goodexcept stanley and darling tod who would move just as she had got into the comb particularly nice bits of his hair always so crisp and difficult and of how she had cut off felixs long golden curls when he was four and would have cried over it if crying hadnt always been silly and of how beautifully they had all had their measles together so that she had been up with them day and night for about a fortnight and of how it was a terrible risk with derek and darling nedda not at all a wise match she was afraid and yet if they really were attached of course one must put the best face on it and how lovely it would be to see another little baby some day and what a charming little mother nedda would makeif only the dear child would do her hair just a little differently and she perceived that derek was asleepand one of her own legs from the knee down she would certainly have bad pins and needles if she did not get up but since she would not wake him for the world she must do something else to cure it and she hit upon this plan she had only to say nonsense you havent anything of the sort and it was sure to go away she said this to her leg but being a realist she only made it feel like a pincushion she knew however that she had only to persevere because it would never do to give in she persevered and her leg felt as if redhot needles were being stuck in it then for the life of her she could not help saying a little psalm the sensation went away and left her leg quite dead she would have no strength in it at all when she got up but that would be easily cured when she could get to her bag with three globules of nux vomicaand darling derek must not be waked up for anything she waited thus till nedda came back and then said sssh  he woke at once so that providentially she was able to get up and having stood with her weight on one leg for five minutes so as to be quite sure she did not fall she crossed back to the window took her nux vomica and sat down with her tablets to note down the little affairs she would require while nedda took her place beside the bed to fan him having made her list she went to nedda and whispered that she was going down to see about one or two little things and while she whispered she arranged the dear childs hair if only she would keep it just like that it would be so much more becoming and she went downstairs  accustomed to the resources of stanleys establishment or at least to those of johns and felixs and of the hotels she stayed at she felt for a moment just a little nonplussed at discovering at her disposal nothing but three dear little children playing with a dog and one bicycle for a few seconds she looked at the latter hard if only it had been a tricycle then feeling certain that she could not make it into one she knew that she must make the best of it especially as in any case she could not have used it for it would never do to leave darling nedda alone in the house she decided therefore to look in every room to see if she could find the things she wanted the dog who had been attracted by her left the children and came too and the children attracted by the dog followed so they all five went into a room on the ground floor it was partitioned into two by a screen in one portion was a rough camp bedstead and in the other two dear little childs beds that must once have been dereks and sheilas and one still smaller made out of a large packingcase the eldest of the little children said  thats where billy sleeps susie sleeps here and i sleeps there and our father sleeped in here before he went to prison frances freeland experienced a shock to prison the idea of letting these little things know such a thing as that the best face had so clearly not been put on it that she decided to put it herself  oh not to prison dear only into a house in the town for a little while  it seemed to her quite dreadful that they should know the truthit was simply necessary to put it out of their heads that dear little girl looked so old already such a little mother and as they stood about her she gazed piercingly at their heads they were quite clean  the second dear little thing said  we like bein here we hope father wont be comin back from prison for a long time so as we can go on stayin here mr freeland gives us apples  the failure of her attempt to put a nicer idea into their heads disconcerted frances freeland for a moment only she said  who told you he was in prison  biddy answered slowly nobody didnt tell us we picked it up  oh but you should never pick things up thats not at all nice you dont know what harm they may do you  billy replied we picked up a dead cat yesterday it didnt scratch a bit it didnt  and biddy added please what is prison like  pity seized on frances freeland for these little derelicts whose heads and pinafores and faces were so clean she pursed her lips very tight and said  hold out your hands all of you  three small hands were held out and three small pairs of grayblue eyes looked up at her from the recesses of her pocket she drew forth her purse took from it three shillings and placed one in the very centre of each palm the three small hands closed two small grave bodies dipped in little courtesies the third remained stockstill but a grin spread gradually on its face from ear to ear  what do you say said frances freeland  thank you  thank youwhat  thank you maam  thats right now run away and play a nice game in the orchard  the three turned immediately and went a sound of whispering rose busily outside frances freeland glancing through the window saw them unlatching the wicket gate sudden alarm seized her she put out her head and called biddy came back  you mustnt spend them all at once  biddy shook her head  no once we had a shillin and we were sick were goin to spend three pennies out of one shillin every day till theyre gone  and arent you going to put any by for a rainy day  no  frances freeland did not know what to answer dear little things  the dear little things vanished  in tods and kirsteens room she found a little table and a pillow and something that might do and having devised a contrivance by which this went into that and that into this and nothing whatever showed she conveyed the whole very quietly up near dear dereks room and told darling nedda to go downstairs and look for something that she knew she would not find for she could not think at the moment of any better excuse when the child had gone she popped this here and popped that there and there she was and she felt better it was no use whatever to make a fuss about that aspect of nursing which was not quite nice one just put the best face upon it quietly did what was necessary and pretended that it was not there kirsteen had not seen to things quite as she should have but then dear kirsteen was so clever  her attitude indeed to that blue bird who had alighted now twentyone years ago in the freeland nest had always after the first few shocks been duly stoical for however her fastidiousness might jib at neglect of the forms of things she was the last woman not to appreciate really sterling qualities though it was a pity dear kirsteen did expose her neck and arms so that they had got quite brown a pity that she never went to church and had brought up the dear children not to go and to have ideas that were not quite right about the land still she was emphatically a lady and devoted to dear tod and very good and her features were so regular and she had such a good color and was so slim and straight in the back that she was always a pleasure to look at and if she was not quite so practical as she might have been that was not everything and she would never get stout as there was every danger of clara doing so that from the first she had always put a good face on her dereks voice interrupted her thoughts  im awfully thirsty granny  yes darling dont move your head and just let me pop in some of this delicious lemonade with a spoon  nedda returning found her supporting his head with one hand while with the other she kept popping in the spoon her soul smiling at him lovingly through her lips and eyes   chapter xxxii   felix went back to london the afternoon of frances freelands installation taking sheila with him she had been bound over to keep the peacea task which she would obviously be the better able to accomplish at a distance and though to take charge of her would be rather like holding a burning match till there was no match left he felt bound to volunteer  he left nedda with many misgivings but had not the heart to wrench her away  the recovery of a young man who means to get up tomorrow is not so rapid when his head rather than his body is the seat of trouble dereks temperament was against him he got up several times in spirit to find that his body had remained in bed and this did not accelerate his progress it had been impossible to dispossess frances freeland from command of the sickroom and since she was admittedly from experience and power of paying no attention to her own wants the fittest person for the position there she remained taking turn and turn about with nedda and growing a little whiter a little thinner more resolute in face and more loving in her eyes from day to day that tragedy of the oldthe being laid aside from life before the spirit is ready to resign the feeling that no one wants you that all those you have borne and brought up have long passed out on to roads where you cannot follow that even the thoughtlife of the world streams by so fast that you lie up in a backwater feebly blindly groping for the full of the water and always pushed gently hopelessly back that sense that you are still young and warm and yet so furbelowed with old thoughts and fashions that none can see how young and warm you are none see how you long to rub hearts with the active how you yearn for something real to do that can help life on and how no one will give it you all thisthis tragedywas for the time defeated she was in triumph doing something real for those she loved and longed to do things for she had sheilas room  for a week at least derek asked no questions made no allusion to the mutiny not even to the cause of his own disablement it had been impossible to tell whether the concussion had driven coherent recollection from his mind or whether he was refraining from an instinct of selfpreservation barring such thoughts as too exciting nedda dreaded every day lest he should begin she knew that the questions would fall on her since no answer could possibly be expected from granny except its all right darling everythings going on perfectlyonly you mustnt talk  it began the last day of june the very first day that he got up  they didnt save the hay did they  was he fit to hear the truth would he forgive her if she did not tell it if she lied about this could she go on lying to his other questions when he discovered later would not the effect undo the good of lies now she decided to lie but when she opened her lips simply could not with his eyes on her and said faintly yes they did  his face contracted she slipped down at once and knelt beside his chair he said between his teeth  go on tell me did it all collapse  she could only stroke his hands and bow her head  i see whats happened to them  without looking up she murmured  some have been dismissed the others are working again all right  all right  she looked up then so pitifully that he did not ask her anything more but the news put him back a week and she was in despair the day he got up again he began afresh  when are the assizes  the 7th of august  has anybody been to see bob tryst  yes aunt kirsteen has been twice  having been thus answered he was quiet for a long time she had slipped again out of her chair to kneel beside him it seemed the only place from which she could find courage for her answers he put his hand that had lost its brown on her hair at that she plucked up spirit to ask  would you like me to go and see him  he nodded  then i willtomorrow  dont ever tell me what isnt true nedda people do thats why i didnt ask before  she answered fervently  i wont oh i wont  she dreaded this visit to the prison even to think of those places gave her nightmare sheilas description of her night in a cell had made her shiver with horror but there was a spirit in nedda that went through with things and she started early the next day refusing kirsteens proffered company  the look of that battlemented building whose walls were pierced with emblems of the christian faith turned her heartsick and she stood for several minutes outside the darkgreen door before she could summon courage to ring the bell  a stout man in blue with a fringe of gray hair under his peaked cap and some keys dangling from a belt opened and said  yes miss  being called miss gave her a little spirit and she produced the card she had been warming in her hand  i have come to see a man called robert tryst waiting for trial at the assizes  the stout man looked at the card back and front as is the way of those in doubt closed the door behind her and said  just a minute miss  the shutting of the door behind her sent a little shiver down neddas spine but the temperature of her soul was rising and she looked round beyond the heavy arch beneath which she stood was a courtyard where she could see two men also in blue with peaked caps then to her left she became conscious of a shavenheaded noiseless being in drabgray clothes on hands and knees scrubbing the end of a corridor her tremor at the stealthy ugliness of this crouching figure yielded at once to a spasm of pity the man gave her a look furtive yet so charged with intense penetrating curiosity that it seemed to let her suddenly into innumerable secrets she felt as if the whole life of people shut away in silence and solitude were disclosed to her in the swift unutterably alive look of this noiseless kneeling creature riving out of her something to feed his soul and body on that look seemed to lick its lips it made her angry made her miserable with a feeling of pity she could hardly bear tears too startled to flow darkened her eyes poor man how he must hate her who was free and all fresh from the open world and the sun and people to love and talk to the poor man scrubbed on steadily his ears standing out from his shaven head then dragging his kneemat skewways he took the chance to look at her again perhaps because his dress and cap and stubble of hair and even the color of his face were so drabgray those little dark eyes seemed to her the most terribly living things she had ever seen she felt that they had taken her in from top to toe clothed and unclothed taken in the resentment she had felt and the pity she was feeling they seemed at once to appeal to attack and to possess her ravenously as though all the starved instincts in a whole prisoned world had rushed up and for a second stood outside their bars then came the clank of keys the eyes left her as swiftly as they had seized her and he became again just that stealthy noiseless creature scrubbing a stone floor and shivering nedda thought  i cant bear myself hereme with everything in the world i wantand these with nothing  but the stout janitor was standing by her again together with another man in blue who said  now miss this way please  and down that corridor they went though she did not turn she knew well that those eyes were following still riving something from her and she heaved a sigh of real relief when she was round a corner through barred windows that had no glass she could see another court where men in the same drabgray clothes printed with arrows were walking one behind the other making a sort of moving human hieroglyphic in the centre of the concrete floor two warders with swords stood just outside its edge some of those walking had their heads up their chests expanded some slouched along with heads almost resting on their chests but most had their eyes fixed on the back of the neck of the man in front and there was no sound save the tramp of feet  nedda put her hand to her throat the warder beside her said in a chatty voice  thats where the ards takes their exercise miss you want to see a man called tryst waitin trial i think weve had a woman here to see him and a lady in blue once or twice  my aunt  ah just so laborer i thinkcase of arson funny thing never yet found a farmlaborer that took to prison well  nedda shivered the words sounded ominous then a little flame lit itself within her  does anybody ever take to prison  the warder uttered a sound between a grunt and chuckle  theres some has a better time here than they have out any day no doubt about ittheyre well fed here  her aunts words came suddenly into neddas mind libertys a glorious feast but she did not speak them  yes the warder proceeded some o them we get look as if they didnt have a square meal outside from one years end to the other if youll just wait a minute miss ill fetch the man down to you  in a bare room with distempered walls and bars to a window out of which she could see nothing but a high brick wall nedda waited so rapid is the adjustment of the human mind so quick the blunting of human sensation that she had already not quite the passion of pitiful feeling which had stormed her standing under that archway a kind of numbness gripped her nerves there were wooden forms in this room and a blackboard on which two rows of figures had been set one beneath the other but not yet added up  the silence at first was almost deathly then it was broken by a sound as of a heavy door banged and the shuffling tramp of marching menlouder louder softera word of commandstill softer and it died away dead silence again nedda pressed her hands to her breast twice she added up those figures on the blackboard each time the number was the same ah there was a flytwo flies how nice they looked moving moving chasing each other in the air did flies get into the cells perhaps not even a fly came therenothing more living than walls and wood nothing living except what was inside oneself how dreadful not even a clock ticking not even a birds song silent unliving worse than in this room something pressed against her leg she started violently and looked down a little cat oh what a blessed thing a little sandy ugly cat it must have crept in through the door she was not locked in then anyway thus far had nerves carried her already scrattling the little cats furry pate she pulled herself together she would not tremble and be nervous it was disloyal to derek and to her purpose which was to bring comfort to poor tryst then the door was pushed open and the warder said  a quarter of an hour miss ill be just outside  she saw a big man with unshaven cheeks come in and stretched out her hand  i am mr dereks cousin going to be married to him hes been ill but hes getting well again now we knew youd like to hear and she thought oh what a tragic face i cant bear to look at his eyes  he took her hand said thank you miss and stood as still as ever  please come and sit down and we can talk  tryst moved to a form and took his seat thereon with his hands between his knees as if playing with an imaginary cap he was dressed in an ordinary suit of laborers best clothes and his stiff dustcolored hair was not cut particularly short the cheeks of his squarecut face had fallen in the eyes had sunk back and the prominence thus given to his cheek and jawbones and thick mouth gave his face a savage lookonly his doglike terribly yearning eyes made nedda feel so sorry that she simply could not feel afraid  the children are such dears mr tryst billy seems to grow every day theyre no trouble at all and quite happy biddys wonderful with them  shes a good maid the thick lips shaped the words as though they had almost lost power of speech  do they let you see the newspapers we send have you got everything you want  for a minute he did not seem to be going to answer then moving his head from side to side he said  nothin i want but just get out of here  nedda murmured helplessly  its only a month now to the assizes does mr pogram come to see you  yes he comes he cant do nothin  oh dont despair even if they dont acquit you itll soon be over dont despair and she stole her hand out and timidly touched his arm she felt her heart turning over and over he looked so sad  he said in that stumbling thick voice  thank you kindly i must get out i wont stand long of itnot much longer im not used to italways been accustomed to the air an bein about thats where tis but dont you tell him miss you say im goin along all right dont you tell him what i said tis no use him frettin over me twon do me no good  and nedda murmured  no no i wont tell him  then suddenly came the words she had dreaded  dyou think theyll let me go miss  oh yes i think soi hope so but she could not meet his eyes and hearing him grit his boot on the floor knew he had not believed her  he said slowly  i never meant to do it when i went out that mornin it came on me sudden lookin at the straw  nedda gave a little gasp could that man outside hear  tryst went on if they dont let me go i won stand it tis too much for a man i cant sleep i cant eat nor nothin i won stand it it don take long to die if you put your mind to it  feeling quite sick with pity nedda got up and stood beside him and moved by an uncontrollable impulse she lifted one of his great hands and clasped it in both her own oh try and be brave and look forward youre going to be ever so happy some day  he gave her a strange long stare  yes ill be happy some day don you never fret about me  and nedda saw that the warder was standing in the doorway  sorry miss times up  without a word tryst rose and went out  nedda was alone again with the little sandy cat standing under the highbarred window she wiped her cheeks that were all wet why why must people suffer so suffer so slowly so horribly what were men made of that they could go on day after day year after year watching others suffer  when the warder came back to take her out she did not trust herself to speak or even to look at him she walked with hands tight clenched and eyes fixed on the ground outside the prison door she drew a long long breath and suddenly her eyes caught the inscription on the corner of a lane leading down alongside the prison wallloves walk   chapter xxxiii   peremptorily ordered by the doctor to the sea but with instructions to avoid for the present all excitement sunlight and color derek and his grandmother repaired to a spot well known to be gray and nedda went home to hampstead this was the last week in july a fortnight spent in the perfect vacuity of an english wateringplace restored the boy wonderfully no one could be better trusted than frances freeland to preserve him from looking on the dark side of anything more specially when that thing was already not quite nice their conversation was therefore free from allusion to the laborers the strike or bob tryst and derek thought the more the approaching trial was hardly ever out of his mind bathing he would think of it sitting on the gray jetty looking over the gray sea he would think of it up the gray cobbled streets and away on the headlands he would think of it and so as not to have to think of it he would try to walk himself to a standstill unfortunately the head will continue working when the legs are at rest and when he sat opposite to her at mealtimes frances freeland would gaze piercingly at his forehead and muse the dear boy looks much better but hes getting a little line between his browsit is such a pity it worried her too that the face he was putting on their little holiday together was not quite as full as she could have wishedthough the last thing in the world she could tolerate were really fat cheeks those signs of all that her stoicism abhorred those truly unforgivable marks of the loss of form he struck her as dreadfully silent too and she would rack her brains for subjects that would interest him often saying to herself if only i were clever it was natural he should think of dear nedda but surely it was not that which gave him the little line he must be brooding about those other things he ought not to be melancholy like this and let anything prevent the sea from doing him good the habithardlearned by the old and especially the old of her particular sexof not wishing for the moon or at all events of not letting others know that you are wishing for it had long enabled frances freeland to talk cheerfully on the most indifferent subjects whether or no her heart were aching ones heart often did ache of course but it simply didnt do to let it interfere making things uncomfortable for others and once she said to him you know darling i think it would be so nice for you to take a little interest in politics theyre very absorbing when you once get into them i find my paper most enthralling and it really has very good principles  if politics did anything for those who most need things done grannybut i cant see that they do  she thought a little then making firm her lips said  i dont think thats quite just darling there are a great many politicians who are very much looked up toall the bishops for instance and others whom nobody could suspect of selfseeking  i didnt mean that politicians were selfseeking granny i meant that theyre comfortable people and the things that interest them are those that interest comfortable people what have they done for the laborers for instance  oh but darling theyre going to do a great deal in my paper theyre continually saying that  do you believe it  im sure they wouldnt say so if they werent theres quite a new plan and it sounds most sensible and so i dont think darling that if i were you i should make myself unhappy about all that kind of thing they must know best theyre all so much older than you and youre getting quite a little line between your eyes  derek smiled  all right granny i shall have a big one soon   frances freeland smiled too but shook her head  yes and thats why i really think you ought to take interest in politics  id rather take interest in you granny youre very jolly to look at  frances freeland raised her brows  i my dear im a perfect fright nowadays  thus pushing away what her stoicism and perpetual aspiration to an impossibly good face would not suffer her to admit she added  where would you like to drive this afternoon  for they took drives in a small victoria frances freeland holding her sunshade to protect him from the sun whenever it made the mistake of being out  on august the fourth he insisted that he was well and must go back home and though to bring her attendance on him to an end was a grief she humbly admitted that he must be wanting younger company and after one wistful attempt made no further bones the following day they travelled  on getting home he found that the police had been to see little biddy tryst who was to be called as a witness tod would take her over on the morning of the trial derek did not wait for this but on the day before the assizes repacked his bag and went off to the royal charles hostel at worcester he slept not at all that night and next morning was early at the court for trysts case would be the first anxiously he sat watching all the queer and formal happenings that mark the initiation of the higher justicethe assemblage of the gentlemen in wigs the sifting shifting settling of clerks and ushers solicitors and the public the busy indifference the cheerful professionalism of it all he saw little mr pogram come in more square and rubbery than ever and engage in conclave with one of the bewigged the smiles shrugs even the sharp expressions on that barristers face the way he stood twisting round one hand wrapped in his gown one foot on the bench behind it was all as if he had done it hundreds of times before and cared not the snap of one of his thin yellow fingers then there was a sudden hush the judge came in bowed and took his seat and that too seemed so professional haunted by the thought of him to whom this was almost life and death the boy was incapable of seeing how natural it was that they should not all feel as he did  the case was called and tryst brought in derek had once more to undergo the torture of those tragic eyes fixed on him round that heavy figure that mournful halfbrutal and halfyearning face the pleadings the questions the answers buzzed bringing out facts with damning clearness yet leaving the real story of that early morning as hidden as if the court and all were but gibbering figures of air the real story of tryst heavy and distraught rising and turning out from habit into the early haze on the fields where his daily work had lain of tryst brooding with the slow the wrathful incoherence that centuries of silence in those lonely fields had passed into the blood of his forebears and himself brooding in the dangerous disproportion that enforced continence brings to certain natures loading the brain with violence till the storm bursts and there leap out the lurid dark insanities of crime brooding while in the air flies chased each other insects crawled together in the grass and the first principle of nature worked everywhere its sane fulfilment they might talk and take evidence as they would be shrewd and sharp with all the petty sharpness of the law but the secret springs would still lie undisclosed too natural and true to bear the light of day the probings and eloquence of justice would never paint the picture of that moment of maniacal relief when with jaw hanging loose eyes bulging in exultation of revenge he had struck those matches with his hairy hands and let them flare in the straw till the little red flames ran and licked rustled and licked and there was nothing to do but watch them lick and burn nor of that sudden wildness of dumb fear that rushed into the heart of the crouching creature changing the madness of his face to palsy nor of the recoil from the burning stack those moments empty with terror nor of how terror through habit of inarticulate emotionless existence gave place again to brute stolidity and so heavily back across the dewy fields under the larks songs the cooings of pigeons the hum of wings and all the unconscious rhythm of ageless nature no the probings of justice could never reach the whole truth and even justice quailed at its own probings when the motherchild was passed up from tods side into the witnessbox and the big laborer was seen to look at her and she at him she seemed to have grown taller her pensive little face and beautifully fluffedout cornbrown hair had an eerie beauty perched up there in the arid witnessbox as of some small figure from the brush of botticelli  your name my dear  biddy tryst  how old  ten next month please  do you remember going to live at mr freelands cottage  yes sir  and do you remember the first night  yes sir  where did you sleep biddy  please sir we slept in a big room with a screen billy and susie and me and father behind the screen  and where was the room  downstairs sir  now biddy what time did you wake up the first morning  when father got up  was that early or late  very early  would you know the time  no sir  but it was very early how did you know that  it was a long time before we had any breakfast  and what time did you have breakfast  half past six by the kitchen clock  was it light when you woke up  yes sir  when father got up did he dress or did he go to bed again  he hadnt never undressed sir  then did he stay with you or did he go out  out sir  and how long was it before he came back  when i was puttin on billys boots  what had you done in between  helped susie and dressed billy  and how long does that take you generally  half an hour sir  i see what did father look like when he came in biddy  the motherchild paused for the first time it seemed to dawn on her that there was something dangerous in these questions she twisted her small hands before her and gazed at her father  the judge said gently  well my child  like he does now sir  thank you biddy  that was all the motherchild was suffered to step down and take her place again by tod and in the silence rose the short and rubbery report of little mr pogram blowing his nose no evidence given that morning was so conclusive actual terrible as that unconscious like he does now sir that was why even justice quailed a little at its own probings  from this moment the boy knew that trysts fate was sealed what did all those words matter those professional patterings one way and the other the professional jeers my friend has told you this and my friend will tell you that the professional steering of the impartial judge seated there above them all the cold calculated rhapsodies about the heinousness of arson the cold and calculated attack on the characters of the stonebreaker witness and the tramp witness the cold and calculated patter of the appeal not to condemn a father on the evidence of his little child the cold and calculated outburst on the right of every man to be assumed innocent except on overwhelming evidence such as did not here exist the cold and calculated balancing of pro and con and those minutes of cold calculation veiled from the eyes of the court even the verdict guilty even the judgment three years penal servitude all nothing all superfluity to the boy supporting the tragic gaze of trysts eyes and making up his mind to a desperate resort  three years penal servitude the big laborer paid no more attention to those words than to any others spoken during that hours settlement of his fate true he received them standing as is the custom fronting the image of justice from whose lips they came but by no single gesture did he let any one see the dumb depths of his soul if life had taught him nothing else it had taught him never to express himself mute as any bullock led into the slaughteringhouse with something of a bullocks dulled and helpless fear in his eyes he passed down and away between his jailers and at once the professional noises rose and the professional rhapsodists hunching their gowns swept that little lot of papers into their pink tape and turning to their neighbors smiled and talked and jerked their eyebrows   chapter xxxiv   the nest on the spaniards road had not been able to contain sheila long there are certain natures such as that of felix to whom the claims and exercise of authority are abhorrent who refuse to exercise it themselves and rage when they see it exercised over others but who somehow never come into actual conflict with it there are other natures such as sheilas who do not mind in the least exercising authority themselves but who oppose it vigorously when they feel it coming near themselves or some others of such is the kingdom of militancy her experience with the police had sunk deep into her soul they had not as a fact treated her at all badly which did not prevent her feeling as if they had outraged in her the dignity of woman she arrived therefore in hampstead seeing red even where red was not and since undoubtedly much real red was to be seen there was little other color in the world or in her cheeks those days long disagreements with alan to whom she was still a magnet but whose stanleylike nature stood firm against the blandishments of her revolting tongue drove her more and more toward a decision the seeds of which had perhaps been planted during her former stay among the breezy airs of hampstead  felix coming one day into his wifes studyfor the house knew not the word drawingroomfound flora with eyebrows lifted up and smiling lips listening to sheila proclaiming the doctrine that it was impossible not to live on ones own nothing elsefelix learnedwas compatible with dignity or even with peace of mind she had therefore taken a back room high up in a back street in which she was going to live perfectly well on ten shillings a week and having thirtytwo pounds saved up she would be all right for a year after which she would be able to earn her living the principle she purposed to keep before her eyes was that of committing herself to nothing which would seriously interfere with her work in life somehow it was impossible to look at this girl with her glowing cheeks and her glowing eyes and her hair frizzy from ardor and to distrust her utterances yes she would arrive if not where she wanted at all events somewhere which after all was the great thing and in fact she did arrive the very next day in the back room high up in the back street and neither tods cottage nor the house on the spaniards road saw more than flying gleams of her thenceforth  another byproduct this of that little starting episode the notice given to tryst strange how in life one little incident one little piece of living stress can attract and gather round it the feelings thoughts actions of people whose lives run far and wide away therefrom but episodes are thus potent only when charged with a significance that comes from the clash of the deepest instincts  during the six weeks which had elapsed between his return home from joyfields and the assizes felix had much leisure to reflect that if lady malloring had not caused tryst to be warned that he could not marry his deceased wifes sister and continue to stay on the estatethe lives of felix himself his daughter mother brother brothers wife their son and daughter and in less degree of his other brothers would have been free of a preoccupation little short of ludicrous in proportion to the face value of the cause but he had leisure too to reflect that in reality the issue involved in that tiny episode concerned human existence to its depthsfor what was it but the simple allimportant question of human freedom the simple allimportant issue of how far men and women should try to rule the lives of others instead of trying only to rule their own and how far those others should allow their lives to be so ruled this it was which gave that episode its power of attracting and affecting the thoughts feelings actions of so many people otherwise remote and though felix was paternal enough to say to himself nearly all the time i cant let nedda get further into this mess he was philosopher enough to tell himself in the unfatherly balance of his hours that the mess was caused by the fight best of all worth fightingof democracy against autocracy of a mans right to do as he likes with his life if he harms not others of the land against the fetterers of the land and he was artist enough to see how from that little starting episode the whole business had sprunggiven of course the entrance of the wilful force called love but a father especially when he has been thoroughly alarmed gives the artist and philosopher in him short shrift  nedda came home soon after sheila went and to the eyes of felix she came back too old and thoughtful altogether how different a girl from the nedda who had so wanted to know everything that first night of may what was she brooding over what planning in that dark round pretty head at what resolve were those clear eyes so swiftly raised to look what was going on within when her breast heaved so without seeming cause and the color rushed up in her cheeks at a word as though she had been so far away that the effort of recall was alone enough to set all her veins throbbing and yet felix could devise no means of attack on her infatuation for a man cannot cultivate the habit of never interfering and then suddenly throw it over least of all when the person to be interfered with is his pet and only daughter  flora not of course in the swim of those happenings at joyflelds could not be got to take the matter very seriously in factbeyond what concerned felix himself and poetrythe matter that she did take seriously had yet to be discovered hers was one of those semidetached natures particularly found in hampstead when exhorted to help tackle the question she could only suggest that felix should take them all abroad when he had finished the last of the laborers a tour for instance in norway and sweden where none of them had ever been and perhaps down through finland into russia  feeling like one who squirts on a burning haystack with a garden syringe felix propounded this scheme to his little daughter she received it with a start a silence a sort of quivering all over as of an animal who scents danger she wanted to know when and being toldnot before the middle of august relapsed into her preoccupation as if nothing had been said felix noted on the hall table one afternoon a letter in her handwriting addressed to a worcester newspaper and remarked thereafter that she began to receive this journal daily obviously with a view to reports of the coming assizes once he tried to break through into her confidence it was august bank holiday and they had gone out on to the heath together to see the people wonderfully assembled coming back across the burntup grass strewn with paper bags banana peel and the cores of apples he hooked his hand into her arm  what is to be done with a child that goes about all day thinking and thinking and not telling anybody what she is thinking  she smiled round at him and answered  i know dad she is a pig isnt she  this comparison with an animal of proverbial stubbornness was not encouraging then his hand was squeezed to her side and he heard her murmur  i wonder if all daughters are such beasts  he understood well that she had meant there is only one thing i wantone thing i mean to haveone thing in the world for me now  and he said soberly  we cant expect anything else  oh daddy she answered but nothing more  only four days later she came to his study with a letter and a face so flushed and troubled that he dropped his pen and got up in alarm  read this dad its impossible its not true its terrible oh what am i to do  the letter ran thus in a straight boyish handwriting   royal charles hostel  worcester aug 7th  my nedda  i have just seen bob tried they have given him three years penal it was awful to sit there and watch him he can never stand it it was awful to watch him looking at me its no good im going to give myself up i must do it ive got everything ready theyll have to believe me and squash his sentence you see but for me it would never have been done its a matter of honour i cant let him suffer any more this isnt impulse ive been meaning to do it for some time if they found him guilty so in a way its an immense relief id like to have seen you first but it would only distress you and i might not have been able to go through with it after nedda darling if you still love me when i get out well go to new zealand away from this country where they bully poor creatures like bob be brave ill write tomorrow if they let me  your  derek   the first sensation in felix on reading this effusion was poignant recollection of the little lawyers look after derek had made the scene at trysts committal and of his words nothing in it is there his second thought is this the cutting of the knot that ive been looking for his third which swept all else away my poor little darling what business has that boy to hurt her again like this  he heard her say  tryst told me himself he did it dad he told me when i went to see him in the prison honour doesnt demand what isnt true oh dad help me  felix was slow in getting free from the cross currents of reflection he wrote this last night he said dismally he may have done it already we must go and see john  nedda clasped her hands ah yes  and felix had not the heart to add what he was thinking not that i see what good he can do but though sober reason told him this it was astonishingly comforting to be going to some one who could be relied on to see the facts of the situation without any of that flimflam with which imagination is accustomed to surround them and well send derek a wire for what its worth  they went at once to the postoffice felix composing this message on the way utterly mistaken chivalry you have no right await our arrival felix freeland he handed it to her to read and passed it under the brass railing to the clerk not without the feeling of shame due from one who uses the word chivalry in a postoffice  on the way to the tube station he held her arm tightly but whether to impart courage or receive it he could not have said so strungup in spirit did he feel her with few words exchanged they reached whitehall marking their card urgent they were received within ten minutes  john was standing in a high white room smelling a little of papers and tobacco and garnished solely by five green chairs a table and a bureau with an immense number of pigeonholes whereat he had obviously been seated quick to observe what concerned his little daughter felix noted how her greeting trembled up at her uncle and how a sort of warmth thawed for the moment the regularity of his brothers face when they had taken two of the five green chairs and john was back at his bureau felix handed over the letter john read it and looked at nedda then taking a pipe out of his pocket which he had evidently filled before they came in he lighted it and reread the letter then looking very straight at nedda he said  nothing in it honour bright my dear  no uncle john nothing only that he fancies his talk about injustice put it into trysts head  john nodded the girls face was evidence enough for him  any proof  tryst himself told me in the prison that he did it he said it came on him suddenly when he saw the straw  a pause followed before john said  good you and i and your father will go down and see the police  nedda lifted her hands and said breathlessly  but uncle dad have i the right he sayshonour wont it be betraying him  felix could not answer but with relief he heard john say  its not honorable to cheat the law  no but he trusted me or he wouldnt have written  john answered slowly  i think your dutys plain my dear the question for the police will be whether or not to take notice of this false confession for us to keep the knowledge that its false from them under the circumstances is clearly not right besides being to my mind foolish  for felix to watch this mortal conflict going on in the soul of his daughterthat soul which used to seem perhaps even now seemed part of himself to know that she so desperately wanted help for her decision and to be unable to give it unable even to trust himself to be honestthis was hard for felix there she sat staring before her and only her tightclasped hands the little movements of her lips and throat showed the struggle going on in her  i couldnt without seeing him i must see him first uncle  john got up and went over to the window he too had been affected by her face  you realize he said that you risk everything by that if hes given himself up and theyve believed him hes not the sort to let it fall through you cut off your chance if he wont let you tell better for your father and me to see him first anyway and felix heard a mutter that sounded like confound him  nedda rose can we go at once then uncle  with a solemnity that touched felix john put a hand on each side of her face raised it and kissed her on the forehead  all right he said lets be off  a silent trio sought paddington in a taxicab digesting this desperate climax of an affair that sprang from origins so small  in felix contemplating his daughters face there was profound compassion but also that family dismay that perturbation of selfesteem which public scandal forces on kinsmen even the most philosophic he felt exasperation against derek against kirsteen almost even against tod for having acquiesced passively in the revolutionary bringingup which had brought on such a disaster war against injustice sympathy with suffering chivalry yes but not quite to the point whence they recoiled on his daughter his family himself the situation was impossible he was fast resolving that whether or no they saved derek from this quixotry the boy should not have nedda and already his eyes found difficulty in meeting hers  they secured a compartment to themselves and having settled down in corners began mechanically unfolding evening journals for after all whatever happens one must read the papers without that life would indeed be insupportable felix had bought mr cuthcotts but though he turned and turned the sheets they seemed to have no sense till these words caught his eyes convicts tragic death yesterday afternoon at worcester while being conveyed from the assize court back to prison a man named tryst sentenced to three years penal servitude for arson suddenly attacked the warders in charge of him and escaped he ran down the street hotly pursued and darting out into the traffic threw himself under a motorcar going at some speed the car struck him on the head and the unfortunate man was killed on the spot no reason whatever can be assigned for this desperate act he is known however to have suffered from epilepsy and it is thought an attack may have been coming on him at the time  when felix had read these words he remained absolutely still holding that buffcolored paper before his face trying to decide what he must do now what was the significanceexactly the significance of this now that tryst was dead dereks quixotic action had no meaning but had he already confessed it seemed from this account that the suicide was directly after the trial even before the boys letter to nedda had been written he must surely have heard of it since and given up his mad idea he leaned over touched john on the knee and handed him the paper john read the paragraph handed it back and the two brothers stared fixedly at each other then felix made the faintest movement of his head toward his daughter and john nodded crossing to nedda felix hooked his arm in hers and said  just look at this my child  nedda read started to her feet sank back and cried out  poor poor man oh dad poor man  felix felt ashamed though trysts death meant so much relief to her she felt first this rush of compassion he himself to whom it meant so much less relief had felt only that relief  he said he couldnt stand it he told me that but i never thoughtoh poor man and burying her face against his arm she gave way  petrified and conscious that john at the far end of the carriage was breathing rather hard felix could only stroke her arm till at last she whispered  theres nobody now for derek to save oh if youd seen that poor man in prison dad  and the only words of comfort felix could find were  my child there are thousands and thousands of poor prisoners and captives  in a truce to agitation they spent the rest of that three hours journey while the train rattled and rumbled through the quiet happylooking land   chapter xxxv   it was teatime when they reached worcester and at once went up to the royal charles hostel a pretty young woman in the office there informed them that the young gentleman had paid his bill and gone out about ten oclock but had left his luggage she had not seen him come in his room was up that little staircase at the end of the passage there was another entrance that he might have come in at the boots would take them  past the hall stuffed with furniture and decorated with the stags heads and battleprints common to english countytown hotels they followed the boots up five redcarpeted steps down a dingy green corridor to a door at the very end there was no answer to their knock the dark little room with striped walls and more battleprints looked out on a side street and smelled dusty on a shiny leather sofa an old valise strappedup ready for departure was reposing with felixs telegram unopened deposited thereon writing on his card have come down with nedda f f and laying it on the telegram in case derek should come in by the side entrance felix and nedda rejoined john in the hall  to wait in anxiety is perhaps the hardest thing in life tea tobacco and hot baths perhaps the only anodynes these except the baths they took without knowing what had happened neither john nor felix liked to make inquiry at the police station nor did they care to try and glean knowledge from the hotel people by questions that might lead to gossip they could but kick their heels till it became reasonably certain that derek was not coming back the enforced waiting increased felixs exasperation everything derek did seemed designed to cause nedda pain to watch her sitting there trying resolutely to mask her anxiety became intolerable at last he got up and said to john  i think wed better go round there and john nodding he added wait here my child one of usll come back at once and tell you anything we hear  she gave them a grateful look and the two brothers went out they had not gone twenty yards when they met derek striding along pale wild unhappylooking when felix touched him on the arm he started and stared blankly at his uncle  weve seen about tryst felix said youve not done anything  derek shook his head  good john tell nedda that and stay with her a bit i want to talk to derek well go in the other way he put his hand under the boys arm and turned him down into the side street when they reached the gloomy little bedroom felix pointed to the telegram  from me i suppose the news of his death stopped you  yes derek opened the telegram dropped it and sat down beside his valise on the shiny sofa he looked positively haggard  taking his stand against the chest of drawers felix said quietly  im going to have it out with you derek do you understand what all this means to nedda do you realize how utterly unhappy youre making her i dont suppose youre happy yourself  the boys whole figure writhed  happy when youve killed some one you dont think much of happinessyour own or any ones  startled in his turn felix said sharply  dont talk like that its monomania  derek laughed bob trysts deadthrough me i cant get out of that  gazing at the boys tortured face felix grasped the gruesome fact that this idea amounted to obsession  derek he said youve dwelt on this till you see it out of all proportion if we took to ourselves the remote consequences of all our words we should none of us survive a week youre overdone youll see it differently tomorrow  derek got up to pace the room  i swear i would have saved him i tried to do it when they committed him at transham he looked wildly at felix didnt i you were there you heard  yes yes i heard  they wouldnt let me then i thought they mightnt find him guilty hereso i let it go on and now hes dead you dont know how i feel  his throat was working and felix said with real compassion  my dear boy your sense of honour is too extravagant altogether a grown man like poor tryst knew perfectly what he was doing  no he was like a doghe did what he thought was expected of him i never meant him to burn those ricks  exactly no one can blame you for a few wild words he might have been the boy and you the man by the way you take it come  derek sat down again on the shiny sofa and buried his head in his hands  i cant get away from him hes been with me all day i see him all the time  that the boy was really haunted was only too apparent how to attack this mania if one could make him feel something else and felix said  look here derek before youve any right to nedda youve got to find ballast thats a matter of honour if you like  derek flung up his head as if to escape a blow seeing that he had riveted him felix pressed on with some sternness  a man cant serve two passions you must give up this championing the weak and lighting flames you cant control see what it leads to youve got to grow and become a man until then i dont trust my daughter to you  the boys lips quivered a flush darkened his face ebbed and left him paler than ever  felix felt as if he had hit that face still anything was better than to leave him under this gruesome obsession then to his consternation derek stood up and said  if i go and see his body at the prison perhaps hell leave me alone a little  catching at that as he would have caught at anything felix said  good yes go and see the poor fellow well come too  and he went out to find nedda  by the time they reached the street derek had already started and they could see him going along in front felix racked his brains to decide whether he ought to prepare her for the state the boy was in twice he screwed himself up to take the plunge but her facepuzzled as though wondering at her lovers neglect of herstopped him better say nothing  just as they reached the prison she put her hand on his arm  look dad  and felix read on the corner of the prison lane those words loves walk  derek was waiting at the door after some difficulty they were admitted and taken down the corridor where the prisoner on his knees had stared up at nedda past the courtyard where those others had been pacing out their living hieroglyphic up steps to the hospital here in a whitewashed room on a narrow bed the body of the big laborer lay wrapped in a sheet  we bury him friday poor chap fine big man too and at the warders words a shudder passed through felix the frozen tranquillity of that body  as the carved beauty of great buildings so is the graven beauty of death the unimaginable wonder of the abandoned thing lying so quiet marvelling at its resemblance to what once lived how strange this thing still stamped by all that it had felt wanted loved and hated by all its dumb hard commonplace existence this thing with the calm pathetic look of one who asks of his own fled spirit why have you abandoned me  death what more wonderful than a dead bodythat still perfect work of life for which life has no longer use what more mysterious than this sight of what still is yet is not  below the linen swathing the injured temples those eyes were closed through which such yearning had looked forth from that face where the hair had grown faster than if it had been alive deaths majesty had planed away the aspect of brutality removed the yearning covering all with wistful acquiescence was his departed soul coherent where was it did it hover in this room visible still to the boy did it stand there beside what was left of tryst the laborer that humblest of all creatures who dared to make revoltserf descendant of serfs who since the beginning had hewn wood drawn water and done the will of others or was it winged and calling in space to the souls of the oppressed  this body would go back to the earth that it had tended the wild grass would grow over it the seasons spend wind and rain forever above it but that which had held this togetherthe inarticulate lowly spirit hardly asking itself why things should be faithful as a dog to those who were kind to it obeying the dumb instinct of a violence that in his betters would be called high spirit wherefelix wonderedwhere was it  and what were they thinkingnedda and that haunted boyso motionless nothing showed on their faces nothing but a sort of living concentration as if they were trying desperately to pierce through and see whatever it was that held this thing before them in such awful stillness their first glimpse of death their first perception of that terrible remoteness of the dead no wonder they seemed to be conjured out of the power of thought and feeling  nedda was first to turn away walking back by her side felix was surprised by her composure the reality of death had not been to her half so harrowing as the news of it she said softly  im glad to have seen him like that now i shall think of himat peace not as he was that other time  derek rejoined them and they went in silence back to the hotel but at the door she said  come with me to the cathedral derek i cant go in yet  to felixs dismay the boy nodded and they turned to go should he stop them should he go with them what should a father do and with a heavy sigh he did nothing but retire into the hotel   chapter xxxvi   it was calm with a darkblue sky and a golden moon and the lighted street full of people out for airing the great cathedral cutting the heavens with its massive towers was shut no means of getting in and while they stood there looking up the thought came into neddas mind where would they bury poor tryst who had killed himself would they refuse to bury that unhappy one in a churchyard surely the more unhappy and desperate he was the kinder they ought to be to him  they turned away down into a little lane where an old white timbered cottage presided ghostly at the corner some church magnate had his garden back there and it was quiet along the waving line of a high wall behind which grew sycamores spreading closebunched branches whose shadows in the light of the corner lamps lay thick along the ground this glamourous august night a chafer buzzed by a small black cat played with its tail on some steps in a recess nobody passed  the girls heart was beating fast dereks face was so strange and strained and he had not yet said one word to her all sorts of fears and fancies beset her till she was trembling all over  what is it she said at last you haventyou havent stopped loving me derek  no one could stop loving you  what is it then are you thinking of poor tryst  with a catch in his throat and a sort of choked laugh he answered  yes  but its all over hes at peace  peace then in a queer dead voice he added im sorry nedda its beastly for you but i cant help it  what couldnt he help why did he keep her suffering like thisnot telling her what was this something that seemed so terribly between them she walked on silently at his side conscious of the rustling of the sycamores of the moonlit angle of the church magnates house of the silence in the lane and the gliding of their own shadows along the wall what was this in his face his thoughts that she could not reach and she cried out  tell me oh tell me derek i can go through anything with you  i cant get rid of him thats all i thought hed go when id seen him there but its no good  terror got hold of her then she peered at his facevery white and haggard there seemed no blood in it they were going downhill now along the blank wall of a factory there was the river in front with the moonlight on it and boats drawn up along the bank from a chimney a scroll of black smoke was flung out across the sky and a lighted bridge glowed above the water they turned away from that passing below the dark pile of the cathedral here couples still lingered on benches along the riverbank happy in the warm night under the august moon and on and on they walked in that strange miserable silence past all those benches and couples out on the riverpath by the fields where the scent of haystacks and the freshness from the early stubbles and the grasses webbed with dew overpowered the faint reek of the river mud and still on and on in the moonlight that haunted through the willows at their footsteps the waterrats scuttled down into the water with tiny splashes a dog barked somewhere a long way off a train whistled a frog croaked from the stubbles and second crops of sunbaked clover puffs of warm air kept stealing up into the chillier air beneath the willows such moonlit nights never seem to sleep and there was a kind of triumph in the nights smile as though it knew that it ruled the river and the fields ruled with its gleams the silent trees that had given up all rustling suddenly derek said  hes walking with us look over there  and for a second there did seem to nedda a dim gray shape moving square and dogged parallel with them at the stubble edges gasping out  oh no dont frighten me i cant bear it tonight she hid her face against his shoulder like a child he put his arm round her and she pressed her face deep into his coat this ghost of bob tryst holding him away from her this enemy this uncanny presence she pressed closer closer and put her face up to his it was wonderfully lonely silent whispering with the moongleams slipping through the willow boughs into the shadow where they stood and from his arms warmth stole through her closer and closer she pressed not quite knowing what she did not quite knowing anything but that she wanted him never to let her go wanted his lips on hers so that she might feel his spirit pass away from what was haunting it into hers never to escape but his lips did not come to hers they stayed drawn back trembling hungrylooking just above her lips and she whispered  kiss me  she felt him shudder in her arms saw his eyes darken his lips quiver and quiver as if he wanted them to but they would not what was it oh what was it wasnt he going to kiss hernot to kiss her and while in that unnatural pause they stood their heads bent back among the moongleams and those willow shadows there passed through nedda such strange trouble as she had never known not kiss her not kiss her why didnt he when in her blood and in the night all round in the feel of his arms the sight of his hungry lips was something unknown wonderful terrifying sweet and she wailed out  i want youi dont carei want you she felt him sway reel and clutch her as if he were going to fall and all other feeling vanished in the instinct of the nurse she had already been to him he was ill again yes he was ill and she said  derekdont its all right lets walk on quietly  she got his arm tightly in hers and drew him along toward home by the jerking of that arm the taut look on his face she could feel that he did not know from step to step whether he could stay upright but she herself was steady and calm enough bent on keeping emotion away and somehow getting him back along the riverpath abandoned now to the moon and the bright still spaces of the night and the slowmoving whitened water why had she not felt from the first that he was overwrought and only fit for bed  thus very slowly they made their way up by the factory again into the lane by the church magnates garden under the branches of the sycamores past the same whitefaced old house at the corner to the high street where some few people were still abroad  at the front door of the hotel stood felix looking at his watch disconsolate as an old hen to her great relief he went in quickly when he saw them coming she could not bear the thought of talk and explanation the one thing was to get derek to bed all the time he had gone along with that taut face and now when he sat down on the shiny sofa in the little bedroom he shivered so violently that his teeth chattered she rang for a hot bottle and brandy and hot water when he had drunk he certainly shivered less professed himself all right and would not let her stay she dared not ask but it did seem as if the physical collapse had driven away for the time at all events that ghostly visitor and touching his forehead with her lipsvery motherlyso that he looked up and smiled at hershe said in a matteroffact voice  ill come back after a bit and tuck you up and went out  felix was waiting in the hall at a little table on which stood a bowl of bread and milk he took the cover off it for her without a word and while she supped he kept glancing at her trying to make up his mind to words but her face was sealed and all he said was  your uncles gone to becket for the night ive got you a room next mine and a toothbrush and some sort of comb i hope youll be able to manage my child  nedda left him at the door of his room and went into her own after waiting there ten minutes she stole out again it was all quiet and she went resolutely back down the stairs she did not care who saw her or what they thought probably they took her for dereks sister but even if they didnt she would not have cared it was past eleven the light nearly out and the hall in the condition of such places that await a mornings renovation his corridor too was quite dark she opened the door without sound and listened till his voice said softly  all right little angel im not asleep  and by a glimmer of moonlight through curtains designed to keep out nothing she stole up to the bed she could just see his face and eyes looking up at her with a sort of adoration she put her hand on his forehead and whispered are you comfy  he murmured back yes quite comfy  kneeling down she laid her face beside his on the pillow she could not help doing that it made everything seem holy cuddley warm his lips touched her nose her eyes for just that instant looked up into his that were very dark and soft then she got up  would you like me to stay till youre asleep  yes forever but i shouldnt exactly sleep would you  in the darkness nedda vehemently shook her head sleep no she would not sleep  good night then  good night little dark angel  good night with that last whisper she slipped back to the door and noiselessly away   chapter xxxvii   it was long before she closed her eyes spending the hours in fancy where still less she would have slept but when she did drop off she dreamed that he and she were alone upon a star where all the trees were white the water grass birds everything white and they were walking arm in arm among white flowers and just as she had stooped to pick oneit was no flower buttrysts whitebanded face she woke with a little cry  she was dressed by eight and went at once to dereks room there was no answer to her knock and in a flutter of fear she opened the door he had gonepacked and gone she ran back to the hall there was a note for her in the office and she took it out of sight to read it said   he came back this morning im going home by the first train he seems to want me to do something  derek   came back that thingthat gray thing that she too had seemed to see for a moment in the fields beside the river and he was suffering again as he had suffered yesterday it was awful she waited miserably till her father came down to find that he too knew of this trouble was some relief he made no objection when she begged that they should follow on to joyfields directly after breakfast they set out once on her way to derek again she did not feel so frightened but in the train she sat very still gazing at her lap and only once glanced up from under those long lashes  can you understand it dad  felix not much happier than she answered  the man had something queer about him besides dereks been ill dont forget that but its too bad for you nedda i dont like it i dont like it  i cant be parted from him dad thats impossible  felix was silenced by the vigor of those words  his mother can help perhaps he said  ah if his mother would helpsend him away from the laborers and all this  up from the station they took the field paths which cut off quite a mile the grass and woods were shining brightly peacefully in the sun it seemed incredible that there should be heartburnings about a land so smiling that wrongs and miseries should haunt those who lived and worked in these bright fields surely in this earthly paradise the dwellers were enviable wellnourished souls sleek and happy as the pied cattle that lifted their inquisitive muzzles nedda tried to stroke the nose of onegrayish blunt moist but the creature backed away from her hand snuffling and its cynical soft eyes with chestnut lashes seemed warning the girl that she belonged to the breed that might be trusted to annoy  in the last fields before the joyfields crossroads they came up with a little square towheaded man without coat or cap who had just driven some cattle in and was returning with his dog at a dothere dotthere walk as though still driving them he gave them a look rather like that of the bullock nedda had tried to stroke she knew he must be one of the malloring men and longed to ask him questions but he too looked shy and distrustful as if he suspected that they wanted something out of him she summoned up courage however to say did you see about poor bob tryst  i eard tell e didn like prison they say prison takes the eart out of you e didn think o that and the smile that twisted the little mans lips seemed to nedda strange and cruel as if he actually found pleasure in the fate of his fellow all she could find to answer was  is that a good dog  the little man looked down at the dog trotting alongside with drooped tail and shook his head  es no good wi beastswont touch em then looking up sidelong he added surprisingly  mast freeland e got a crack on the head though again there was that satisfied resentment in his voice and the little smile twisting his lips nedda felt more lost than ever  they parted at the crossroads and saw him looking back at them as they went up the steps to the wicket gate amongst a patch of early sunflowers tod in shirt and trousers was surrounded by his dog and the three small trysts all apparently engaged in studying the biggest of the sunflowers where a peacockbutterfly and a bee were feeding one on a gold petal the other on the black heart nedda went quickly up to them and asked  has derek come uncle tod  tod raised his eyes he did not seem in the least surprised to see her as if his sky were in the habit of dropping his relatives at ten in the morning  gone out again he said  nedda made a sign toward the children  have you heard uncle tod  tod nodded and his blue eyes staring above the childrens heads darkened  is granny still here  again tod nodded  leaving felix in the garden nedda stole upstairs and tapped on frances freelands door  she whose stoicism permitted her the one luxury of never coming down to breakfast had just made it for herself over a little spiritlamp she greeted nedda with lifted eyebrows  oh my darling where have you come from you must have my nice cocoa isnt this the most perfect lamp you ever saw did you ever see such a flame watch  she touched the spiritlamp and what there was of flame died out  now isnt that provoking its really a splendid thing quite a new kind i mean to get you one now drink your cocoa its beautifully hot  ive had breakfast granny  frances freeland gazed at her doubtfully then as a last resource began to sip the cocoa of which in truth she was badly in want  granny will you help me  of course darling what is it  i do so want derek to forget all about this terrible business  frances freeland who had unscrewed the top of a little canister answered  yes dear i quite agree im sure its best for him open your mouth and let me pop in one of these delicious little plasmon biscuits theyre perfect after travelling only she added wistfully im afraid he wont pay any attention to me  no but you could speak to aunt kirsteen its for her to stop him  one of her most pathetic smiles came over frances freelands face  yes i could speak to her but you see i dont count for anything one doesnt when one gets old  oh granny you do you count for a lot every one admires you so you always seem to have something thatthat other people havent got and youre not a bit old in spirit  frances freeland was fingering her rings she slipped one off  well she said its no good thinking about that is it ive wanted to give you this for ages darling it is so uncomfortable on my finger now just let me see if i can pop it on  nedda recoiled  oh granny she said you are and vanished  there was still no one in the kitchen and she sat down to wait for her aunt to finish her upstairs duties  kirsteen came down at last in her inevitable blue dress betraying her surprise at this sudden appearance of her niece only by a little quivering of her brows and trembling with nervousness nedda took her plunge pouring out the whole storyof dereks letter their journey down her fathers talk with him the visit to trysts body their walk by the river and of how haunted and miserable he was showing the little note he had left that morning she clasped her hands and said  oh aunt kirsteen make him happy again stop that awful haunting and keep him from all this  kirsteen had listened with one foot on the hearth in her favorite attitude when the girl had finished she said quietly  im not a witch nedda  but if it wasnt for you he would never have started and now that poor trysts dead he would leave it alone im sure only you can make him lose that haunted feeling  kirsteen shook her head  listen nedda she said slowly as though weighing each word i should like you to understand theres a superstition in this country that people are free ever since i was a girl your age ive known that they are not no one is free here who cant pay for freedom its one thing to see another to feel this with your whole being when like me you have an open wound which something is always inflaming you cant wonder can you that fever escapes into the air derek may have caught the infection of my feverthats all but i shall never lose that fever neddanever  but aunt kirsteen this haunting is dreadful i cant bear to see it  my dear derek is very highly strung and hes been ill its in my family to see things thatll go away  nedda said passionately  i dont believe hell ever lose it while he goes on here tearing his heart out and theyre trying to get me away from him i know they are  kirsteen turned her eyes seemed to blaze  they ah yes youll have to fight if you want to marry a rebel nedda  nedda put her hands to her forehead bewildered you see nedda rebellion never ceases its not only against this or that injustice its against all force and wealth that takes advantage of its force and wealth that rebellion goes on forever think well before you join in  nedda turned away of what use to tell her to think when i wonti cant be parted from him kept every other thought paralyzed and she pressed her forehead against the crossbar of the window trying to find better words to make her appeal again out there above the orchard the sky was blue and everything light and gay as the very butterflies that wavered past a motorcar seemed to have stopped in the road close by its whirring and whizzing was clearly audible mingled with the cooings of pigeons and a robins song and suddenly she heard her aunt say  you have your chance nedda here they are  nedda turned there in the doorway were her uncles john and stanley coming in followed by her father and uncle tod  what did this mean what had they come for and disturbed to the heart she gazed from one to the other they had that curious look of people not quite knowing what their reception will be like yet with something resolute almost portentous in their mien she saw john go up to her aunt and hold out his hand  i dare say felix and nedda have told you about yesterday he said stanley and i thought it best to come over kirsteen answered  tod will you tell mother whos here  then none of them seemed to know quite what to say or where to look till frances freeland her face all pleased and anxious came in when she had kissed them they all sat down and nedda at the window squeezed her hands tight together in her lap  weve come about derek john said  yes broke in stanley for goodness sake kirsteen dont lets have any more of this just think what would have happened yesterday if that poor fellow hadnt providentially gone off the hooks  providentially  well it was you see to what lengths derek was prepared to go hang it all we shouldnt have been exactly proud of a felon in the family  frances freeland who had been lacing and unlacing her fingers suddenly fixed her eyes on kirsteen  i dont understand very well darling but i am sure that whatever dear john says will be wise and right you must remember that he is the eldest and has a great deal of experience  kirsteen bent her head if there was irony in the gesture it was not perceived by frances freeland  it cant be right for dear derek or any gentleman to go against the law of the land or be mixed up with wrongdoing in any way i havent said anything but i have felt it very much becauseits all been not quite nice has it  nedda saw her father wince then stanley broke in again  now that the whole things done with do for heavens sake lets have a little peace  at that moment her aunts face seemed wonderful to nedda so quiet yet so burningly alive  peace there is no peace in this world there is death but no peace and moving nearer to tod she rested her hand on his shoulder looking as it seemed to nedda at something far away till john said  thats hardly the point is it we should be awfully glad to know that therell be no more trouble all this has been very worrying and now the cause seems to beremoved  there was always a touch of finality in johns voice nedda saw that all had turned to kirsteen for her answer  if those up and down the land who profess belief in liberty will cease to filch from the helpless the very crust of it the cause will be removed  which is to saynever  at those words from felix frances freeland gazing first at him and then at kirsteen said in a pained voice  i dont think you ought to talk like that kirsteen dear nobody whos at all nice means to be unkind were all forgetful sometimes i know i often forget to be sympathetic it vexes me dreadfully  mother dont defend tyranny  im sure its often from the best motives dear  so is rebellion  well i dont understand about that darling but i do think with dear john its a great pity it will be a dreadful drawback to derek if he has to look back on something that he regrets when hes older its always best to smile and try to look on the bright side of things and not be grumblygrumbly  after that little speech of frances freelands there was a silence that nedda thought would last forever till her aunt pressing close to tods shoulder spoke  you want me to stop derek i tell you all what ive just told nedda i dont attempt to control derek i never have for myself when i see a thing i hate i cant help fighting against it i shall never be able to help that i understand how you must dislike all this i know it must be painful to you mother but while there is tyranny in this land to laborers women animals anything weak and helpless so long will there be rebellion against it and things will happen that will disturb you  again nedda saw her father wince but frances freeland bending forward fixed her eyes piercingly on kirsteens neck as if she were noticing something there more important than that about tyranny  then john said very gravely  you seem to think that we approve of such things being done to the helpless  i know that you disapprove  with the masterly inactivity felix said suddenly in a voice more bitter than nedda had ever heard from him of authority money culture and philosophy with the disapproval that lifts no fingerwinking at tyrannies lest worse befall us yes webrethrenweand so we shall go on doing quite right kirsteen  no the world is changing felix changing  but nedda had started up there at the door was derek   chapter xxxviii   derek who had slept the sleep of the dead having had none for two nights woke thinking of nedda hovering above him in the dark of her face laid down beside him on the pillow and then suddenly up started that thing and stood there haunting him why did it come what did it want of him after writing the little note to nedda he hurried to the station and found a train about to start to see and talk with the laborers to do something anything to prove that this tragic companion had no real existence he went first to the gaunts cottage the door there was opened by the roguegirl comely and robust as ever in a linen frock with her sleeves rolled up and smiling broadly at his astonishment  dont be afraid mr derek im only here for the weekend just to tiddy up a bit tis all right in london i wouldnt come back here i wouldntnot if you was to give me and she pouted her red lips  wheres your father wilmet  over in willeys copse cuttin stakes i hear youve been ill mr derek you do look pale were you very bad and her eyes opened as though the very thought of illness was difficult for her to grasp i saw your young lady up in london shes very pretty wish you happiness mr derek grandfather heres mr derek  the face of old gaunt carved cynical yellow appeared above her shoulder there he stood silent giving derek no greeting and with a sudden miserable feeling the boy said  ill go and find him goodby wilmet  goodby mr derek tis quiet enough here now theres changes  her rogue face twinkled again and turning her chin she rubbed it on her plump shoulder as might a heifer while from behind her grandfather gaunts face looked out with a faint sardonic grin  derek hurrying on to willeys copse caught sight along a far hedge of the big dark laborer tulley who had been his chief lieutenant in the fighting but whether the man heard his hail or no he continued along the hedgeside without response and vanished over a stile the field dipped sharply to a stream and at the crossing derek came suddenly on the little dothere dotthere cowherd who at dereks greeting gave him an abrupt good day and went on with his occupation of mending a hurdle again that miserable feeling beset the boy and he hastened on a sound of chopping guided him near the edge of the coppice tom gaunt was lopping at some bushes at sight of derek he stopped and stood waiting his loquacious face expressionless his little hard eye cocked  good morning tom its ages since i saw you  ah tis a proper long time you ad a knock  derek winced it was said as if he had been disabled in an affair in which gaunt had neither part nor parcel then with a great effort the boy brought out his question  youve heard about poor bob  yaas tis the end of him  some meaning behind those words the unsmiling twist of that hardbitten face the absence of the sir that even tom gaunt generally gave him all seemed part of an attack and feeling as if his heart were being squeezed derek looked straight into his face  whats the matter tom  matter i don know as theres anything the matter ezactly  what have i done tell me  tom gaunt smiled his little gray eyes met dereks full  tisnt for a gentleman to be held responsible  come derek cried passionately what is it dyou think i deserted you or what speak out man  abating nothing of his stare and drawl gaunt answered  deserted oh dear no us cant afford to do no more dyin for youthats all  for me dying my god dyou think i wouldnt have oh confound you  aye confounded us you ave hope youre satisfied  pale as death and quivering all over derek answered  so you think ive just been frying fish of my own  tom gaunt emitted a little laugh  i think youve fried no fish at all thats what i think and no one else does neither if you want to knowexcept poor bob youve fried his fish sure enough  stung to the heart the boy stood motionless a pigeon was cooing the sappy scent from the lopped bushes filled all the sunwarmed air  i see he said thanks tom im glad to know  without moving a muscle tom gaunt answered  dont mention it and resumed his lopping  derek turned and walked out of the little wood but when he had put a field between him and the sound of gaunts billhook he lay down and buried his face in the grass chewing at its green blades scarce dry of dew and with its juicy sweetness tasting the full of bitterness and the gray shade stalked out again and stood there in the warmth of the august day with its scent and murmur of full summer while the pigeons cooed and dandelion fluff drifted by  when two hours later he entered the kitchen at home of the company assembled frances freeland alone retained equanimity enough to put up her face to be kissed  im so thankful youve come back in time to see your uncles darling your uncle john thinks and we all agree that to encourage those poor laborers to do things which are not nice isisyou know what i mean darling  derek gave a bitter little laugh  criminal granny yes and puppyish ive learned all that  the sound of his voice was utterly unlike his own and kirsteen starting forward put her arm round him  its all right mother theyve chucked me  at that moment when all save his mother wanted so to express their satisfaction frances freeland alone succeeded  im so glad darling  then john rose and holding out his hand to his nephew said  thats the end of the trouble then derek  yes and i beg your pardon uncle john and alluncle stanley uncle felix you dad granny  they had all risen now the boys face gave themeven john even stanleya choke in the throat frances freeland suddenly took their arms and went to the door her other two sons followed and quietly they all went out  derek who had stayed perfectly still staring past nedda into a corner of the room said  ask him what he wants mother  nedda smothered down a cry but kirsteen tightening her clasp of him and looking steadily into that corner answered  nothing my boy hes quite friendly he only wants to be with you for a little  but i cant do anything for him  he knows that  i wish he wouldnt mother i cant be more sorry than i have been  kirsteens face quivered  my dear it will go quite soon love nedda see she wants you  derek answered in the same quiet voice  yes nedda is the comfort mother i want to go awayaway out of englandright away  nedda rushed and flung her arms round him  i too derek i too   that evening felix came out to the old fly waiting to take him from joyfields to becket what a sky all over its pale blue a farup wind had drifted long rosy clouds and through one of them the halfmoon peered of a cheesegreen hue and framed and barred by the elmtrees like some roseate stainedglass window the sunset blazed in a corner of the orchard a little bonfire had been lighted and round it he could see the three small trysts dropping armfuls of leaves and pointing at the flames leaping out of the smoulder there too was tods big figure motionless and his dog sitting on its haunches with head poked forward staring at those red tongues of flame kirsteen had come with him to the wicket gate he held her hand long in his own and pressed it hard and while that blue figure turned to the sunset was still visible he screwed himself back to look  they had been in painful conclave as it seemed to felix all day coming to the decision that those two young things should have their wish marry and go out to new zealand the ranch of cousin alick morton son of that brother of frances freeland who absorbed in horses had wandered to australia and died in falling from them had extended a welcome to derek those two would have a voyage of happinesssee together the red sunsets in the mediterranean pompeii and the dark ants of men swarming in endless band up and down with their
