76135330	the game   chapter i   many patterns of carpet lay rolled out before them on the floortwo of brussels showed the beginning of their quest and its ending in that direction while a score of ingrains lured their eyes and prolonged the debate between desire pocketbook  the head of the department did them the honor of waiting upon them himselfor did joe the honor as she well knew for she had noted the openmouthed awe of the elevator boy who brought them up  nor had she been blind to the marked respect shown joe by the urchins and groups of young fellows on corners when she walked with him in their own neighborhood down at the west end of the town  but the head of the department was called away to the telephone and in her mind the splendid promise of the carpets and the irk of the pocket book were thrust aside by a greater doubt and anxiety  but i dont see what you find to like in it joe she said softly the note of insistence in her words betraying recent and unsatisfactory discussion  for a fleeting moment a shadow darkened his boyish face to be replaced by the glow of tenderness  he was only a boy as she was only a girltwo young things on the threshold of life houserenting and buying carpets together  whats the good of worrying he questioned  its the last go the very last  he smiled at her but she saw on his lips the unconscious and all but breathed sigh of renunciation and with the instinctive monopoly of woman for her mate she feared this thing she did not understand and which gripped his life so strongly  you know the go with oneil cleared the last payment on mothers house he went on  and thats off my mind  now this last with ponta will give me a hundred dollars in bankan even hundred thats the pursefor you and me to start on a nestegg  she disregarded the money appeal  but you like it thisthis game you call it  why  he lacked speechexpression  he expressed himself with his hands at his work and with his body and the play of his muscles in the squared ring but to tell with his own lips the charm of the squared ring was beyond him  yet he essayed and haltingly at first to express what he felt and analyzed when playing the game at the supreme summit of existence  all i know genevieve is that you feel good in the ring when youve got the man where you want him when hes had a punch up both sleeves waiting for you and youve never given him an opening to land em when youve landed your own little punch an hes goin groggy an holdin on an the referees dragging him off sos you can go in an finish m an all the house is shouting an tearin itself loose an you know youre the best man an that you played m fair an won out because youre the best man  i tell you  he ceased brokenly alarmed by his own volubility and by genevieves look of alarm  as he talked she had watched his face while fear dawned in her own  as he described the moment of moments to her on his inward vision were lined the tottering man the lights the shouting house and he swept out and away from her on this tide of life that was beyond her comprehension menacing irresistible making her love pitiful and weak the joe she knew receded faded became lost  the fresh boyish face was gone the tenderness of the eyes the sweetness of the mouth with its curves and pictured corners  it was a mans face she saw a face of steel tense and immobile a mouth of steel the lips like the jaws of a trap eyes of steel dilated intent and the light in them and the glitter were the light and glitter of steel  the face of a man and she had known only his boy face  this face she did not know at all  and yet while it frightened her she was vaguely stirred with pride in him  his masculinity the masculinity of the fighting male made its inevitable appeal to her a female moulded by all her heredity to seek out the strong man for mate and to lean against the wall of his strength  she did not understand this force of his being that rose mightier than her love and laid its compulsion upon him and yet in her womans heart she was aware of the sweet pang which told her that for her sake for loves own sake he had surrendered to her abandoned all that portion of his life and with this one last fight would never fight again  mrs silverstein doesnt like prizefighting she said  shes down on it and she knows something too  he smiled indulgently concealing a hurt not altogether new at her persistent inappreciation of this side of his nature and life in which he took the greatest pride  it was to him power and achievement earned by his own effort and hard work and in the moment when he had offered himself and all that he was to genevieve it was this and this alone that he was proudly conscious of laying at her feet  it was the merit of work performed a guerdon of manhood finer and greater than any other man could offer and it had been to him his justification and right to possess her  and she had not understood it then as she did not understand it now and he might well have wondered what else she found in him to make him worthy  mrs silverstein is a dub and a softy and a knocker he said good humoredly  whats she know about such things anyway  i tell you it is good and healthy toothis last as an afterthought  look at me  i tell you i have to live clean to be in condition like this  i live cleaner than she does or her old man or anybody you knowbaths rubdowns exercise regular hours good food and no makin a pig of myself no drinking no smoking nothing thatll hurt me  why i live cleaner than you genevieve  honest i do he hastened to add at sight of her shocked face  i dont mean water an soap but look there  his hand closed reverently but firmly on her arm  soft youre all soft all over  not like mine here feel this  he pressed the ends of her fingers into his hard armmuscles until she winced from the hurt  hard all over just like that he went on  now thats what i call clean  every bit of flesh an blood an muscle is clean right down to the bonesand theyre clean too  no soap and water only on the skin but clean all the way in  i tell you it feels clean  it knows its clean itself  when i wake up in the morning an go to work every drop of blood and bit of meat is shouting right out that it is clean  oh i tell you  he paused with swift awkwardness again confounded by his unwonted flow of speech  never in his life had he been stirred to such utterance and never in his life had there been cause to be so stirred  for it was the game that had been questioned its verity and worth the game itself the biggest thing in the worldor what had been the biggest thing in the world until that chance afternoon and that chance purchase in silversteins candy store when genevieve loomed suddenly colossal in his life overshadowing all other things  he was beginning to see though vaguely the sharp conflict between woman and career between a mans work in the world and womans need of the man  but he was not capable of generalization  he saw only the antagonism between the concrete flesh andblood genevieve and the great abstract living game  each resented the other each claimed him he was torn with the strife and yet drifted helpless on the currents of their contention  his words had drawn genevieves gaze to his face and she had pleasured in the clear skin the clear eyes the cheek soft and smooth as a girls she saw the force of his argument and disliked it accordingly  she revolted instinctively against this game which drew him away from her robbed her of part of him  it was a rival she did not understand  nor could she understand its seductions  had it been a woman rival another girl knowledge and light and sight would have been hers  as it was she grappled in the dark with an intangible adversary about which she knew nothing  what truth she felt in his speech made the game but the more formidable  a sudden conception of her weakness came to her  she felt pity for herself and sorrow  she wanted him all of him her womans need would not be satisfied with less and he eluded her slipped away here and there from the embrace with which she tried to clasp him  tears swam into her eyes and her lips trembled turning defeat into victory routing the allpotent game with the strength of her weakness  dont genevieve dont the boy pleaded all contrition though he was confused and dazed  to his masculine mind there was nothing relevant about her breakdown yet all else was forgotten at sight of her tears  she smiled forgiveness through her wet eyes and though he knew of nothing for which to be forgiven he melted utterly  his hand went out impulsively to hers but she avoided the clasp by a sort of bodily stiffening and chill the while the eyes smiled still more gloriously  here comes mr clausen she said at the same time by some transforming alchemy of woman presenting to the newcomer eyes that showed no hint of moistness  think i was never coming back joe queried the head of the department a pinkandwhitefaced man whose austere sidewhiskers were belied by genial little eyes  now let me seehum yes we was discussing ingrains he continued briskly  that tasty little pattern there catches your eye dont it now eh  yes yes i know all about it  i set up housekeeping when i was getting fourteen a week  but nothings too good for the little nest eh  of course i know and its only seven cents more and the dearest is the cheapest i say  tell you what ill do joethis with a burst of philanthropic impulsiveness and a confidential lowering of voiceseeins its you and i wouldnt do it for anybody else ill reduce it to five cents  onlyhere his voice became impressively solemnonly you mustnt ever tell how much you really did pay  sewed lined and laidof course thats included he said after joe and genevieve had conferred together and announced their decision  and the little nest eh he queried  when do you spread your wings and fly away  tomorrow  so soon  beautiful  beautiful  he rolled his eyes ecstatically for a moment then beamed upon them with a fatherly air  joe had replied sturdily enough and genevieve had blushed prettily but both felt that it was not exactly proper  not alone because of the privacy and holiness of the subject but because of what might have been prudery in the middle class but which in them was the modesty and reticence found in individuals of the working class when they strive after clean living and morality  mr clausen accompanied them to the elevator all smiles patronage and beneficence while the clerks turned their heads to follow joes retreating figure  and tonight joe mr clausen asked anxiously as they waited at the shaft  how do you feel  think youll do him  sure joe answered  never felt better in my life  you feel all right eh  good  good  you see i was just awonderinyou know ha hagoin to get married and the restthought you might be unstrung eh a triflenerves just a bit off you know know how gettin married is myself  but youre all right eh  of course you are  no use asking you that  ha ha  well good luck my boy  i know youll win  never had the least doubt of course of course  and goodby miss pritchard he said to genevieve gallantly handing her into the elevator  hope you call often  will be charmedcharmedi assure you  everybody calls you joe she said reproachfully as the car dropped downward  why dont they call you mr fleming  thats no more than proper  but he was staring moodily at the elevator boy and did not seem to hear  whats the matter joe she asked with a tenderness the power of which to thrill him she knew full well  oh nothing he said  i was only thinkingand wishing  wishingwhat  her voice was seduction itself and her eyes would have melted stronger than he though they failed in calling his up to them  then deliberately his eyes lifted to hers  i was wishing you could see me fight just once  she made a gesture of disgust and his face fell  it came to her sharply that the rival had thrust between and was bearing him away  iid like to she said hastily with an effort striving after that sympathy which weakens the strongest men and draws their heads to womens breasts  will you  again his eyes lifted and looked into hers  he meant itshe knew that it seemed a challenge to the greatness of her love  it would be the proudest moment of my life he said simply  it may have been the apprehensiveness of love the wish to meet his need for her sympathy and the desire to see the game face to face for wisdoms sakeand it may have been the clarion call of adventure ringing through the narrow confines of uneventful existence for a great daring thrilled through her and she said just as simply i will  i didnt think you would or i wouldnt have asked he confessed as they walked out to the sidewalk  but cant it be done she asked anxiously before her resolution could cool  oh i can fix that but i didnt think you would  i didnt think you would he repeated still amazed as he helped her upon the electric car and felt in his pocket for the fare     chapter ii   genevieve and joe were workingclass aristocrats  in an environment made up largely of sordidness and wretchedness they had kept themselves unsullied and wholesome  theirs was a selfrespect a regard for the niceties and clean things of life which had held them aloof from their kind  friends did not come to them easily nor had either ever possessed a really intimate friend a heartcompanion with whom to chum and have things in common  the social instinct was strong in them yet they had remained lonely because they could not satisfy that instinct and at that same time satisfy their desire for cleanness and decency  if ever a girl of the working class had led the sheltered life it was genevieve  in the midst of roughness and brutality she had shunned all that was rough and brutal  she saw but what she chose to see and she chose always to see the best avoiding coarseness and uncouthness without effort as a matter of instinct  to begin with she had been peculiarly unexposed  an only child with an invalid mother upon whom she attended she had not joined in the street games and frolics of the children of the neighbourhood  her father a mildtempered narrowchested anaemic little clerk domestic because of his inherent disability to mix with men had done his full share toward giving the home an atmosphere of sweetness and tenderness  an orphan at twelve genevieve had gone straight from her fathers funeral to live with the silversteins in their rooms above the candy store and here sheltered by kindly aliens she earned her keep and clothes by waiting on the shop  being gentile she was especially necessary to the silversteins who would not run the business themselves when the day of their sabbath came round  and here in the uneventful little shop six maturing years had slipped by  her acquaintances were few  she had elected to have no girl chum for the reason that no satisfactory girl had appeared  nor did she choose to walk with the young fellows of the neighbourhood as was the custom of girls from their fifteenth year  that stuckup dollface was the way the girls of the neighbourhood described her and though she earned their enmity by her beauty and aloofness she none the less commanded their respect  peaches and cream she was called by the young menthough softly and amongst themselves for they were afraid of arousing the ire of the other girls while they stood in awe of genevieve in a dimly religious way as a something mysteriously beautiful and unapproachable  for she was indeed beautiful  springing from a long line of american descent she was one of those wonderful workingclass blooms which occasionally appear defying all precedent of forebears and environment apparently without cause or explanation  she was a beauty in color the blood spraying her white skin so deliciously as to earn for her the apt description peaches and cream  she was a beauty in the regularity of her features and if for no other reason she was a beauty in the mere delicacy of the lines on which she was moulded  quiet lowvoiced stately and dignified she somehow had the knack of dress and but befitted her beauty and dignity with anything she put on  withal she was sheerly feminine tender and soft and clinging with the smouldering passion of the mate and the motherliness of the woman  but this side of her nature had lain dormant through the years waiting for the mate to appear  then joe came into silversteins shop one hot saturday afternoon to cool himself with icecream soda  she had not noticed his entrance being busy with one other customer an urchin of six or seven who gravely analyzed his desires before the showcase wherein truly generous and marvellous candy creations reposed under a cardboard announcement five for five cents  she had heard icecream soda please and had herself asked what flavor without seeing his face  for that matter it was not a custom of hers to notice young men  there was something about them she did not understand  the way they looked at her made her uncomfortable she knew not why while there was an uncouthness and roughness about them that did not please her  as yet her imagination had been untouched by man  the young fellows she had seen had held no lure for her had been without meaning to her  in short had she been asked to give one reason for the existence of men on the earth she would have been nonplussed for a reply  as she emptied the measure of icecream into the glass her casual glance rested on joes face and she experienced on the instant a pleasant feeling of satisfaction  the next instant his eyes were upon her face her eyes had dropped and she was turning away toward the soda fountain but at the fountain filling the glass she was impelled to look at him againbut for no more than an instant for this time she found his eyes already upon her waiting to meet hers while on his face was a frankness of interest that caused her quickly to look away  that such pleasingness would reside for her in any man astonished her what a pretty boy she thought to herself innocently and instinctively trying to ward off the power to hold and draw her that lay behind the mere prettiness  besides he isnt pretty she thought as she placed the glass before him received the silver dime in payment and for the third time looked into his eyes  her vocabulary was limited and she knew little of the worth of words but the strong masculinity of his boys face told her that the term was inappropriate  he must be handsome then was her next thought as she again dropped her eyes before his  but all goodlooking men were called handsome and that term too displeased her  but whatever it was he was good to see and she was irritably aware of a desire to look at him again and again  as for joe he had never seen anything like this girl across the counter while he was wiser in natural philosophy than she and could have given immediately the reason for womans existence on the earth nevertheless woman had no part in his cosmos  his imagination was as untouched by woman as the girls was by man  but his imagination was touched now and the woman was genevieve  he had never dreamed a girl could be so beautiful and he could not keep his eyes from her face  yet every time he looked at her and her eyes met his he felt painful embarrassment and would have looked away had not her eyes dropped so quickly  but when at last she slowly lifted her eyes and held their gaze steadily it was his own eyes that dropped his own cheek that mantled red  she was much less embarrassed than he while she betrayed her embarrassment not at all  she was aware of a flutter within such as she had never known before but in no way did it disturb her outward serenity  joe on the contrary was obviously awkward and delightfully miserable  neither knew love and all that either was aware was an overwhelming desire to look at the other  both had been troubled and roused and they were drawing together with the sharpness and imperativeness of uniting elements  he toyed with his spoon and flushed his embarrassment over his soda but lingered on and she spoke softly dropped her eyes and wove her witchery about him  but he could not linger forever over a glass of icecream soda while he did not dare ask for a second glass  so he left her to remain in the shop in a waking trance and went away himself down the street like a somnambulist  genevieve dreamed through the afternoon and knew that she was in love  not so with joe  he knew only that he wanted to look at her again to see her face  his thoughts did not get beyond this and besides it was scarcely a thought being more a dim and inarticulate desire  the urge of this desire he could not escape  day after day it worried him and the candy shop and the girl behind the counter continually obtruded themselves  he fought off the desire  he was afraid and ashamed to go back to the candy shop  he solaced his fear with i aint a ladies man  not once nor twice but scores of times he muttered the thought to himself but it did no good  and by the middle of the week in the evening after work he came into the shop  he tried to come in carelessly and casually but his whole carriage advertised the strong effort of will that compelled his legs to carry his reluctant body thither  also he was shy and awkwarder than ever  genevieve on the contrary was serener than ever though fluttering most alarmingly within  he was incapable of speech mumbled his order looked anxiously at the clock despatched his icecream soda in tremendous haste and was gone  she was ready to weep with vexation  such meagre reward for four days waiting and assuming all the time that she loved  he was a nice boy and all that she knew but he neednt have been in so disgraceful a hurry but joe had not reached the corner before he wanted to be back with her again  he just wanted to look at her  he had no thought that it was love  love  that was when young fellows and girls walked out together as for himand then his desire took sharper shape and he discovered that that was the very thing he wanted her to do  he wanted to see her to look at her and well could he do all this if she but walked out with him  then that was why the young fellows and girls walked out together he mused as the weekend drew near  he had remotely considered this walking out to be a mere form or observance preliminary to matrimony  now he saw the deeper wisdom in it wanted it himself and concluded therefrom that he was in love  both were now of the same mind and there could be but the one ending and it was the mild nine days wonder of genevieves neighborhood when she and joe walked out together  both were blessed with an avarice of speech and because of it their courtship was a long one  as he expressed himself in action she expressed herself in repose and control and by the lovelight in her eyesthough this latter she would have suppressed in all maiden modesty had she been conscious of the speech her heart printed so plainly there dear and darling were too terribly intimate for them to achieve quickly and unlike most mating couples they did not overwork the love words  for a long time they were content to walk together in the evenings or to sit side by side on a bench in the park neither uttering a word for an hour at a time merely gazing into each others eyes too faintly luminous in the starshine to be a cause for selfconsciousness and embarrassment  he was as chivalrous and delicate in his attention as any knight to his lady  when they walked along the street he was careful to be on the outsidesomewhere he had heard that this was the proper thing to doand when a crossing to the opposite side of the street put him on the inside he swiftly sidestepped behind her to gain the outside again he carried her parcels for her and once when rain threatened her umbrella  he had never heard of the custom of sending flowers to ones ladylove so he sent genevieve fruit instead  there was utility in fruit  it was good to eat  flowers never entered his mind until one day he noticed a pale rose in her hair  it drew his gaze again and again  it was her hair therefore the presence of the flower interested him  again it interested him because she had chosen to put it there  for these reasons he was led to observe the rose more closely he discovered that the effect in itself was beautiful and it fascinated him  his ingenuous delight in it was a delight to her and a new and mutual lovethrill was theirsbecause of a flower  straightway he became a lover of flowers  also he became an inventor in gallantry  he sent her a bunch of violets  the idea was his own  he had never heard of a man sending flowers to a woman  flowers were used for decorative purposes also for funerals  he sent genevieve flowers nearly every day and so far as he was concerned the idea was original as positive an invention as ever arose in the mind of man  he was tremulous in his devotion to heras tremulous as was she in her reception of him  she was all that was pure and good a holy of holies not lightly to be profaned even by what might possibly be the too ardent reverence of a devotee  she was a being wholly different from any he had ever known  she was not as other girls  it never entered his head that she was of the same clay as his own sisters or anybodys sister  she was more than mere girl than mere woman  she waswell she was genevieve a being of a class by herself nothing less than a miracle of creation  and for her in turn there was in him but little less of illusion  her judgment of him in minor things might be critical while his judgment of her was sheer worship and had in it nothing critical at all but in her judgment of him as a whole she forgot the sum of the parts and knew him only as a creature of wonder who gave meaning to life and for whom she could die as willingly as she could live  she often beguiled her waking dreams of him with fancied situations wherein dying for him she at last adequately expressed the love she felt for him and which living she knew she could never fully express  their love was all fire and dew  the physical scarcely entered into it for such seemed profanation  the ultimate physical facts of their relation were something which they never considered  yet the immediate physical facts they knew the immediate yearnings and raptures of the fleshthe touch of finger tips on hand or arm the momentary pressure of a handclasp the rare lipcaress of a kiss the tingling thrill of her hair upon his cheek of her hand lightly thrusting back the locks from above his eyes  all this they knew but also and they knew not why there seemed a hint of sin about these caresses and sweet bodily contacts  there were times when she felt impelled to throw her arms around him in a very abandonment of love but always some sanctity restrained her  at such moments she was distinctly and unpleasantly aware of some unguessed sin that lurked within her  it was wrong undoubtedly wrong that she should wish to caress her lover in so unbecoming a fashion  no selfrespecting girl could dream of doing such a thing  it was unwomanly  besides if she had done it what would he have thought of it  and while she contemplated so horrible a catastrophe she seemed to shrivel and wilt in a furnace of secret shame  nor did joe escape the prick of curious desires chiefest among which perhaps was the desire to hurt genevieve  when after long and tortuous degrees he had achieved the bliss of putting his arm round her waist he felt spasmodic impulses to make the embrace crushing till she should cry out with the hurt  it was not his nature to wish to hurt any living thing  even in the ring to hurt was never the intention of any blow he struck  in such case he played the game and the goal of the game was to down an antagonist and keep that antagonist down for a space of ten seconds  so he never struck merely to hurt the hurt was incidental to the end and the end was quite another matter  and yet here with this girl he loved came the desire to hurt  why when with thumb and forefinger he had ringed her wrist he should desire to contract that ring till it crushed was beyond him  he could not understand and felt that he was discovering depths of brutality in his nature of which he had never dreamed  once on parting he threw his arms around her and swiftly drew her against him  her gasping cry of surprise and pain brought him to his senses and left him there very much embarrassed and still trembling with a vague and nameless delight  and she too was trembling  in the hurt itself which was the essence of the vigorous embrace she had found delight and again she knew sin though she knew not its nature nor why it should be sin  came the day very early in their walking out when silverstein chanced upon joe in his store and stared at him with saucereyes  came likewise the scene after joe had departed when the maternal feelings of mrs silverstein found vent in a diatribe against all prizefighters and against joe fleming in particular  vainly had silverstein striven to stay the spouses wrath  there was need for her wrath  all the maternal feelings were hers but none of the maternal rights  genevieve was aware only of the diatribe she knew a flood of abuse was pouring from the lips of the jewess but she was too stunned to hear the details of the abuse  joe her joe was joe fleming the prizefighter it was abhorrent impossible too grotesque to be believable  her clear eyed girlcheeked joe might be anything but a prizefighter  she had never seen one but he in no way resembled her conception of what a prize fighter must bethe human brute with tiger eyes and a streak for a forehead  of course she had heard of joe flemingwho in west oakland had notbut that there should be anything more than a coincidence of names had never crossed her mind  she came out of her daze to hear mrs silversteins hysterical sneer keepin company vit a bruiser  next silverstein and his wife fell to differing on noted and notorious as applicable to her lover  but he iss a good boy silverstein was contending  he make der money an he safe der money  you tell me dat mrs silverstein screamed  vat you know  you

that his eloquence had betrayed him collapsed into voluble assurances that he was ahead of the game  an all because of joe fleming he concluded  i back him efery time to vin  but genevieve and joe were preeminently mated and nothing not even this terrible discovery could keep them apart  in vain genevieve tried to steel herself against him but she fought herself not him  to her surprise she discovered a thousand excuses for him found him lovable as ever and she entered into his life to be his destiny and to control him after the way of women  she saw his future and hers through glowing vistas of reform and her first great deed was when she wrung from him his promise to cease fighting  and he after the way of men pursuing the dream of love and striving for possession of the precious and deathless object of desire had yielded and yet in the very moment of promising her he knew vaguely deep down that he could never abandon the game that somewhere sometime in the future he must go back to it  and he had had a swift vision of his mother and brothers and sisters their multitudinous wants the house with its painting and repairing its street assessments and taxes and of the coming of children to him and genevieve and of his own daily wage in the sailmaking loft  but the next moment the vision was dismissed as such warnings are always dismissed and he saw before him only genevieve and he knew only his hunger for her and the call of his being to her and he accepted calmly her calm assumption of his life and actions  he was twenty she was eighteen boy and girl the pair of them and made for progeny healthy and normal with steady blood pounding through their bodies and wherever they went together even on sunday outings across the bay amongst people who did not know him eyes were continually drawn to them  he matched her girls beauty with his boys beauty her grace with his strength her delicacy of line and fibre with the harsher vigor and muscle of the male  frankfaced freshcolored almost ingenuous in expression eyes blue and wide apart he drew and held the gaze of more than one woman far above him in the social scale  of such glances and dim maternal promptings he was quite unconscious though genevieve was quick to see and understand and she knew each time the pang of a fierce joy in that he was hers and that she held him in the hollow of her hand he did see however and rather resented the mens glances drawn by her these too she saw and understood as he did not dream of understanding     chapter iii   genevieve slipped on a pair of joes shoes lightsoled and dapper and laughed with lottie who stooped to turn up the trousers for her  lottie was his sister and in the secret  to her was due the inveigling of his mother into making a neighborhood call so that they could have the house to themselves  they went down into the kitchen where joe was waiting his face brightened as he came to meet her love shining frankly forth  now get up those skirts lottie he commanded  havent any time to waste  there thatll do  you see you only want the bottoms of the pants to show  the coat will cover the rest  now lets see how itll fit  borrowed it from chris hes a dead sporty sportlittle but oh my he went on helping genevieve into an overcoat which fell to her heels and which fitted her as a tailormade overcoat should fit the man for whom it is made  joe put a cap on her head and turned up the collar which was generous to exaggeration meeting the cap and completely hiding her hair  when he buttoned the collar in front its points served to cover the cheeks chin and mouth were buried in its depths and a close scrutiny revealed only shadowy eyes and a little less shadowy nose  she walked across the room the bottom of the trousers just showing as the bang of the coat was disturbed by movement  a sport with a cold and afraid of catching more all right all right the boy laughed proudly surveying his handiwork  how much money you got  im layin ten to six  will you take the short end  whos short she asked  ponta of course lottie blurted out her hurt as though there could be any question of it even for an instant  of course genevieve said sweetly only i dont know much about such things  this time lottie kept her lips together but the new hurt showed on her face  joe looked at his watch and said it was time to go  his sisters arms went about his neck and she kissed him soundly on the lips  she kissed genevieve too and saw them to the gate one arm of her brother about her waist  what does ten to six mean genevieve asked the while their footfalls rang out on the frosty air  that im the long end the favorite he answered  that a man bets ten dollars at the ring side that i win against six dollars another man is betting that i lose  but if youre the favorite and everybody thinks youll win how does anybody bet against you  thats what makes prizefightingdifference of opinion he laughed besides theres always the chance of a lucky punch an accident  lots of chance he said gravely  she shrank against him clingingly and protectingly and he laughed with surety  you wait and youll see  an dont get scared at the start  the first few roundsll be something fierce  thats pontas strong point  hes a wild man with an kinds of punchesa whirlwindand he gets his man in the first rounds  hes put away a whole lot of cleverer and better men than him  its up to me to live through it thats all  then hell be all in  then i go after him just watch  youll know when i go after him an ill getm too  they came to the hall on a dark streetcorner ostensibly the quarters of an athletic club but in reality an institution designed for pulling off fights and keeping within the police ordinance  joe drew away from her and they walked apart to the entrance  keep your hands in your pockets whatever you do joe warned her and itll be all right  only a couple of minutes of it  hes with me joe said to the doorkeeper who was talking with a policeman  both men greeted him familiarly taking no notice of his companion  they never tumbled nobodyll tumble joe assured her as they climbed the stairs to the second story  and even if they did they wouldnt know who it was and theys keep it mum for me  here come in here  he whisked her into a little officelike room and left her seated on a dusty brokenbottomed chair  a few minutes later he was back again clad in a long bath robe canvas shoes on his feet  she began to tremble against him and his arm passed gently around her  itll be all right genevieve he said encouragingly  ive got it all fixed  nobodyll tumble  its you joe she said  i dont care for myself  its you  dont care for yourself  but thats what i thought you were afraid of  he looked at her in amazement the wonder of woman bursting upon him in a more transcendent glory than ever and he had seen much of the wonder of woman in genevieve  he was speechless for a moment and then stammered  you mean me  and you dont care what people think or anythingor anything  a sharp double knock at the door and a sharper get a move on yerself joe brought him back to immediate things  quick one last kiss genevieve he whispered almost holily  its my last fight an ill fight as never before with you lookin at me  the next she knew the pressure of his lips yet warm on hers she was in a group of jostling young fellows none of whom seemed to take the slightest notice of her  several had their coats off and their shirt sleeves rolled up  they entered the hall from the rear still keeping the casual formation of the group and moved slowly up a side aisle  it was a crowded illlighted hall barnlike in its proportions and the smokeladen air gave a peculiar distortion to everything  she felt as though she would stifle  there were shrill cries of boys selling programmes and soda water and there was a great bass rumble of masculine voices  she heard a voice offering ten to six on joe fleming  the utterance was monotonoushopeless it seemed to her and she felt a quick thrill  it was her joe against whom everybody was to bet  and she felt other thrills  her blood was touched as by fire with romance adventurethe unknown the mysterious the terribleas she penetrated this haunt of men where women came not  and there were other thrills  it was the only time in her life she had dared the rash thing for the first time she was overstepping the bounds laid down by that harshest of tyrants the mrs grundy of the working class  she felt fear and for herself though the moment before she had been thinking only of joe  before she knew it the front of the hall had been reached and she had gone up half a dozen steps into a small dressingroom  this was crowded to suffocationby men who played the game she concluded in one capacity or another  and here she lost joe  but before the real personal fright could soundly clutch her one of the young fellows said gruffly come along with me you and as she wedged out at his heels she noticed that another one of the escort was following her  they came upon a sort of stage which accommodated three rows of men and she caught her first glimpse of the squared ring  she was on a level with it and so near that she could have reached out and touched its ropes  she noticed that it was covered with padded canvas  beyond the ring and on either side as in a fog she could see the crowded house  the dressingroom she had left abutted upon one corner of the ring squeezing her way after her guide through the seated men she crossed the end of the hall and entered a similar dressingroom at the other corner of the ring  now dont make a noise and stay here till i come for you instructed her guide pointing out a peephole arrangement in the wall of the room     chapter iv   she hurried to the peephole and found herself against the ring  she could see the whole of it though part of the audience was shut off  the ring was well lighted by an overhead cluster of patent gasburners  the front row of the men she had squeezed past because of their paper and pencils she decided to be reporters from the local papers uptown  one of them was chewing gum  behind them on the other two rows of seats she could make out firemen from the nearby enginehouse and several policemen in uniform  in the middle of the front row flanked by the reporters sat the young chief of police  she was startled by catching sight of mr clausen on the opposite side of the ring  there he sat austere sidewhiskered pink and white close up against the front of the ring  several seats farther on in the same front row she discovered silverstein his weazen features glowing with anticipation  a few cheers heralded the advent of several young fellows in shirtsleeves carrying buckets bottles and towels who crawled through the ropes and crossed to the diagonal corner from her  one of them sat down on a stool and leaned back against the ropes  she saw that he was barelegged with canvas shoes on his feet and that his body was swathed in a heavy white sweater  in the meantime another group had occupied the corner directly against her  louder cheers drew her attention to it and she saw joe seated on a stool still clad in the bath robe his short chestnut curls within a yard of her eyes  a young man in a black suit with a mop of hair and a preposterously tall starched collar walked to the centre of the ring and held up his hand  gentlemen will please stop smoking he said  his effort was applauded by groans and catcalls and she noticed with indignation that nobody stopped smoking  mr clausen held a burning match in his fingers while the announcement was being made and then calmly lighted his cigar  she felt that she hated him in that moment how was her joe to fight in such an atmosphere  she could scarcely breathe herself and she was only sitting down  the announcer came over to joe  he stood up  his bath robe fell away from him and he stepped forth to the centre of the ring naked save for the low canvas shoes and a narrow hipcloth of white  genevieves eyes dropped  she sat alone with none to see but her face was burning with shame at sight of the beautiful nakedness of her lover  but she looked again guiltily for the joy that was hers in beholding what she knew must be sinful to behold  the leap of something within her and the stir of her being toward him must be sinful  but it was delicious sin and she did not deny her eyes  in vain mrs grundy admonished her  the pagan in her original sin and all nature urged her on  the mothers of all the past were whispering through her and there was a clamour of the children unborn  but of this she knew nothing  she knew only that it was sin and she lifted her head proudly recklessly resolved in one great surge of revolt to sin to the uttermost  she had never dreamed of the form under the clothes  the form beyond the hands and the face had no part in her mental processes  a child of garmented civilization the garment was to her the form  the race of men was to her a race of garmented bipeds with hands and faces and haircovered heads  when she thought of joe the joe instantly visualized on her mind was a clothed joegirlcheeked blueeyed curly headed but clothed  and there he stood all but naked godlike in a white blaze of light  she had never conceived of the form of god except as nebulously naked and the thoughtassociation was startling  it seemed to her that her sin partook of sacrilege or blasphemy  her chromotrained aesthetic sense exceeded its education and told her that here were beauty and wonder  she had always liked the physical presentment of joe but it was a presentment of clothes and she had thought the pleasingness of it due to the neatness and taste with which he dressed  she had never dreamed that this lurked beneath  it dazzled her  his skin was fair as a womans far more satiny and no rudimentary hairgrowth marred its white lustre  this she perceived but all the rest the perfection of line and strength and development gave pleasure without her knowing why  there was a cleanness and grace about it  his face was like a cameo and his lips parted in a smile made it very boyish  he smiled as he faced the audience when the announcer placing a hand on his shoulder said joe fleming the pride of west oakland  cheers and handclappings stormed up and she heard affectionate cries of oh you joe  men shouted it at him again and again  he walked back to his corner  never to her did he seem less a fighter than then  his eyes were too mild there was not a spark of the beast in them nor in his face while his body seemed too fragile what of its fairness and smoothness and his face too boyish and sweettempered and intelligent  she did not have the experts eye for the depth of chest the wide nostrils the recuperative lungs and the muscles under their satin sheathscrypts of energy wherein lurked the chemistry of destruction  to her he looked like a something of dresden china to be handled gently and with care liable to be shattered to fragments by the first rough touch  john ponta stripped of his white sweater by the pulling and hauling of two of his seconds came to the centre of the ring  she knew terror as she looked at him  here was the fighterthe beast with a streak for a forehead with beady eyes under lowering and bushy brows flatnosed thicklipped sullenmouthed  he was heavyjawed bullnecked and the short straight hair of the head seemed to her frightened eyes the stiff bristles on a hogs back  here were coarseness and brutishnessa thing savage primordial ferocious  he was swarthy to blackness and his body was covered with a hairy growth that matted like a dogs on his chest and shoulders  he was deepchested thicklegged largemuscled but unshapely  his muscles were knots and he was gnarled and knobby twisted out of beauty by excess of strength  john ponta west bay athletic club said the announcer  a much smaller volume of cheers greeted him  it was evident that the crowd favored joe with its sympathy  go in an eat m ponta  eat m up a voice shouted in the lull  this was received by scornful cries and groans  he did not like it for his sullen mouth twisted into a halfsnarl as he went back to his corner he was too decided an atavism to draw the crowds admiration instinctively the crowd disliked him  he was an animal lacking in intelligence and spirit a menace and a thing of fear as the tiger and the snake are menaces and things of fear better behind the bars of a cage than running free in the open  and he felt that the crowd had no relish for him  he was like an animal in the circle of its enemies and he turned and glared at them with malignant eyes  little silverstein shouting out joes name with high glee shrank away from pontas gaze shrivelled as in fierce heat the sound gurgling and dying in his throat  genevieve saw the little byplay and as pontas eyes slowly swept round the circle of their hate and met hers she too shrivelled and shrank back  the next moment they were past pausing to centre long on joe  it seemed to her that ponta was working himself into a rage  joe returned the gaze with mild boys eyes but his face grew serious  the announcer escorted a third man to the centre of the ring a genial faced young fellow in shirtsleeves  eddy jones who will referee this contest said the announcer  oh you eddy men shouted in the midst of the applause and it was apparent to genevieve that he too was well beloved  both men were being helped into the gloves by their seconds and one of pontas seconds came over and examined the gloves before they went on joes hands  the referee called them to the centre of the ring  the seconds followed and they made quite a group joe and ponta facing each other the referee in the middle the seconds leaning with hands on one anothers shoulders their heads craned forward  the referee was talking and all listened attentively  the group broke up  again the announcer came to the front  joe fleming fights at one hundred and twentyeight he said john ponta at one hundred and forty  they will fight as long as one hand is free and take care of themselves in the breakaway  the audience must remember that a decision must be given  there are no draws fought before this club  he crawled through the ropes and dropped from the ring to the floor there was a scuttling in the corners as the seconds cleared out through the ropes taking with them the stools and buckets  only remained in the ring the two fighters and the referee  a gong sounded  the two men advanced rapidly to the centre  their right hands extended and for a fraction of an instant met in a perfunctory shake  then ponta lashed out savagely right and left and joe escaped by springing back  like a projectile ponta hurled himself after him and upon him  the fight was on  genevieve clutched one hand to her breast and watched she was bewildered by the swiftness and savagery of pontas assault and by the multitude of blows he struck  she felt that joe was surely being destroyed  at times she could not see his face so obscured was it by the flying gloves  but she could hear the resounding blows and with the sound of each blow she felt a sickening sensation in the pit of her stomach  she did not know that what she heard was the impact of glove on glove or glove on shoulder and that no damage was being done  she was suddenly aware that a change had come over the fight  both men were clutching each other in a tense embrace no blows were being struck at all  she recognized it to be what joe had described to her as the clinch  ponta was struggling to free himself joe was holding on  the referee shouted break  joe made an effort to get away but ponta got one hand free and joe rushed back into a second clinch to escape the blow  but this time she noticed the heel of his glove was pressed against pontas mouth and chin and at the second break of the referee joe shoved his opponents head back and sprang clear himself  for a brief several seconds she had an unobstructed view of her lover left foot a trifle advanced knees slightly bent he was crouching with his head drawn well down between his shoulders and shielded by them  his hands were in position before him ready either to attack or defend  the muscles of his body were tense and as he moved about she could see them bunch up and writhe and crawl like live things under the white skin  but again ponta was upon him and he was struggling to live  he crouched a bit more drew his body more compactly together and covered up with his hands elbows and forearms  blows rained upon him and it looked to her as though he were being beaten to death  but he was receiving the blows on his gloves and shoulders rocking back and forth to the force of them like a tree in a storm while the house cheered its delight  it was not until she understood this applause and saw silverstein half out of his seat and intensely madly happy and heard the oh you joes from many throats that she realized that instead of being cruelly punished he was acquitting himself well  then he would emerge for a moment again to be enveloped and hidden in the whirlwind of pontas ferocity     chapter v   the gong sounded  it seemed they had been fighting half an hour though from what joe had told her she knew it had been only three minutes  with the crash of the gong joes seconds were through the ropes and running him into his corner for the blessed minute of rest  one man squatting on the floor between his outstretched feet and elevating them by resting them on his knees was violently chafing his legs  joe sat on the stool leaning far back into the corner head thrown back and arms outstretched on the ropes to give easy expansion to the chest  with wideopen mouth he was breathing the toweldriven air furnished by two of the seconds while listening to the counsel of still another second who talked with low voice in his ear and at the same time sponged off his face shoulders and chest  hardly had all this been accomplished it had taken no more than several seconds when the gong sounded the seconds scuttled through the ropes with their paraphernalia and joe and ponta were advancing against each other to the centre of the ring  genevieve had no idea that a minute could be so short  for a moment she felt that this rest had been cut and was suspicious of she knew not what  ponta lashed out right and left savagely as ever and though joe blocked the blows such was the force of them that he was knocked backward several steps  ponta was after him with the spring of a tiger in the involuntary effort to maintain equilibrium joe had uncovered himself flinging one arm out and lifting his head from beneath the sheltering shoulders  so swiftly had ponta followed him that a terrible swinging blow was coming at his unguarded jaw  he ducked forward and down pontas fist just missing the back of his head  as he came back to the perpendicular pontas left fist drove at him in a straight punch that would have knocked him backward through the ropes  again and with a swiftness an inappreciable fraction of time quicker than pontas he ducked forward  pontas fist grazed the backward slope of the shoulder and glanced off into the air  pontas right drove straight out and the graze was repeated as joe ducked into the safety of a clinch  genevieve sighed with relief her tense body relaxing and a faintness coming over her  the crowd was cheering madly  silverstein was on his feet shouting gesticulating completely out of himself  and even mr clausen was yelling his enthusiasm at the top of his lungs into the ear of his nearest neighbor  the clinch was broken and the fight went on  joe blocked and backed and slid around the ring avoiding blows and living somehow through the whirlwind onslaughts  rarely did he strike blows himself for ponta had a quick eye and could defend as well as attack while joe had no chance against the others enormous vitality  his hope lay in that ponta himself should ultimately consume his strength  but genevieve was beginning to wonder why her lover did not fight  she grew angry  she wanted to see him wreak vengeance on this beast that had persecuted him so  even as she waxed impatient the chance came and joe whipped his fist to pontas mouth  it was a staggering blow  she saw pontas head go back with a jerk and the quick dye of blood upon his lips  the blow and the great shout from the audience angered him  he rushed like a wild man  the fury of his previous assaults was as nothing compared with the fury of this one  and there was no more opportunity for another blow  joe was too busy living through the storm he had already caused blocking covering up and ducking into the safety and respite of the clinches  but the clinch was not all safety and respite  every instant of it was intense watchfulness while the breakaway was still more dangerous genevieve had noticed with a slight touch of amusement the curious way in which joe snuggled his body in against pontas in the clinches but she had not realized why until in one such clinch before the snuggling in could be effected pontas fist whipped straight up in the air from under and missed joes chin by a hairsbreadth  in another and later clinch when she had already relaxed and sighed her relief at seeing him safely snuggled ponta his chin over joes shoulder lifted his right arm and struck a terrible downward blow on the small of the back  the crowd groaned its apprehension while joe quickly locked his opponents arms to prevent a repetition of the blow  the gong struck and after the fleeting minute of rest they went at it againin joes corner for ponta had made a rush to meet him clear across the ring  where the blow had been over the kidneys the white skin had become bright red  this splash of color the size of the glove fascinated and frightened genevieve so that she could scarcely take her eyes from it  promptly in the next clinch the blow was repeated but after that joe usually managed to give ponta the heel of the glove on the mouth and so hold his head back  this prevented the striking of the blow but three times more before the round ended ponta effected the trick each time striking the same vulnerable part  another rest and another round went by with no further damage to joe and no diminution of strength on the part of ponta  but in the beginning of the fifth round joe caught in a corner made as though to duck into a clinch  just before it was effected and at the precise moment that ponta was ready with his own body to receive the snuggling in of joes body joe drew back slightly and drove with his fists at his opponents unprotected stomach  lightninglike blows they were four of them right and left and heavy they were for ponta winced away from them and staggered back half dropping his arms his shoulders drooping forward and in as though he were about to double in at the waist and collapse joes quick eye saw the opening and he smashed straight out upon pontas mouth following instantly with a half swing half hook for the jaw  it missed striking the cheek instead and sending ponta staggering sideways  the house was on its feet shouting to a man  genevieve could hear men crying hes got m hes got m and it seemed to her the beginning of the end  she too was out of herself softness and tenderness had vanished she exulted with each crushing blow her lover delivered  but pontas vitality was yet to be reckoned with  as like a tiger he had followed joe up joe now followed him up  he made another half swing half hook for pontas jaw and ponta already recovering his wits and strength ducked cleanly  joes fist passed on through empty air and so great was the momentum of the blow that it carried him around in a half twirl sideways  then ponta lashed out with his left  his glove landed on joes unguarded neck  genevieve saw her lovers arms drop to his sides as his body lifted went backward and fell limply to the floor  the referee bending over him began to count the seconds emphasizing the passage of each second with a downward sweep of his right arm  the audience was still as death  ponta had partly turned to the house to receive the approval that was his due only to be met by this chill graveyard silence  quick wrath surged up in him  it was unfair  his opponent only was applaudedif he struck a blow if he escaped a blow he ponta who had forced the fighting from the start had received no word of cheer  his eyes blazed as he gathered himself together and sprang to his prostrate foe  he crouched alongside of him right arm drawn back and ready for a smashing blow the instant joe should start to rise  the referee still bending over and counting with his right hand shoved ponta back with his left  the latter crouching circled around and the referee circled with him thrusting him back and keeping between him and the fallen man  fourfivesix the count went on and joe rolling over on his face squirmed weakly to draw himself to his knees  this he succeeded in doing resting on one knee a hand to the floor on either side and the other leg bent under him to help him rise  take the count  take the count a dozen voices rang out from the audience  for gods sake take the count one of joes seconds cried warningly from the edge of the ring  genevieve gave him one swift glance and saw the young fellows face drawn and white his lips unconsciously moving as he kept the count with the referee  seveneightnine the seconds went  the ninth sounded and was gone when the referee gave ponta a last backward shove and joe came to his feet bunched up covered up weak but cool very cool  ponta hurled himself upon him with terrific force delivering an uppercut and a straight punch  but joe blocked the two ducked a third stepped to the side to avoid a fourth and was then driven backward into a corner by a hurricane of blows  he was exceedingly weak  he tottered as he kept his footing and staggered back and forth  his back was against the ropes  there was no further retreat  ponta paused as if to make doubly sure then feinted with his left and struck fiercely with his right with all his strength  but joe ducked into a clinch and was for a moment saved  ponta struggled frantically to free himself  he wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone  but joe was holding on for life resisting the others every effort as fast as one hold or grip was torn loose finding a new one by which to cling  break the referee commanded  joe held on tighter  make m break  why the hell dont you make m break ponta panted at the referee  again the latter commanded the break  joe refused keeping as he well knew within his rights each moment of the clinch his strength was coming back to him his brain was clearing the cobwebs were disappearing from before his eyes  the round was young and he must live somehow through the nearly three minutes of it yet to run  the referee clutched each by the shoulder and sundered them violently passing quickly between them as he thrust them backward in order to make a clean break of it  the moment he was free ponta sprang at joe like a wild animal bearing down its prey  but joe covered up blocked and fell into a clinch  again ponta struggled to get free joe held on and the referee thrust them apart  and again joe avoided damage and clinched  genevieve realized that in the clinches he was not being beatenwhy then did not the referee let him hold on  it was cruel  she hated the genialfaced eddy jones in those moments and she partly rose from her chair her hands clenched with anger the nails cutting into the palms till they hurt  the rest of the round the three long minutes of it was a succession of clinches and breaks  not once did ponta succeed in striking his opponent the deadly final blow  and ponta was like a madman raging because of his impotency in the face of his helpless and all but vanquished foe  one blow only one blow and he could not deliver it  joes ring experience and coolness saved him  with shaken consciousness and trembling body he clutched and held on while the ebbing life turned and flooded up in him again  once in his passion unable to hit him ponta made as though to lift him up and hurl him to the floor  vy dont you bite him silverstein taunted shrilly  in the stillness the sally was heard over the whole house and the audience relieved of its anxiety for its favorite laughed with an uproariousness that had in it the note of hysteria  even genevieve felt that there was something irresistibly funny in the remark and the relief of the audience was communicated to her yet she felt sick and faint and was overwrought with horror at what she had seen and was seeing  bite m  bite m voices from the recovered audience were shouting chew his ear off ponta  thats the only way you can get m  eat m up  eat m up  oh why dont you eat m up  the effect was bad on ponta  he became more frenzied than ever and more impotent  he panted and sobbed wasting his effort by too much effort losing sanity and control and futilely trying to compensate for the loss by excess of physical endeavor  he knew only the blind desire to destroy shook joe in the clinches as a terrier might a rat strained and struggled for freedom of body and arms and all the while joe calmly clutched and held on  the referee worked manfully and fairly to separate them  perspiration ran down his face  it took all his strength to split those clinging bodies and no sooner had he split them than joe fell unharmed into another embrace and the work had to be done all over again in vain when freed did ponta try to avoid the clutching arms and twining body  he could not keep away  he had to come close in order to strike and each time joe baffled him and caught him in his arms  and genevieve crouched in the little dressingroom and peering through the peephole was baffled too  she was an interested party in what seemed a deathstrugglewas not one of the fighters her joebut the audience understood and she did not  the game had not unveiled to her the lure of it was beyond her  it was greater mystery than ever  she could not comprehend its power  what delight could there be for joe in that brutal surging and straining of bodies those fierce clutches fiercer blows and terrible hurts  surely she genevieve offered more than thatrest and content and sweet calm joy  her bid for the heart of him and the soul of him was finer and more generous than the bid of the game yet he dallied with bothheld her in his arms but turned his head to listen to that other and siren call she could not understand  the gong struck  the round ended with a break in pontas corner  the whitefaced young second was through the ropes with the first clash of sound  he seized joe in his arms lifted him clear of the floor and ran with him across the ring to his own corner  his seconds worked over him furiously chafing his legs slapping his abdomen stretching the hip cloth out with their fingers so that he might breathe more easily  for the first time genevieve saw the stomachbreathing of a man an abdomen that rose and fell far more with every breath than her breast rose and fell after she had run for a car  the pungency of ammonia bit her nostrils wafted to her from the soaked sponge wherefrom he breathed the fiery fumes that cleared his brain  he gargled his mouth and throat took a suck at a divided lemon and all the while the towels worked like mad driving oxygen into his lungs to purge the pounding blood and send it back revivified for the struggle yet to come  his heated body was sponged with water doused with it and bottles were turned mouthdownward on his head     chapter vi   the gong for the sixth round struck and both men advanced to meet each other their bodies glistening with water  ponta rushed twothirds of the way across the ring so intent was he on getting at his man before full recovery could be effected  but joe had lived through  he was strong again and getting stronger  he blocked several vicious blows and then smashed back sending ponta reeling  he attempted to follow up but wisely forbore and contented himself with blocking and covering up in the whirlwind his blow had raised  the fight was as it had been at the beginningjoe protecting ponta rushing  but ponta was never at ease  he did not have it all his own way  at any moment in his fiercest onslaughts his opponent was liable to lash out and reach him  joe saved his strength  he struck one blow to pontas ten but his one blow rarely missed  ponta overwhelmed him in the attacks yet could do nothing with him while joes tigerlike strokes always imminent compelled respect  they toned pontas ferocity  he was no longer able to go in with the complete abandon of destructiveness which had marked his earlier efforts  but a change was coming over the fight  the audience was quick to note it and even genevieve saw it by the beginning of the ninth round  joe was taking the offensive  in the clinches it was he who brought his fist down on the small of the back striking the terrible kidney blow  he did it once in each clinch but with all his strength and he did it every clinch  then in the breakaways he began to uppercut ponta on the stomach or to hook his jaw or strike straight out upon the mouth  but at first sign of a coming of a whirlwind joe would dance nimbly away and cover up  two rounds of this went by and three but pontas strength though perceptibly less did not diminish rapidly  joes task was to wear down that strength not with one blow nor ten but with blow after blow without end until that enormous strength should be beaten sheer out of its body  there was no rest for the man  joe followed him up step by step his advancing left foot making an audible tap tap tap on the hard canvas  then there would come a sudden leap in tigerlike a blow struck or blows and a swift leap back whereupon the left foot would take up again its tapping advance  when ponta made his savage rushes joe carefully covered up only to emerge his left foot going tap tap tap as he immediately followed up  ponta was slowly weakening  to the crowd the end was a foregone conclusion  oh you joe it yelled its admiration and affection  its a shame to take the money it mocked  why dont you eat m ponta  go on in an eat m  in the oneminute intermissions pontas seconds worked over him as they had not worked before  their calm trust in his tremendous vitality had been betrayed  genevieve watched their excited efforts while she listened to the whitefaced second cautioning joe  take your time he was saying  youve got m but you got to take your time  ive seen m fight  hes got a punch to the end of the count  ive seen m knocked out and clean batty an go on punching just the same  mickey sullivan had m goin  puts m to the mat as fast as he crawls up six times an then leaves an opening  ponta reaches for his jaw an two minutes afterward mickeys openin his eyes an askin whats doin  so youve got to watch m  no goin in an absorbin one of them lucky punches now  i got money on this fight but i dont call it mine till hes counted out  ponta was being doused with water  as the gong sounded one of his seconds inverted a water bottle on his head  he started toward the centre of the ring and the second followed him for several steps keeping the bottle still inverted  the referee shouted at him and he fled the ring dropping the bottle as he fled  it rolled over and over the water gurgling out upon the canvas till the referee with a quick flirt of his toe sent the bottle rolling through the ropes  in all the previous rounds genevieve had not seen joes fighting face which had been prefigured to her that morning in the department store sometimes his face had been quite boyish other times when taking his fiercest punishment it had been bleak and gray and still later when living through and clutching and holding on it had taken on a wistful expression  but now out of danger himself and as he forced the fight his fighting face came upon him  she saw it and shuddered  it removed him so far from her  she had thought she knew him all of him and held him in the hollow of her hand but this she did not knowthis face of steel this mouth of steel these eyes of steel flashing the light and glitter of steel  it seemed to her the passionless face of an avenging angel stamped only with the purpose of the lord  ponta attempted one of his oldtime rushes but was stopped on the mouth implacable insistent ever menacing never letting him rest joe followed him up  the round the thirteenth closed with a rush in pontas corner  he attempted a rally was brought to his knees took the nine seconds count and then tried to clinch into safety only to receive four of joes terrible stomach punches so that with the gong he fell back gasping into the arms of his seconds  joe ran across the ring to his own corner  now im going to get m he said to his second  you sure fixed m that time the latter answered  nothin to stop you now but a lucky punch  watch out for it  joe leaned forward feet gathered under him for a spring like a foot racer waiting the start  he was waiting for the gong  when it sounded he shot forward and across the ring catching ponta in the midst of his seconds as he rose from his stool  and in the midst of his seconds he went down knocked down by a righthand blow  as he arose from the confusion of buckets stools and seconds joe put him down again  and yet a third time he went down before he could escape from his own corner  joe had at last become the whirlwind  genevieve remembered his just watch youll know when i go after him  the house knew it too  it was on its feet every voice raised in a fierce yell  it was the bloodcry of the crowd and it sounded to her like what she imagined must be the howling of wolves  and what with confidence in her lovers victory she found room in her heart to pity ponta  in vain he struggled to defend himself to block to cover up to duck to clinch into a moments safety  that moment was denied him  knockdown after knockdown was his portion  he was knocked to the canvas backwards and sideways was punched in the clinches and in the breakawaysstiff jolty blows that dazed his brain and drove the strength from his muscles he was knocked into the corners and out again against the ropes rebounding and with another blow against the ropes once more  he fanned the air with his arms showering savage blows upon emptiness  there was nothing human left in him  he was the beast incarnate roaring and raging and being destroyed  he was smashed down to his knees but refused to take the count staggering to his feet only to be met stiff handed on the mouth and sent hurling back against the ropes  in sore travail gasping reeling panting with glazing eyes and sobbing breath grotesque and heroic fighting to the last striving to get at his antagonist he surged and was driven about the ring  and in that moment joes foot slipped on the wet canvas  pontas swimming eyes saw and knew the chance  all the fleeing strength of his body gathered itself together for the lightning lucky punch  even as joe slipped the other smote him fairly on the point of the chin  he went over backward genevieve saw his muscles relax while he was yet in the air and she heard the thud of his head on the canvas  the noise of the yelling house died suddenly  the referee stooping over the inert body was counting the seconds  ponta tottered and fell to his knees  he struggled to his feet swaying back and forth as he tried to sweep the audience with his hatred  his legs were trembling and bending under him he was choking and sobbing fighting to breathe  he reeled backward and saved himself from falling by a blind clutching for the ropes  he clung there drooping and bending and giving in all his body his head upon his chest until the referee counted the fatal tenth second and pointed to him in token that he had won  he received no applause and he squirmed through the ropes snakelike into the arms of his seconds who helped him to the floor and supported him down the aisle into the crowd  joe remained where he had fallen  his seconds carried him into his corner and placed him on the stool  men began climbing into the ring curious to see but were roughly shoved out by the policemen who were already there  genevieve looked on from her peephole  she was not greatly perturbed her lover had been knocked out  in so far as disappointment was his she shared it with him but that was all  she even felt glad in a way  the game had played him false and he was more surely hers  she had heard of knockouts from him  it often took men some time to recover from the effects  it was not till she heard the seconds asking for the doctor that she felt really worried  they passed his limp body through the ropes to the stage and it disappeared beyond the limits of her peephole  then the door of her dressingroom was thrust open and a number of men came in  they were carrying joe  he was laid down on the dusty floor his head resting on the knee of one of the seconds  no one seemed surprised by her presence she came over and knelt beside him  his eyes were closed his lips slightly parted  his wet hair was plastered in straight locks about his face  she lifted one of his hands  it was very heavy and the lifelessness of it shocked her  she looked suddenly at the faces of the seconds and of the men about her  they seemed frightened all save one and he was cursing in a low voice horribly  she looked up and saw silverstein standing beside her  he too seemed frightened  he rested a kindly hand on her shoulder tightening the fingers with a sympathetic pressure  this sympathy frightened her  she began to feel dazed  there was a bustle as somebody entered the room  the person came forward proclaiming irritably get out  get out  youve got to clear the room  a number of men silently obeyed  who are you he abruptly demanded of genevieve  a girl as im alive  thats all right shes his girl spoke up a young fellow she recognized as her guide  and you the other man blurted explosively at silverstein  im vit her he answered truculently  she works for him explained the young fellow  its all right i tell you  the newcomer grunted and knelt down  he passed a hand over the damp head grunted again and arose to his feet  this is no case for me he said  send for the ambulance  then the thing became a dream to genevieve  maybe she had fainted she did not know but for what other reason should silverstein have his arm around her supporting her  all the faces seemed blurred and unreal fragments of a discussion came to her ears  the young fellow who had been her guide was saying something about reporters  you vill get your name in der papers she could hear silverstein saying to her as from a great distance and she knew she was shaking her head in refusal  there was an eruption of new faces and she saw joe carried out on a canvas stretcher  silverstein was buttoning the long overcoat and drawing the collar about her face  she felt the night air on her cheek and looking up saw the clear cold stars  she jammed into a seat silverstein was beside her  joe was there too still on his stretcher with blankets over his naked body and there was a man in blue uniform who spoke kindly to her though she did not know what he said  horses hoofs were clattering and she was lurching somewhere through the night  next light and voices and a smell of iodoform  this must be the receiving hospital she thought this the operating table those the doctors  they were examining joe  one of them a darkeyed darkbearded foreignlooking man rose up from bending over the table  never saw anything like it he was saying to another man  the whole back of the skull  her lips were hot and dry and there was an intolerable ache in her throat  but why didnt she cry  she ought to cry she felt it incumbent upon her  there was lottie there had been another change in the dream across the little narrow cot from her and she was crying  somebody was saying something about the coma of death  it was not the foreignlooking doctor but somebody else  it did not matter who it was  what time was it  as if in answer she saw the faint white light of dawn on the windows  i was going to be married today she said to lottie  and from across the cot his sister wailed dont dont and covering her face sobbed afresh  this then was the end of it allof the carpets and furniture and the little rented house of the meetings and walking out the thrilling nights of starshine the deliciousness of surrender the loving and the being loved  she was stunned by the awful facts of this game she did not understandthe grip it laid on mens souls its irony and faithlessness its risks and hazards and fierce insurgences of the blood making woman pitiful not the beall and endall of man but his toy and his pastime to woman his mothering and caretaking his moods and his moments but to the game his days and nights of striving the tribute of his head and hand his most patient toil and wildest effort all the strain and the stress of his beingto the game his hearts desire  silverstein was helping her to her feet  she obeyed blindly the daze of the dream still on her  his hand grasped her arm and he was turning her toward the door  oh why dont you kiss him lottie cried out her dark eyes mournful and passionate  genevieve stooped obediently over the quiet clay and pressed her lips to the lips yet warm  the door opened and she passed into another room there stood mrs silverstein with angry eyes that snapped vindictively at sight of her boys clothes  silverstein looked beseechingly at his spouse but she burst forth savagely  vot did i tell you eh  vot did i tell you  you vood haf a bruiser for your steady  an now your name vill be in all der papers  at a prize fightvit boys clothes on  you liddle strumpet  you hussy  you  but a flood of tears welled into her eyes and voice and with her fat arms outstretched ungainly ludicrous holy with motherhood she tottered over to the quiet girl and folded her to her breast  she muttered gasping inarticulate lovewords rocking slowly to and fro the while and patting genevieves shoulder with her ponderous hand
