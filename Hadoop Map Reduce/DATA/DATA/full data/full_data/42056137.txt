42056137	ned myers  or a life before the mast  by james fenimore cooper            thou unrelenting past   strong are the barriers round thy dark domain     and fetters sure and fast   hold all that enter thy unbreathing reign                                     bryant   entered according to the act of congress in the year 1843 by  j fenimore cooper  in the clerks office of the district court of the united states for the northern district of new york    preface    it is an old remark that the life of any man could the incidents be faithfully told would possess interest and instruction for the general reader the conviction of the perfect truth of this saying has induced the writer to commit to paper the vicissitudes escapes and opinions of one of his old shipmates as a sure means of giving the public some just notions of the career of a common sailor in connection with the amusement that many will find in following a foremast jack in his perils and voyages however it is hoped that the experience and moral change of myers may have a salutary influence on the minds of some of those whose fortunes have been or are likely to be cast in a mould similar to that of this old salt  as the reader will feel a natural desire to understand how far the editor can vouch for the truth of that which he has here written and to be informed on the subject of the circumstances that have brought him acquainted with the individual whose adventures form the subject of this little work as much shall be told as may be necessary to a proper understanding of these two points  first then as to the writers own knowledge of the career of the subject of his present work in the year 1806 the editor then a lad fresh from yale and destined for the navy made his first voyage in a merchantman with a view to get some practical knowledge of his profession this was the fashion of the day though its utility on the whole may very well be questioned the voyage was a long one including some six or eight passages and extending to near the close of the year 1807 on board the ship was myers an apprentice to the captain ned as myers was uniformly called was a lad as well as the writer and as a matter of course the intimacy of a ship existed between them ned however was the junior and was not then compelled to face all the hardships and servitude that fell to the lot of the writer  once only after the crew was broken up did the writer and ned actually see each other and that only for a short time this was in 1809 in 1833 they were for half an hour on board the same ship without knowing the fact at the time a few months since ned rightly imagining that the author of the pilot must be his old shipmate wrote the former a letter to ascertain the truth the correspondence produced a meeting and the meeting a visit from ned to the editor it was in consequence of the revelations made in this visit that the writer determined to produce the following work  the writer has the utmost confidence in all the statements of ned so far as intention is concerned should he not be mistaken on some points he is an exception to the great rule which governs the opinions and recollections of the rest of the human family still nothing is related that the writer has any reasons for distrusting in a few instances he has interposed his own greater knowledge of the world between neds more limited experience and the narrative but this has been done cautiously and only in cases in which there can be little doubt that the narrator has been deceived by appearances or misled by ignorance the reader however is not to infer that ned has no greater information than usually falls to the share of a foremast hand this is far from being the case when first known to the writer his knowledge was materially above that of the ordinary class of lads in his situation giving ample proof that he had held intercourse with persons of a condition in life if not positively of the rank of gentlemen of one that was not much below it in a word his intelligence on general subjects was such as might justly render him the subject of remark on board a ship although much of his afterlife was thrown away portions of it passed in improvement leaving ned at this moment a man of quick apprehension considerable knowledge and of singularly shrewd comments if to this be added the sound and accurate moral principles that now appear to govern both his acts and his opinions we find a man every way entitled to speak for himself the want of the habit of communicating his thoughts to the public alone excepted  in this book the writer has endeavoured to adhere as closely to the very language of his subject as circumstances will at all allow and in many places he feels confident that no art of his own could in any respect improve it  it is probable that a good deal of distrust will exist on the subject of the individual whom ned supposes to have been one of his godfathers on this head the writer can only say that the account which myers has given in this work is substantially the same as that which he gave the editor nearly forty years ago at an age and under circumstances that forbid the idea of any intentional deception the account is confirmed by his sister who is the oldest of the two children and who retains a distinct recollection of the prince as indeed does ned himself the writer supposes these deserted orphans to have been born out of wedlockthough he has no direct proof to this effectand there is nothing singular in the circumstance of a man of the highest rank that of a sovereign excepted appearing at the font in behalf of the child of a dependant a member of the royal family indeed might be expected to do this to favour one widely separated from him by birth and station sooner than to oblige a noble who might possibly presume on the condescension  it remains only to renew the declaration that every part of this narrative is supposed to be true the memory of ned may occasionally fail him and as for his opinions they doubtless are sometimes erroneous but the writer has the fullest conviction that it is the intention of the old salt to relate nothing that he does hot believe to have occurred or to express an unjust sentiment on the subject of his reformation so far as the tree is to be known by its fruits it is entirely sincere the language deportment habits and consistency of this wellmeaning tar being those of a cheerful and confiding christian without the smallest disposition to cant or exaggeration in this particular he is a living proof of the efficacy of faith and of the power of the holy spirit to enlighten the darkest understanding and to quicken the most apathetic conscience       chapter i    in consenting to lay before the world the experience of a common seaman and i may add of one who has been such a sinner as the calling is only too apt to produce i trust that no feeling of vanity has had an undue influence i love the seas and it is a pleasure to me to converse about them and of the scenes i have witnessed and of the hardships i have undergone on their bosom in various parts of the world meeting with an old shipmate who is disposed to put into proper form the facts which i can give him and believing that my narrative may be useful to some of those who follow the same pursuit as that in which i have been so long engaged i see no evil in the course i am now taking while i humbly trust it may be the means of effecting some little good god grant that the pictures i shall feel bound to draw of my own past degradation and failings contrasted as they must be with my present contentment and hopes may induce some one at least of my readers to abandon the excesses so common among seamen and to turn their eyes in the direction of those great truths which are so powerful to reform and so convincing when regarded with humility and with a just understanding of our own weaknesses  i know nothing of my family except through my own youthful recollections and the accounts i have received from my sister my father i slightly remember but of my mother i retain no distinct impressions the latter must have died while i was very young the former i was in the habit of often seeing until i reached my fifth or sixth year he was a soldier and belonged to the twentythird regimen of foot in the service of the king of great britain1 the fourth son of this monarch prince edward as he was then called or the duke of kent as he was afterwards styled commanded the corps and accompanied it to the british american colonies where it was stationed for many years   i was born in quebec between the years 1792 and 1794 probably in 1793 of the rank of my father in the regiment i am unable to speak though i feel pretty confident he was a commissioned officer he was much with the prince and i remember that on parade where i have often seen him he was in the habit of passing frequently from the prince to the ranksa circumstance that induces my old shipmate to think he may have been the adjutant my father i have always understood was a native of hanover and the son of a clergyman in that country my mother also was said to be a german though very little is now known of her by any of the family she is described to me as living much alone as being occupied in pursuits very different from those of my father and as being greatly averse to the life of a soldier  i was baptized in the church of england and from earliest boyhood have always been given to understand that his royal highness prince edward the father of queen victoria stood for me at the font major walker of the same regiment being the other godfather and mrs walker his wife my godmother my real names are edward robert meyers those received in baptism having been given me by my two sponsors after themselves this christening like my birth occurred in quebec i have however called myself edward or ned myers ever since i took to the sea  before i was old enough to receive impressions to be retained the regiment removed to halifax my father accompanied it and of course his two children my sister harriet and myself were taken to nova scotia of the period of my life that was passed in halifax i retain tolerably distinct recollections more especially of the later years the prince and my father both remained with the regiment for a considerable time though all quitted halifax several years before i left it myself i remember prince edward perfectly well he sometimes resided at a house called the lodge a little out of town and i was often taken out to see him he also had a residence in town he took a good deal of notice of me raising me in his arms and kissing me when he passed our house i would run to him and he would lead me through the streets himself on more than one occasion he led me off and sent for the regimental tailor directing suits of clothes to be made for me after his own taste he was a large man of commanding presence and frequently wore a star on the breast of his coat he was not then called the duke of kent but prince edward or the prince a lady lived with him at the lodge but who she was i do not know  at this time my mother must have been dead for of her i retain no recollection whatever i think my father left halifax some time before the prince major walker too went to england leaving mrs walker in nova scotia for some time whether my father went away with a part of the regiment to which he belonged or not i cannot say but i well remember a conversation between the prince the major and mrs walker in which they spoke of the loss of a transport and of meyerss saving several men this must have been at the time when my father quitted nova scotia to which province i think he never could have returned neither my sister nor myself ever saw him afterwards we have understood that he was killed in battle though when or where we do not know my old shipmate the editor however thinks it must have been in canada as letters were received from a friend in quebec after i had quitted nova scotia inquiring after us children and stating that the effects of my father were in that town and ought to belong to us this letter gave my sister the first account of his death though it was not addressed to her but to those in whose care she had been left this property was never recovered and my shipmate who writes this account thinks there may have been legal difficulties in the way  previously to quitting the province of nova scotia my father placed harriet and myself in the house of a mr marchinton to live this gentleman was a clergyman who had no regular parish but who preached in a chapel of his own he sent us both to school and otherwise took charge of us i am not aware of the precise time when the prince left halifax but it must have been when i was five or six years oldprobably about the year 1798 or 17992  from that time i continued at mr marchintons attending school and busied as is usual with boys of that age until the year 1805 i fear i was naturally disposed to idleness and selfindulgence for i became restive and impatient under the restraints of the schoolmaster and of the gentleman in whose family i had been left i do not know that i had any just grounds of complaint against mr marchinton but his rigorous discipline disgusted me principally i am now inclined to believe because it was not agreeable to me to be kept under any rigid moral restraint i do not think i was very vicious and i know i was far from being of a captious temperament but i loved to be my own master and i particularly disliked everything like religious government mr marchinton moreover kept me out of the streets and it was my disposition to be an idler and at play it is possible he may have been a little too severe for one of my temperament though i fear nature gave me a roving and changeful mind  at that time the english cruisers sent in many american vessels as prizes our house was near the water and i was greatly in the habit of strolling along the wharves whenever an opportunity occurred mr marchinton owning a good deal of property in that part of the town the cambrian frigate had a midshipman a little older than myself who had been a schoolmate of mine this lad whose name was bowen was sent in as the nominal prizemaster of a brig loaded with coffee and i no sooner learned the fact than i began to pay him visits young bowen encouraged me greatly in a wish that now arose within me to become a sailor i listened eagerly to the history of his adventures and felt the usual boyish emulation mr marchinton seemed averse to my following the profession and these visits became frequent and stealthy my wishes most probably increasing in proportion as they seemed difficult of accomplishment  i soon began to climb the rigging of the brig ascending to the mastheads one day mr marchinton saw me quite at the maintruck and calling me down i got a severe flogging for my dexterity and enterprise it sometimes happens that punishment produces a result exactly opposite to that which was intended and so it turned out in the present instance my desire to be a sailor increased in consequence of this very flogging and i now began seriously to think of running away in order to get to sea as well as to escape a confinement on shore that to me seemed unreasonable another prize called the amsterdam packet a philadelphia ship had been sent in by i believe the cleopatra sir robert laurie on board this ship were two american lads apprentices with these boys i soon formed an intimacy and their stories of the sea and their accounts of the states coupled with the restraints i fancied i endured gave rise to a strong desire to see their country as well as to become a sailor they had little to do and enjoyed great liberty going and coming much as they pleased this idleness seemed to me to form the summit of human happiness i did not often dare to play truant and the school became odious to me according to my recollections this desire for a change must have existed near or quite a twelvemonth being constantly fed by the arrival and departure of vessels directly before my eyes ere i set about the concocting of a serious plan to escape  my project was put in execution in the summer of 1805 when i could not have been more than eleven years old if indeed quite as old i was in the market one day and overheard some american seamen who had been brought in conversing of a schooner that was on the point of leaving halifax for new york this vessel belonged to north carolina and had been captured by the driver some time before but had been liberated by a decision of the admiralty court the men i overheard talking about her intended taking their passages back to their own country in the craft this seemed to me a good opportunity to effect my purpose and i went from the market itself down to the schooner the mate was on board alone and i took courage and asked him if he did not want to ship a boy my dress and appearance were both against me as i had never done any work and was in the ordinary attire of a better class lad on shore the mate began to laugh at me and to joke me on my desire to go to sea questioning me about my knowledge i was willing to do anything but perceiving that i made little impression i resorted to bribery prince edward had made me a present before he left halifax of a beautiful little fowlingpiece which was in my own possession and i mentioned to the mate that i was the owner of such an article and would give it to him if he would consent to secrete me in the schooner and carry me to new york this bait took and i was told to bring the fowling piece on board and let the mate see it that night i carried the bribe as agreed on to this man who was perfectly satisfied with its appearance and we struck a bargain on the spot i then returned to the house and collected a few of my clothes i knew that my sister harriet was making some shirts for me and i stole into her room and brought away two of them which were all i could find my wardrobe was not large when i left the house and i had taken the precaution of carrying the articles out one at a time and of secreting them in an empty cask in the yard when i thought i had got clothes enough i made them into a bundle and carried them down to the schooner the mate then cleared out a locker in the cabin in which there were some potatoes and told me i must make up my mind to pass a few hours in that narrow berth too thoughtless to raise any objections i cheerfully consented and took my leave of him with the understanding that i was to be on board again early in the morning  before going to bed i desired a black servant of mr marchintons to call me about daybreak as i desired to go out and pick berries this was done and i was up and dressed before any other member of the family was stirring i lost no time but quitted the house and walked deliberately down to the schooner no one was up on board of her and i was obliged to give the mate a call myself this man now seemed disposed to draw back from his bargain and i had to use a good deal of persuasion before i could prevail on him to be as good as his word he did not like to part with the fowlingpiece but seemed to think it would be fairly purchased could he persuade me to run away at length he yielded and i got into the locker where i was covered with potatoes  i was a good while in this uncomfortable situation before there were any signs of the vessels quitting the wharf i began to grow heartily tired of the confinement and the love of change revived within me in a new form the potatoes were heavy for me to bear and the confined air rendered my prison almost insupportable i was on the point of coming out of prison when the noise on deck gave me the comfortable assurance that the people had come on board and that the schooner was about to sail i could hear men conversing and after a period of time that seemed an age i felt satisfied the schooner was fairly under way i heard a hail from one of the forts as we passed down the harbour and not long after the driver the very sloop of war that had sent the vessel in met her and quite naturally hailed her old prize also all this i heard in my prison and it served to reconcile me to the confinement as everything was right the ship did not detain us and we were permitted to proceed  it was noon before i was released going on deck i found that the schooner was at sea nothing of halifax was visible but a tower or two that were very familiar objects to me i confess i now began to regret the step i had taken and could i have been landed it is probable my roving disposition would have received a salutary check it was too late however and i was compelled to continue in the thorny and difficult path on which i had so thoughtlessly entered i often look back to this moment and try to imagine what might have been my fortunes had i never taken this unlucky step what the prince might have done for me it is impossible to say though i think it probable that after the death of my father i should have been forgotten as seems to have been the case with my sister who gradually fell from being considered and treated as one of the family in which she lived into a sort of upper servant  i have learned latterly that mr marchinton had a great search made for me it was his impression i was drowned and several places were dragged for my body this opinion lasted until news of my being in new york reached the family  my appearance on deck gave rise to a great many jokes between the captain of the schooner and his mate i was a good deal laughed at but not badly treated on the whole my office was to be that of cookby no means a very difficult task in that craft the camboose consisting of two pots set in bricks and the dishes being very simple in the cabin sassafras was used for tea and boiled pork and beef composed the dinner the first day i was excused from entering on the duties of my office on account of seasickness but the next morning i set about the work in good earnest we had a long passage and my situation was not very pleasant the schooner was wet and the seas she shipped would put out my fire there was a deck load of shingles and i soon discovered that these made excellent kindling wood but it was against the rules of the craft to burn cargo and my friend the mate had bestowed a few kicks on me before i learned to make the distinction in other respects i did tolerably well and at the end of about ten days we entered sandy hook  such was my first passage at sea or at least the first i can remember though i understand we were taken from quebec to halifax by water i was not cured of the wish to roam by this experiment though at that age impressions are easily received and as readily lost some idea may be formed of my recklessness and ignorance of such matters at this time from the circumstance that i do not remember ever to have known the name of the vessel in which i left nova scotia change and adventure were my motives and it never occurred to me to inquire into a fact that was so immaterial to one of my temperament to this hour i am ignorant on the subject  the schooner came up and hauled in abreast of fly market she did not come close to the wharf but made fast temporarily at its end outside of two or three other vessels this took place not long after breakfast i set about the preparations for dinner which was ready as usual at twelve oclock while the crew were eating this meal i had nothing to do and seeing a number of boys on the wharf i went ashore landing for the first time in this my adopted country i was without hat coat or shoes my feet having become sore from marching about among the shingles the boys were licking molasses from some hogsheads and i joined in the occupation with great industry i might have been occupied in this manner and in talking with the boys an hour or more when i bethought me of my duty on board on looking for the schooner she was gone her people no doubt thought i was below and did not miss me and she had been carried to some other berth where i did not know i could not find her nor did i ever see her again  such then was my entrance on a new scene had i known enough to follow the wharves doubtless i should have found the vessel but after a short search i returned to the boys and the molasses  that i was concerned at finding myself in a strange place without a farthing in my pocketswithout hat shoes or coat is certainbut it is wonderful how little apprehension i felt i knew nothing and feared nothing while licking the molasses i told the boys my situation and i met with a great deal of sympathy among them the word passed from one to the other that a poor english boy had lost his vessel and did not know where to go to pass the night one promised me a supper and as for lodgings the general opinion seemed to be that i might find a berth under one of the butchers stalls in the adjacent market i had different projects for myself however  there was a family of the name of clark then residing in new york that i had known in halifax i remembered to have heard my sister harriet speaking of them not long before i quitted home and that she said they lived in or near fly market i knew we were at fly market and the name recalled these people i inquired accordingly if any one knew such a family but met with no success in discovering them they were strangers and no one knew them it was now near sunset and i determined to look for these people myself on this errand then i set off walking up the market until i reached maiden lane while strolling along the street i heard a female voice suddenly exclaim lord here is edward myers without anything on him at the next instant susan clark one of the daughters came running into the street and presently i was in the house surrounded by the whole family  of course i was closely questioned and i told the whole truth the clarks were extremely kind to me offering me clothes and desiring to keep me with them but i did not like the family owing to old quarrels with the boys and a certain sternness in the father who had made complaints of my stealing his fruit while in halifax i was innocent and the whole proceeding had made me regard mr clark as a sort of enemy my principal motive in inquiring for the family was to learn where a certain dr heizer3 lived this gentleman was a german who had formerly been in the army and i knew he was then in new york in him i had more confidence and i determined to throw myself on his kindness  after declining a great many offers i got the address of dr heizer and proceeded in quest of his residence just as i was it was moonlight and i went through the streets with boyish confidence my route lay up broadway and my destination was one of its corners and hester street in 1805 this was nearly out of town being near canal street i had been told to look for a bridge which then stood in broadway and which answered for a landmark in my new navigation the bridge i found easily and making inquiries at a house i was told the family i sought lived next door  the heizers were greatly surprised at my appearance i was questioned of course and told them the naked truth i knew concealment would be useless was naturally frank notwithstanding what i had just done and i began to feel the want of friends i was fed and that same evening dr and mrs heizer led me down broadway and equipped me in a neat suit of clothes within a week i was sent regularly to school  i never knew what dr heizer did in relation to my arrival i cannot but think that he communicated the circumstances to mr marchinton who was well known to him though harriet tell me the first intelligence they got of me was of a much later date and came from another source let this be as it might i was kindly treated living in all respects as if i were one of the family there was no son and they all seemed to consider me as one  i remained in this family the autumn of 1805 and the winter and spring of 1806 i soon tired of school and began to play truant generally wandering along the wharves gazing at the ships dr heizer soon learned this and watching me discovered the propensity i still retained for the sea he and mrs heizer now took me aside and endeavoured to persuade me to return to halifax but i had become more and more averse to taking this backward step to own the truth i had fearful misgivings on the subject of floggings and i dreaded a long course of severity and discipline it is certain that while rigid rules of conduct are very necessary to some dispositions there are others with which they do not succeed mine was of the latter class for i think i am more easily led than driven at all events i had a horror of going back and refused to listen to the proposal after a good deal of conversation and many efforts at persuasion dr heizer consented to let me go to sea from new york or affected to consent i never knew which  the leander mirandas flagship in his abortive attempt to create a revolution in spanishamerica was then lying in the hudson and dr heizer who was acquainted with some one connected with her placed me in this ship with the understanding i was to go in her to holland i passed the day on board going up to my new employers house for my meals and to sleep this course of life may have lasted a fortnight when i became heartily tired of it i found i had a mistress now as well as a master the former set me to cleaning knives boots candlesticks and other similar employments converting me into a sort of scullion my pride revolted at this i have since thought it possible all this was done to create disgust and to induce me to return to mr marchinton but it had a very contrary effect  my desire was to be a sailor one sunday i had been on board the ship and after assisting the mate to show the bunting fore and aft i went back to the house here my mistress met me with a double allowance of knives to clean we had a quarrel on the subject i protesting against all such work but to clean the knives i was compelled about half were thrown over the fence into the adjoining yard and cleaning what remained i took my hat went to the doctors and saw no more of my mistress or of the leander    chapter ii    an explanation took place dr and mrs heizer remonstrated about my conduct and endeavoured once more to persuade me to return to mr marchintons a great deal was told me of the kind intentions of that gentleman and concerning what i might expect from the protection and patronage of my godfather the duke of kent i cannot help thinking now that much of the favour which was extended towards me at that early period of life was owing to the circumstance that the prince had consented to stand for me at my baptism he was a great disciplinarianso great indeed i remember to have heard as to cause more than one mutinyand my father being a german and coming from a people that carried military subordination to extremes it is highly probable i was indebted for this compliment to a similarity of tastes between the two i cared little for all this however in 1805 and thought far less of being protected by a prince of the blood royal than of going to sea and especially of escaping from the moral discipline of mr marchinton finding his arguments vain dr heizer sent me to school again where i continued a few months longer  all this time my taste for ships rather increased than diminished at every opportunity i was on the wharves studying the different craft and endeavouring to understand their rig one day i saw a british ensign and while looking at it with a feeling of strong disgust i heard myself called by name a glance told me that i was seen by a halifax man and i ran away under the apprehension that he might by some means seize me and carry me back my feelings on this head were all alive and that very day one of the young ladies said in a melancholy way edouard halifax these girls spoke scarcely any english having been born in martinique and they talked much together in french looking at me occasionally as if i were the subject of their discourse it is probable conscience was at the bottom of this conceit of mine but the latter now became so strong as to induce me to determine to look out for a vessel for myself and be off again with this view i quitted a negro who had been sent with me to market under the pretence of going to school but went along the wharves until i found a ship that took my fancy she was called the sterling and there was a singularly goodlooking mate on her deck of the name of irish who was a native of nantucket the ship was commanded by capt john johnston of wiscasset in maine and belonged to his father and himself  i went on board the sterling and after looking about for some time i ventured to offer myself to mr irish as a boy who wished to ship i was questioned of course but evaded any very close answers after some conversation capt johnston came on board and mr irish told him what i wanted my examination now became much closer and i found myself driven to sheer fabrication in order to effect my purposes during my intercourse with different seagoing lads of halifax i had learned the particulars of the capture of the cleopatra 32 by the french frigate ville de milan 38 and her recapture by the leander 50 which ship captured the ville de milan at the same time i said my father had been a serjeant of marines and was killed in the actionthat i had run away when the ships got in and that i wished to be bound to some american shipmaster in order to become a regularlytrained seaman this story so far imposed on capt johnston as to induce him to listen to my proposals and in part to accept them we parted with an understanding that i was to get my clothes and come on board the vessel  it was twelve at noon when i got back to dr heizers my first business was to get my clothes into the yard a few at a time after which i ate my dinner with the family as soon as we rose from table i stole away with my bundle leaving these kind people to believe i had returned to school i never saw one of them afterwards on my return to new york several years later i learned they had all gone to martinique to live i should not have quitted this excellent family in so clandestine a manner had i not been haunted with the notion that i was about to be sent back to halifax a place i now actually hated  capt johnston received me goodnaturedly and that night i slept and supped at the old coffee house old sliphis own lodgings he seemed pleased with me and i was delighted with him the next day he took me to a slopshop and i was rigged like a sailor and was put in the cabin where i was to begin my service in the regular way a boy named daniel mccoy was in the ship and had been out to russia in her as cabinboy the last voyage he was now to be sent into the forecastle and was ordered to instruct me in my duty  i was now comparatively happy though anxious to be bound to capt johnston and still more so to be fairly at sea the sterling had a good oldfashioned cabin as cabins went in 1806 and i ran about her stateroom rummaged her lockers and scampered up and down her companionway with as much satisfaction as if they had all belonged to a palace dan mccoy was every day on board and we had the accommodations of the ship very much to ourselves two or three days later capt johnston took me to the proper place and i was put under regular indentures to serve until i was twentyone i now felt more confidence in my situation knowing that dr heizer had no legal authority over me the work i did in no manner offended my dignity for it was on shipboard and belonged properly to my duty as a cabinboy  the sterling soon began to take in her cargo she was to receive a freight of flour for cowes and a market not only was the hold filled but the stateroom and cabin leaving barely room to climb over the barrels to reach the berths a place was left just inside of the cabin door for the table passengers were not common in that day while commerce was pushed to the utmost our sails were bending when the consignee followed by another merchant came down to the ship accompanied by a youth who it was understood wished also to be received in the vessel this youth was named cooper and was never called by any other appellation in the ship he was accepted by capt johnston signed the articles and the next day he joined us in sailors rig he never came to the cabin but was immediately employed forward in such service as he was able to perform it was afterwards understood that he was destined for the navy  the very day that cooper joined us was one of deep disgrace to me the small stores came on board for the cabin and dan mccoy persuaded me to try the flavour of a bottle of cherrybounce i did not drink much but the little i swallowed made me completely drunk this was the first time i ever was in that miserable and disgraceful plight would to god i could also say it was the last the last it was however for several years that is some comfort i thank my divine master that i have lived to see the hour when intoxicating liquors have ceased to have any command over me and when indeed they never pass my lips capt johnston did not flog me for this act of folly merely pulling my ears a little and sharply reprimanding me both he and mr irish seeming to understand that my condition had proceeded from the weakness of my head dan was the principal sufferer as to say the truth he ought to have been he was ropesended for his pains  next day the stevedores took the ship in to the stream and the crew came on board the assembling of the crew of a merchantman in that day was a melancholy sight the men came off bearing about them the signs of the excesses of which they had been guilty while on shore some listless and stupid others still labouring under the effects of liquor and some in that fearful condition which seamen themselves term having the horrors our crew was neither better nor worse than that of other ships it was also a sample of the mixed character of the crews of american vessels during the height of her neutral trade the captain chiefmate cook and four of those forward were american born while the secondmate was a portuguese the boys were one scotch and one a canadian and there were a spaniard a prussian a dane and an englishman in the forecastle there was also an englishman who worked his passage having been the cooper of a whaler that was wrecked as dan mccoy was sent forward too this put ten in the forecastle besides the cook and left five aft including the master of another wrecked english vessel whom we took out as a passenger  that afternoon we lifted our anchor and dropped down abreast of governors island where we brought up next day all hands were called to get under way and as soon as the anchor was short the mate told cooper and myself to go up and loose the foretopsail i went on one yardarm and cooper went on the other in a few minutes the second mate came up hallooing to us to avast and laughing cooper was hard at work at the robins and would soon have had his half of the sail down in the top had he been let alone while i was taking the gaskets from the yard with the intention of bringing them carefully down on deck where it struck me they would be quite safe luckily for us the men were too busy heaving and too stupid to be very critical and we escaped much ridicule in a week we both knew better  the ship only got to the quarantine ground that day but in the morning we went to sea our passage was long and stormy the ship was on a bowline most of the time and we were something like forty days from land to land nothing extraordinary occurred however and we finally made the bill of portland the weather came on thick but we found a pilot and ran into st helens roads and anchored the captain got into his boat and taking four men pulled ashore to look for his orders at cowes  that afternoon it cleared off and we found a pilot lying a little outside of us about sunset a manofwars cutter came alongside and mr irish was ordered to muster the crew the english lieutenant who was tolerably bowsed up took his seat behind the cabin table while the men came down and stood in the companionway passage to be overhauled most of the foreigners had gone in the boat but two of the americans that remained were uncommonly finelooking men and were both prime seamen one whose name was thomas cook was a sixfooter and had the air of a thorough seadog he filled the lieutenants eye mightily and cook was very coolly told to gather his dunnage as he was wanted cook pointed to his protection but the lieutenant answeredoh these things are nothinganybody can have one for two dollars in new york you are an englishman and the king has need of your services cook now took out of his pocket a certificate that was signed by sir john beresford stating that thomas cook had been discharged from his maj ship cambrian after a pretty long service in her because he had satisfactorily proved that he was a nativeborn american the lieutenant could not very well dishonour this document and he reluctantly let cook go keeping his protection however he next selected isaac gaines a native new yorker a man whose father and friends were known to the captain but gaines had no discharge like that of cooks and the poor fellow was obliged to rowse up his chest and get into the cutter this he did with tears in his eyes and to the regret of all on board he being one of the best men in the ship we asked the boats crew to what vessel they belonged and they gave us the name of a sixtyfour in the offing but we observed as they pulled away from us that they took the direction of another ship this was the last i ever saw or heard of isaac gaines cook went on with us and one day while in london he went with cooper to somerset house to get an order for some prizemoney to which he was entitled for his service in the cambrian as was shown by his discharge the clerk asked him to leave the certificate and call a day or two later when he would have searched out the amount this was done and cook being now without certificate or protection was pressed on his way back to the ship we never heard of him either such was often the fate of sailors in that day who were with you one day and lost for ever the next  captain johnston did not get back to the ship for fourandtwenty hours he brought orders for us to go up to london and the wind being fair and almost a gale we got under way and were off as soon as possible the next morning we were in the straits of dover the wind light but fair this was at a moment when all england was in arms in anticipation of an invasion from france forty odd sail of vessels of war were counted from our ship as the day dawned that had been cruising in the narrow waters during the night to prevent a surprise  we worked our way up to london with the tides and were carried into london dock where we discharged this was my first visit to the modern babylon of course but i had little opportunity of seeing much i had one or two cruises of a sunday in tow of cooper who soon became a branch pilot in those waters about the parks and west end but i was too young to learn much or to observe much most of us went to see the monument st pauls and the lions and cooper put himself in charge of a beefeater and took a look at the arsenals jewels and armoury he had a rum time of it in his sailor rig but hoisted in a wonderful deal of gibberish according to his own account of his cruise  captain johnston now got a freight for the ship and we hauled into the stream abreast of the dockgates and took in shingle ballast the prussian dane second mate and the english cooper all left us in london we got a philadelphian a chap from maine who had just been discharged from an english manofwar and an irish lad in their places in january we sailed making the best of our way for the straits of gibraltar the passage was stormythe bay of biscay in particular giving us a touch of its qualities it was marked by only two incidents however out of the usual way while running down the coast of portugal with the land in sight we made an armed felucca astern and to windward this vessel gave chase and the captain disliking her appearance we carried hard in order to avoid her the weather was thick and it blew fresh occasionally in squalls whenever it lulled the felucca gained on us we having a very little the advantage in the puffs at length the felucca began to fire and finding that his shot were coming pretty near captain johnston knowing that he was in ballast thought it wisest to heaveto ten minutes after our maintopsail was aback the felucca ranged up close under our lee hailed and ordered us to send a boat with our papers on board her a more rascallylooking craft never gave such an order to an unarmed merchantman as our ship rose on a sea and he fell into the trough we could look directly down upon his decks and thus form some notion of what we were to expect when he got possession of us his people were in red caps and shirts and appeared to be composed of the rakings of such places as gibraltar cadiz and lisbon he had ten long guns and pikes pistols and muskets were plenty with him on the end of each latineyard was a chap on the lookout who occasionally turned his eyes towards us as if to anticipate the gleanings that we should be plundered every one expected and it was quite likely we might be illtreated as soon as we hoveto captain johnston gave me the best spyglass with orders to hand it to cooper to hide the latter buried it in the shingle ballast we in the cabin concealed a bag of guineas so effectually that after all was over we could not find it ourselves  the jollyboat had been stowed in the launch on account of the rough weather we had expected to meet and tackles had to be got aloft before we could hoist it out this consumed some time during which there was a lull the felucca seeing us busy at this work waited patiently until we had got the boat over the side and into the water cooper dan mccoy big dan and spanish joe then got into her and the captain had actually passed his writingdesk into the boat and had his leg on the rail to go over the side himself when a squall struck the ship the men were called out of the boat to clew down the topsails and a quarter of an hour passed in taking care of the vessel by this time the squall had passed and it lightened up a little there lay the felucca waiting for the boat and the men were reluctantly going into the latter again when the commander of the felucca waved his hand to us his craft fell off and filled wingandwing skimming away towards the coast like a duck we stood gaping and staring at her not knowing what to make of this manoeuvre when bang went a heavy gun a little on our weather quarter the shot passed our wake for we had filled our topsail and it went skipping from sea to sea after the felucca turning our eyes in the direction of the report we saw a frigate running down upon the felucca carrying studdingsails on both sides with the water foaming up to her hawseholes as she passed our stern she showed an english ensign but took no other notice of us continuing on after the felucca and occasionally measuring her distance with a shot both vessels soon disappeared in the mist though we heard guns for some time as for ourselves we jogged along on our course wishing good luck to the englishman the felucca showed no ensign the whole day our guineas were found some weeks later in a breadlocker after we had fairly eaten our way down to them  the other adventure occurred very soon after this escape for though the felucca may have had a commission she was a pirate in appearance and most probably in her practices the thick westerly weather continued until we had passed the straits the night we were abreast of cape trafalgar the captain came on deck in the middle watch and hailing the forecastle ordered a sharp lookout kept as we must be running through lord collingwoods fleet the words were hardly out of his mouth when spanish joe sung out sail ho there she was sure enough travelling right down upon us in a line that threatened to take us between the fore and main masts the captain ordered our helm hard up and yelled for cooper to bring up the cabin lantern the youngster made one leap down the ladder just scraping the steps with his heels and was in the mizzen rigging with the light in half a minute that saved us so near was the stranger that we plainly heard the officer of the deck call out to his own quartermaster to port hard aporthard aport and be dd to you hard aport it was and a twodecker came brushing along on our weather beamso near that when she lifted on the seas it seemed as if the muzzles of her guns would smash our rails the sterling did not behave well on this occasion for getting a yaw to windward she seemed disposed to go right into the englishman before she would mind her helm after the manofwar hailed and got our answer her officer quaintly remarked that we were close on board him it blew too fresh for boats and we were suffered to pass without being boarded  the ship proceeded up to carthagena and went in here we were put in quarantine for several days the port was full of heavy ships of war several of which were threedeckers and an arrival direct from london made quite a sensation among them we had divers visits from the officers though i do not know what it all amounted to from carthagena we were sent down the coast to a little place called aguilas where we began to take in a cargo of barilla at night we would discharge our shingle ballast into the water contrary to law and in the day we took in cargo so clear was the water that our nights work might easily be seen next morning lying beneath the ship as we lay in a roadstead it mattered little few vessels touching at the port while at this place there was an alarm of an attack from an english manofwar that was seen in the offing and priests enough turned out to defend an ordinary town  we got about half our freight at this little village and then came down as low as almeria an old moorish town just below cape de gatte for the remainder here we lay several weeks finishing stowing our cargo i went ashore almost every day to market and had an opportunity of seeing something of the spaniards our ship lay a good distance off and we landed at a quarantine station half a mile at least from the watergate to which we were compelled to walk along the beach  one of my journeys to the town produced a little adventure the captain had ordered cooper to boil some pitch at the galley by some accident the pot was capsized and the ship came near being burned a fresh pot was now provided and cooper and dan mccoy were sent ashore at the station with orders to boil down pitch on the land there was no wharf and it was always necessary to get ashore through a surf the bay is merely an elbow half the winds blowing in from the open sea sometimes therefore landing is ticklish work and requires much skill i went ashore with the pitch and proceeded into the town on my errands whilst the two lads lighted their fire and began to boil down when all was ready it was seen there was a good deal of swell and that the breakers looked squally the orders however were to go off on such occasions and not to wait as delay generally made matters worse we got into the boat accordingly and shoved off for a minute or more things went well enough when a breaker took the bows of the jollyboat lifted her nearly on end and turned her keel uppermost one scarcely knows how he gets out of such a scrape we all came ashore however heels over head people pot boat and oars the experiment was renewed less the pitch and a pair of new shoes of mine and it met with exactly the same result on a third effort the boat got through the surf and we succeeded in reaching the ship these are the sorts of scenes that harden lads and make them fond of risks i could not swim a stroke and certainly would have been drowned had not the mediterranean cast me ashore as if disdaining to take a life of so little value to anybody but myself  after lying several weeks at almeria the ship got under way for england again we had fresh westerly gales and beat to and fro between europe and africa for some time when we got a levanter that shoved us out into the atlantic at a furious rate in the straits we passed a squadron of portuguese frigates that was cruising against the algerines it was the practice of these ships to lie at the rock until it blew strong enough from the eastward to carry vessels through the gut when they weighed and kept in the offing until the wind shifted this was blockading the atlantic against their enemies and the mediterranean against their own ships  we had a long passage and were short of salt provisions falling in with an american in the bay of biscay we got a barrel of beef which lasted us in when near the chops of the channel with a light southerly wind we made a sail in our wake that came up with us hand over hand she went nearly two feet to our one the barilla pressing the sterling down into the water and making her very dull more especially in light airs when the stranger got near enough we saw that he was pumping the water running out of his scuppers in a constant stream he was several hours in sight the whole time pumping this ship passed within a cableslength of us without taking any more notice of us than if we had been a milestone she was an english twodecker and we could distinguish the features of her men as they stood in the waist apparently taking breath after their trial at the pumps she dropped a hawsebucket and we picked it up when she was about half a mile ahead of us it had the broadarrow on it and a customhouse officer seeing it some time after was disposed to seize it as a prize  we never knew the name of this ship but there was something proud and stately in her manner of passing us in her distress without so much as a hail it is true we could have done her no good and her object doubtless was to get into dock as soon as possible some thought she had been in action and was going home to repair damages that could not be remedied at sea  soon after this vessel was seen we had proof how difficult it is to judge of a ships size at sea a vessel was made ahead standing directly for us mr irish soon pronounced her a sloop of war half an hour later she grew into a frigate but when she came abeam she showed three tiers of ports being a ninety this ship also passed without deigning to take any notice of us    chapter iii    we made the lands end in fine weather and with a fair wind instead of keeping up channel however our ship hauled in for the land cooper was at the helm and the captain asked him if he knew of any one on board who had ever been into falmouth he was told that philadelphia bill had been pointing out the different headlands on the forecastle and that by his own account he had sailed a long time out of the port this bill was a man of fifty steady trustworthy quiet and respected by every man in the ship he had taken a great liking to cooper whom he used to teach how to knot and splice and other niceties of the calling and cooper often took him ashore with him and amused him with historical anecdotes of the different places we visited in short the intimacy between them was as great as well could be seeing the difference in their educations and ages but even to cooper bill always called himself a philadelphian in appearance indeed he resembled one of those whom we call yankees in america more than anything else  bill was now sent for and questioned he seemed uneasy but admitted he could take the ship into falmouth there was nothing in the way but a rock abreast pendennis castle but it was easy to give that a berth we now learned that the captain had made up his mind to go into this port and ride out the quarantine to which all mediterranean vessels were subject bill took us in very quietly and the ship was ordered up a few miles above the town to a bay where vessels rode out their quarantine the next day a doctors boat came alongside and we were ordered to show ourselves and flourish our limbs in order to make it evident we were alive and kicking there were four men in the boat and as it turned out every one of them recognised bill who was born within a few miles of the very spot where the ship lay and had a wife then living a great deal nearer to him than he desired it was this wifethere happening to be too much of herthat had driven the poor fellow to america twenty years before and which rendered him unwilling to live in his native country by private means bill managed to have some communication with the men in the boat and got their promises not to betray him this was done by signs altogether speaking being quite out of the question  we were near or quite a fortnight in quarantine after which the ship dropped down abreast of the town this was of a saturday and sunday a portion of the crew were permitted to go ashore bill was of the number and when he returned he admitted that he had been so much excited at finding himself in the place that he had been a little indiscreet that night he was very uncomfortable but nothing occurred to molest any of us the next morning all seemed right and bill began to be himself again often wishing however that the anchor was aweigh and the ship turning out of the harbour we soon got at work and began to work down to the mouth of the haven with a light breeze the moment we were clear of the points or headlands we could make a fair wind of it up channel the ship was in stays pretty well down tinder pendennis and the order had been given to swing the head yards bill and cooper were pulling together at the foretopsail brace when the report of a musket was heard quite near the ship bill let go the brace turned as white as a sheet and exclaimed im gone at first the men near him thought he was shot but a gesture towards the boat which had fired explained his meaning the order was given to belay the head braces and we waited the result in silence  the pressgang was soon on board us and its officer asked to have the crew mustered this humiliating order was obeyed and all hands of us were called aft the officer seemed easily satisfied until he came to bill what countryman are you he asked an americana philadelphian answered bill you are an englishman no sir i was born over here across the bay interrupted the officer with a cool smile where your dear wife is at this moment your name is   and you are well known in falmouth get your clothes and be ready to go in the boat  this settled the matter captain johnston paid bill his wages his chest was lowered into the boat and the poor fellow took an affectionate leave of his shipmates he told those around him that his fate was sealed he was too old to outlive a war that appeared to have no end and they would never trust him on shore my foot will never touch the land again he said to cooper as he squeezed his young friends hand and i am to live and die with a ship for my prison  the loss of poor bill made us all sad but there was no remedy we got into the offing and squared away for the river again when we reached london the ship discharged down at limehouse where she lay in a tier of americans for some time we then took in a little ballast and went up opposite to the dock gates once more we next docked and cleaned the ship on the deptford side and then hauled into the wetdock in which we had discharged our flour  here the ship lay part of may all of june and most of july taking in freight for philadelphia as it offered this gave our people a good deal of spare time and we were allowed to go ashore whenever we were not wanted cooper now took me in tow and many a drift i had with him and dan mccoy up to st pauls the parks palaces and the abbey a little accident that happened about this time attached me to cooper more than common and made me more desirous than ever to cruise in his company  i was alone on deck one sunday when i saw a little dog running about on board a vessel that lay outside of us around the neck of this animal some one has fastened a sixpence by a bit of riband rove through a hole i thought this sixpence might be made better use of in purchasing some cherries for which i had a strong longing and i gave chase in attempting to return to our own ship with the dog i fell into the water between the two vessels i could not swim a stroke and i sang out lustily for help as good luck would have it cooper came on board at that precise instant and hearing my outcry he sprang down between the ships and rescued me from drowning i thought i was gone and my condition made an impression on me that never will be lost had not cooper accidentally appeared just as he did ned myerss yarn would have ended with this paragraph i ought to add that the sixpence got clear the dog swimming away with it  i had another escape from drowning while we lay in the docks having fallen overboard from the jollyboat while making an attempt at sculling i forget now how i was saved but then i had the boat and the oar to hold on to in the end it will be seen by what a terrific lesson i finally learned to swim  one sunday we were drifting up around the palace and then it was that i told cooper that the duke of kent was my godfather he tried to persuade me to make a call saying i could do no less than pay this respect to the prince i had half a mind to try my hand at a visit but felt too shy and too much afraid had i done as cooper so strongly urged me to do one cannot say what might have been the consequences or what change might have been brought about in my fortunes4  one day mr irish was in high glee having received a message from captain johnston to inform him that the latter was pressed the captain used to dress in a blue longtog drabbreeches and topboots when he went ashore he thought he could pass for a gentleman from the country said mr irish laughing but them pressgang chaps smelt the tar in his very boots cooper was sent to the rendezvous with the captains desk and papers and the latter was liberated we all liked the captain who was kind and considerate in his treatment of all hands but it was fine fun for us to have the old fellow pressedold fellow of six or eightandtwenty as he was then  about the last of july we left london bound home our crew had again undergone some changes we shipped a second mate a newengland man jim russel left us we had lost bill and another bill a dull irish lad who had gone to spain quitted us also our crew consisted of only spanish joe big dan little dan stephen the kennebunk man cooper a swede shipped in london a man whose name i have forgotten and a young man who passed by the name of davis but who was in truth a son of the pilot who had brought us in and taken us out each time we passed up or down the river this davis had sailed in a coaster belonging to his father and had got pressed in sir home pophams southamerican squadron they made him a midshipman but disliking the sea he was determined to go to america we had to smuggle him out of the country on account of the pressgang he making his appearance on board us suddenly one night in the river  the sterling was shorthanded this passage mustering but four hands in a watch notwithstanding we often reefed in the watch though cooper and little dan were both scarcely more than boys our mates used to go aloft and both were active powerful men the cook too was a famous fellow at a drag in these delicate times when two or three days of watch and watch knock up a set of young men one looks back with pride to a passage like this when fourteen men and boysfour of the latterbrought a good sized ship across the ocean reefing in the watch weathering many a gale and thinking nothing of it i presume half our people on a pinch could have brought the sterling in one of the boys i have mentioned was named john pugh a little fellow the captain had taken as an apprentice in london and who was now at sea for the first time in his life  we had a long passage every inch of the way to the downs was tidework here we lay several days waiting far a wind it blew fresh from the southwesthalf of that summer and the captain was not willing to go out with a foul wind we were surrounded with vessels of war most of the channel fleet being at anchor around us this made a gay scene and we had plenty of music and plenty of saluting one day all hands turnedto together and fired starboard and larboard until we could see nothing but a few mastheads what it all meant i never heard but it made a famous smoke and a tremendous noise  a frigate came in and anchored just ahead of us she lowered a boat and sent a reefer alongside to inform us that she was his majestys ship that she had lost all her anchors but the stream and she might strike adrift and he advised us to get out of her way the captain held on that day however but next morning she came into us sure enough the ships did not get clear without some trouble and we thought it wisest to shift our berth once aweigh the captain thought it best to turn out of the downs which we did working through the straits and anchoring under dungeness as soon as the flood made here we lay until near sunset when we got under way to try our hand upon the ebb i believe the skipper had made up his mind to tide it down to the lands end rather than remain idle any longer there was a sloop of war lying inshore of us a mile or so and just as we stretched out from under the land she began to telegraph with a signal station ashore soon after she weighed and came out also in the middle watch we passed this ship on opposite tacks and learned that an embargo had been laid and that we had only saved our distance by some ten or fifteen minutes this embargo was to prevent the intelligence of the copenhagen expedition from reaching the danes that very day we passed a convoy of transports carrying a brigade from pendennis castle to yarmouth in order to join the main fleet a gunbrig brought us to and came near pressing the swede under the pretence that being allies of his king england had a right to his services had not the man been as obstinate as a bull and positively refused to go i do believe we should have lost him he was ordered into the boat at least halfadozen times but swore he would not budge cooper had a little row with this boarding officer but was silenced by the captain  after the news received from the sloop of war it may be supposed we did not venture to anchor anywhere on english ground keeping the channel we passed the isle of wight several times losing on the flood the distance made on the ebb at length we got a slant and fetched out into the atlantic heading well to the southward however our passage was long even after we got clear the winds carrying us down as low as corvo which island we made and then taking us well north again we had one very heavy blow that forced us to scud the sterling being one of the wettest ships that ever floated when heading up to the sea  when near the american coast we spoke an english brig that gave us an account of the affair between the leopard and the chesapeake though he made his own countrymen come out secondbest bitter were the revilings of mr irish when the pilot told us the real state of the case as was usual with this ships luck we tided it up the bay and river and got safe alongside of the wharf at philadelphia at last here our crew was broken up of course and with the exception of jack pugh my brother apprentice and cooper i never saw a single soul of them afterwards most of them went on to new york and were swallowed up in the great vortex of seamen mr irish i heard died the next voyage he made chief mate of an indiaman he was a prime fellow and fit to command a ship  such was my first voyage at sea for i count the passage round from halifax as nothing i had been kept in the cabin it is true but our work had been of the most active kind the sterling must have brought up and been got under way between fifty and a hundred times and as for tacking waring chappelling round and boxhauling we had so much of it by the channel pilots that the old barky scarce knew which end was going foremost in that day a ship did not get from the forelands up to london without some trouble and great was our envy of the large blocks and light cordage of the colliers which made such easy work for their men we singled much of our rigging the second voyage up the river ourselves and it was a great relief to the people a set of grass foresheets too that we bought in spain got to be great favourites though in the end they cost the ship the life of a very valuable man  captain johnston now determined to send me to wiscasset that i might go to school a wiscasset schooner called the clarissa had come into philadelphia with freight from the west indies and she was about to sail for home in ballast i was put on board as a passenger and we sailed about a week after the ship got in from london jack pugh staid behind the sterling being about to load for ireland on board the clarissa i made the acquaintance of a philadelphian born who was an apprentice to the master of the schooner of the name of jack mallet he was a little older than myself and we soon became intimate and in time were fated to see many strange things in company  the clarissa went by the vineyard sound and the shoals into boston here she landed a few crates and then sailed for wiscasset where we arrived after a pretty long passage i was kindly received by the mother and family of captain johnston and immediately sent to school shortly after we heard of the embargo and the clarissa being laid up jack mallet became one of my schoolmates we soon learned that the sterling had not been able to get out and ere long jack pugh joined our party a little later captain johnston arrived to go into the commercial quarantine with the rest of us  this was the long embargo as sailors called it and it did not terminate until erskines arrangement was made in 1809 all this time i remained in wiscasset at school well treated and if anything too much indulged captain johnston remained at home all this time also and having nothing else to do he set about looking out for a wife we had at school jack pugh jack mallet and bill swett the latter being a lad a little older than myself and a nephew of the captains i was now sixteen and had nearly gotten my growth  as soon as the embargo was removed captain johnston accompanied by swett started for philadelphia to bring the ship round to new york from that place he intended to sail for liverpool where jack pugh and myself were to join him sailing in a ship called the columbia this plan was changed however and we were sent round by sea to join the sterling again in the port where i had first found her  as this was near three years after i had quitted the hel zers so unceremoniously i went to look for them their old neighbours told me they had been gone to martinique about a twelvemonth this was the last intelligence i ever heard of them bill swett was now put into the cabin and jack pugh and myself were sent regularly to duty before the mast we lived in the steerage and had cabin fare but otherwise had the fortunes of foremast jacks our freight was wheat in the lower hold flour betwixt decks and cotton on deck the ship was very deep our crew was good but both our mates were foreigners  nothing occurred until we got near soundings when it came on to blow very heavy from the southward and westward the ship was running under a closereefed maintopsail and foresail with a tremendous sea on just as night set in one harry a prussian came on deck from his supper to relieve the wheel and fetching a lurch as he went aft he brought up against the launch and thence down against our grass foresheet which had been so great a favourite in the london passages this rope had been stretched above the deck load for a ridge rope but being rotten it gave way when the poor prussian struck it and he went into the sea we could do no more than throw him the skylight which was large but the ship went foaming ahead leaving the poor fellow to his fate in the midst of the hissing waters some of our people thought they saw poor harry on the skylight but this could not have made much difference in such a raging sea it was impossible to roundto and as for a boats living it was out of the question this was the first man i saw lost at sea and notwithstanding the severity of the gale and the danger of the ship herself the fate of this excellent man made us all melancholy the captain felt it bitterly as was evident from his manner still the thing was unavoidable  we had begun to shorten sail early in the afternoon and harry was lost in the first dogwatch a little later the larboard foresheet went and the sail was split all hands were called and the rags were rolled up and the gaskets passed the ship now laboured so awfully that she began to leak the swell was so high that we did not dare to come by the wind and the seas would come in just about the main chains meet in board and travel out over her bows in a way to threaten everything that could be moved we lads were lashed at the pumps and ordered to keep at work and to make matters worse the wheat began to work its way into the pumpwell while things were in this state the maintopsail split leaving the ship without a rag of sail on her  the sterling loved to be under water even in moderate weather many a time have i seen her send the water aft into the quarterdeck scuppers and as for diving no loon was quicker than she now that she was deep and was rolling her deckload to the water it was time to think of lightening her the cotton was thrown overboard as fast as we could and what the men could not start the seas did after a while we eased the ship sensibly and it was well we did the wheat choking the pumps so often that we had little opportunity for getting out the water  i do not now recollect at what hour of this fearful night captain johnston shouted out to us all to look outand hold on the ship was broachingto fortunately she did this at a lucky moment and always lyingto well though wet we made much better weather on deck the mizzenstaysail was now set to keep her from falling off into the troughs of the sea still the wind blew as hard as ever first one sail then another got loose and a hard time we had to keep the canvass to the yards then the foretopmast went with a heavy lurch and soon after the main carrying with it the mizzentopgallantmast we owed this to the embargo in my judgment the ships rigging having got damaged lying dry so long we were all night clearing the wreck and the men who used the hatchets told us that the wind would cant their tools so violently that they sometimes struck on the eyes instead of the edge the gale fairly seemed like a hard substance  we passed a fearful night working at the pumps and endeavouring to take care of the ship next morning it moderated a little and the vessel was got before the wind which was perfectly fair she could carry but little sail though we got up topgallantmasts for topmasts as soon as the sea would permit about four i saw the land myself and pointed it out to the mate it was cape clear and we were heading for it as straight as we could go we hauled up to clear it and ran into the irish channel a large fleet of vessels had gathered in and near the chops of the channel in readiness to run into liverpool by a particular day that had been named in the law opening the trade and great had been the destruction among them i do not remember the number of the ships we saw but there must have been more than a hundred it was afterwards reported that near fifty vessels were wrecked on the irish coast almost every craft we fell in with was more or less dismasted and one vessel a ship called the liberty was reported to have gone down with every soul on board her  the weather becoming moderate all hands of us went into liverpool the best way we could the sterling had good luck in getting up though we lay some time in the river before we were able to get into dock when we got out the cargo we found it much damaged particularly the wheat the last was so hot that we could not bear our feet among it we got it all out in a few days when we went into a dry dock and repaired  this visit to liverpool scattered our crew as if it had been so much dust in a squall most of our men were pressed and those that were not ran but one man us boys excepted stuck by the ship the chief matea foreigner though of what country i never could discoverlived at a house kept by a handsome landlady to oblige this lady he ordered william swett and myself to carry a bucketfull of salt each up to her house the salt came out of the harnesscask and we took it ashore openly but we were stopped on the quay by a customhouse officer who threatened to seize the ship such was the penalty for landing two buckets of liverpool salt at liverpool  captain johnston had the matter explained and he discharged the mate next day the discharged man and the second mate were pressed we got the last who was a swede clear and the chief mate in the end made his escape and found his way back to new york among those impressed was jack pugh who having been bound in london we did not dare show his papers the captain tried hard to get the boy clear but without success i never saw poor jack after this though i learn he ran from the marketboat of the guardship made his way back to wiscasset where he stayed some time then shipped and was lost at sea    chapter iv    at length we got a new crew and sailed for home we had several passengers on board masters of american ships who could go back themselves but not carry their vessels with them on account of certain liberties the last had taken with the laws these persons were called embargo captains one of them a captain b kept captain johnstons watch and got so much into his confidence and favour that he gave him the vessel in the end the passage home was stormy and long but offered nothing remarkable a nonimportation law had been passed during our absence and our ship was seized in new york in consequence of having a cargo of english salt we had taken the precaution however to have the salt cleared in liverpool and put afloat before the day named in the law and got clear after a detention of two months salt rose so much in the interval that the seizure turned out to be a good thing for the owners  while the ship was lying off the battery on her return from this voyage and before she had hauled in a boat came alongside with a young man in her in naval uniform this was cooper who in pulling across to go aboard his own vessel had recognised our mastheads and now came to look at us this was the last time i met him until the year 1843 or for thirtyfour years  we now loaded with naval stores and cleared again for liverpool bill swett did not make this voyage with us the cook acting as steward we had good passages out and home experiencing no detention or accidents in the spring of 1810 captain johnston gave the ship to captain b who carried us to liverpool for the third time nothing took place this voyage either worthy of being mentioned the ship getting back in good season we now took in a cargo of staves for limerick off the hook we were broughtto by the indian sloopofwar one of the halifax cruisers a squadron in company several vessels were coming out at the same time and among them were several of the clippers in the french trade the amiable matilda and the colt went to windward of the englishmen as if the last had been at anchor but the tameahmeah when nearest to the english got her yards locked in stays and was captured we saw all this and felt as was natural to men who beheld such things enacted at the mouth of their own port our passages both ways were pleasant and nothing occurred out of the usual course i fell in with a pressgang however in limerick which would have nabbed me but for a party of irishmen who showed fight and frightened the fellows so much that i got clear once before i had been in the hands of these vermin in liverpool but captain johnston had got me clear by means of my indentures i was acting as secondmate this voyage  on our return home the ship was ordered to charleston to get a cargo of yellow pine under a contract captain b was still in command my old master captain johnston being then at home occupied in building a new ship i never saw this kindhearted and indulgent seaman until the year 1842 when i made a journey to wiscasset expressly to see him captain b and myself were never very good friends and i was getting to be impatient of his authority but i still stuck by the ship  we had an ordinary run to charleston and began to prepare for the reception of our cargo at this time there were two french privateers on the southern coast that did a great deal of damage to our trade one went into savannah and got burned for her pains and the other came into charleston and narrowly escaped the same fate a mob collectedmade a fireraft and came alongside of our ship demanding some tar to own the truth though then clothed with all the dignity of a dicky 5 i liked the fun and offered no resistance bill swett had come in in a ship called the united states and he was on board the sterling at the time on a visit to me we two off hatches and whipped a barrel of tar on deck which we turned over to the raftsmen with our hearty good wishes for their success all this was legally very wrong but i still think it was not so very far from being morally just at least as regards the privateersmen the attempt failed however and those implicated were blamed a great deal more than they would have been had they burned up the frenchmens eyebolts it is bad to fail in a legal undertaking but success is indispensable for forgiveness to one that is illegal  that night captain b and the chief mate came down upon me like a gust for having parted with the tar they concluded their lecture by threatening to work me up bill swett was by and he got his share of the dose when we were left to ourselves we held a council of war about future proceedings our crew had run to a man the cook excepted as usually happens in charleston and we brought in the cook as a counsellor this man told me that he had overheard the captain and mate laying a plan to give me a threshing as soon as i had turned in bill now frankly proposed that i should run as well as himself for he had already left his ship and our plan was soon laid bill went ashore and brought a boat down under the bows of the ship and i passed my dunnage into her by going through the forecastle i then left the sterling for ever never putting my foot on board of her again i saw her once or twice afterwards at a distance and she always looked like a sort of home to me she was subsequently lost on the eastern coast captain johnston still owning her and being actually on board her though only as a passenger i had been out in her twelve times from country to country besides several short runs from port to port she always seemed natural to me and i had got to know every timber and stick about her i felt more in quitting this ship than i did in quitting halifax this desertion was the third great error of my life the first was quitting those with whom i had been left by my father the second abandoning my good friends the heizers and the third leaving the sterling had captain johnston been in the ship i never should have dreamed of running he was always kind to me and if he failed in justice it was on the side of indulgence had i continued with him i make no doubt my career would have been very different from what it has since turned out to be and i fear i must refer one of the very bad habits that afterwards marred my fortunes that of drinking too much to this act still it will be remembered i was only nineteen loved adventure and detested captain b  after this exploit swett and i kept housed for a week he then got into a ship called the president and i into another called the tontine and both sailed for new york where we arrived within a few days of each other we now shipped together in a vessel called the jane bound to limerick this was near the close of the year 1811 our passage out was tremendously bad and we met with some serious accidents to our people we were not far from the mouth of the irish channel when the ship broachedto in scudding under the foresail and maintopsail bill swett being at the helm the watch below ran on deck and hauled up the foresail without orders to prevent the ship from going down stern foremost the yards being square as the ship cameto she took a sea in on her starboard side which drove poor bill to leeward under some watercasks and boards beating in two of his ribs both mates were injured also and were off duty in consequence for several weeks the plank sheer was ripped off the vessel from aft to amidships as neatly as if it had been done by the carpenters we could look down among the timbers the same as if the vessel were on the stocks  the men braced up the afteryards and then the ship was lyingto under a closereefed maintopsail after this she did well enough we now passed the hurt below and got tarred canvass over the timberheads and managed to keep out the water next day we made sail for our port it blowing too fresh to get a pilot we ran into a roadstead at the mouth of the shannon and anchored with both bowers we rode out the gale and then went up to limerick here all hands got well and returned to duty in due time we sailed for home in ballast as we came into the hook we were hailed by a gunboat and heard of the little embargo  the question now came up seriously between bill and myself what was best to be done i was for going to wiscasset like two prodigals own our fault and endeavour to amend bill thought otherwise now we were cast ashore without employment he thought it more manly to try and shift for ourselves he had an uncle who was a captain of artillery and who was then stationed on governors island and we took him into our councils this gentleman treated us kindly and kept us with him on the island for two days finding his nephew bent on doing something for himself he gave us a letter to lt trenchard of the navy by whom we were both shipped for the service swett got a mastersmates berth and i was offered the same but felt too much afraid of myself to accept it i entered the navy then for the first time as a common jack  this was a very short time before war was declared and a large flotilla of gunboats was getting ready for the new york station bill was put on board of no 112 and i was ordered to no 107 sailingmaster costigan soon after we were all employed in fitting the essex for sea and while thus occupied the declaration of war actually arrived on this occasion i got drunk for the second time in my life a quantity of whiskey was started into a tub and all hands drank to the success of the conflict a little upset me then nor would i have drunk anything but for the persuasions of some of my wiscasset acquaintances of whom there were several in the ship i advise all young men who feel no desire to drink to follow their own propensities and not to yield themselves up body and soul to the thoughtless persuasions of others there is no real goodfellowship in swilling rum and whiskey but the taste once acquired is hard to cure i never drank much as to quantity but a little filled me with the love of mischief and that little served to press me down for all the more valuable years of my life valuable as to the advancement of my worldly interests though i can scarcely say i began really to live as a creature of gods should live to honour his name and serve his ends until the year 1839  after the essex was fitted out the flotilla cruised in the sound and was kept generally on the lookout about the waters of new york towards the end of the season our boat with several others was lying abreast of the yard when orders came off to meet the yard commander captain chauncey on the wharf here this officer addressed us and said he was about to proceed to lake ontario to take command and asking who would volunteer to go with him this was agreeable news to us for we hated the gunboats and would go anywhere to be quit of them every man and boy volunteered we got twentyfour hours liberty with a few dollars in money and when this scrape was over every man returned and we embarked in a sloop for albany our draft contained near 140 men and was commanded by mr mix then a sailingmaster but who died a commander a few years since messrs osgood and mallaby were also with us and two midshipmen viz messrs sands and livingston the former of these young gentlemen is now a commander but i do not know what became of mr livingston we had also two mastersmates messrs bogardus and emory  on reaching albany we paid a visit to the governor gave him three cheers got some good cheer in return and were all stowed in wagons a mess in each before his door we now took to our land tacks and a merry time we had of it our first days run was to a place called schenectady and here the officers found an empty house and berthed us all together fastening the doors this did not suit our notions of a land cruise and we began to grumble there was a regular hard horse of a boatswainsmate with us of the name of mcnally this man had been in the service a long time and was a thorough manofwars man fie had collected twentyfour of us whom he called his disciples and shamed am i to say i was one mcnally called all hands on the upper deck as he called it that is to say in the garret and made us a speech he said this was no way to treat volunteers and proposed that we should unship the awning we rigged pries and first singing out stand from under hove one half of the roof into the street and the other into the garden we then gave three cheers at our success the officers now came down and gave us a lecture but we made out so good a case that they let us run till morning when every soul was back and mustered in the wagons in this way we went through the country cracking our jokes laughing and noting all oddities that crossed our course i believe we were ten or twelve days working our way through the state to oswego at onondago lake we got into boats and did better than in the wagons at a village on the lake shore the people were very bitter against us and we had some difficulty the word went among us they were scotch from the canadas but of this i know nothing we heard in the morning however that most of our officers were in limbo and we crossed and marched up a hill intending to burn sink and destroy if they were not liberated mischief was prevented by the appearance of mr mix with the other gentlemen and we pushed off without coming to blows  it came on to rain very hard and we fetched up at a solitary house in the woods and tried to get quarters these were denied us and we were told to shift for ourselves this we did in a large barn where we made good stowage until morning in the night we caught the owner coming about with a lantern to set fire to the barn and we carried him down to a boat and lashed him there until morning letting the rain wash all the combustible matter out of him that day we reached oswego falls where a party of us were stationed some time running boats over and carrying stores across the portage  when everything reached oswego all hands turned to to equip some lake craft that had been bought for the service these were schooners salt droggers of about sixty or eighty tons all we did at oswego however was to load these vessels some six or eight in all and put to sea i went off in one of the first a vessel called the fair american having no armaments we sailed in the night to avoid john bulls cruisers of which there were several out at the time as we got in with some islands at no great distance from sacketts harbour we fell in with the oneidas launch which was always kept in the offing at night rowing or sailing guard bill swett was in her and we then met for the first time on fresh water i now learned that jack mallet was on the station too whom i had not fallen in with since we parted at wiscasset more than three years before a fortnight later i found him acting as boatswain of the julia sailingmaster trant a craft i have every reason to remember as long as i shall live  the day after i reached the harbour i was ordered on board the scourge this vessel was englishbuilt and had been captured before the war and condemned for violating the revenue laws under the name of the lord nelson by the oneida 16 lt com woolseythe only cruiser we then had on the lake this craft was unfit for her duty but time pressed and no better offered bulwarks had been raised on her and she mounted eight sixes in regular broadside her accommodations were bad enough and she was so tender that we could do little or nothing with her in a blow it was often prognosticated that she would prove our coffin besides mr osgood who was put in command of this vessel we had mr bogardus and mr livingston as officers we must have had about fortyfive souls on board all told we did not get this schooner out that season however  the commodore arriving and an expedition against kingston being in the wind a party of us volunteered from the scourge to go on board the oneida this was in november rather a latish month for active service on those waters the brig went out in company with the conquest hamilton governor tompkins port julia and growler schooners these last craft were all merchantmen mostly without quarters and scarcely fit for the duty on which they were employed the oneida was a warm little brig of sixteen 24 lb carronades but as dull as a transport she had been built to cross the bars of the american harbours and would not travel to windward  we went off the false ducks where we made the royal george a ship the english had built expressly to overlay the oneida two or three years before and which was big enough to eat us her officers however did not belong to the royal navy and we made such a show of schooners that though she had herself a vessel or two in company she did not choose to wait for us we chased her into the bay of quinté and there we lost her in the darkness next morning however we saw her at anchor in the channel that leads to kingston a general chase now commenced and we ran down into the bay and engaged the ship and batteries as close as we could well get the firing was sharp on both sides and it lasted a great while i was stationed at a gun as her second captain and was too busy to see much but i know we kept our piece speaking as fast as we could for a good bit we drove the royal george from a second anchorage quite up to a berth abreast of the town and it was said that her people actually deserted her at one time we gave her nothing but roundshot from our gun and these we gave her with all our hearts whenever we noticed the shore a stand of grape was added  i know nothing of the damage done the enemy we had the best of it so far as i could see and i think if the weather had not compelled us to haul off something serious might have been done as it was we beat out with flying colours and anchored a few miles from the light  these were the first shot i ever saw fired in anger our brig had one man killed and three wounded and she was somewhat injured aloft one shot came in not far from my gun and scattered lots of cattails breaking in the hammockcloths this was the nearest chance i ran that day and on the whole i think we escaped pretty well on our return to the harbour the ten scourges who had volunteered for the cruise returned to their own schooner none of us were hurt though all of us were half frozen the water freezing as fast as it fell  shortly after both sides went into winter quarters and both sides commenced building we launched a ship called the madison about this time and we laid the keel of another that was named the pike what john bull was about is more than i can say though the next season showed he had not been idle the navigation did not absolutely close notwithstanding until december  our vessels were moored about the harbour and we were all frozen in as a matter of course around each craft however a space was kept cut to form a sort of ditch in order to prevent being boarded parties were regularly stationed to defend the madison and in the days we worked at her rigging and at that of the pike in gangs our larboard guns were landed and placed in a blockhouse while the starboard were kept mounted my station was that of captain of one of the guns that remained  the winter lasted more than four months and we made good times of it we often went after wood and occasionally we knocked over a deer we had a target out on the lake and this we practised on making ourselves rather expert cannoneers now and then they rowsed us out on a false alarm but i know of no serious attempts being made by the enemy to molest us  the lake was fit to navigate about the middle of april somewhere about the 20th6 the soldiers began to embark to the number of 1700 men a company came on board the scourge and they filled us chockablock it came on to blow and we were obliged to keep these poor fellows cramped as we were most of the time on deck exposed to rain and storm on the 25th we got out rather a showy force altogether though there was not much service in our small craft we had a ship a brig and twelve schooners fourteen sail in all the next morning we were off little york having sailed with a fair wind all hands anchored about a mile from the beach i volunteered to go in a boat to carry soldiers ashore each of us brought across the lake two of these boats in tow but we had lost one of ours dragging her after us in a staggering breeze i got into the one that was left and we put half our soldiers in her and shoved off we had little or no order in landing each boat pulling as hard as she could the english blazed away at us concealed in a wood and our men fired back again from the boat i never was more disappointed in men than i was in the soldiers they were mostly tall palelooking yankees half dead with sickness and the bad weatherso mealy indeed that half of them could not take their grog which by this time i had got to think a bad sign as soon as they got near the enemy however they became wide awake pointed out to each other where to aim and many of them actually jumped into the water in order to get the sooner ashore no men could have behaved better for i confess frankly i did not like the work at all it is no fun to pull in under a sharp fire with ones back to his enemy and nothing but an oar to amuse himself with the shot flew pretty thick and two of our oars were split this was all done with musketry no heavy guns being used at this place i landed twice in this way but the danger was principally in the first affair there was fighting up on the bank but it gave us no trouble mr livingston commanded the boat  when we got back to the schooner we found her lifting her anchors several of the smaller craft were now ordered up the bay to open on the batteries nearer to the town we were the third from the van and we all anchored within canister range we heard a magazine blow up as we stood in and this brought three cheers from us we now had some sharp work with the batteries keeping up a steady fire the schooner ahead of us had to cut and she shifted her berth outside of us the leading schooner however held on in the midst of it all we heard cheers down the line and presently we saw the commodore pulling in among us in his gig he came on board us and we greeted him with three cheers while he was on the quarterdeck a hot shot struck the upper part of the afterport cut all the boardingpikes adrift from the mainboom and wounded a man named lemuel bryant who leaped from his quarters and fell at my feet his clothes were all on fire when he fell and after putting them out the commodore himself ordered me to pass him below the old man spoke encouragingly to us and a little thing took place that drew his attention to my crew two of the trucks of the gun we were fighting had been carried away and i determined to shift over its opposite my crew were five negroes strapping fellows and as strong as jackasses the gun was called the black joke shoving the disabled gun out of the way these chaps crossed the deck unhooked the breechings and guntackles raised the piece from the deck and placed it in the vacant port the commodore commended us and called out that is quick work my lads in less than three minutes i am certain we were playing on the enemy with the fresh gun  as for the old man he pulled through the fire as coolly as if it were only a snowballing scrape though many a poor fellow lost the number of his mess in the boats that day when he left us we cheered him again he had not left us long before we heard an awful explosion on shore stones as big as my two fists fell on board of us though nobody was hurt by them we cheered thinking some dire calamity had befallen the enemy the firing ceased soon after this explosion though one english gun held on under the bank for some little time    chapter v    we did not know the cause of the last explosion until after the firing ceased i had seen an awful black cloud and objects in the air that i took for men but little did we imagine the explosion had cost us so dear our schooner lay at no great distance from the common landing and no sooner were we certain of the success of the day than mr osgood ordered his boats crew called away and he landed as i belonged to the boat i had an early opportunity of entering the town  we found the place deserted with the exception of our own men i found but one living being in it this was an old woman whom i discovered stowed away in a potatoe locker in the government house i saw tables set and eggs in the cups but no inhabitant our orders were of the most severe kind not to plunder and we did not touch a morsel of food even the liquor however was too much for our poor natures and a parcel of us had broke bulk in a better sort of grocery when some officers came in and stove the casks i made sail and got out of the company the army had gone in pursuit of the enemy with the exception of a few riflemen who being now at liberty found their way into the place  i ought to feel ashamed and do feel ashamed of what occurred that night but i must relate it lest i feel more ashamed for concealing the truth we had spliced the mainbrace pretty freely throughout the day and the pull i got in the grocery just made me ripe for mischief when we got aboard the schooner again we found a canoe that had drifted athwarthawse and had been secured my guns crew the black jokers wished to have some fun in the town and they proposed to me to take a cruise ashore we had few officers on board and the boatswain a boat swains mate in fact consented to let us leave we all went ashore in this canoe then and were soon alongside of a wharf on landing we were near a large store and looking in at a window we saw a man sitting asleep with a gun in the hollow of his arm his head was on the counter and there was a lamp burning one of the blacks pitched through the window and was on him in a moment the rest followed and we made him a prisoner the poor fellow said he had come to look after his property and he was told no one would hurt him my blacks now began to look about them and to help themselves to such articles as they thought they wanted i confess i helped myself to some tea and sugar nor will i deny that i was in such a state as to think the whole good fun we carried off one canoe load and even returned for a second of course such an exploit could not have been effected without letting all in the secret share and one boatload of plunder was not enough the negroes began to drink however and i was sober enough to see the consequences if they were left ashore any longer some riflemen came in too and i succeeded in getting my jokers away  the recklessness of sailors may be seen in our conduct all we received for our plunder was some eight or ten gallons of whiskey when we got back to the harbour and this at the risk of being flogged through the fleet it seemed to us to be a scrape and that was a sufficient excuse for disobeying orders and for committing a crime for myself i was influenced more by the love of mischief and a weak desire to have it said i was foremost in such an exploit than from any mercenary motive notwithstanding the severity of the orders and one or two pretty sharp examples of punishment inflicted by the commodore the black jokers were not the only plunderers ashore that night one mastersmate had the buttons taken off his coat for stealing a feather bed besides being obliged to carry it back again of course he was a shipped mastersmate  i was ashore every day while the squadron remained in the port our schooner never shifted her berth from the last one she occupied in the battle and that was pretty well up the bay i paid a visit to the gun that had troubled us all so much and which we could not silence for it was under a bank near the landingplace it was a long french eighteen and did better service that day than any other piece of john bulls i think it hulled us several times  i walked over the ground where the explosion took place it was a dreadful sight the dead being so mutilated that it was scarcely possible to tell their colour i saw gunbarrels bent nearly double i think we saw sir roger sheafe the british general galloping across the field by himself a few minutes before the explosion at all events we saw a mounted officer and fired at him he galloped up to the governmenthouse dismounted went in remained a short time and then galloped out of town all this i saw and the old woman in the potatolocker told me the general had been in the house a short time before we landed her account agreed with the appearance of the officer i saw though i will not pretend to be certain it was general sheafe  i ought to mention the kindness of the commodore to the poor of york as most of the inhabitants came back to their habitations the next day the poor were suffering for food our men were ordered to roll barrels of salt meat and barrels of bread to their doors from the government stores that fell into our hands we captured an immense amount of these stores a portion of which we carried away we sunk many guns in the lake and as for the powder that had taken care of itself among other things we took was the body of an english officer preserved in rum which they said was general brocks i saw it hoisted out of the duke of gloucester the manofwar brig we captured at sacketts harbour and saw the body put in a fresh cask i am ashamed to say that some of our men were inclined to drink the old rum  we burned a large corvette that was nearly ready for launching and otherwise did the enemy a good deal of harm the inhabitants that returned were very submissive and thankful for what they received as for the man of the red store i never saw him after the night he was plundered nor was anything ever said of the scrape  our troops had lost near three hundred men in the attack the wounded included and as a great many of these green soldiers were now sick from exposure the army was much reduced in force we took the troops on board on the 1st of may but could not sail on account of a gale until the 8th which made the matter worse then we got under way and crossed the lake landing the soldiers a few miles to the eastward of fort niagara our schooner now went to the harbour along with the commodore though some of the craft remained near the head of the lake here we took in another lot of soldiers placed two more large batteaux in tow and sailed for the army again we had good passages both ways and this duty was done within a few days while at the harbour i got a message to go and visit bill swett but the poor fellow died without my being able to see him i heard he was hurt at york but never could come at the truth  on the 27th may the army got into the batteaux formed in two divisions and commenced pulling towards the mouth of the niagara the morning was foggy with a light wind and the vessels getting under way kept company with the boats a little outside of them the schooners were closest in and some of them opened on fort george while others kept along the coast scouring the shore with grape and canister as they moved ahead the scourge came to an anchor a short distance above the place selected for the landing and sprung her broadside to the shore we now kept up a steady fire with grape and canister until the boats had got inshore and were engaged with the enemy when we threw roundshot over the heads of our own men upon the english as soon as colonel scott was ashore we sprung our broadside upon a twogun battery that had been pretty busy and we silenced that among us this affair for our craft was nothing like that of york though i was told the vessels nearer the river had warmer berths of it we had no one hurt though we were hulled once or twice a little rigging was cut but we set this down as light work compared to what the old black joke had seen that day month there was a little sharp fighting ashore but our men were too strong for the enemy when they could fairly get their feet on solid ground  just after we had anchored mr bogardus was sent aloft to ascertain if any enemy were to be seen at first he found nobody but after a little while he called out to have my gun fired at a little thicket of brushwood that lay on an inclined plain near the water mr osgood came and elevated the gun and i touched it off we had been looking out for the blink of muskets which was one certain guide to find a soldier and the moment we sent this grist of grape and canister into those bushes the place lighted up as if a thousand muskets were there we then gave the chaps the remainder of our broadside we peppered that wood well and did a good deal of harm to the troops stationed at the place  the wind blew on shore and began to increase and the commodore now threw out a signal for the boats to land to take care of the batteaux that were thumping on the beach and then for their crews to assist in taking care of the wounded of course i went in my own boat mr bogardus having charge of her we left the schooner just as we quitted our guns black with powder in our shirts and trowsers though we took the precaution to carry our boardingbelts with a brace of pistols each and a cutlass on landing we first hauled up the boats taking some dead and wounded men out of them and laying them on the beach  we were now ordered to divide ourselves into groups of three and go over the ground pick up the wounded and carry them to a large house that had been selected as a hospital my party consisted of bill southard simeon grant and myself we being messmates the first man we fell in with was a young english soldier who was seated on the bank quite near the lake he was badly hurt and sat leaning his head on his hands he begged for water and i took his cap down to the lake and filled it giving him a drink then washing his face this revived him and he offered us his canteen in which was some excellent jamaica to us chaps who got nothing better than whiskey this was a rare treat and we emptied the remainder of his half pint at a pull apiece after tapping this rum we carried the poor lad up to the house and turned him over to the doctors we found the rooms filled with wounded already and the american and english doctors hard at work on them  as we left the hospital we agreed to get a canteen apiece and go round among the dead and fill them with jamaica when our canteens were about a third full we came upon a young american rifleman who was lying under an appletree he was hit in the head and was in a very bad way we were all three much struck with the appearance of this young man and i now remember him as one of the handsomest youths i had ever seen his wound did not bleed though i thought the brains were oozing out and i felt so much sympathy for him that i washed his hurt with the rum i fear i did him harm but my motive was good bill southard ran to find a surgeon of whom several were operating out on the field the young man kept saying no use and he mentioned father and mother vermont he even gave me the names of his parents but i was too much in the wind from the use of rum to remember them we might have been half an hour with this young rifleman busy on him most of the time when he murmured a few words gave me one of the sweetest smiles i ever saw on a mans face and made no more signs of life i kept at work notwithstanding until bill got back with the doctor the latter cast an eye on the rifleman pronounced him dead and coolly walked away  there was a bridge in a sort of a swamp that we had fired on for some time and we now moved down to it just to see what we had done we found a good many dead and several horses in the mire but no wounded we kept emptying canteens as we went along until our own would hold no more on our return from the bridge we went to a brook in order to mix some grog and then we got a full view of the offing not a craft was to be seen everything had weighed and disappeared this discovery knocked us all aback and we were quite at a loss how to proceed we agreed however to pass through a bit of woods and get into the town it being now quite late in the day there we knew we should find the army and might get tidings of the fleet the battleground was now nearly deserted and to own the truth we were all three at least two sheets in the wind still i remember everything for my stomach would never allow me to get beastly drunk it rejecting any very great quantity of liquor as we went through the wood open pine trees we came across an officer lying dead with one leg over his horse which was dead also i went up to the body turned it over and examined it for a canteen but found none we made a few idle remarks and proceeded  in quitting the place i led the party and as we went through a little thicket i heard female voices this startled me a little and on looking round i saw a white female dress belonging to a person who was evidently endeavouring to conceal herself from us i was now alone and walked up to the women when i found two one a lady in dress and manner and the other a person that i have always supposed was her servant the first was in white the last in a dark calico they were both under thirty judging from their looks and the lady was exceedingly welllooking they were much alarmed and as i came up the lady asked me if i would hurt her i told her no and that no person should harm her while she remained with us this relieved her and she was able to give an account of her errand on the field of battle our looks half intoxicated and begrimed with the smoke of a battle as we were certainly were enough to alarm her but i do not think one of the three would have hesitated about fighting for a female that they thus found weeping in this manner in the open field the maid was crying also simeon grant and southard did make use of some improper language at first but i brought them up and they said they were sorry and would go all lengths with me to protect the women the fact was these men supposed we had fallen in with common camp followers but i had seen too much of officers wives in my boyhood not to know that this was one  the lady then told her story she had just come from kingston to join her husband having arrived but a few hours before she did not see her husband but she had heard he was left wounded on the field and she had come out in the hope of finding him she then described him as an officer mounted with a particular dress and inquired if we had met with any such person on the field we told her of the horseman we had just left and led her back to the spot the moment the lady saw the body she threw herself on it and began to weep and mourn over it in a very touching manner the maid too was almost as bad as the mistress we were all so much affected in spite of the rum that i believe all three of us shed tears we said all we could to console her and swore we would stand by her until she was safe back among her friends  it was a good bit before we could persuade the lady to quit her husbands body she took a miniature from his neck and i drew his purse and watch from him and handed them to her she wanted me to keep the purse but this we all three refused up and down we had hauled our manly tacks aboard and had no thoughts of plunder even the maid urged us to keep the money but we would have nothing to do with it i shall freely own my faults i hope i shall be believed when i relate facts that show i am not altogether without proper feelings  the officer had been hit somewhere about the hip and the horse must have been killed by another grapeshot fired from the same gun we laid the body of the first over in such a manner as to get a good look at him but we did not draw the leg from under the horse7  when we succeeded in persuading the lady to quit her husbands body we shaped our course for the lighthouse glad were we three tars to see the mastheads of the shipping in the river as we came near the banks of the niagara the house at the light was empty but on my hailing a womans voice answered from the cellar it was an old woman who had taken shelter from shot down in the hold the rest of the family having slipped and run we now got some milk for the lady who continued in tears most of the time sometimes she would knock off crying for a bit when she seemed to have some distrust of us but on the whole we made very good weather in company after staying about half an hour at the lighthouse we left it for the town my advice to the lady being to put herself under the protection of some of our officers i told her if the news of what had happened reached the commodore she might depend on her husbands being buried with the honours of war and said such other things to comfort her as came to the mind of a man who had been sailing so near the wind  i forgot to relate one part of the adventure before we had got fairly clear of the woods we fell in with four of forsyths men notoriously the wickedest corps in the army these fellows began to crack their jokes at the expense of the two females and we came near having a brush with them when we spoke of our pistols and of our determination to use them before we would let our convoy come to harm these chaps laughed at our popguns and told us they had such things as rifles this was true enough and had we come to broadsides i make no doubt they would have knocked us over like so many snipes i began to reason with them on the impropriety of offending respectable females and one of the fellows who was a kind of corporal or something of that sort shook my hand said i was right and offered to be friends so we spliced the mainbrace and parted glad enough was the lady to be rid of them so easily in these squalls she would bring up in her tears and then when all went smooth again she would break out afresh  after quitting the light we made the best of our way for the town just as we reached it we fell in with a party of soldierofficers and we turned the lady and her woman over to their care these gentlemen said a good word in our favour and here we parted company with our convoy never hearing or seeing anything of either afterwards  by this time it was near dark and bill southard and i began to look out for the scourge she was anchored in the river with the rest of the fleet and we went down upon a wharf to make a signal for a boat on the way we saw a woman crying before a watchmakers shop and a party of forsyths close by on enquiry we learned these fellows had threatened to rob her shop we had been such defenders of the sex that we could not think of deserting this woman and we swore we would stand by her too we should have had a skirmish here i do believe had not one or two rifle officers hove in sight when the whole party made sail from us we turned the woman over to these gentlemen who said ay there are some of our vagabonds again one of them said it would be better to call in their parties and before we reached the water we heard the bugle sounding the recall  they had given us up on board the schooner a report of some indians being out had reached her and we three were set down as scalped thank god ive got all the hair on my head yet and battered as my old hulk has got to be and shattered as are my timbers it is as black as a ravens wing at this moment this my old shipmate who is logging this yarn says he thinks is a proof my mother was a french canadian though such is not the fact as it has been told to me  those riflemen were regular scamps just before we went down to the wharf we saw one walking sentinel before the door of a sort of barracks on drawing near and asking what was going on inside we were told we had nothing to do with their fun ashore that we might look in at a window however but should not go in we took him at his word a merry scene it was inside the english officers dunnage had been broken into and there was a party of the corps strutting about in uniform coats and feathers we thought it best to give these daredevils a berth and so we left them one was never safe with them on the field of battle friend or enemy  we met a large party of marines on the wharf marching up under major smith they were going to protect the people of the town from further mischief mr osgood was glad enough to see us and we got plenty of praise for what we had done with the women as for the canteens we had to empty them after treating the crew of the boat that was sent to take us off i did not enter the town after that night  we lay some time in the niagara the commodore going to the harbour to get the pike ready captain crane took the rest of us off kingston where we were joined by the commodore and made sail again for the niagara here colonel scott embarked with a body of troops and we went to burlington bay to carry the heights they were found to be too strong and the men after landing returned to the vessels we then went to york again and took possession of the place a second time here we destroyed several boats and stores set fire to the barracks and did the enemy a good deal of damage otherwise after which we left the place two or three days later we crossed the lake and landed the soldiers again at fort niagara  early in august while we were still in the river sir james yeo hove in sight with two ships two brigs and two schooners we had thirteen sail in all such as they were and immediately got under way and manoeuvred for the weathergauge all the enemys vessels had regular quarters and the ships were stout craft our squadron sailed very unequally some being pretty fast and others as dull as droggers nor were we more than half fitted out on board the scourge the only squaresail we had was made out of an english marquée we had laid our hands on at york the first time we were there i ought to say too that we got two small brass guns at york fourpounders i believe which mr osgood clapped into our two spare ports forward this gave us ten guns in all sixes and fours i remember that jack mallet laughed at us heartily for the fuss we made with our popguns as he called them while we were working upon the english batteries saying we might just as well have spared our powder as for any good we did he belonged to the julia which had a long thirtytwo forward which they called the old sow and one smart eighteen aft she had two sixes in her waist also but they disdained to use them  while we were up at the harbour the last time mr mix who had married a sister of mr osgood took a party of us in a boat and we went up black river shooting the two gentlemen landed and as we were coming down the river we saw something swimming which proved to be a bear we had no arms but we pulled over the beast and had a regular squawfight with him we were an hour at work with this animal the fellow coming very near mastering us i struck at his nose with an iron tiller fifty times but he warded the blow like a boxer he broke our boathook and once or twice he came near boarding us at length a woodboat gave us an axe and with this we killed him mr osgood had this bear skinned and said he should send the skin to his family if he did it must have been one of the last memorials it ever got from him    chapter vi    i left the two fleets manoeuvring for the wind in the last chapter about nine oclock the pike got abeam of the wolfe sir james yeos own ship hoisted her ensign and fired a few guns to try the range of her shot the distance was too great to engage at this time our sternmost vessels were two leagues off and the commodore wore round and hauled up on the other tack the enemy did the same but perceiving that our leading ships were likely to weather on him he tacked and hauled off to the northward we stood on in pursuit tacking too but the wind soon fell and about sunset it was quite calm  throughout the day the scourge had as much as she could do to keep anywhere near her station as for the old oneida she could not be kept within a long distance of her proper berth we were sweeping at odd times for hours that day towards evening all the light craft were doing the same to close with the commodore our object was to get together lest the enemy should cut off some of our small vessels during the night  before dark the whole line was formed again with the exception of the oneida which was still astern towing she ought to have been near the commodore but could not get there a little before sunset mr osgood ordered us to pull in our sweeps and to take a spell it was a lovely evening not a cloud visible and the lake being as smooth as a lookingglass the english fleet was but a short distance to the northward of us so near indeed that we could almost count their ports they were becalmed like ourselves and a little scattered  we took in our sweeps as ordered laying them athwart the deck in readiness to be used when wanted the vessels ahead and astern of us were generally within speaking distance just as the sun went below the horizon george turnblatt a swede who was our gunner came to me and said he thought we ought to secure our guns for we had been cleared for action all day and the crew at quarters we were still at quarters in name but the petty officers were allowed to move about and as much license was given to the people as was wanted i answered that i would gladly secure mine if he would get an order for it but as we were still at quarters and there lay john bull we might get a slap at him in the night on this the gunner said he would go aft and speak to mr osgood on the subject he did so but met the captain as we always called mr osgood at the break of the quarterdeck when george had told his errand the captain looked at the heavens and remarked that the night was so calm there could be no great use in securing the guns and the english were so near we should certainly engage if there came a breeze that the men would sleep at their quarters of course and would be ready to take care of their guns but that he might catch a turn with the sidetacklefalls around the pommelions of the guns which would be sufficient he then ordered the boatswain to call all hands aft to the break of the quarterdeck  as soon as the people had collected mr osgood saidyou must be pretty well fagged out men i think we may have a hard nights work yet and i wish you to get your suppers and then catch as much sleep as you can at your guns he then ordered the pursers steward to splice the mainbrace these were the last words i ever heard from mr osgood as soon as he gave the order he went below leaving the deck in charge of mr bogardus all our old crew were on board but mr livingston who had left us and simeon grant one of my companions in the cruise over the battleground at fort george grant had cut his hand off in a sawmill while we were last at the harbour and had been left behind in the hospital there was a pilot on board who used to keep a lookout occasionally and sometimes the boatswain had the watch  the schooner at this time was under her mainsail jib and foretopsail the foresail was brailed and the foot stopped and the flyingjib was stowed none of the halyards were racked nor sheets stoppered this was a precaution we always took on account of the crafts being so tender  we first spliced the mainbrace and then got our suppers eating between the guns where we generally messed indeed one of my messmates tom goldsmith was captain of the gun next to me and as we sat there finishing our suppers i says to him tom bring up that rug that you pinned at little york and that will do for both of us to stow ourselves away under tom went down and got the rug which was an article for the camp that he had laid hands on and it made us a capital bedquilt as all hands were pretty well tired we lay down with our heads on shotboxes and soon went to sleep  in speaking of the canvass that was set i ought to have said something of the state of our decks the guns had the sidetackles fastened as i have mentioned there was a box of canister and another of grape at each gun besides extra stands of both under the shotracks there was also one grummet of roundshot at every gun besides the racks being filled each guns crew slept at the gun and its opposite thus dividing the people pretty equally on both sides of the deck those who were stationed below slept below i think it probable that as the night grew cool as it always does on the fresh waters some of the men stole below to get warmer berths this was easily done in that craft as we had but two regular officers on board the acting boatswain and gunner being little more than two of ourselves  i was soon asleep as sound as if lying in the bed of a king how long my nap lasted or what took place in the interval i cannot say i awoke however in consequence of large drops of rain falling on my face tom goldsmith awoke at the same moment when i opened my eyes it was so dark i could not see the length of the deck i arose and spoke to tom telling him it was about to rain and that i meant to go down and get a nip out of a little stuff we kept in our messchest and that i would bring up the bottle if he wanted a taste tom answered this is nothing were neither pepper nor salt one of the black men spoke and asked me to bring up the bottle and give him a nip too all this took half a minute perhaps i now remember to have heard a strange rushing noise to windward as i went towards the forward hatch though it made no impression on me at the time we had been lying between the starboard guns which was the weather side of the vessel if there were any weather side to it there not being a breath of air and no motion to the water and i passed round to the larboard side in order to find the ladder which led up in that direction the hatch was so small that two men could not pass at a time and i felt my way to it in no haste one hand was on the bitts and a foot was on the ladder when a flash of lightning almost blinded me the thunder came at the next instant and with it a rushing of winds that fairly smothered the clap  the instant i was aware there was a squall i sprang for the jibsheet being captain of the forecastle i knew where to find it and throw it loose at a jerk in doing this i jumped on a man named leonard lewis and called on him to lend me a hand i next let fly the larboard or lee topsailsheet got hold of the clewline and assisted by lewis got the clew half up all this time i kept shouting to the man at the wheel to put his helm hard down the water was now up to my breast and i knew the schooner must go over lewis had not said a word but i called out to him to shift for himself and belaying the clewline in hauling myself forward of the foremast i received a blow from the jibsheet that came near breaking my left arm i did not feel the effect of this blow at the time though the arm has since been operated on to extract a tumour produced by this very injury  all this occupied less than a minute the flashes of lightning were incessant and nearly blinded me our decks seemed on fire and yet i could see nothing i heard no hail no order no call but the schooner was filled with the shrieks and cries of the men to leeward who were lying jammed under the guns shotboxes shot and other heavy things that had gone down as the vessel fell over the starboard second gun from forward had capsized and come down directly over the forward hatch and i caught a glimpse of a man struggling to get past it apprehension of this gun had induced me to drag myself forward of the mast where i received the blow mentioned  i succeeded in hauling myself up to windward and in getting into the schooners forechannels here i met william deer the boatswain and a black boy of the name of philips who was the powderboy of our gun deer shes gone i said the boatswain made no answer but walked out on the forerigging towards the masthead he probably had some vague notion that the schooners masts would be out of water if she went down and took this course as the safest the boy was in the chains the last i saw of him  i now crawled aft on the upper side of the bulwarks amid a most awful and infernal din of thunder and shrieks and dazzling flashes of lightning the wind blowing all the while like a tornado when i reached the port of my own gun i put a foot in thinking to step on the muzzle of the piece but it had gone to leeward with all the rest and i fell through the port until i brought up with my arms i struggled up again and continued working my way aft as i got abreast of the mainmast i saw some one had let run the halyards i soon reached the beckets of the sweeps and found four in them i could not swim a stroke and it crossed my mind to get one of the sweeps to keep me afloat in striving to jerk the becket clear it parted and the forward ends of the four sweeps rolled down the schooners side into the water this caused the other ends to slide and all the sweeps got away from me i then crawled quite aft as far as the fashionpiece the water was pouring down the cabin companionway like a sluice and as i stood for an instant on the fashionpiece i saw mr osgood with his head and part of his shoulders through one of the cabin windows struggling to get out he must have been within six feet of me i saw him but a moment by means of a flash of lightning and i think he must have seen me at the same time there was a man visible on the end of the mainboom holding on by the clew of the sail i do not know who it was this man probably saw me and that i was about to spring for he called out dont jump overboarddont jump overboard the schooner is righting  i was not in a state of mind to reflect much on anything i do not think more than three or four minutes if as many had passed since the squall struck us and there i was standing on the vessels quarter led by providence more than by any discretion of my own it now came across me that if the schooner should right she was filled and must go down and that she might carry me with her in the suction i made a spring therefore and fell into the water several feet from the place where i had stood it is my opinion the schooner sunk as i left her i went down some distance myself and when i came up to the surface i began to swim vigorously for the first time in my life i think i swam several yards but of course will not pretend to be certain of such a thing at such a moment until i felt my hand hit something hard i made another stroke and felt my hand pass down the side of an object that i knew at once was a clincherbuilt boat i belonged to this boat and i now recollected that she had been towing astern until that instant i had not thought of her but thus was i led in the dark to the best possible means of saving my life i made a grab at the gunwale and caught it in the sternsheets had i swum another yard i should have passed the boat and missed her altogether i got in without any difficulty being all alive and much excited  my first look was for the schooner she had disappeared and i supposed she was just settling under water it rained as if the floodgates of heaven were opened and it lightened awfully it did not seem to me that there was a breath of air and the water was unruffled the effects of the rain excepted all this i saw as it might be at a glance but my chief concern was to preserve my own life i was cockswain of this very boat and had made it fast to this taffrail that same afternoon with a round turn and two halfhitches by its best painter of course i expected the vessel would drag the boat down with her for i had no knife to cut the painter there was a gangboard in the boat however which lay fore and aft and i thought this might keep me afloat until some of the fleet should pick me up to clear this gangboard then and get it into the water was my first object i ran forward to throw off the lazypainter that was coiled on its end and in doing this i caught the boats painter in my hand by accident a pull satisfied me that it was all clear some one on board must have cast off this painter and then lost his chance of getting into the boat by an accident at all events i was safe and i now dared to look about me  my only chance of seeing was during the flashes and these left me almost blind i had thrown the gangboard into the water and i now called out to encourage the men telling them i was in the boat i could hear many around me and occasionally i saw the heads of men struggling in the lake there being no proper place to scull in i got an oar in the after rullock and made out to scull a little in that fashion i now saw a man quite near the boat and hauling in the oar made a spring amidships catching this poor fellow by the collar he was very near gone and i had a great deal of difficulty in getting him in over the gunwale our joint weight brought the boat down so low that she shipped a good deal of water this turned out to be leonard lewis the young man who had helped me to clew up the foretopsail he could not stand and spoke with difficulty i asked him to crawl aft out of the water which he did lying down in the sternsheets  i now looked about me and heard another leaning over the gunwale i got a glimpse of a man struggling quite near the boat i caught him by the collar too and had to drag him in very much in the way i had done with lewis this proved to be lemuel bryant the man who had been wounded by a hot shot at york as already mentioned while the commodore was on board us his wound had not yet healed but he was less exhausted than lewis he could not help me however lying down in the bottom of the boat the instant he was able  for a few moments i now heard no more in the water and i began to scull again by my calculation i moved a few yards and must have got over the spot where the schooner went down here in the flashes i saw many heads the men swimming in confusion and at random by this time little was said the whole scene being one of fearful struggling and frightful silence it still rained but the flashes were less frequent and less fierce they told me afterwards in the squadron that it thundered awfully but i cannot say i heard a clap after i struck the water the next man caught the boat himself it was a mulatto from martinique who was mr osgoods steward and i helped him in he was much exhausted though an excellent swimmer but alarm nearly deprived him of his strength he kept saying oh masser nedoh masser ned and lay down in the bottom of the boat like the two others i taking care to shove him over to the larboard side so as to trim our small craft  i kept calling out to encourage the swimmers and presently i heard a voice saying ned im here close by you this was tom goldsmith a messmate and the very man under whose rug i had been sleeping at quarters he did not want much help getting in pretty much by himself i asked him if he were able to help me yes ned he answered ill stand by you to the last what shall i do i told him to take his tarpaulin and to bail the boat which by this time was a third full of water this he did while i sculled a little ahead ned says tom shes gone down with her colours flying for her pennant came near getting a round turn about my body and carrying me down with her davy has made a good haul and he gave us a close shave but he didnt get you and me in this manner did this thoughtless sailor express himself as soon as rescued from the grasp of death seeing something on the water i asked tom to take my oar while i sprang to the gunwale and caught mr bogardus the masters mate who was clinging to one of the sweeps i hauled him in and he told me he thought some one had hold of the other end of the sweep it was so dark however we could not see even that distance i hauled the sweep along until i found ebenezer duffy a mulatto and the ships cook he could not swim a stroke and was nearly gone i got him in alone tom bailing lest the boat which was quite small should swamp with us  as the boat drifted along she reached another man whom i caught also by the collar i was afraid to haul this person in amidships the boat being now so deep and so small and so i dragged him ahead and hauled him in over the bows this was the pilot whose name i never knew he was a lakeman and had been aboard us the whole summer the poor fellow was almost gone and like all the rest with the exception of tom he lay down and said not a word  we had now as many in the boat as it would carry and tom and myself thought it would not do to take in any more it is true we saw no more everything around us appearing still as death the pattering of the rain excepted tom began to bail again and i commenced hallooing i sculled about several minutes thinking of giving others a tow or of even hauling in one or two more after we got the water out of the boat but we found no one else i think it probable i sculled away from the spot as there was nothing to guide me i suppose however that by this time all the scourges had gone down for no more were ever heard from  tom goldsmith and myself now put our heads together as to what was best to be done we were both afraid of falling into the enemys hands for they might have bore up in the squall and run down near us on the whole however we thought the distance between the two squadrons was too great for this at all events something must be done at once so we began to row in what direction even we did not know it still rained as hard as it could pour though there was not a breath of wind the lightning came now at considerable intervals and the gust was evidently passing away towards the broader parts of the lake while we were rowing and talking about our chance of falling in with the enemy tom cried out to me to avastpulling he had seen a vessel by a flash and he thought she was english from her size as he said she was a schooner however i thought it must be one of our own craft and got her direction from him at the next flash i saw her and felt satisfied she belonged to us before we began to pull however we were hailed boat ahoy i answered if you pull another stroke ill fire into youcame backwhat boats that lay on your oars or ill fire into you it was clear we were mistaken ourselves for an enemy and i called out to know what schooner it was no answer was given though the threat to fire was repeated if we pulled another stroke i now turned to tom and said i know that voicethat is old trant tom thought we were in the wrong shop i now sung out this is the scourges boatour schooner has gone down and we want to come alongside a voice next called from the schooneris that you ned this i knew was my old shipmate and schoolfellow jack mallet who was acting as boatswain of the julia the schooner commanded by sailingmaster james trant one of the oddities of the service and a man with whom the blow often came as soon as the word i had known mr trants voice and felt more afraid he would fire into us than i had done of anything which had occurred that fearful night mr trant himself now called outohho give way boys and come alongside this we did and a very few strokes took us up to the julia where we were received with the utmost kindness the men were passed out of the boat while i gave mr trant an account of all that had happened this took but a minute or two  mr trant now inquired in what direction the scourge had gone down and as soon as i had told him in the best manner i could he called out to jack malletohho mallettake four hands and go in the boat and see what you can dotake a lantern and i will show a light on the waters edge so you may know me mallet did as ordered and was off in less than three minutes after we got alongside mr trant who was much humoured had no officer in the julia unless mallet could be called one he was an irishman by birth but had been in the american navy ever since the revolution dying a lieutenant a few years after this war perhaps no man in the navy was more generally known or excited more amusement by his oddities or more respect for his courage he had come on the lake with the commodore with whom he was a great pet and had been active in all the fights and affairs that had yet taken place his religion was to hate an englishman  mr trant now called the scourges aft and asked more of the particulars he then gave us a glass of grog all round and made his own crew splice the mainbrace the julias now offered us dry clothes i got a change from jack reilly who had been an old messmate and with whom i had always been on good terms it knocked off raining but we shifted ourselves at the galley fire below i then went on deck and presently we heard the boat pulling back it soon came alongside bringing in it four more men that had been found floating about on sweeps and gratings on inquiry it turned out that these men belonged to the hamilton lt wintera schooner that had gone down in the same squall that carried us over these men were very much exhausted too and we all went below and were told to turn in  i had been so much excited during the scenes through which i had just passed and had been so much stimulated by grog that as yet i had not felt much of the depression natural to such events i even slept soundly that night nor did i turn out until six the next morning  when i got on deck there was a fine breeze it was a lovely day and the lake was perfectly smooth our fleet was in a good line in pretty close order with the exception of the governor tompkins lieutenant tom brown which was a little to leeward but carrying a press of sail to close with the commodore mr trant perceiving that the tompkins wished to speak us in passing brailed his foresail and let her luff up close under our lee two of the schooners the hamilton and the scourge have gone down in the night called out mr brown for i have picked up four of the hamiltons ohhoanswered mr trantthats no news at all for i have picked up twelve eight of the scourges and four of the hamiltonsaft foresheet  these were all that were ever saved from the two schooners which must have had near a hundred souls on board them the two commanders lieutenant winter and mr osgood were both lost and with mr winter went down i believe one or two young gentlemen the squadron could not have moved much between the time when the accidents happened and that when i came on deck or we must have come round and gone over the same ground again for we now passed many relics of the scene floating about in the water i saw spunges gratings sweeps hats c scattered about and in passing ahead we saw one of the latter that we tried to catch mr trant ordering it done as he said it must have been lieutenant winters we did not succeed however nor was any article taken on board a good lookout was kept for men from aloft but none were seen from any of the vessels the lake had swallowed up the rest of the two crews and the scourge as had been often predicted had literally become a coffin to a large portion of her people  there was a good deal of manoeuvring between the two fleets this day and some efforts were made to engage but to own the truth i felt so melancholy about the loss of so many shipmates that i did not take much notice of what passed all my black jokers were drowned and nothing remained of the craft and people with which and whom i had been associated all summer bill southard too was among the lost as indeed were all my messmates but tom goldsmith and lemuel bryant i had very serious and proper impressions for the moment but my new shipmates some of whom had been old shipmates in other crafts managed to cheer me up with grog the effect was not durable and in a short time i ceased to think of what had happened i have probably reflected more on the merciful manner in which my life was spared amid a scene so terrific within the last five years than i did in the twentyfive that immediately followed the accidents  the fleet went in off the niagara and anchored mr trant now mustered the remaining scourges and told us he wanted just our number of hands and that he meant to get an order to keep us in the julia in the meantime he should station and quarter us i was stationed at the braces and quartered at the long thirtytwo as second loader the julia mounted a long thirtytwo and an eighteen on pivots besides two sixes in the waist the last were little used as i have already mentioned she was a small but a fast schooner and had about forty souls on board she was altogether a better craft than the scourge though destitute of any quarters but a low rail with washboards and carrying fewer guns    chapter vii    i never knew what became of the four hamiltons that were picked up by the julias boat though i suppose they were put in some other vessel along with their shipmates nor did i ever learn the particulars of the loss of this schooner beyond the fact that her topsailsheets were stoppered and her halyards racked this much i learned from the men who were brought on board the julia who said that their craft was ready in all respects for action some seamen have thought this wrong and some right but in my opinion it made but little difference in such a gust as that which passed over us what was remarkable the julia which could not have been far from the scourge when we went over felt no great matter of wind just luffing up and shaking her sails to be rid of it  we lay only one night off the mouth of the niagara the next morning the squadron weighed and stood out in pursuit of the english the weather was very variable and we could not get within reach of sir james all that day this was the 9th of august the scourge had gone down on the night of the 7th or the morning of the 8th i never knew which on the morning of the 10th however we were under the north shore and to windward of john bull the commodore now took the asp and the madison the fair american in tow and we all kept away expecting certainly a general action but the wind shifted bringing the english to windward the afternoon was calm or had variable airs towards sunset the enemy was becalmed under the american shore and we got a breeze from the southward we now closed and at 6 formed our line for engaging we continued to close until 7 when the wind came out fresh at sw putting john again to windward  i can hardly tell what followed there was so much manoeuvring and shifting of berths both squadrons were standing across the lake the enemy being to windward and a little astern of us we now passed within hail of the commodore who gave us orders to form a new line of battle which we did in the following manner one line composed of the smallest schooners was formed to windward while the ships brig and two heaviest schooners formed another line to leeward we had the weathermost line having the growler lieutenant deacon for the vessel next astern of us this much i could see though i did not understand the object i now learn the plan was for the weather line to engage the enemy and then by edging away draw them down upon the lee line which line contained our principal force according to the orders we ought to have rather edged off as soon as the english began to fire in order to draw them down upon the commodore but it will be seen that our schooner pursued a very different course  it must have been near midnight when the enemy began to fire at the fair american the sternmost vessel of our weather line we were a long bit ahead of her and did not engage for some time the firing became pretty smart astern but we stood on without engaging the enemy not yet being far enough ahead for us after a while the four sternmost schooners of our line kept off according to orders but the julia and growler still stood on i suppose the english kept off too at the same time as the commodore had expected at any rate we found ourselves so well up with the enemy that instead of bearing up mr trant tacked in the julia and the growler came round after us we now began to fire on the headmost ships of the enemy which were coming on towards us we were able to lay past the enemy on this tack and fairly got to windward of them when we were a little on john bulls weather bow we brailed the foresail and gave him several rounds within a pretty fair distance the enemy answered us and from that moment he seemed to give up all thoughts of the vessels to leeward of him turning his whole attention on the julia and growler  the english fleet stood on the same tack until it had got between us and our own line when it went about in chase of us we now began to make short tacks to windward the enemy separating so as to spread a wide clew in order that they might prevent our getting past by turning their line and running to leeward as for keeping to windward we had no difficultyoccasionally brailing our foresail and even edging off now and then to be certain that our shot would tell in moderate weather the julia was the fastest vessel in the american squadron the lady of the lake excepted and the growler was far from being dull had there been room i make no doubt we might have kept clear of john bull with the greatest ease touching him up with our long heavy guns from time to time as it suited us i have often thought that mr trant forgot we were between the enemy and the land and that he fancied himself out at sea it was a hazy moonlight morning and we did not see anything of the main though it turned out to be nearer to us than we wished  all hands were now turning to windward the two schooners still edging off occasionally and firing the enemys shot went far beyond us and did us some mischief though nothing that was not immediately repaired the main throathalyards on board the julia were shot away as was the clew of the mainsail it is probable the enemy did not keep his luff towards the last on account of the land  our two schooners kept quite near each other sometimes one being to windward sometimes the other it happened that the growler was a short distance to windward of us when we first became aware of the nature of our critical situation she up helm and running down within hail lieutenant deacon informed mr trant he had just sounded in two fathoms and that he could see lights ashore he thought there must be indians in great numbers in this vicinity and that we must at all events avoid the land what do you think we had best do asked lieutenant deacon run the gauntlet called out mr trant very well sir which shall lead ill lead the van answered mr trant and then all was settled  we now up helm and steered for a vacancy among the british vessels the enemy seemed to expect us for they formed in two lines leaving us room to enter between them when we bore up even in these critical circumstances it was under our mainsail foretopsail jib flyingjib and foresail so insufficient were the equipments of these small craft that we had neither squaresail nor studdingsails on board us i never saw a studdingsail in any of the schooners the scourge excepted  the julia and growler now ran down the former leading half a cableslength apart when we entered between the two lines of the enemy we were within short canisterrange and got it smartly on both tacks the two english ships were to leeward each leading a line and we had a brig and three large regular manofwar schooners to get past with the certainty of meeting the wolfe and royal george should we succeed in clearing these four craft both of us kept up a heavy fire swivelling our guns round so as not to neglect any one as we drew near the ships however we paid them the compliment of throwing all the heavy shot at them as was due to their rank and size  for a few minutes we fared pretty well but we were no sooner well entered between the lines than we got it hot and hard our rigging began to come down about our ears and one shot passed a few feet above our heads cutting both topsailsheets and scooping a bit of wood as big as a thirtytwo pound shot out of the foremast i went up on one side myself to knot one of these sheets and while aloft discovered the injury that had been done to the spar soon after the tack of the mainsail caught fire from a wad of one of the englishmen for by this time we were close at it i think indeed that the nearness of the enemy alone prevented our decks from being entirely swept the grape and canister were passing just above our heads like hail and the foresail was literally in ribands the halyards being gone the mainsail came down by the run and the jib settled as low as it could the topsailyard was on the cap and the schooner now came up into the wind  all this time we kept working the guns the old man went from one gun to the other pointing each himself as it was ready he was at the eighteen when things were getting near the worst and as he left her he called out to her crew to fill herfill her to the muzzle he then came to our gun which was already loaded with one round a stand of grape and a case of canister shot this i know for i put them all in with my own hands at this time the melville a brig of the enemys was close up with us firing upon our decks from her foretop she was coming up on our larboard quarter while a large schooner was nearing us fast on the starboard mr trant directed our gun to be elevated so as to sweep the brigs forecastle and then he called out nows the time ladsfire at the bs fire away at em but no match was to be found some one had thrown both overboard by this time the brigs jibboom was over our quarter and the english were actually coming on board of us the enemy were now all round us the wolfe herself was within hail and still firing the last i saw of any of our people was mallet passing forward and i sat down on the slide of the thirtytwo myself sullen as a bear two or three of the english passed me without saying anything even at this instant a volley of bullets came out of the brigs foretop and struck all around me some hitting the deck and others the gun itself just then an english officer came up and saidwhat are you doing here you yankee i felt exceedingly savage and answered looking at your fools firing upon their own men take that for your sauce he said giving me a thrust with his sword as he spoke the point of the cutlass just passed my hipbone and gave me a smart fleshwound the hurt was not dangerous though it bled freely and was some weeks in healing i now rose to go below and heard a hail from one of the shipsthe wolfe as i took her to be have you struck demanded some one the officer who had hurt me now called out dont fire into us sir for im on board and have got possession the officer from the ship next asked is there anybody alive on board her to which the prizeofficer answered i dont know sir ive seen but one man as yet  i now went down below first i got a bandage on my wound to stop the bleeding and then i had an opportunity to look about me a party of english was below and some of our men having joined them the heads were knocked out of two barrels of whiskey the kids and breadbags were procured and all hands without distinction of country sat down to enjoy themselves some even began to sing and as for goodfellowship it was just as marked as it would have been in a jollification ashore  in a few minutes the officer who had hurt me jumped down among us the instant he saw what we were at he sang outhalloo heres high life below stairs then he called to another officer to bear a hand down and see the fun some one sung out from among ourselves to dowse the glim the lights were put out and then the two officers capsized the whiskey while this was doing most of the englishmen ran up the forward hatch we julias all remained below  in less than an hour we were sent on board the enemys vessels i was carried to the royal george but mr trant was taken on board the wolfe the growler had lost her bowsprit and was otherwise damaged and had been forced to strike also she had a man killed and i believe one or two wounded8 on board of us not a man besides myself had been touched we seemed to have been preserved by a miracle for every one of the enemy had a slap at us and for some time we were within pistolshot then we had no quarters at all being perfectly exposed to grape and canister the enemy must have fired too high for nothing else could have saved us  in july while i still belonged to the scourge i had been sent with a boats crew under mr bogardus on board an english flag of truce that had come into the harbour while in this vessel our boats crew were hailfellowswellmet with the englishmen and we had agreed among us to take care of each other should either side happen to be taken i had been on board the royal george but a short time when two of these very men came up to me with some grog and some grub and next morning they brought me my bitters i saw no more of them however except when they came to shake hands with us at the gangway as we were leaving the ship  after breakfast next morning we were all called aft to the wardroom one at a time i was pumped as to the force of the americans the names of the vessels the numbers of the crews and the names of the commanders i answered a little saucily and was ordered out of the wardroom as i was quitting the place i was called back by one of the lieutenants whose appearance i did not like from the first although it was now eight years since i left halifax and we had both so much altered i took this gentleman for mr bowen the very midshipman of the cleopatra who had been my schoolmate and whom i had known on board the prizebrig i have mentioned  this officer asked me where i was born i told him new york he said he knew better and asked my name i told him it was what he found it on the musterroll and that by which i had been called he said i knew better and that i should hear more of this hereafter if this were my old schoolfellow he knew that i was always called edward robert meyers whereas i had dropped the middle name and now called myself myers he may not however have been the person i took him for and might have mistaken me for some one else for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining any more about him  we got into little york and were sent ashore that evening i can say nothing of our squadron having been kept below the whole time i was on board the royal george i could not find out whether we did the enemy any harm or not the night we were taken though i remember that a sixtyeight pound carronade that stood near the gangway of the royal george was dismounted the night i passed into her it looked to me as if the trucks were gone this i know that the ship was more than usually screened off though for what reason i will not pretend to say  at york we were put in the gaol where we were kept three weeks our treatment was every way bad with the exception that we were not crowded as to food we were kept six upon four the whole time i was prisoner9 the bread was bad and the pork little better while in this gaol a party of drunken indians gave us a volley in passing but luckily it did us no harm  at the end of three weeks we received a haversack apiece and two days allowance our clothes were taken from us and the men were told they would get them below a thing that happened to very few of us i believe as for myself i was luckily without anything to lose my effects having gone down in the scourge all i had on earth was a shirt and two handkerchiefs and an old slouched hat that i had got in exchange for a scotch cap that had been given to me in the julia i was without shoes and so continued until i reached halifax all this gave me little concern my spirits being elastic and my disposition gay my great trouble was the apprehension of being known through the recollections of the officer i have mentioned  we now commenced our march for kingston under the guard of a company of the glengarians and a party of indians the last kept on our flanks and it was understood they would shoot and scalp any man who left the ranks we marched two and two being something like eighty prisoners it was hard work for the first day or two the road being nothing but an indian trail and our lodgingplaces the open air my feet became very sore and as for food we had to eat our pork raw there being nothing to cook in the soldiers fared no better than ourselves however with the exception of being on full allowance it seems that our provisions were sent by water and left for us at particular places for every eightandforty hours we touched the lake shore and found them ready for us they were left on the beach without any guard or any one near them in this way we picked up our supplies the whole distance  at the dépôt mr bogardus and the pilot found a boat and managed to get into her and put out into the lake after being absent a day and night they were driven in by rough weather and fell into the hands of a party of dragoons who were escorting sir george prevost along the lake shore we found them at a sort of tavern where were the english governor and his escort at the time they were sent back among us with two american army officers who had fallen into the hands of the indians and had been most foully treated one of these officers was wounded in the arm  the night of the day we fell in with sir george prevost we passed through a hamlet and slept just without it as we entered the village the guard played yankee doodle winding up with the rogues march as we went through the place i got leave to go to a house and ask for a drink of milk the woman of this house said they had been expecting us for two days and that they had been saving their milk expressly to give us i got as much as i wanted and a small loaf of bread in the bargain as did several others with me these people seemed to me to be all well affected to the americans and much disposed to treat us kindly we slept on a barn floor that night  we were much provoked at the insult of playing the rogues march jack reilly and i laid a plan to have our revenge should it be repeated two or three days later we had the same tune at another village and i caught up a couple of large stones ran ahead and dashed them through both ends of the drum before the boy who was beating it knew what i was about jack snatched the fife out of the other boys hand and it was passed from one to another among us until it reached one who threw it over the railing of a bridge after this we had no more music good or bad not a word was said to any of us about this affair and i really think the officers were ashamed of themselves  after a march of several days we came to a hamlet not a great distance from kingston i saw a good many geese about and took a fancy to have one for supper i told mallet if he would cook a goose i would tip one over the matter was arranged between us and picking up a club i made a dash at a flock and knocked a bird over i caught up the goose and ran when my fellowprisoners called out to me to dodge which i did behind a stump not knowing from what quarter the danger might come it was well i did for two indians fired at me one hitting the stump and the other ball passing just over my head a militia officer now galloped up and drove back the indians who were running up to me to look after the scalp i suppose this officer remonstrated with me but spoke mildly and even kindly i told him i was hungry and that i wanted a warm mess but you are committing a robbery he said if i am im robbing an enemy you do not know but it may be a friend was his significant answer well if i am hell not grudge me the goose says i on hearing this the officer laughed and asked me how i meant to cook the goose i told him that one of my messmates had promised to do this for me he then bade me carry the goose into the ranks and to come to him when we halted at night i did this and he gave us a pan some potatoes onions c out of which we made the only good mess we got on our march i may say this was the last hearty and really palatable meal i made until i reached halifax a period of several weeks  while jack mallet was cooking the goose i went in behind a pile of boards attended by a soldier to watch me and while there i saw an ivory rule lying on the boards with fifteen pence alongside of it these i pinned as a lawful prize being in an enemys country the money served to buy us some bread the rule was bartered for half a gallon of rum this made us a merry night taking all things together  we made no halt at kingston though the indians left us we now marched through a settled country with some militia for our guards our treatment was much better than it had been the people of the country treating us kindly when we were abreast of the thousand islands mr bogardus and the pilot made another attempt to escape and got fairly off these were the only two who did succeed how they effected it i cannot say but i know they escaped i never saw either afterwards  at the long sault we were all put in boats with a canadian pilot in each end the militia staid behind and down we went they say at the rate of nine miles in fifteen minutes we found a new guard at the foot of the rapids this was done beyond a doubt to save us and themselves though we thought hard of it at the time for it appeared to us as if they thrust us into a danger they did not like to run themselves i have since heard that even ladies travelling used to go down these formidable rapids in the same way and that with skilful pilots there is little or no danger  when we reached montreal we were confined in a gaol where we remained three weeks there was an american lady confined in this building though she had more liberty than we and from her we received much aid she sent us soap and she gave me bandages c for my hurt occasionally she gave us little things to eat i never knew her name but heard she had two sons in the american army and that she had been detected in corresponding with them  we remained at montreal two or three weeks and then were sent down to quebec where we were put on board of prisonships i was sent to the lord cathcart and most of the julias men with me our provisions were very bad and the mortality among us was great the bread was intolerably bad mr trant came to see us privately and he brought some salt with him which was a great relief to us jack mallet asked him whether some of us might not go to work on board a transport that lay just astern of us in order to get something better to eat mr trant said yes and eight of us went on board this craft every day getting provisions and grog for our pay at sunset we returned regularly to the cathcart i got a second shirt and a pair of trowsers in this way  about a fortnight after this arrangement the surprise 32 and a sloopofwar came in anchoring some distance below the town these ships sent their boats up to the prisonships to examine them for men after going through those vessels they came on board the transport and finding us fresh clean fed and tolerably clad they pronounced us all englishmen and carried us on board the frigate we were not permitted even to go and take leave of our shipmates of the eight men thus taken five were native americans one was from mozambique one i suppose to have been an english subject born but long settled in america and as for me the reader knows as much of my origin as i know myself  we were asked if we would go to duty on board the surprise and we all refused we were then put in close con finement on the berthdeck under the charge of a sentry in a day or two the ship sailed and off cape breton we met with a heavy gale in which the people suffered severely with snow and cold the ship was kept off the land with great difficulty after all we prisoners saved the ship though i think it likely the injury originally came from some of us the breechings of two of the guns had been cut and the guns broke adrift in the height of the gale all the crew were on deck and the sentinel permitting it we went up and smothered the guns with hammocks we were now allowed to go about deck but this lasted a short time the whole of us being sent below again as soon as the gale abated  on reaching halifax we were all put on board of the regulus transport bound to bermuda here we eight were thrown into irons under the accusation of being british subjects at the end of twentyfour hours however the captain came to us and offered to let us out of irons and to give us ships treatment if we would help in working the vessel to bermuda i have since thought we were ironed merely to extort this arrangement from us we consulted together and thinking a chance might offer to get possession of the regulus which had only a few canadians in her and was to be convoyed by the pictou schooner we consented we were now turned up to duty and i got the first pair of shoes that had been on my feet since the scourge sunk from under me  the reader will imagine i had not been in the harbour of halifax without a strong desire to ascertain something about those i had left behind me in that town i was nervously afraid of being discovered and yet had a feverish wish to go ashore the manner in which i gratified this wish and the consequences to which it led will be seen in the sequel    chapter viii    jack mallet had long known my history he was my confidant and entered into all my feelings the night we went to duty on board the transport a boat was lying alongside of the ship and the weather being thick it afforded a good opportunity for gratifying my longing jack and myself got in after putting our heads together and stole off undetected i pulled directly up to the wharf of mr marchinton and at once found myself at home i will not pretend to describe my sensations but they were a strange mixture of apprehension disquiet hope and natural attachment i wished much to see my sister but was afraid to venture on that  there was a family however of the name of fraser that lived near the shore with which i had been well acquainted and in whose members i had great confidence they were respectable in position its head being called a judge and they were all intimate with the marchintons to the frasers then i went jack keeping me company i was afraid if i knocked the servant would not let me in appearing as i did in the dress of a common sailor so i opened the streetdoor without any ceremony and went directly to that of the parlour which i entered before there was time to stop me jack brought up in the entry  mrs fraser and her daughter were seated together on a settee and the judge was reading at a table my sudden apparition astonished them and all three gazed at me in silence mr fraser then said in the name of heaven where did you come from edward i told him i had been in the american service but that i now belonged to an english transport that was to sail in the morning and that i had just come ashore to inquire how all hands did particularly my sister he told me that my sister was living a married woman in halifax that mr marchinton was dead and had grieved very much at my disappearance that i was supposed to be dead he then gave me much advice as to my future course and reminded me how much i had lost by my early mistakes he was particularly anxious i should quit my adopted country and wished me to remain in halifax he offered to send a servant with me to find my sister but i was afraid to let my presence be known to so many i begged my visit might be kept a secret as i felt ashamed of being seen in so humble circumstances i was well treated as was jack mallet both of us receiving wine and cake c mr fraser also gave me a guinea and as i went away mrs fraser slipped a pound note into my hand the latter said to me in a whisperi know what you are afraid of but i shall tell harriet of your visit she will be secret  i staid about an hour receiving every mark of kindness from these excellent and respectable people leaving them to believe we were to sail in the morning when we got back to the transport no one knew of our absence and nothing was ever said of our taking the boat the regulus did not sail for twenty hours after this but i had no more communication with the shore we got to sea at last two transports under the convoy of the pictou  during the whole passage we eight prisoners kept a sharp lookout for a chance to get possession of the ship we were closely watched there being a lieutenant and his boats crew on board besides the canadians the master mate c all the arms were secreted and nothing was left at hand that we could use in a rising  about mid passage it blowing fresh with the ship under doublereefed topsails i was at the weather with one of the canadians at the lee wheel mallet was at work in the larboard or weather mizen chains ready to lend me a hand at this moment the pictou came up under our lee to speak us in relation to carrying a light during the night her masts swung so she could not carry one herself and her commander wished us to carry our toplight he keeping near it instead of our keeping near him the schooner came very close to us it blowing heavily and mallet called out ned now is your time up helm and into him a couple of seas will send him down this was said loud enough to be heard though all on deck were attending to the schooner and as for the canadian he did not understand english i managed to get the helm hard up and mallet jumped inboard the ship fell off fast but the lieutenant who was on board as an agent was standing in the companionway with his wife and the instant he saw what i had done he ran aft struck me a sharp blow and put the helm hard down with his own hands this saved the pictou though there was a great outcry on board her the lieutenants wife screamed and there was a pretty uproar for a minute in every direction as the regulus luffedto her jibboomend just cleared the pictous forward rigging and a man might almost have jumped from the ship to the schooner as we got alongside of each other another minute and we should have travelled over his majestys schooner like a railroad car going over a squash  the lieutenant now denounced us and we prisoners were all put in irons i am merely relating facts how far we were right i leave others to decide but it must be remembered that jack had in that day a mortal enmity to a british manofwar which was a little too apt to lay hands on all that she fell in with on the high seas perhaps severe moralists might say that we had entered into a bargain with the captain of the regulus not to make war on him during the passage in answer to which we can reply that we were not attacking him but the pictou our intention it must be confessed however was to seize the regulus in the confusion had we been better treated as prisoners our tempers might not have been so savage but we got no good treatment except for our own work and being hedged in in this manner common sailors reason very much as they feel we were not permitted to go at large again in the regulus in which the english were very right as jack mallet in particular was a man to put his shipmates up to almost any enterprise  the anchor was hardly down at bermuda before a signal was made to the goliah razée for a boat and we were sent on board that ship this was a cruising vessel and she went to sea next morning we were distributed about the ship and ordered to go to work the intention evidently was to swallow us all in the enormous maw of the british navy we refused to do duty however to a man most of our fellows being pretty bold as native americans we were a fortnight in this situation the greater part of the time playing green with our tin pots slung round our necks we did so much of this that the people began to laugh at us as real johnny raws though the old salts knew better the last even helped us along some giving us clothes extra grog and otherwise being very kind to us the officers treated us pretty well too all things considered none of us got flogged nor were we even threatened with the gangway at length the plan was changed the boatswain was asked if he got anything out of us and making a bad report we were sent down to the lower gundeck under a sentrys charge and put at six upon four again here we remained until the ship went into bermuda after a six weeks cruise this vessel an old seventyfour cut down did not answer for she was soon after sent to england i overheard her officers from our berth near the bulkhead wishing to fall in with the president commodore rodgersa vessel they fancied they could easily handle i cannot say they could not but one day an elderly man among them spoke very rationally on the subject saying they might or they might not get the best of it in such a fight for his part he did not wish to see any such craft with the miserable crew they had in the goliah  we found the ramilies sir thomas hardy lying in bermuda roads this ship sent a boat which took us on board the ardent 64 which was then used as a prisonship about a week before we reached this vessel an american midshipman got hold of a boat and effected his escape actually making the passage between bermuda and cape henry all alone by himself10 in consequence of this unusual occurrence a bright look out was kept on all the boats thus defeating one of our plans which was to get off in the same way when we reached the ardent we found but four americans in her after we had been on board her about a week three men joined us who had given themselves up on board english menofwar as native americans one of these men whose name was baily had been fourteen years in the english service into which he had been pressed his protection having been torn up before his face he was a connecticut man and had given himself up at the commencement of the war getting three dozen for his pains he was then sent on the halifax station where he gave himself up again he received three dozen more then had his shirt thrown over his back and was sent to us i saw the back and the shirt myself and baily said he would keep the last to be buried with him bradbury and patrick were served very much in the same manner i saw all their backs and give the remainder of the story as they gave it to me baily and bradbury got off in season to join the constitution and to make the last cruise in her during this war i afterwards fell in with bradbury who mentioned this circumstance to me  it is good to have these things known for i do believe the english nation would be averse to mens receiving such treatment could they fairly be made to understand it it surely is bad enough to be compelled to fight the battles of a foreign country without being flogged for not fighting them when they happen to be against ones own people for myself i was born of german parents in the english territory it is true but america was and ever has been the country of my choice and while yet a child i may say i decided for myself to sail under the american flag and if my father had a right to make an englishman of me by taking service under the english crown i think i had a right to make myself what i pleased when he had left me to get on as i could without his counsel and advice  after being about three weeks in the ardent we eight prisoners were sent on board the ramilies to be tried as englishmen who had been fighting against their king the trial took place on board the asia 74 a flagship but we lived in the ramilies during the time the investigation was going on sir thomas hardy held several conversations with me on the quarterdeck in which he manifested great kindness of feeling he inquired whether i was really an american but i evaded any direct answer i told him however that i had been an apprentice in new york in the employment of jacob barker which was true in one sense as mr barker was the consignee of the sterling and knew of my indentures i mentioned him as a person more likely to be known than captain johnston sir thomas said he had some knowledge of mr barker and i think i have heard that they were in some way connected this was laying an anchor towindward as it turned out in the end  we were all on board the asia for trial or investigation two days before i was sent for into the cabin i was very much frightened and scarce knew what i said or did it is a cruel thing to leave sailors without counsel on such occasions though the officers behaved very kindly and considerately to me and i believe to all of us there were several officers seated round a table and all were in swabs they said the gentleman who presided was a sir borlase warren the admiral on the station11 this gentleman whoever he was probably saw that i was frightened he slewed himself round in his chair and said to me my man you need not be alarmed we know who you are and what you are but your apprenticeship will be of great service to you this was not said however until sir thomas hardy had got out the story of my being an apprentice in jacob barkers employ again before them all in the cabin i was told to send for a copy of my indentures by one of the whitewashed swedes that sailed between bermuda and new york this i did that very day i was in the cabin of the asia half an hour perhaps and i felt greatly relieved when i got out of it it was decided in my presence to send me back among the prisoners on board the ardent the same decision was made as to the whole eight of us that had come on in the regulus  when we got back to the ramilies sir thomas hardy had some more conversation with me i have thought ever since that he knew something about my birth and of my being the princes godson he wished me to join the british service seemingly very much and encouraged me with the hope of being promoted but it is due to myself to say i held out against it all i do not believe america had a truer heart in her service than mine and i do not think an english commission would have bought me i have nothing to hope from saying this for i am now old and a cripple but as i have sat down to relate the truth let the truth be told whether it tell for or against me  we were now sent back to the ardent where we remained three weeks or a month longer during this time we got our papers from new york i receiving a copy of my indentures together with the sum of ten dollars which reached me through sir thomas hardy as i understood nothing more was ever said to any of the eight about their being englishmen the whole of us being treated as prisoners of war prisoners arrived fast until we had four hundred in the ardent the old ruby a fortyfour on two decks was obliged to receive some of them most of these prisoners were privateersmen though there were a few soldiers and some citizens that had been picked up in chesapeake bay before we left bermuda the crew of a french frigate was put into the ardent to the number of near four hundred men in the whole we must have had eight hundred souls and all on one deck this was close stowage and i was heartily glad when i quitted the ship  soon after the french arrived four hundred of us americans were put on board transports and we sailed for halifax under the convoy of the ramilies a day or two after we got out we fell in with an american privateer which continued hovering around us for several days as this was a bold fellow frequently coming within gunshot and sporting his sticks and canvass in all sorts of ways sir thomas hardy felt afraid he would get one of the four transports and he took all us prisoners into the ramilies we staid in the ship the rest of the passage and when we went into halifax it was all alone the four transports having disappeared two of them subsequently got in but i think the other two were actually taken by that saucy fellow  the prisoners at first had great liberty allowed them on board the ramilies on all occasions sir thomas hardy treated the americans well a party of marines was stationed on the poop and another on the forecastle and the ships people had arms but this was all the precaution that was used the opportunity tempted some of our men to plan a rising with a view to seize the ship privateer officers were at the head of this scheme which was communicated to me among others soon after the plot was laid most of the prisoners knew of the intention and everybody seemed to enter into the affair with hearty goodwill our design was to rise at the end of the second dogwatch overcome the crew and carry the ship upon our own coast if unable to pass the blockading squadrons we intended to run her ashore the people of the ramilies outnumbered us by near onehalf and they had arms it is true but we trusted to the effect of a surprise and something to the disposition of most english sailors to get quit of their own service had the attempt been made from what i saw of the crew i think our main trouble would have been with the officers and the marines we were prevented from trying the experiment however in consequence of having been betrayed by some one who was in the secret the whole of us being suddenly sent into the cable tiers and amongst the water casks under the vigilant care of sentinels posted in the wings after that we were allowed to come on deck singly only and then under a sentinels charge when sir thomas spoke to us concerning this change of treatment he did not abuse us for our plan but was mild and reasonable while he reminded us of the necessity of what he was doing i have no idea he would have been in the least injured had we got possession of the ship for to the last our people praised him and the treatment they received while under his orders  before we were sent below sir thomas spoke to me again on the subject of my joining the english service he was quite earnest about it and reasoned with me like a father but i was determined not to yield i did not like england and i did like america my birth in quebec was a thing i could not help but having chosen to serve under the american flag and having done so now for years i did not choose to go over to the enemy  at halifax fifteen or twenty of us were sent on board the old centurion 44 lord ansons ship as retaliationmen we eight were of the number we found something like thirty more in the ship all retaliationmen like ourselves those we found in the centurion did not appear to me to be foremast jacks but struck me as being citizens from ashore we were well treated however suffering no other confinement than that of the ship we were on six upon four it is true like other prisoners but our own country gave us small stores and extra bread and beef in the way of grub we fared like sailor kings at the end of three weeks we eight lakesmen were sent to melville island among the great herd of prisoners i cannot explain the reason of all these changes but i know that when the gate was shut on us the turnkey said we had gone into a home that would last as long as the war lasted  melville is an island of more than a mile in circumference with low rocky shores it lies about three miles from the town of halifax but not in sight it is connected with the main by a bridge that is thrown across a narrow passage of something like a quarter of a mile in width in the centre of the island is an eminence which was occupied by the garrison and had some artillery this eminence commanded the whole island another post on the main also commanded the prisoners barracks these barracks were ordinary wooden buildings enclosed on the side of the island with a strong stone wall and on the side of the post on the main by high open palisades of course a sufficient guard was maintained  it was said there were about twelve hundred americans on the island when i passed the gate among them were a few french some of whom were a part of the crew of the ville de milan the ship that had been taken before i first left halifax or more than eight years previously to this time this did indeed look like the places being a home to a poor fellow and i did not relish the circumstance at all among our people were soldiers sailors and longshoremen there was no difference in the treatment which for a prison was good we got only six upon four from the english of course but our own country made up the difference here as on board the centurion they had a prison dress with one leg of the trowsers yellow and the other blue c but we would not stand that our agent managed the matter so that we got regular jackets and trowsers of the true old colour the poor frenchmen looked like peacocks in their dress but we did not envy them their finery  i had been on the island about a fortnight when i was told by jack mallet that a woman whom he thought to be my sister was at the gate jack knew my whole history and came to his opinion from a resemblance that he saw between me and the person who had inquired for me i refused to go to the gate however to see who it was and jack was sent back to tell the woman that i had been left behind at bermuda he was directed to throw in a few hints about the expediency of her not coming back to look for me and that it would be better if she never named me all this was done i getting a berth from which i could see the female i knew her in a moment although she was married and had a son with her and my heart was very near giving way especially when i saw her shedding tears she went away from the gate however going up on the ramparts from which she could look down into the prisonyard there she remained an hour as if she wished to satisfy her own eyes as to the truth of jacks story but i took good care to keep out of her sight  as i knew there was little hope of an exchange of prisoners i now began to think of the means of making my escape jack mallet dared not attempt to swim on account of the rheumatism and cramps having narrowly escaped drowning at bermuda and he could not join in our schemes as for myself i have been able to swim ever since danger taught me the important lesson the night the scourge went down money would be necessary to aid me in escaping and jack and i put our heads together in order to raise some i had still the ten dollars given me by sir thomas hardy and i commenced operations by purchasing shares in a diceboard a vingt et un table and a quino table12 jack mallet and i also set up a shop on a capital of three dollars we sold smoked herring pipes tobacco segars spruce beer and as chances of smuggling it in offered now and then a little jamaica all this time the number of the prisoners increased until in the end we got to have a full prison when they began to send them to england only one of the julias was sent away however all the rest remaining at melville island from some cause i cannot explain  i cannot say we made money very fast on every shilling won at dice we received a penny at vingt et un the commission was the same as it was also at the other games new cards however brought a little higher rate all this was wrong i now know but then it gave me very little trouble i hope i would not do the same thing over again even to make my escape from melville island but one never knows to what distress may drive him  some person among the american prisonersa soldier it was saidcommenced counterfeiting spanish dollars i am afraid most of us helped to circulate them we thought it no harm to cheat the people of the canteens for we knew they were doing all they could to cheat us this was prison morality in wartime and i say nothing in its favour though for myself i will own i felt more of the consciousness of wrongdoing in holding the shares in the gambling establishments than in giving bad dollars for poor rum the counterfeiting business was destroyed by one of the dollars happening to break as some of the officers were pitching them when on examination it turned out that most of the money in the prison was bad it was said the people of the canteens had about four hundred of the dollars when they came to overhaul their lockers a good many found their way into halifax  my trade lasted all winterthat of 181314 and by march i had gained the sum of eighty french crowns dollars i was afraid to hold on account of the base money the ice now began to give way and a few of us who had been discussing the matter all winter set about forming serious plans to escape my confederates were a man of the name of johnson who had been taken in the snapdragon privateer and an irishman of the name of littlefield barnet the mozambique man joined us also making four in all it was quite early in the month when we made the attempt our windows were long and had perpendicular bars of wrought iron to secure them but no crossbars there was no glass but outside shutters that we could open at our pleasure outside of the windows were sentinels and there were two rows of pickets between us and the shore  i put my crowns in a belt around my waist another belt or skin was filled with rum for the double purpose of buoying me in the water and of comforting me when ashore at that day i found rum one of the great blessings of life now i look upon it as one of the greatest evils my companions made similar provisions of money and rum though neither was as rich as myself i left mallet and leonard lewis my heirs at law if i escaped and my trustees should i be caught lewis was a young man of better origin than most in the prison and i have always thought some calamity drove him to the seas he was in ill health and did not appear to be destined to a long life he would have joined us heart and hand but was not strong enough to endure the fatigue which we well knew we must undergo before we could get clear  the night selected for the attempt was so cold dark and dismal as to drive all the sentinels into their boxes it rained hard in the bargain about eight or as soon as the lights were out we got the lanyards of our hammocks around two of the window bars and using a bit of firewood for a heaver we easily brought them together this left room for our bodies to pass out without any difficulty jack mallet and those we left behind hove the bars straight again so that the keepers were at a loss to know how we had got off we met with no obstacle between the prison and the water the pickets we removed having cut them in the daytime in a word all four of us reached the shore of the island in two or three minutes after we had taken leave of our messmates the difficulty lay before us we entered into the water at once and began to swim when i was a few rods from the place of landing which was quite near the guardhouse on the main johnson began to sing out that he was drowning i told him to be quiet but it was of no use the guard on the main heard him and commenced firing and of course we swam all the harder three of us were soon ashore and knowing the roads well i led them in a direction to avoid the soldiers by running into the woods we got clear though poor johnson fell again into the hands of the enemy he deserved it for bawling as he did it being the duty of a man in such circumstances to lie with a shut mouth    chapter ix    the three who had escaped ran for a quarter of a mile in the woods when we brought up and took a drink hearing no more firing or any further alarm we now consulted as to our future course there were some mills at the head of the bay about four miles from the guardhouse and i led the party thither we reached the place towards morning and found a berth in them before any one was stirring we hid ourselves in an old granary but no person appeared near the place throughout the next day we had put a little bread and a few herrings in our hats and on these we subsisted the rum cheered us up and if rum ever did good i think it was to us on that occasion we slept soundly with one man on the lookout a rule we observed the whole time we were out it stopped raining in the course of the day though the weather was bitter cold  next night we got under way and walked in a direction which led us within three miles of the town in doing this we passed the princes lodge a place where i had often been and the sight of which reminded me of home and of my childish days there was no use in regrets however and we pushed ahead the men saw my melancholy and they questioned me but i evaded the answer pretending that nothing ailed me there was a tavern about a league from the town kept by a man of the name of grant and littlefield ventured into it he bought a small cheese and a loaf of bread getting off clear though not unsuspected this helped us along famously and we pushed on as fast as we could before morning we came near a bridge on which there was a sentinel posted with a guardhouse near its end to avoid this danger we turned the guardhouse striking the river above the bridge here we met two indians and fell into discourse with them our rum now served us a better turn than ever buying the indians in a minute we told these chaps we were deserters from the bulwark 74 and begged them to help us along at first they thought we were yankees whom they evidently disliked and that right heartily but the story of the desertion took and made them disposed to serve us  these two indians led us down to the bed of the river and actually carried us beneath the bridge on the side of the river next the guard where we found a party of about thirty of these redskins men women and children here we stayed no less than three days faring extremely well having fish bread butter and other common food the weather was very bad and we did not like to turn out in it besides thinking the search for us might be less keen after a short delay all this time we were within a few rods of the guard hearing the sentinels cry alls well from halfhour to halfhour we were free with our rum and as much as we dared to be with our money these people never betrayed us  the third night we left the bridge guided by a young indian he led us about two miles up the river passing through the maroon town in the night after which he left us we wished him to keep on with us for some distance further but he refused he quitted us near morning and we turned into a deserted loghouse on the banks of the river where we passed the day the country was thinly populated and the houses we saw were poor and mean we must now have been about fiveandtwenty miles from halifax  our object was to cross the neck of land between the atlantic and the bay of fundy and to get to annapolis royal where we expected to be able to procure a boat by fair means if we could by stealth if necessary and cross over to the american shore we had still a long road before us and had some little difficulty to find the way the indians however gave us directions that greatly assisted us and we travelled a long bit and pretty fast all that night in the morning the country had more the appearance of being peopled and cultivated and i suspected we were getting into the vicinity of horton a place through which it would be indispensable to pass the weather became bad again and it was necessary to make a halt coming near a loghouse we sent littlefield ahead to make some inquiries of a woman who appeared to be in it alone on his return he reported well of the woman he had told her we were deserters from the bulwark and had promised to pay her if she would let us stay about her premises that day and get us something to eat the woman had consented to our occupying an outhouse and had agreed to buy the provisions we now took possession of the outhouse where the woman visited us and getting some money she left us in quest of food we were uneasy during her absence but she came back with some meat eggs bread and butter at the end of an hour and all seemed right we made two comfortable meals in this outhouse where we remained until near evening i had the lookout about noon and i saw a man hanging about the house and took the alarm the man did not stay long however and i got a nap as soon as he disappeared about four we were all up and one of us taking a look saw this same man and two others go into the house the woman had already told us that a party of soldiers had gone ahead in pursuit of three yankee runaways that four had broken prison but one had been retaken and the rest were still out this left little doubt that she knew who we were and we thought it best to steal away at once lest the men in the house should be consulting with her at that very moment about selling us for the reward which we know was always four pounds ahead the outhouse was near the river and there was a good deal of brush growing along the banks and we succeeded in getting away unseen  we went down to the margin under the bank and pursued our way along the stream before it was dark we came in sight of the bridge for which we had been travelling ever since we left the other bridge and were sorry to see a sentrybox on it we now halted for a council and came to a determination to wait until dark and then advance this we did getting under this bridge as we had done with the other we had no indians however to comfort and feed us  i had known a good deal of this part of the country when a boy from the circumstance that mr marchinton had a large farm near a place called cornwallis on the bay where i had even spent whole summers with the family this bridge i recollected well and i remembered there was a ford a little on one side of it when the tide was out the tides are tremendous in this part of the world and we did not dare to steal a boat here lest we should be caught in one of the bores as they are called when the tide came in it was now half ebb and we resolved to wait and try the ford  it was quite dark when we left the bridge and we had a delicate bit of work before us the naked flats were very wide and we sallied out with the bridge as our guide i was up to my middle in mud at times but the water was not very deep we must have been near an hour in the mud for we were not exactly on the proper ford of course and made bad navigation of it in the dark but we were afraid to lose sight of the bridge lest we should get all adrift  at length we reached the firm ground covered with mud and chilled with cold we found the road and the village of horton and skirted the last until all was clear then we took to the road and carried sail hard all night whenever we saw any one we hid ourselves but we met few while travelling next morning we walked until we came to a deserted sawmill which i also remembered and here we halted for the day no one troubled us nor did i see any one but littlefield said that a man drove a herd of cattle past during his watch on deck  i told my companions that night if they would be busy we might reach cornwallis where i should be at home we were pretty well fagged and wanted rest for jack is no great traveller ashore and i promised the lads a good snug berth at mr marchintons farm we pushed ahead briskly in consequence and i led the party up to the farm just as day was dawning a newfoundland dog named hunter met us with some ferocity but on my calling him by name he was pacified and began to leap on me and to caress me i have always thought that dog knew me after an absence of so many years there was no time to waste with dogs however and we took the way to the barn we had wit enough not to get on the hay but to throw ourselves on a mow filled with straw as the first was probably in use here we went to sleep with one man on the lookout this was the warmest and most comfortable rest we had got since quitting the island from which we had now been absent or nine days  we remained one night and two days in the barn the workmen entered it often and even stayed some time on the barnfloor but no one seemed to think of ascending our mow the dog kept much about the place and i was greatly afraid he would be the means of betraying us our provisions were getting low and the night we were at the farm i sallied out accompanied by barnet and we made our way into the dairy here we found a pan of bread milk cheese butter eggs and codfish of course we took our fill of milk but barnet got hold of a vessel of sour cream and came near hallooing out when he had taken a good pull at it as we returned to the barn the geese set up an outcry and glad enough was i to find myself safe on the mow again without being discovered next day however we overheard the men in the barn speaking of the robbery and complaining in particular of the uselessness of the dog i did not know any of these persons although a young man appeared among them this day who i fancied had been a playfellow of mine when a boy i could not trust him or any one else there and all the advantage we got from the farm was through my knowledge of the localities and of the habits of the place  i had never been further on the road between halifax and annapolis than to cornwallis the rest of the distance was unknown to me though i was familiar with the route which went out of cornwallis and which was called the annapolis road it was a fine starlight evening and we made good headway we all felt refreshed and journeyed on full stomachs we did not meet a soul though we travelled through a wellsettled country the next morning we halted in a wood the weather being warm and pleasant here we slept and rested as usual and were off again at night littlefield pinned three fowls as we went along declaring that he intended to have a warm mess next day and he got off without discoverv about four oclock in the morning we fell in with a river and left the highway following the banks of the stream for a short distance it now came on to blow and rain with the wind on shore and we saw it would not do to get a boat and go out in such a time there was a rising ground in a thick wood near us and we went up the hill to pass the day we had seen two men pulling ashore in a goodlooking boat and it was our determination to get this boat and shape our course down stream to the bay as soon as it moderated from the hill we could overlook the river and the adjacent country we saw the fishermen land take their sail and oars out of the boat haul the latter up turn her over and stow their sails and oars beneath her they had a breaker of fresh water too and everything seemed fitted for our purposes we liked the craft and what is more we liked the cruise  we could not see the town of annapolis which turned out to be upstream from us though we afterwards ascertained that we were within a mile or two of it the fishermen walked in the direction of the town and disappeared all we wanted now was tolerably good weather with a fair wind or at least with less wind the blow had driven in the fishermen and we thought it wise to be governed by their experience nothing occurred in the course of the day the weather remaining the same and we being exposed to the rain with no other cover than trees without leaves there were many pines however and they gave us a little shelter  at dusk littlefield lighted a fire and began to cook his fowls the supper was soon ready and we eat it with a good relish we then went to sleep leaving barnet on the lookout i had just got into a good sleep when i was awoke by the tramp of horses and the shouting of men on springing up i found that a party of five horsemen were upon us one called outhere they areweve found them at last this left no doubt of their errand and we were all retaken our arms were tied and we were made to mount behind the horsemen when they rode off with us taking the road by which we had come we went but a few miles that night when we halted  we were taken the whole distance to halifax in this manner riding on greatcoats without stirrups the horses on a smart walk we did not go by cornwallis which it seems was not the nearest road but we passed through horton and crossed the bridge beneath which we had waded through the mud at horton we passed a night we were confined in a sort of a prison that was covered with mud we did not like our berths and finding that the logs of which the building was made were rotten we actually worked our way through them and got fairly out littlefield who was as reckless an irishman as ever lived swore he would set fire to the place which he did by returning through the hole we had made and getting up into a loft that was dry and combustible but for this silly act we might have escaped and as it was we did get off for the rest of the night being caught next morning nearly down again by the bridge at windsor  this time our treatment was a good deal worse than at first a sharp lookout was kept and they got us back to halifax without any more adventures we were pretty well fagged though we had to taper off with the black hole and bread and water for the next ten days the regular punishment for such misdemeanors as ours at the end of the ten days we were let out and came together again our return brought about a great deal of discussion and not a little criticism as to the prudence of our course to hear the chaps talk one would think every man among them could have got off had he been in our situation though none of them did any better several having got off the island in our absence and been retaken within the first day or two while i was in prison however i remember but one man who got entirely clear this was a privateersman from marblehead who did get fairly off though he was back again in six weeks having been taken once more a few days out  we adventurers were pretty savage about our failure and the moment we were out of the black hole we began to lay our heads together for a new trial my idea was to steer a different course in the new attempt making the best of our way towards liverpool which lay to the southward coastwise this would leave us on the atlantic it was true but our notion was to ship in a small privateer called the liverpool and then run our chance of getting off from her as she was constantly crossing over to the american coast as this craft was quite small and often had but few hands in her we did not know but we might get hold of the schooner itself then there was some probability of being put in a coaster which we might run away with at all events any chance seemed better to us than that of remaining in prison until the end of war that might last years or until we got to be greyheaded i remembered when the ville de milan was brought into halifax this was a year or two before i went to sea and yet here were some of her people still on melville island  i renewed my trade as soon as out of the black hole but did not give up the idea of escaping leonard lewis and jack mallet were the only men we let into the secret they both declined joining us mallet on account of his dread of the water and lewis because certain he could not outlive the fatigue but they wished us good luck and aided us all they could with johnson we would have no further concern  the keepers did not ascertain the means by which we had left the barracks though they had seen the cut pickets of course we did not attempt therefore to cut through again but resolved to climb the english had strengthened the pickets with crosspieces which were a great assistance to us and i now desire to express my thanks for the same we waited for a warm but dark and rainy night in may before we commenced our new movement we had still plenty of money i having brought back with me to prison forty crowns and having driven a thriving trade in the interval we got out through the bars precisely as we had done before and at the very same window this was a small job after climbing the pickets either littlefield or barnet dropped on the outside a little too carelessly and was overheard the sentinel immediately called for the corporal of the guard but we were in the water swimming quite near the bridge and some little distance from the guardhouse on the main there was a stir on the island while we were in the water but we all got ashore safe and unseen  we took to the same woods as before but turned south instead of west our route brought us along by the waterside and we travelled hard all that night littlefield pretended to be our guide but we got lost and remained two days and nights in the woods without food and completely at fault as to which way to steer at length we ventured out into a highway by open daylight and good luck threw an old irish seaman who then lived by fishing in missing after a little conversation we told this old man we were deserters from a vessel of war and he seemed to like us all the better for it he had served himself and had a son impressed and seemed to like the english navy little better than we did ourselves he took us to a hut on the beach and fed us with fish potatoes and bread giving us a very comfortable and hearty meal we remained in this hut until sunset receiving a great deal of useful advice from the old man and then we left him we used some precaution in travelling sleeping in the woods but we kept moving by day as well as by night and halting only when tired and a good place offered we were not very well off for food though we brought a little from the fishermans hut and found quantities of winterberries by the wayside  we entered liverpool about eight at night and went immediately to the rendezvous of the privateer giving a little girl a shilling to be our guide the keeper of the rendezvous received us gladly and we shipped immediately of course we were lodged and fed in waiting for the schooner to come in each of us got four pounds bounty and both parties seemed delighted with the bargain to own the truth we now began to drink and the next day was pretty much a blank with us all the second day after breakfast the landlord rushed into our room with a newspaper in his hand and broke out upon us with a pretty string of names denouncing us for having told him we were deserters when we were only runaway yankees the twelve pounds troubled him and he demanded it back we laughed at him and advised him to be quiet and put us aboard the privateer he then told us the guard was after us hotfoot and that it was too late this proved to be true enough for in less than an hour an officer and a platoon of men had us in custody we had some fun in hearing the officer give it to the landlord who still kept talking about his twelve pounds the officer told him plainly that he was rightly served for attempting to smuggle off deserters and i suppose this was the reason no one endeavoured to get the money away from us except by words we kept the twelve pounds right or wrong  we were now put in a coaster and sent to halifax by water we were in irons but otherwise were well enough treated we were kept in the navyyard guardhouse at halifax several hours and were visited by a great many officers these gentlemen were curious to hear our story and we let them have it very frankly they laughed and said generally we were not to be blamed for trying to get off if their own lookouts were so bad as to let us we did not tell them however by what means we passed out of the prisonbarracks among the officers who came and spoke to us was an admiral sir isaac coffin this gentleman was a native american and was then in halifax to assist the nantucket men whom he managed to get exchanged his own nephew was said to be among them but him he would not serve as he had been captured in a privateer had he been captured in a manofwar or a merchantman he would have done all he could for him but as it was he let him go to dartmoorat least this was the story in the prison the old gentleman spoke very mildly to us and said he could not blame us for attempting to escape i do not think he had ever heard of the twelve pounds though none of the navy officers were sorry that the privateersmen should be punished as for us we considered them all enemies alike on whom it was fair enough to live in a time of war  we were sent back to the island and were quarantined again though it was for twenty days this time when we got pratique we learned that some one had told of the manner in which we got out of prison and crossbars had been placed in all the windows making them so many nine of diamonds this was blocking the channel and there was no more chance for getting off in that way  a grand conspiracy was now formed which was worthy of the men in prison the plan was to get possession of halifax itself and go off in triumph we were eighteen hundred prisoners in all though not very well off for officers about fifty of us entered into the plan at first nor did we let in any recruits for something like six weeks a mr crowninshield of salem was the head man among as he having been an officer in a privateer there were a good many privateer officers in the prison but they were berthed overhead and were intended to be separated from us at night the floor was lifted between us however and we held our communications by these means the officers came down at night and lent us a hand with the work  the scheme was very simple though i do not think it was at all difficult of execution the blackhole cells were beneath the prison and we broke through the floor into one of them from our bay a large messchest concealed the process in the daytime we worked in gangs of six digging and passing up the dirt into the nighttubs these tubs we were permitted to empty every morning in a tides way and thus we got rid of the dirt at the end of two months we had dug a passage wide enough for two abreast some twenty or thirty yards and were nearly ready to come up to the surface we now began to recruit swearing in each man on the whole we had got about four hundred names when the project was defeated by that great enemy which destroys so many similar schemes treachery we were betrayed as was supposed by one of our own number  had we got out the plan was to seize the heights of the island and get possession of the guns this effected it would have been easy to subdue the guard we then would have pushed for citadel hill which commanded halifax had we succeeded there we should have given john bull a great deal of trouble though no one could say what would have been the result hundreds would probably have got off in different craft even had the great plan failed we were not permitted to try the experiment however for one day we were all turned out and a party of english officers army and navy entered the barracks removed the messchest and surveyed our mine at their leisure a draft of six hundred was sent from the prison that day and was shipped for dartmoor and by the end of the week our whole number was reduced to some three or four hundred souls one of the julias went in this draft but all the rest of us were kept at halifax for some reason or other the english seemed to keep their eyes on us  i never gave up the hope of escaping and the excitement of the hope was beneficial to both body and mind we were too well watched however and conversation at night was even forbidden most of the officers were gone and this threw me pretty much on my own resources i have forgotten to say that lemuel bryant the man who fell at the breech of my gun at little york and whom i afterwards hauled into the scourges boat got off very early after our arrival at halifax he made two that got quite clear instead of the one i have already mentioned bryants escape was so clever as to deserve notice  one day a party of some thirty soldiers was called out for exchange under a capitulation among the names was that of lemuel bryant but the man happened to be dead our bryant had found this out beforehand and he rigged himself soldierfashion and answered to the name it is probable he ascertained the fact by means of some relationship which brought him in contact with the soldier previously to his death he met with no difficulty and i have never seen him since i have heard he is still living and that he receives a pension for the hurt he received at york well does he deserve it for no man ever had a narrower chance for his life  nothing new worthy of notice occurred for several months until one evening in march 1815 we heard a great rejoicing in halifax and presently a turnkey appeared on the walls and called out that england and america had made peace we gave three cheers and passed the night happy enough we had a bit of a row with the turnkeys about locking us in again for we were fierce for liberty but we were forced to submit for another night    chapter x    the following morning eight of the names that stood first on the prisonroll were called off to know if the men would consent to work a liberated swedish brig to new york i was one of the eight as was jack mallet and barnet wilcox one of those who had gone with us to bermuda had died and the rest were left on the island i never fell in with leonard lewis littlefield or any of the rest of those chaps after i quitted the prison lewis i think could not have lived long and as for littlefield i heard of him afterwards as belonging to the washington 74  the swede whose name was the venus was lying at the end of marchintons wharf a place that had been so familiar to me in boyhood we all went on board and i was not sorry to find that we were to haul into the stream immediately i had an extraordinary aversion to halifax which my late confinement had not diminished and had no wish to see a living soul in it jack mallet however took on himself the office of paying my sister a visit and of telling her where i was to be found this he did contrary to my wishes and without my knowledge though i think he meant to do me a favour the very day we hauled into the stream a boat came alongside us and i saw at a glance that harriet was in it i said a few words to her requesting her not to come on board but promising to visit her that evening which i did  i stayed several hours with my sister whom i found living with her husband she did not mention my fathers name to me at all and i learned nothing of my other friends if i ever had any or of my family her husband was a tailor and they gave me a good outfit of clothes and treated me with great kindness it struck me that the unaccountable silence of my father about us children had brought my sister down in the world a little but it was no affair of mine and as for myself i cared for no one after passing the evening with the family i went on board again without turning to the right or left to see a single soul more even the frasers were not visited so strong was my dislike to have anything to do with halifax  the venus took on board several passengers among whom were three or four officers of the navy lieutenant rapp and a midshipman randolph were among them and there were also several merchantmasters of the party we sailed two days after i joined the brig and had a ten or twelve days passage the moment the venus was alongside the wharf at new york we all left and found ourselves free men once more i had been a prisoner nineteen months and that was quite enough for me for the remainder of my life  we united states men reported ourselves the next day to captain evans the commandment of the brooklyn yard and after giving in our names we were advised to go on board the epervier which was then fitting out for the mediterranean under the command of captain downes to this we objected however as we wanted a cruise ashore before we took to the water again this was a lucky decision of ours though scarcely to be defended as to our views the epervier being lost and all hands perishing a few months later on her return passage from the straits  captain evans then directed us to report ourselves daily which we did but the press of business at washington prevented our cases from being attended to and being destitute of money while wages were high we determined with captain evans approbation to make a voyage each in the merchant service and to get our accounts settled on our return jack mallet barnet and i shipped therefore in another brig called the venus that was bound on a sealing voyage as was thought in some part of the world where seals were said to be plenty we were ignorant of the work or we might have discovered there was a deception intended from the outfit of the vessel she had no salt even while she had plenty of crosscut saws iron dogs chains c the brig sailed however and stood across the atlantic as if in good earnest when near the cape de verds the captain called us aft and told us he thought the season too far advanced for sealing and that if we would consent he would run down to st domingo and make an arrangement with some one there to cut mahogany on shares with fustick and lignumvitæ the secret was now out but what could we poor salts do the work we were asked to do turned out to be extremely laborious and i suppose we had been deceived on account of the difficulty of getting men just at that time for such a voyage there we were in the midst of the ocean and we agreed to the proposal pretty much as a matter of course  the brig now bore up and stood for st domingo she first went in to the city of st domingo where the arrangements were made and spaniards were got to help to cut the wood when we sailed for a bay of which i have forgotten the name and anchored near the shore the trees were sawed down about ten miles up a river and floated to its bar across which they had to be hauled by studdingsail halyards through the surf one man hauling two logs at a time made into a sort of raft sharks abounded and we had to keep a bright lookout lest they got a leg while we were busy with the logs i had a narrow escape from two while we lay at st domingo a man fell overboard and i went after him succeeding in catching the poor fellow a boat was dropped astern to pick us up and as we hauled the man in two large sharks came up close alongside this affair had set us drinking and i got a good deal of punch aboard the idea of remaining in the brig was unpleasant to me and i had thought of quitting her for some days a small schooner bound to america and short of hands lay near us and i had told the captain i would come and join him that night jack mallet and the rest tried to persuade me not to go but i had too much punch and grog in me to listen to reason when all hands aft were asleep therefore i let myself down into the water and swam quite a cableslength to the schooner one of the men was looking out for me he heard me in the water and stood ready to receive me as i drew near the schooner this man threw me a rope and helped me up the side but as soon as i was on the deck he told me to look behind me i did so and there i saw an enormous shark swimming about a fellow that was sixteen or eighteen feet long this shark i was told had kept company with me as long as i had been in sight from the schooner i cannot well describe the effect that was produced on me by this discovery when i entered the water i was under the influence of liquor but this escape sobered me in a minute so much so indeed that i insisted on being put in a boat and sent back to the brig which was done i was a little influenced in this however by some reluctance that was manifested to keep me on board the schooner i got on board the venus without being discovered and came to a resolution to stick by the craft until the voyage was up  we filled up with mahogany and took in a heavy deckload in the course of four months which was a most laborious process when ready the brig sailed for new york we encountered a heavy gale about a week out which swept away our deckload bulwarks c at this time the master supercargo mate cook and three of the crew were down with the fever leaving mallet barnet and myself to take care of the brig we three brought the vessel up as far as barnegat where we procured assistance and she arrived safe at the quarantine ground  as soon as we got pratique mallet barnet and myself went up to town to look after our affairs leaving the brig below the owners gave us thirty dollars each to begin upon we ascertained that our landlord had received our wages from government and held it ready for us sailor fashion i also sold my share in the venus voyage for one hundred and twenty dollars this gave me in all about five hundred dollars which money lasted me between five and six weeks how true is it that sailors make their money like horses and spend it like asses i cannot say this prodigal waste of my means afforded me any substantial gratification i have experienced more real pleasure from one day passed in a way of which my conscience could approve than from all the loose and thoughtless follies in which i was then in the habit of indulging when ashore of a whole life the manner in which this hardearned gold was thrown away may serve to warn some brother tar of the dangers that beset me and let the reader understand the real wants of so large a body of his fellowcreatures  on turning out in the morning i felt an approach to that which seamen call the horrors and continued in this state until i had swallowed several glasses of rum i had no appetite for breakfast and life was sustained principally by drink half of the time i ate no dinner and when i did it was almost drowned in grog occasionally i drove out in a coach or a gig and generally had something extra to pay for damages one of these cruises cost me forty dollars and i shall always think i was given a horse that sailed crabfashion on purpose to do me out of the money at night i generally went to the play and felt bound to treat the landlord and his family to tickets and refreshments we always had a coach to go in and it was a reasonable night that cost me only ten dollars at first i was a sort of king among beggars but as the money went neds importance went with it until one day the virtuous landlord intimated to me that it would be well as i happened to be sober to overhaul our accounts he then began to read from his books ten dollars for this twenty dollars for that and thirty for the other until i was soon tired and wanted to know how much was left i had still fifty dollars even according to his account of the matter and as that might last a week with good management i wanted to hear no more about the items  all this time i was separated from my old shipmates being left comparatively among strangers jack mallet had gone to join his friends in philadelphia and barnet went south whither i cannot say i never fell in with either of them again it being the fate of seamen to encounter the greatest risks and hardships in company and then to cut adrift from each other with little ceremony never to meet again i was still young being scarcely twoandtwenty and might even then have hauled in my oars and come to be an officer and a man  as i knew i must go to sea as soon as the accounts were balanced i began to think a little seriously of my prospects dissipation had wearied me and i wanted to go a voyage of a length that would prevent my falling soon into the same course of folly and vice i had often bitter thoughts as to my conduct nor was i entirely free from reflection on the subject of my peculiar situation i might be said to be without a friend or relative in the world when my hat was on my house was thatched of my father i knew nothing i have since ascertained he must then have been dead my sister was little to me and i never expected to see her again the separation from all my old lakers too gave me some trouble for i never met with one of them after parting from barnet and mallet with the exception of tom goldsmith and jack reilly tom and i fell in with each other on my return from st domingo in the streets of new york and had a yarn of two hours about old times this was all i ever saw of tom he had suffered a good deal with the english who kept him in kingston upper canada until the peace when they let him go with the rest as for reilly we have been in harbour together in our old age and i may speak of him again  under the feelings i have mentioned as soon as the looks of my landlord let me know that there were no more shot in the locker i shipped in a south sea whaler named the edward that was expected to be absent between two and three years she was a small vessel and carried only three boats i got a pretty good outfit from my landlord though most of the articles were secondhand we parted good friends however and i came back to him and played the same silly game more than once he was not a bad landlord as landlords then went and i make no doubt he took better care of my money than i should have done myself on the whole this class of men are not as bad as they seem though there are precious rascals among them the respectable sailor landlord is quite as good in his way as one could expect all things considered  the voyage i made in the edward was one of very little interest the ship being exceedingly successful the usage and living were good and the whaling must have been good too or we never should have been back again as soon as we were we went round the horn and took our first whale between the coast of south america and that of new holland i must have been present at the striking of thirty fish but never met with any accident i pulled a midship oar being a new hand at the business and had little else to do but keep clear of the line and look out for my paddle the voyage is now so common and the mode of taking whales is so well known that i shall say little about either we went off the coast of japan as it is called though a long bit from the land and we made new holland though without touching the return passage was by the cape of good hope and st helena we let go our anchor but once the whole voyage and that was at puna at the mouth of the guayaquil river on the coast of chili we lay there a week but with this exception the edward was actually under her canvass the whole voyage or eighteen months we did intend to anchor at st helena but were forbidden on account of bonaparte who was then a prisoner on the island as we stood in we were met by a manofwar brig that kept close to us until we had sunk the heights on our passage off again we were not permitted even to send a boat in for fresh grub  i sold my voyage in the edward for two hundred and fifty dollars and went back to my landlord in water street of course everybody was glad to see me a sailors importance in such places being estimated by the length of his voyage in wall street they used to call a man a hundred thousand dollar man and in water an eighteen months or a two years voyage man as none but whalers indiamen and statesmen could hold out so long we were all a no 1 for a fortnight or three weeks the manofwarsman is generally most esteemed his cruise lasting three years the lucky whaler comes next and the cantonman third the edward had been a lucky ship and insomuch i had been a lucky fellow i behaved far better this time however than i had done on my return from st domingo i kept sober more did not spend my money as foolishly or as fast and did not wait to be kicked out of doors before i thought of getting some more when i shipped anew i actually left a hundred dollars behind me in my landlords hands a very extraordinary thing for jack and what is equally worthy of notice i got it all again on my next return from sea  my steadiness was owing in a great measure to the following circumstances i fell in with two old acquaintances who had been in prison with me of the names of tibbets and wilson this tibbets was not the man who had been sent to bermuda with me but another of the same name these men had belonged to the gov tompkins privateer and had received a considerable sum in prizemoney on returning home they had used their money discreetly having purchased an english prizebrig at a low price and fitted her out on board the tompkins both had been foremost hands and in prison they had messed in our bay so that we had been hailfellowswellmet on melville island after getting this brig ready they had been to the west indies in her and were now about to sail for ireland they wished me to go with them and gave me so much good advice on the subject of taking care of my money that it produced the effect i have just mentioned  the name of the prizebrig was the susan though i forget from what small eastern port she hailed she was of about two hundred tons burthen but must havebeen old and rotten tibbets was master and wilson was chiefmate i shipped as a sort of secondmate keeping a watch though i lived forward at my own request we must have sailed about january 1818 bound to belfast there were fourteen of us altogether on board most of us downeasters our run off the coast was with a strong northwest gale which compelled us to heaveto the sea being too high for scudding finding that the vessel laboured very much however and leaked badly we kept off again and scudded for the rest of the blow on the whole we got out of this difficulty pretty well we got but two observations the whole passage but in the afternoon of the twentythird day out we made the coast of ireland close aboard in thick weather the wind directly on shore blowing a gale the brig was under closereefed topsails running free at the time and we found it necessary to haul up we now discovered the defects of old canvass and old rigging splitting the foretopsail foresail and foretopmaststaysail besides carrying away sheets c we succeeded in hauling up the foresail however and i went upon the yard and mended it after a fashion it was now nearly night and it blew in a way to need two men to hold one mans hair on his head i cannot say i thought much of our situation my principal concern being to get below with some warm dry clothes on we saw nothing of the land after the first halfhour but at midnight we wore ship and came up on the larboard tack the brig had hardly got round before the foretack went and the foresail split into ribands we let the sail blow from the yard by this time things began to look very serious though for some reason i felt no great alarm the case was different with tibbets and wilson who were uneasy about cape clear i had had a bit of a spat with them about waring believing myself that we should have gone clear of the cape on the starboard tack this prevented them saying much to me and we had little communication with each other that night to own the truth i was sorry i had shipped in such a craft her owners were too poor to give a seagoing vessel a proper outfit and they were too near my own level to create respect  the foretopsail had been mended as well as the foresail and was set anew the sheets went however about two in the morning and the sail flew from the reefband like a bit of muslin torn by a shopboy the brig now had nothing set but a closereefed maintopsail and this i expected every minute would follow the other canvass it rained blew tremendously and the sea was making constant breaches over us most of the men were fagged out some going below while others who remained on deck did or could do nothing at the same time it was so dark that we could not see the length of the vessel  i now went aft to speak to tibbets telling him i thought it was all over with us he had still some hope as the bay was deep and he thought light might return before we got to the bottom of it i was of a different opinion believing the brig then to be within the influence of the groundswell though not absolutely within the breakers all this time the people were quiet and there was no drinking indeed i hardly saw any one moving about it was an hour after the conversation with tibbets that i was standing holding on by the weathermainclewgarnet when i got a glimpse of breakers directly under our lee i sung out theres breakers and everybody must shift for himself at the next instant the brig rose on a sea settled in the trough and struck the blow threw me off my feet though i held on to the clewgarnet then i heard the crash of the foremast as it went down to leeward the brig rolled over on her beamends but righted at the next sea drove in some distance and down she came again with a force that threatened to break her up i bethought me of the mainmast and managed to get forward as far as the bitts in order to be out of its way it was well i did as i felt a movement as if her upper works were parting from the bottom i was near no one and the last person i saw or spoke to on board was tibbets who was then standing in the companionway this was an hour before the brig struck  there might have been an interval of half a minute between the time i reached the windlass and that in which i saw a tremendous white foaming sea rolling down upon the vessel at this ominous sight i instinctively seized the bitts for protection i can remember the rushing of the water down upon me and have some faint impressions of passing through a mass of rigging but this is all when i came to my senses it was in an irish mudcabin with an old woman and her daughter taking care of me my head was bandaged and most of the hair had been cut off in front i was stiff and sore all over me fortunately none of my bones were broken  the account given me of what had passed was this i was found by the old man who lived in the hut a fisherman and the husband of my nurse with some other persons lying on my face between two shelves of rock there was nothing very near me not even a bit of wood or a rope two lads that belonged to the brig were found not far from me both alive though both badly hurt one of them having had his thigh broken of the rest of the fourteen souls on board the susan there were no traces i never heard that even their bodies were found tibbets and wilson had gone with their old prize and anything but a prize did she prove to me i lost a good outfit and after belonging to her about three weeks here was i left naked on the shores of ireland i am sorry to say my feelings were those of repining rather than of gratitude of religion i had hardly a notion and i am afraid that all which had been driven into me in childhood was already lost in this state of mind i naturally felt more of the hardships i had endured than of the mercy that had been shown me i look back with shame at the hardness of heart which rendered me insensible to the many mercies i had received in escaping so often from the perils of my calling  it was three days after the wreck before i left my bed nothing could have been kinder than the treatment i received from those poor irish people certainly no reward was before them but that which heaven gives the merciful and yet i could not have been more cared for had i been their own son they fed me nursed me and warmed me without receiving any other return from me than my thanks i staid with them three weeks doing nothing on account of the bruises i had received the susans had been a thorough wreck not enough of her could be found of which to build a launch her cargo was as effectually destroyed as her hull and to say the truth it took but little to break her up as for the two lads i could not get as far as the cabin in which they had been put it was two or three miles along the coast and having no shoes i could not walk that distance over the sharp stones several messages passed between us but i never saw a single soul that belonged to the brig after the last look i had of tibbets in the companionway  a coaster passing near the cabin and it falling calm the fisherman went off to her told my story and got a passage for me to liverpool i now took my leave of these honest people giving them all i hadmy sincere thanksand went on board the sloop here i was well treated nor did any one expect me to work we reached liverpool the second day and i went and hunted up molly hutson the landlady with whom the crew of the sterling had lodged when captain b had her the old woman helped me to some clothes received me well and seemed sorry for my misfortunes as it would not do to remain idle however i shipped on board the robert burns and sailed for new york within the week i got no wages but met with excellent treatment and had a very short winter passage in less than three months after i left him i was back again with my old landlord who gave me my hundred dollars without any difficulty i had sailed with him in the sterling and he always seemed to think of me a little differently from what landlords generally think of jack  a good deal was said among my associates now about the advantages of making a voyage to the coast of ireland for the purpose of smuggling tobacco and i determined to try my hand at one of the morality of smuggling i have nothing to say i would not make such a voyage now if i know myself but poor sailors are not taught to make just distinctions in such things and the merchants must take their share of the shame i fear there are few merchants and fewer seamen manofwar officers excepted who will not smuggle13  i laid out most of my hundred dollars in getting a new outfit and then shipped in a small pilotboatbuilt schooner called the mdonough bound to ireland to supply such honest fellows as my old fisherman with good tobacco cheap our cargo was in small bales being the raw material intended to be passed by hand we had seventeen hands before the mast but carried no armament pistols c excepted the schooner sailed like a witch carrying only two gafftopsails we made the land in fourteen days after we left the hook our port being tory island off the northwest coast of ireland we arrived in the daytime and showed a signal which was answered in the course of the day by a smoke on some rocks a large boat then came off to us and we filled her with tobacco the same evening in the course of the night we had despatched four or five more boats loaded with the same cargo but as day approached we hauled our wind and stood off the land next night we went in again and met more boats and the succeeding morning we hauled off as before when we saw a boat we hailed and asked if they were outward bound if the answer was satisfactory we brailed the foresail and permitted the boat to come alongside in this manner we continued shoving cargo ashore for quite a week sometimes falling in with only one boat of a night and at others with three or four just as it might happen we had got about twothirds of the tobacco out and a boat had just left us on the morning of the sixth or seventh day when we saw a manofwar brig coming round tory island in chase at this sight we hauled up close on a wind it blowing very fresh as the english never employed any but the fastest cruisers for this station we had a scratching time of it the brig sailed very fast and outcarried us but our little schooner held on well for two days and one night we had it tack and tack with her the brig certainly gained on us our craft carrying a balanced reefedmainsail bonnet off the foresail and one reef in and bonnet off the jib the flyingjib was inboard at sunset on the second night the brig was so near us we could see her people and it was blowing fresher than ever this was just her play while ours was in more moderate weather our skipper got uneasy now and determined to try a trick it set in dark and rainy and as soon as we lost sight of the brig we tacked stood on a short distance lowered everything and extinguished all our lights we lay in this situation three hours when we stuck the craft down again for tory island as straight as we could go i never knew what became of the brig which may be chasing us yet for aught i know for i saw no more of her next day we had the signal flying again and the smoke came up from the same rock as before it took us three days longer to get all the tobacco ashore in consequence of some trouble on the island but it all went in the end and went clear as i was told one or two boatloads excepted the cargo was no sooner out than we made sail for new york where we arrived in another short passage we were absent but little more than two months and my wages and presents came to near one hundred dollars i never tried the tobacco trade again    chapter xi    i now stayed ashore two months i had determined to study navigation and to try to get off the forecastle in which wise course i was encouraged by several discreet friends i had fallen in with a young woman of respectable character and agreeable person and to own the truth was completely in irons with her i believe a mother is a good deal more on the lookout than a father in such matters for i was overhauled by the old woman and questioned as to my intentions about sarah whereas the old man was somewhat more moderate i confessed my wish to marry her daughter but the old woman thought i was too wild which was not sarahs opinion i believe had we been left to ourselves we should have got married though i was really desirous of going out once as an officer before i took so important a step i have sometimes suspected that sarahs parents had a hand in getting me shipped again as they were intimate with the captain who now proposed to take me with him as his secondmate i consented to go with some reluctance but on the whole thought it was the best thing i could do my reluctance proceeded from desire to remain with sarah when the time came though the berth was exactly the thing i wanted whenever i reasoned coolly on the subject  i shipped accordingly in a vessel of the costers called the william and jane bound to holland and canton as her secondmate my leavetaking with sarah was very tender and i believe we both felt much grieved at the necessity of parting nothing occurred on the passage out worth mentioning i got along with my duty well enough for i had been brokenin on board the sterling and one or two other vessels we went to the texel but found some difficulty in procuring dollars which caused us to return to new york after getting only twenty thousand we had no other return cargo with the exception of a little gin we were absent five months and i found sarah as pretty and as true as ever i did not quit the vessel however but finding my knowledge of the lunars too limited i was obliged to go backward a littlebecoming thirdmate we were a month in new york and it was pretty hard work to keep from eloping with sarah but i clawed off the breakers as well as i could i gave her a silver thimble and told her to take it to a smith and get our joint names cut on it which she did the consequences of this act will be seen in the end  we had a little breeze on board the ship before we could get off the people refusing to sail with a new firstmate that had joined her it ended by getting another mate when we went to sea i believe that no other vessel ever went out with such articles as our crew insisted on the men stipulated for three quarts of water a day and the forenoons watch below all this was put in black and white and it gave us some trouble before we got to our destination  our passage out was a very long one lasting two hundred and ten days when we got into the trades we stripped one mast after the other to a girtline overhauling everything and actually getting new gangs of rigging up over the lowermastheads we were a long time about it but lost little or nothing in distance as the ship was going before the wind the whole time with everything packed on the masts that were rigged before overhauling the rigging we fell in with an english ship called the general blucher and kept company with her for quite a fortnight while the two ships were together we were chased by a strange brig that kept in sight three or four days evidently watching us and both vessels suspected him of being a pirate as we had six guns and thirtyone souls and the blucher was at least as strong the two captains thought by standing by each other they might beat the fellow off should he attack us the brig frequently came near enough to get a good look at us and then dropped astern he continued this game several days until he suddenly hauled his wind and left us our ship would have been a famous prize having it was said no less than two hundred and fifty thousand spanish dollars on board  we parted company with the blucher in a heavy gale our ship bearing up for rio after getting rid of some of our ballast however and changing the cargo of piglead our vessel was easier and did not go in nothing further occurred worth mentioning until we got off van diemens land two days after seeing the land a boy fell from the foretopgallant yard while reeving the studdingsail halyards i had just turned in after eating my dinner having the watch below when i heard the cry of a man overboard running on deck as i was i jumped into a quarterboat followed by four men and we were immediately lowered down the ship was roundedto and i heard the poor fellow calling out to me by name to save him i saw him astern very plainly while on the ships quarter but lost sight of him as soon as the boat was in the water the skylighthood had been thrown overboard and was floating in the ships wake we steered for that but could neither see nor hear anything more of the poor fellow we got his hat and we picked up the hood of the skylight but could not find the boy he had unquestionably gone down before we reached the spot where he had been floating as his hat must have pointed out the place we got the hat first and then seeing nothing of the lad we pulled back to take in the hood which was quite large while employed in taking it in a squall passed over the boat which nearly blew it away from us being very busy in securing the hood no one had leisure to look about but the duty was no sooner done than one of the men called out that he could not see the ship sure enough the william and jane had disappeared and there we were left in the middle of the ocean in a sixoared pinnace without a morsel of food and i myself without hat shoes jacket or trowsers in a word i had nothing on me but my drawers and a flannel shirt fortunately the captain kept a breaker of fresh water in each boat and we had a small supply of this great requisiteenough perhaps to last five men two or three days  all our boats had sails but those of the pinnace had been spread on the quarterdeck to dry and we had nothing but the ash to depend on at first we pulled to leeward but the weather was so thick we could not see a cableslength and our search for the vessel in that direction proved useless at the end of an hour or two we ceased rowing and held a consultation i proposed to pull in the direction of the land which was pulling to windward if the ship should search for us it would certainly be in that quarter and if we should miss her altogether our only chance was in reaching the shore there we might find something to eat of which there was little hope out on the ocean the men did not relish the idea of quitting the spot but after some talk they came into my plan  it remained thick weather all that afternoon night and succeeding day until about noon we were without a compass and steered by the direction of the wind and sea occasionally it lightened up a little so as to show us a star or two or during the day to permit us to see a few miles around the boat but we got no glimpse of the ship it blew so heavily that we made no great progress in my judgment doing very little more than keeping the boat head to sea could we have pulled four oars this might not have been the case but we took it watch and watch two men pulling while two tried to get a little rest under the shelter of the hood i steered as long as i could but was compelled to row part of the time to keep myself warm in this manner were passed about sixandtwenty of the most unpleasant hours of my life when some of us thought they heard the report of a distant gun i did not believe it but after listening attentively some ten or fifteen minutes another report was heard beyond all dispute dead to leeward of us  this signal produced a wonderful effect on us all the four oars were manned and away we went before the wind and sea as fast as we could pull i steering for the reports as they came heavily up to windward at intervals of about a quarter of an hour three or four of these guns were heard each report sounding nearer than the other to our great joy until i got a glimpse of the ship about two miles distant from us she was on the starboard tack close hauled a proof she was in search of us with topgallantsails set over singlereefed topsails she was drawing ahead of us fast however and had we not seen her as we did we should have crossed her wake and been lost without a hope by running to leeward we altered our course the instant she was seen but what could a boat do in such a sea pulling after a fast ship under such canvass perhaps we felt more keen anxiety after we saw the ship than we did before since we beheld all the risk we ran never shall i forget the sensations with which i saw her start her maintack and haul up the sail the foresail and topgallantsail followed and then the mainyard came round and laid the topsail aback everything seemed to fly on board her and we knew we were safe in a few minutes we were alongside the boat was at the davits the helm was up and the old barky squared away for china  we in the boat were all pretty well fagged out with hunger toil and exposure i was the worst off having so little clothing in cool weather and i think another day would have destroyed us all unless we had taken refuge in the wellknown dreadful alternative of seamen the captain was delighted to see us as indeed were all hands they had determined to turn to windward on short tacks until they made the land the best thing that could have been done and the course that actually saved us  when we got into the latitude of port jackson the crew was put on two quarts of water a man three quarts having been stipulated for in the articles this produced a mutiny the men refusing duty this was awkward enough in that distant sea the captain took advantage of the mens going below however to secure the scuttle and keep them there he then mustered us who lived aft six men and three boys and laid the question before us whether we would take the ship into canton or go into port jackson and get some water he admitted we were about seventyfive days run from cauton but he himself leaned to the plan of continuing on our course we saw all the difficulties before us and told him of them  there were twenty men below and to carry them eight or ten thousand miles in that situation would have been troublesome to say the least and might have caused the death of some among them we were armed and had no apprehensions of the people but we did not like to work a ship of five hundred tons with so few hands onethird of whom were boys so great a distance the crew moreover had a good deal of right on their side the articles stipulating that they should have the water and this water was to be had a short distance to windward  the captain yielded to our reasoning and we beat up to port jackson where we arrived in three or four days the people were then sent to prison as mutineers and we watered the ship we were in port a fortnight thus occupied all this time the men were in gaol no men were to be had and then arose the question about trusting the old crew there was no choice and the ship being ready to sail we received the people on board again and turned them all to duty we had no further trouble with them however the fellows behaving perfectly well as men commonly will who have been once put down no mutiny is dangerous when the officers are apprized of its existence and are fairly ready to meet it the kings name is a tower of strength  we arrived at canton in due time and found our cargo ready for us we took it in and sailed again for the texel in three weeks our passage to europe was two hundred and eleven days but we met with no accident at the texel i found two letters from new york one being from sarah and the other from a female friend sarah was married to the very silversmith who had engraven our names on the thimble this man saw her for the first time when she carried that miserable thimble to him fell in love with her and being in good circumstances her friends prevailed on her to have him her letter to me admitted her error and confessed her unhappiness but there was no remedy i did not like the idea of returning to new york under the circumstances and resolved to quit the ship i got my discharge therefore from the william and jane and left her never seeing the vessel afterwards  there was a small baltimore ship called the wabash at the texel getting ready for canton and i entered on board her as a foremast jack again my plan was to quit her in china and to remain beyond the capes for ever the disappointment in my matrimonial plans had soured me and i wanted to get as far from america as i could this was the turning point of my life and was to settle my position in my calling i was now twentyseven and when a man gets sternway on him at that age he must sail a good craft ever to work his way into his proper berth again  the wabash had a good passage out without any unusual occurrence on her arrival at canton i told the captain my views and he allowed me to go i was now adrift in the imperial empire with a couple of hundred dollars in my pocket and a chest full of good clothes so far all was well and i began to look about me for a berth we had found an english country ship lying at whampao smuggling opium and i got on board of her as thirdmate a few days after i quitted the wabash this was the first and only time i ever sailed under the english flag for i do not call my other passages in english vessels sailing under the flag though it was waving over my head my new ship was the hope of calcutta commanded by captain kid or kyd i forget which the vessel was built of teak and had been a frigate in the portuguese service she was so old no one knew exactly when she was built but sailed like a witch her crew consisted principally of lascars with a few europeans and negroes as is usual in those craft my wages did not amount to much in dollars but everything was so cheap they counted up in the long run i had perquisites too which amounted to something handsome they kept a very good table  the hope had a good deal of opium when i joined her and it was all to be smuggled before we sailed as this trade has made a great deal of noise latterly i will relate the manner in which we disposed of the drug of the morality of this species of commerce i have no more to say in its defence than i had of the tobacco voyage unless it be to aver that were i compelled now to embark in one of the two it should be to give the countrymen of my honest fisherman cheap tobacco in preference to making the chinese drunk on opium  our opium was packed in wooden boxes of forty cylinders weighing about ten pounds each cylinder of course each box weighed about four hundred pounds the main cargo was cotton and saltpetre and ebony but there were four hundred boxes of this opium  the sales of the article were made by the captain up at the factory they seldom exceeded six or eight boxes at a time and were oftener two or three the purchaser then brought or sent an order on board the ship for the delivery of the opium he also provided bags the customhouse officers did not remain in the ship as in other countries but were on board a large armed boat hanging astern these crafts are called hoppoo boats this arrangement left us tolerably free to do as we pleased on board if an officer happened to come on board however we had early notice of it of course as thirdmate it was my duty to see the boxes taken out of the hold and the opium delivered the box was opened and the cylinders counted off and stowed in the bags which were of sizes convenient to handle all this was done on the gundeck the purchaser receiving possession of his opium on board us it was his loss if anything failed afterwards  as soon as the buyer had his opium in the bags he placed the latter near two or three open ports amidships and hung out a signal to the shore this signal was soon answered and then it was look out for the smuggling boats these smuggling boats are long swift craft that have doublebanked paddles frequently to the number of sixty men they are armed and are swift as arrows when all is ready they appear suddenly on the water and dash alongside of the vessel for which they are bound and find the labourers of the purchaser standing at the ports with the bags of cylinders ready these bags are thrown into the boat the purchaser and his men tumble after them and away she paddles like a racer the whole operation occupies but a minute or two  as soon as the hoppoo boat sees what is going on it begins to blow conches this gives the alarm and then follows a chase from an armed customhouse boat of which there are many constantly plying about it always appeared to me that the customhouse people were either afraid of the smugglers or that they were paid for not doing their duty i never saw any fight or seizure though i am told such sometimes happen i suppose it is in china as it is in other parts of the world that men occasionally do their whole duty but that they oftener do not if the connivance of customhouse officers will justify smuggling in china it will justify smuggling in london and possibly in new york  we not only smuggled cargo out but we smuggled cargo in the favourite prohibited article was a species of metal that came in plates like tin or copper of which we took in large quantities it was brought to us by the smugglingboats and thrown on board very much as the opium was taken out and we stowed it away in the hold all this was done in the daytime but i never heard of any ones following the article into the ship once there it appeared to be considered safe then we got sycee silver which was prohibited for exportation all came on board in the same manner for every box of opium sold the mate got a china dollar as a perquisite of course my share on four hundred boxes came to one hundred and thirtythree of these dollars or about one hundred and sixteen of our own i am ashamed to say there was a great deal of cheating all round each party evidently regarding the other as rogues and instead of doing as they would be done by doing as they thought they were done by  the hope sailed as soon as the opium was sold about a month and had a quick passage to calcutta i now began to pick up a little bengalee and before i left the trade could work a ship very well in the language the lascars were more like monkeys than men aloft though they wanted strength a topsail that six of our common men would furl would employ twenty of them this was partly from habit perhaps though they actually want physical force they eat little besides rice and are small in frame we had a curious mode of punishing them when slack aloft our standing rigging was of grass and wiry enough to cut even hands that were used to it the ratlines were not seized to the forward and after shrouds by means of eyes as is done in our vessels but were made fast by a round turn and stopping back the ends we used to take down all the ratlines and make the darkies go up without them in doing this they took the rigging between the great and second toe and walked up instead of shinning it like christians this soon gave them sore toes and they would beg hard to have the ratlines replaced on the whole they were easily managed and were respectful and obedient we had near a hundred of these fellows in the hope and kept them at work by means of a boatswain and four mates all countrymen of their own in addition we had about thirty more souls including the europeanschristians as we were called  at calcutta we loaded with cotton and returned to canton having another short passage we had no opium in the ship this time it being out of season but we smuggled cargo in as before we lay at whampao a few weeks and returned to calcutta by this time the hope was dying of old age and captain kyd began to think if he did not bury her she might bury him her beams actually dropped as we removed the cotton at canton though she still remained tight but it would have been dangerous to encounter heavy weather in her  a new ship called the hopping castle had been built by captain kyds fatherinlaw expressly for him she was a stout large vessel and promised to sail well the officers wore all transferred to her but most of the old lascars refused to ship on account of a quarrel with the boatswain this compelled us to ship a new set of these men most of whom were strangers to us  by a law of calcutta if anything happens to a vessel before she gets to sea the people retain the two months advance it is customary to give them this rule brought us into difficulty the hopping castle cleared for bombay with a light cargo we had dropped down the river discharged the pilot and made sail on our course when a fire suddenly broke up out of the forehatch a quantity of grass junk and two or three cables of the same material were in that part of the ship and they all burnt like tinder i went with the other officers and threw overboard the powder but it was useless to attempt extinguishing the flames luckily there were two pilot brigs still near us and they came alongside and received all hands the hopping castle burnt to the waters edge and we saw her wreck go down this was a short career for so fine a ship and it gave us all great pain all but the rascals of lascars i lost everything i had in the world in her but a few clothes i saved in a small trunk i had little or no money calcutta being no place for economy in a country in which it is a distinction to be a white man and called a christian one must maintain his dignity by a little extravagance  captain kyd felt satisfied that the lascars had set his ship on fire and he had us all landed on tiger island here the serang or boatswain took the matter in hand and attempted to find out the facts i was present at the proceeding and witnessed it all it was so remarkable as to deserve being mentioned the men were drawn up in rings of twenty or thirty each and the boatswain stood in the centre he then put a little white powder into each mans hand and ordered him to spit in it the idea was that the innocent men would spit without any difficulty while the mouths of the guilty would become too dry and husky to allow them to comply at any rate the serang picked out ten men as guilty and they were sent to calcutta to be tried i was told afterwards that all these ten men admitted their guilt criminated two more and that the whole twelve were subsequently hanged in chains near castle william of the legal trial and execution i know nothing unless by report but the trial by spittle i saw with my own eyes and it was evident the lascars looked upon it as a very serious matter i never saw criminals in court betray more uneasiness than these fellows while the serang was busy with them  i was now out of employment captain kyd wished me to go on an indigo plantation offering me high wages i never drank at sea and had behaved in a way to gain his confidence i believe so that he urged me a good deal to accept his offers i would not consent however being afraid of death there was a philadelphia ship called the benjamin rush at calcutta and i determined to join her by this time i felt less on the subject of my disappointment and had a desire to see home again i shipped accordingly in the vessel mentioned as a foremast hand we sailed soon after and had a pleasant passage to the capes of the delaware which i now entered again for the first time since i had done so on my return from my original voyage on the sterling  as soon as paid off i proceeded to new york i was short of cash and my old landlord being dead i had to look about me for a new ship this time i went in a brig called the boxer a clipper belonging to john jacob astor bound to canton this proved to be a pleasant and successful voyage so far as the vessel was concerned at least the brig being back at new york again eight months after we sailed i went in her before the mast  my money was soon gone and i was obliged to ship again i now went as secondmate in the trio an old english prizeship belonging to david dunham we were bound to batavia and sailed in january after being a short time at sea we found all our water gone with the exception of one cask the remainder had been lost by the bursting of the hoops in consequence of the waters having frozen we went on a short allowance and suffered a good deal by the privation our supercargo a young gentleman of the name of croes came near dying we went on however intending to go into one of the cape de verdes we got up our casks and repaired them in the meanwhile off the island of fuego we hove to and found we could get no water we got a few goats and a little fruit but were compelled to proceed luckily it came on to rain very hard and we stopped all the scuppers filling every cask we had in this easy manner we began about eight at night and were through before morning capital water it proved and it lasted us to batavia there indeed it would even have brought a premium being so much better than anything to be had in that port it changed but sweetened itself very soon  we first went into batavia and entered the ship after which we sailed for a roadstead called terragall to take in rice the vessel was in ballast and had brought money to make her purchases with we got our cargo off in boats and sailed for batavia to clear all within a few weeks the second night out the ship struck in fair weather and a moderate sea on a mudbank and brought up all standing we first endeavoured to force the vessel over the bank but this did not succeed and the tide leaving her the ship fell over on her bilge bringing her gunwales under water luckily she lay quiet though a good deal strained the captain now took a boat and four men and pulled ashore to get prows to lighten the vessel we had but eight men before the mast and six aft this of course left only nine souls on board that night nothing occurred but in the morning early two piratical prows approached and showed a disposition to board us mr croes was the person who saved the ship he stuck up handspikes and other objects about deck putting hats and caps on them so as to make us appear very stronghanded at the same time we got a couple of sixes to bear on the prows and succeeded in keeping them at a safe distance they hovered about until sunset when they left us pulling ashore just as they were quitting us twentyseven boats hove in sight and we made a signal to them which was not answered we set them down as enemies too but as they came nearer we perceived our own boat among them and felt certain it was the captain  we discharged everything betwixt decks into the boats that night and got the ship afloat before morning we now hove clear of the bank restowed the cargo and made sail for batavia the ship leaked badly and kept us hard at the pumps as there were no means for repairing the vessel where we were it was resolved to take in extra hands ship two boxpumps and carry the vessel to the isle of france in order to repair her i did not like the prospect of such a passage and confess i played old soldier to get rid of it i contrived to get on a sick ticket into the hospital and the ship sailed without me at the isle of france the trio was condemned her hulk being in truth much worse than my own docked though i was    chapter xii    as soon as the trio was off i got well little did i then think of the great risk i ran in going ashore for it was almost certain death for an european to land for any length of time at that season still less did i or could i anticipate what was to happen to myself in this very hospital a few years later or how long i was to be one of its truly suffering and i hope repentant inmates the consul was frank enough to tell me that i had been shamming abraham and i so far imitated his sincerity as distinctly to state it was quite true i thought the old trio ought to have been left on the bank where providence had placed her but it being the pleasure of her captain and the supercargo to take her bones to the isle of france for burial i did not choose to go so far weeping through the pumps to attend her funeral  as the consul held my wages and refused to give me any money i was compelled to get on board some vessel as soon as i could batavia was not a place for an american constitution and i was glad to be off i shipped before the mast in the clyde of salem a good little ship with good living and good treatment we sailed immediately but not soon enough to escape the batavia fever two of the crew died about a week out and were buried in the straits of banca the day we lost sight of java head it came on to blow fresh and we had to take in the jib and doublereef the topsails a man of the name of day went down on the bowsprit shrouds to clear the jibsheets when the ship made a heavy pitch and washed him away the second mate and myself got into the boat and were lowered as soon as the ship was roundedto there was a very heavy sea on but we succeeded in finding the poor fellow who was swimming with great apparent strength his face was towards the boat and as we came near i rose and threw the blade of my oar towards him calling out to him to be of good cheer at this instant day seemed to spring nearly his length out of water and immediately sunk what caused this extraordinary effort and sudden failure was never known i have sometimes thought a shark must have struck him though i saw neither blood nor fish the man was hopelessly lost and we returned to the ship feeling as seamen always feel on such occasions  a few days later another man died of the fever this left but five of us in the forecastle with the ship a long way to the eastward of the cape of good hope before we got up with the cape another foremast hand went crazy and instead of helping us became a cause of much trouble for the rest of the passage in the end he died mad we had now only three men in a watch the officers included and of course it was trick and trick at the helm notwithstanding all this we did very well having a good run until we got on the coast which we reached in the month of january a northwester drove us off and we had a pretty tough week of it but brought the ship up to the hook at the end of that time and anchored her safely in the east river the clyde must have been a ship of about three hundred tons and including every one on board nine of us sailed her from the eastward of the cape to her port without any serious difficulty  i did not stay long ashore for the money went like smoke but shipped in a brig called the margaret bound to belfast this vessel struck in the irish channel but she was backed off with little difficulty and got safe into her port the return passage was pleasant and without any accident  such a voyage left little to spend and i was soon on the lookout for a fresh berth i shipped this time as mate in a brig called the william henry bound on a smuggling voyage to the coast of spain we took in tobacco segars c c and the brig dropped down to staten island here i quarrelled with the captain about some cotton wick and i threw up my situation i knew there were more ships than parish churches and felt no concern about finding a place in one up at town the balance of my advance was paid back and i left the smuggling trade like an honest man i only wish this change of purpose had proceeded from a better motive  my next windfall was jacks berth on board a beautiful little schooner called the ida that was to sail for curaçoa in the hope of being purchased by the governor of the island or a yacht i expected to find my way to the spanish main after the craft was sold we got out without any accident going into port of a sunday morning the same morning an english frigate and a sloopofwar came in and anchored that afternoon these vessels commenced giving liberty to their men we were alongside of a wharf and in the afternoon our crew took a drift in some public gardens in the suburbs of the town here an incident occurred that is sufficiently singular to be mentioned  i was by myself in the garden ruminating on the past and i suppose looking melancholy and in the market when i perceived an english manofwarsman eyeing me pretty closely after a while he came up and fell into discourse with me something that fell from him made me distrust him from the first and i acted with great caution after sounding me for some time he inquired if i had any berth i told him no he then went on little by little until he got such answers as gave him confidence when he let me into the secret of his real object he said he belonged to the frigate and had liberty until next morningthat he and four of his shipmates who were ashore had determined to get possession of the pretty little yankee schooner that was lying alongside of the telegraph at the wharf and carry her down to laguayra all this was to be done that night and he wished me to join the party by what fell from this man i made no doubt his design was to turn pirate after he had sold the flour then in the ida i encouraged him to so on and we drank together until he let me into his whole plan the scheme was to come on board the schooner after the crew had turned in to fasten all hands below set the foresail and jib and run out with the landbreeze a thing that was feasible enough considering there is never any watch kept in merchantvessels that lie at wharves  after a long talk i consented to join the enterprise and agreed to be at nine oclock on board the telegraph a philadelphia ship outside of which our schooner lay this vessel had a crew of blacks and as most of them were then ashore it was supposed many would not return to her that night my conspirator observedthe yankees that belong to the schooner are up yonder in the garden and will be half drunk so they will all be sound asleep and can give us little trouble i remember he professed to have no intention of hurting any of us but merely to run away with us and sell the craft from under us we parted with a clear understanding of the manner in which everything was to be done  i know no other reason why this man chose to select me for his companion in such an adventure than the circumstance that i happened to be alone and perhaps i may have looked a little under the weather he was no sooner gone however than i managed to get near my shipmates and to call them out of the garden one by one as we went away i told them all that had happened and we laid our counterplot when we reached the telegraph it was near night and finding only two of the blacks on board her we let them into the secret and they joined us heart and hand we got something to drink as a matter of course and tried to pass the time as well as we could until the hour for springing the mine should arrive  pretty punctually to the hour we heard footsteps on the quay and then a gang of men stopped alongside of the ship we stowed ourselves under the bulwarks and presently the gentlemen came on board one by one the negroes were too impatient however springing out upon their prey a little too soon we secured three of the rascals but two escaped us by jumping down upon the quay and running considering we were all captains this was doing pretty well  our three chaps were englishmen and i make no doubt belonged to the frigate as stated as soon as they were fairly pinned and they understood there was no officer among us they began to beg they said their lives would be forfeited if we gave them up and they entreated us to let them go we kept them about half an hour and finally yielded to their solicitations giving them their liberty again they were very thankful for their escape especially as i told them what had passed between myself and the man in the garden this fellow was one of the two that escaped and had the appearance of a man who might very well become a leader among pirates  the next day the two menofwar went to sea and i make no doubt carried off the intended pirates in them as for us seamen we never told our own officers anything about the affair for i was not quite satisfied with myself after letting the scoundrels go one scarcely knows what to do in such a case as one does not like to be the means of getting a fellowcreature hanged or of letting a rogue escape a pirate of all scoundrels deserves no mercy and yet jack does not relish the idea of being a sort of jack ketch neither if the thing were to be done over again i think i should hold on to my prisoners  we discharged our cargo of flour and failing in the attempt to sell the schooner we took in dyewood and returned to new york i now made a serious attempt to alter my mode of living and to try to get up a few rounds of the great ladder of life hitherto i had felt a singular indifference whether i went to sea as an officer or as a foremast jack with the exception of the time i had a marriage with sarah in view but i was now drawing near to thirty and if anything was to be done it must be done at once looking about me i found a brig called the hippomenes bound to gibraltar and back i shipped before the mast but kept a reckoning and did all i could to qualify myself to become an officer we had a winter passage out but a pleasant one home nothing worthy of being recorded however occurred i still continued to be tolerably correct and after a short stay on shore i shipped in the belle savage commanded by one of the liberated halifax prisoners who had come home in the swede at the time of my own return this person agreed to take me as chief mate and i shipped accordingly the belle savage was a regular curacoa trader and we sailed ten or twelve days after the hippomenes got in our passages both ways were pleasant and safe and i stuck by the craft endeavouring to be less thoughtless and careless about myself i cannot say however i had any very serious plans for making provision for old age my maxim being to live as i went along  our second passage out to curacoa in the belle savage was pleasant and brought about nothing worthy of being mentioned at curacoa we took in mahogany and in so doing a particularly large log got away from us and slid end on against the side of the vessel we saw no consequences at the time and went on to fill up with different articles principally dyewoods coffee cocoa c we got some passengers among whom was a jew merchant who had a considerable amount of money on board when ready we sailed being thirty souls in all crew and passengers included  the belle savage had cleared the islands and was standing on her course one day with a fair wind and a five or six knot breeze under a foretopmast studdingsail everything looking bright and prosperous the brig must have been about a days run to the southward of bermuda it was my watch below but having just breakfasted i was on deck and looking about me carelessly i was struck with the appearance of the vessels being deeper than common i had a little conversation about it with a man in the forechains who thought the same thing this man leaned over in order to get a better look when he called out that he could see that we had started a butt i went over immediately and got a look at this serious injury a butt had started sure enough just under the chains but so low down as to be quite out of our reach the plank had started quite an inch and it was loosened as much as two feet forward and aft we sounded the pumps as soon as possible and found the brig was half full of water  all hands were now called to get both the boats afloat and there was certainly no time to be lost the water rose over the cabinfloor while we were doing it we did not stand to get up tackles but cut away the rail and launched the longboat by hand we got the passengers men women children and servants into her as fast as possible and followed ourselves fortunately there had been a brig in company for some time and she was now less than two leagues ahead of us outsailing the belle savage a little we had hoisted our ensign union down as a signal of distress and well knew she must see that our craft had sunk after it happened if she did not observe our ensign she perceived the signal however and could not fail to notice the manner in which the brig was all adrift as soon as we deserted the helm the strange brig had hauled up for us even before we got out the launch this rendered any supply of food or water unnecessary and we were soon ready to shove off i was in the small boat with three men we pulled off a little distance and lay looking at our sinking craft with saddened eyes even the gold that precious dust which lures so many souls to eternal perdition was abandoned in the hurry to save the remnants of lives to be passed on earth the belle savage settled quite slowly into the ocean one sail disappearing after another her mainroyal being the last thing that went out of sight looking like the lug of a manofwars boat on the water it is a solemn thing to see a craft thus swallowed up in the great vortex of the ocean  the brig in sight proved to be the mary of new york from st thomas bound home she received us kindly and six days later landed us all at no great distance from fulton market when my foot touched the wharf my whole estate was under my hat and my pockets were as empty as a vessel with a swept hold on the wharf itself i saw a man who had been secondmate of the tontine the little ship in which i had sailed when i first ran from the sterling he was now master of a brig called the mechanic that was loading near by for trinidad de cuba he heard my story and shipped me on the spot at nine dollars a month as a forward hand i began to think i was born to bad luck and being almost naked was in nowise particular what became of me i had not the means of getting a mates outfit though i might possibly have got credit but at no period of my life did i run in debt here then my craft got sternway on her again and i had a long bit of rough water to go over  the mechanic sailed four or five days after the mary arrived and i travelled the old road over again nothing happened until we got to the southward of cuba but my bad luck had thrown me into the west india trade at the very moment when piracy was coming to its height in those seas though i never thought on the subject at all off the isle of pines one morning we made a schooner and a sloop inshore of us and both bore up in chase we knew them to be pirates and crowded sail dead before the wind to get clear the captain determined if necessary to run down as far as jamaica where he expected to fall in with some of the english cruisers the schooner sailed very fast and was for coming up with us but they made the mistake of setting a flyingtopsail on board her and from that moment we dropped her it was thought in our brig that the little craft buried too much with such a pressure aloft the chase lasted all day a sunday and a part of the night but the following morning nothing was to be seen of either of our pursuers our captain whose name was ray thought he knew who commanded the schooner a man who had been his enemy and it was believed the pirates knew our brig as she was a regular trader to trinidad this made our captain more ticklish and was the reason he was off so soon  when we found the coast clear we hauled up again and made our port without further molestation the chase was so common a thing that little was said about the affair we discharged took in a new cargo and sailed for home in due time care was had in sailing at an early hour and we sent a boat out to look if the coast were clear before we put to sea we met with no interruption however reaching new york in due time  captain ray was desirous i should stick by the brig but for some reason i cannot explain i felt averse to returning to trinidad i liked the vessel well enough was fond of the captain and thought little of the pirates and yet i felt an unaccountable reluctance to reshipping in the craft it was well i had this feeling for i have since heard this very schooner got the brig the next passage out murdered all hands and burnt the vessel in sight of the port i set this escape down as one of the many unmerited favours i have received from providence  my next berth was that of secondmate on board a new ship in the charleston trade called the franklin i made the voyage and for a novelty did not run in the southern port which was a rare circumstance in that place  i got but twelve dollars as dickey in the franklin and left her to get twenty with the same berth on board a ship called the foster commanded by the same master as had commanded the jane in my former voyage to ireland the foster was bound to belfast which port we reached without any accident we took in salt and a few boxes of linens for norfolk arrived safe discharged and went up the james river to city point after a cargo of tobacco thence we sailed for rotterdam the ship brought back a quantity of gin to new york and this gin caused me some trouble we had a tremendous passage homeone of the worst i ever experienced at sea the ships rudder got loose and was secured with difficulty we had to reef all three of our topmasts also to save the spars after which we could only carry doublereefed topsails it was in the dead of winter and the winds hung to the westward for a long time the cook a surly negro was slack in duty and refused to make scous for us though there were plenty of potatoes on board all the people but five were off duty and it came hard on those who kept watch we determined at length to bring the black to his senses and i had him seized to the windlass everybody but the captain took three clips at him the fellow being regularly cobbed according to sea usage this was lawful punishment for a cook  we got our scous after this but the negro logged the whole transaction as one may suppose he was particularly set against me as i had been ringleader in the cobbing the weather continued bad the watches were much fagged and the ship gave no grog at length i could stand it no longer or thought i could not and i led down betwixt decks tapped a cask of gin introduced the stem of a clean pipe and took a nip at the bowl all my watch smoked this pipe pretty regularly first at one cask and then at another until we got into port the larboard watch did the same and i do think the strong liquor helped us along that time as bad luck would have it the cooks wood was stowed among the casks and one morning just as the last of us had knocked off smoking we saw the wool of this gentleman heaving in sight through the hatch by which we went down still nothing was said until we came to be paid off when the darky came out with his yarn i owned it all and insisted we never could have brought the ship in unless we had got the gin i do believe both captain and owner were sorry we had been complained of but they could not overlook the matter i was mulcted fiveandtwenty dollars and left the ship i know i did wrong and i know that the owners did what was right but i cannot help thinking bad as gin is on a long pull that this did us good i was not driven from the ship on the contrary both master and owners wished me to remain but i felt a little savage and quitted their employment  that i did not carry a very bad character away with me is to be proved by the fact that i shipped the same day on board the washington a vessel bound to london and which lay directly alongside of the foster i had the same berth as that i had just left with the advantage of getting better wages this voyage carried me to london for the first time since i left it in the sterling too many years had elapsed in the interval for me to find any old acquaintances and i had grown from a boy to a man here i got a little insight into the business of carrying passengers our ship bringing more or less each passage i stuck by the washington a year making no less than three voyages in her the last as her chief mate nothing occurred worth mentioning in the four first passages across the atlantic but the fifth produced a little more variety  the washington had proved to be a leaky ship every passage i made in her we had docked her twice in london and it had done her good the first week out on the fifth passage the ship proved tight but the weather was moderate it came on to blow heavily however when we got to the eastward of the banks and the vessel which was scudding under her closereefed maintopsail and foresail laboured so much that i became uneasy i knew she was overloaded and was afraid of the effects of a gale it was my practice to keep one pump ready for sounding the wells and i never neglected this duty in my watch when the gale was at the height in my forenoons watch below i felt so uncomfortable that i turned out and went on deck in nothing but my trowsers to sound although i had sounded less than two hours before and found the water at the suckingheight only to my surprise it was now three feet  this change was so great and so sudden all of us thought there must be some mistake i carried the rod below to dry it and covered the lower part with ashes i could not have been busy in drying the rod more than ten or fifteen minutes when it was lowered again the water had risen several inches in that short period  all this looked very serious and i began to think a third raft was to founder under me after a short consultation it was determined to lighten the ship the foresail was hauled up the men got into the rigging to keep clear of the seas and the vessel was roundedto we then knocked away the washboards in the wake of the two hatches and began to tumble the barrels of turpentine on deck i never felt so strong in my life nor did so much work in so short a time during the labour i went below to splice the mainbrace and after putting a secondmates nip of brandy into my glass filled it as i supposed with water drinking it all down without stopping to breathe it turned out that my water was highproof gin yet this draught had no more effect on me than if it had been so much cold water in ordinary times it would have made me roaring drunk  we tumbled up all the cargo from betwixt decks landing it on deck where it rolled into the sea of itself and were about to begin upon the lower hold when the captain called out avast as the pumps gained fast half an hour later they sucked this was joyful news indeed for i had begun to think we should be driven to the boats among the cargo were some pickled calfskins in the height of the danger i caught the cook knocking the head out of a cask and stowing some of the skins in a tub asking the reason why he did this he told me he wanted to take some of those fine skins home with him it was a pity they should be lost  as soon as the pumps sucked the ship was kept away to her course and she proved to be as tight as a bottle eight or ten days later while running on our course under studdingsails we made a large vessel ahead going before the wind like ourselves but carrying reefed topsails with topgallantsails over them and her ensign whipped of course we neared her fast and as we came up with her saw that she was full of men and that her crew were pumping and bailing we knew how to pity the poor fellows and running alongside demanded the news we were answered first with three cheers after which we heard their story  the vessel was an english bark full of soldiers bound to new brunswick she had sprung a leak like ourselves and was only kept afloat by constant pumping and bailing she had put back for england on account of the wind and the distance our captain was asked to keep near the transport and we shortened sail accordingly for three days and nights the two vessels ran side by side within hail our passengers and officers drinking to theirs and vice versâ at dinner on the fourth day the weather being fine the wind fair and our reckoning making us near the channel we told the englishman we would run ahead make the land and heaveto we stood in so far that the poor fellows owned afterwards they thought we had left them this was not our intention however for we no sooner made the land than we hauled up and brought them the joyful news of its vicinity they cheered us again as we closed with them and both ships jogged on in company  next morning being well in with the land and many vessels in sight the englishmen desired us to make sail as they could carry their bark into falmouth we did so and reached london in due time on our return to new york the washington was sold and i lost my preferment in that employment though i went with a character to another vessel and got the same berth    chapter xiii    my next craft was the camillus a ship that was bound to greenock via charleston we got to the latter port without accident and took in a cargo of cotton the ship was all ready for sailing of a saturday and the captain had gone ashore telling me he would be on board early in the morning when we could haul out and go to sea should the wind be favourable i gave the people their saturdays night and went into the cabin to freshen the nip myself i took a glass or two and certainly had more in me than is good for a man though i was far from being downright drunk in a word i had too much though i could have carried a good deal more on a pinch the steward had gone ashore and there being no secondmate i was all alone  in this state of things i heard a noise and went on deck to inquire what was the matter my old ship the franklin was shifting her berth and her jibboom had come foul of our taffrail after some hailing i got on the taffrail to shove our neighbour off when by some carelessness of my own i fell headforemost hitting the gunwale of the boat which was hanging about half way up to the davits into the water the tide set me away and carried me between the wharf and the ship astern of us which happened to be the william thompson captain thompson owner thompson mate thompson and all thompson as mathews used to have it captain thompson was reading near the cabin windows and he luckily heard me groan giving the alarm a boat was got round and i taken in as the night was dark and i lost all consciousness after the fall i consider this escape as standing second only to that from the shark in the west indies and old trants gun the night the scourge went down i did not recover my recollection for several hours this was not the effect of liquor but of the fall as i remember everything distinctly that occurred before i went from the taffrail still i confess that liquor did all the mischief as i had drunk just enough to make me careless  in the morning i found myself disabled in the left arm and i went to a doctor this gentleman said he never told a fellow what ailed him until he got his whack i gave him a dollar and he then let me into the secret my collarbone was broken and now says he for another dollar ill patch you up i turned out the other spaniard when he was as good as his word going in the ship however was out of the question and i was obliged to get a young man to go on board the camillus in my place thus losing the voyage and my berth  i was now ashore with two or three months of drift before me since the time i joined the washington i had been going regularly ahead and i do think had i been able to stick by the camillus i might have brought up a master i had laid up money and being employed while in port i was gradually losing my taste for sailor amusements and getting more respect for myself that fall from the jaffrail was a sad drawback for me and i never recovered the leeway it brought about  i was more than two months ashore behaving myself rationally on account of my arm at the end of that time i went on board the sally a ship also bound to greenock as her secondmate this vessel belonged to charleston and it was intended she should return to her own port the voyage turned out well and my arm got as strong as ever on reaching charleston i left the craft which was laid up and shipped in a schooner of the same name bound to st domingo as her chief mate this was no great craft certainly though she proved a tight wholesome seaboat we went out without any accident arriving in safety at cape henry after discharging cargo and smuggling on board a quantity of doubloonsfour hundred and eighty it was saidwe got under way for the island of cuba we intended to go into matanzas and kept along the coast after crossing the windward passage we reached cuba and were standing on with a light wind under our squaresail the morning of the third day out when we saw a large boat carrying two sails standing out from the shore evidently in chase of the schooner we had on board eight souls viz the owner a frenchman who had been a dragoon in the service of his own country but who was now between seventy and eighty the captain myself a boy the cook and four men forward we could see that there were nine men in the boat we had no arms in the schooner not even a pistol and the men in the boat had muskets we did not ascertain this last fact however for some time i thought the strangers pirates the moment i saw them come out from under the land but the captain maintained that they were turtlemen the boat was rowing and came up with us hand over hand when near they commenced firing muskets at us to drive us below all the crew forward with the cook ran down into the forecastle leaving no one on deck but the captain the old frenchman and myself the boy got into the companionway  what the others did on deck as these gentry came alongside amusing themselves with keeping up a smart fire of musketry i do not know but my own occupation was to dodge behind the foremast it was not long however before they came tumbling in and immediately got possession of the schooner one or two came forward and secured the forecastle hatch to keep the people down then they probably felt that they were masters one chap drew a fearfullooking knife long slender sharp and glittering and he cut the halyards of the squaresail all the men i saw in the schooner struck me as americans or english affecting to be spaniards there is such a difference in the height complexion and general appearance of the people of spain and those of the two other countries without reference to the manner of speaking that i do not think i could be mistaken i saw but one man among these pirates whom i took for a real spaniard it is true their faces were all blacked to disguise them but one could get enough glimpses of the skin to judge of the true colour there was no negro among them  the chap who cut away the squaresail halyards i felt certain was no spaniard the sail was no sooner down than he ran his knife along the head below the boltrope as if to cut away the cloth with the least trouble to himself i was standing near and asked him why he destroyed the sail if he wanted it why he did not take it whole at this he turned short round upon me raised his arm and struck a heavy blow at me with his fearfullooking knife the point of the deadly weapon struck square on my breastbone i fell partly through the force of the blow and partly from policy for i thought it safest to be lying on my back i got several hearty kicks in addition to this fierce attack together with sundry curses in broken spanish i spoke in english of course and that the man understood me was clear enough by the expression of his countenance and his act the wound was slight though it bled a good deal covering my shirt and trowsers with blood as much as if i had been run through the heart an inch or two either way in the direction of the knife would certainly have killed me  i do not know what might haye been the end of this affair had not one of the pirates come forward at this critical instant and checked my assailant by shaking a finger at him this man i feel very certain i knew i will not mention his name as there is a doubt but i cannot think i was mistaken if i am right he was a young man from connecticut who sailed one voyage to liverpool with me in the sterling with that young man i had been very intimate and was oftener with him ashore than with any other of the crew his face was blackened like those of all his companions but this did not conceal his air manner size eyes and voice when he spoke it was in a jargon of broken english and broken spanish such as no man accustomed to either language from infancy would have used the same was true as to all the rest i heard speak with the exception of an old fellow in the boat whom i shall presently have occasion to mention again  the man i took to be my old shipmate also seemed to know me i was but a lad when i quitted the sterling it is true but they tell me i have not altered a great deal in general appearance my hair is still black and then when i was in the very prime of life it must have been easy to recognize me so strongly was i impressed at the time that i saw an old acquaintance i was about to call him by name when luckily it crossed my mind this might be dangerous the pirates wished clearly to be unknown and it was wisest to let them think they were so my supposed shipmate however proved my friend and i received no more personal ill treatment after he had spoken to his companion i sometimes think he was the means indeed of saving all our lives he asked me if there was any money and on my denying it he told me they knew better the schooner was in ballast and must have got something for her outward cargo i refused to tell and he ordered me into their boat whither the captain had been sent before me in doing all this his manner wore an appearance to me of assumed severity  the poor old frenchman fared worse they seemed to know he was owner and probably thought he could give the best account of the money at any rate he was unmercifully flogged though he held out to the last refusing to betray his doubloons the boy was next attackedwith threats of throwing him overboard this extracted the secret and the doubloons were soon discovered  the captain and myself had been stowed under a halfdeck in the boat but as soon as the money was found the old spaniard who stood sentinel over us was told to let us out that we might see the fun there were the eight scoundrels paraded around the trunk of the schooner dividing the doubloons as soon as this was done we were told to come alongside with our boat which had been used to carry us to the piratical craft the captain got on board the sally and i was ordered to scull the rogues in one gang back to their own craft the scamps were in high spirits seeming much pleased with their haul they cracked a good many jokes at our expense but were so well satisfied with their gold that they left the squaresail behind them they had robbed the cabin however carrying off for me a quadrant a watch and a large portion of my clothes the forecastle had not been entered though the men had four hundred dollars lying under a pile of dirt and old junk to keep them out of sight  my supposed shipmate bore me in mind to the last when we reached his craft he poured out a glass of brandy and offered it to me i was afraid to drink thinking it might be poisoned he seemed to understand me and swallowed it himself in a significant manner this gave me courage and i took the next nip without hesitation he then told me to shove off which i did without waiting for a second order the pirates pulled away at the same time  we were a melancholy party as soon as we found ourselves left to ourselves the old frenchman was sad enough and all of us pitied him he made no complaint of the boy notwithstanding and little was said among us about the robbery my wound proved trifling though the old man was so bruised and beaten that he could scarcely walk  as soon as a breeze came we went into charleston having no means to buy the cargo we had intended to get at matanzas this was the first time i was ever actually boarded by a pirate although i had had several narrow escapes before the first was in the sterling off the coast of portugal the next was in the william and jane outward bound to canton the third was on the bank in the trio off the coast of java and the fourth in the mechanic on the other side of cuba it was not the last of my affairs with them however as will be seen in the sequel  i went out in the sally again making a voyage to matanzas and back without any accident or incident worth mentioning i still intended to remain in this schooner the captain and i agreeing perfectly well had i not been driven out of her by one of those unlucky accidents of which so many have laid me athwarthawse  we were discharging sugar at charleston in very heavy casks the tide being in the vessels rail was higher than the wharf and we landed the casks on the rail from which they were rolled down some planks to the shore two negroes were stationed on the wharf to receive the casks and to ease them down one of these fellows was in the practice of running up the planks instead of standing at their side and holding on to the end of the hogsheads i remonstrated with him several times about the danger he ran but he paid no attention to what i said at length my words came true a cask got away from the men and rolled directly over this negro flattening him like a bit of dough  this was clearly an accident and no one thought of accusing me of any connection with it but the owner of the black looked upon him as one would look upon a hackhorse that had been lamed or killed and he came down to the schooner on hearing that his man was done for swearing i should pay for him as for paying the price of an athletic nigger it was even more impossible for me than it would seem it is for the great state of pennsylvania to pay the interest on its debt and disliking a lawsuit i carried my dunnage on board another vessel that same afternoon and agreed to work my passage to new york as her secondmate  the vessel i now went on board of was the commodore rodgers a regular liner between the two ports we sailed next morning and i paid for the poor nigger with the foretopsail the ships husband was on board as we hauled out a man who was much in the habit of abusing the mates on this occasion he was particularly abusive to our chief mate so much so indeed that i remonstrated with the latter on his forbearance nothing came of it however though i could not forget the character of the man who had used such language when we reached new york our chief mate left us and i was offered the berth it was a little hazardous to go back to charleston but wages were low and business dull the yellow fever being in new york and i thought by a little management i might give my nigger owner a sufficient berth i accordingly agreed to go  when we got back to charleston our ship lay at her own wharf and i saw nothing of my chap he worked up town and we lay low down but another misfortune befel me that led even to worse consequences the ships husband who was so foulmouthed was as busy as ever blackguarding right and left and finding fault with everything our cargo was nearly out and this man and i had a row about some kegs of white lead in the course of the dialogue he called me a saucy son of a bh this was too much for my temper and i seized him and sent him down the hatchway the fall was not great and some hemp lay in the wake of the hatch but the chaps collarbone went he sung out like a singingmaster but i did not stop to chime in throwing my slate on deck in a high passion i left the ship and went ashore i fell in with the captain on the wharf told him my story got a promise from him to send me my clothes and vanished in an hour or two half the constables in charleston were in chase of me i kept so close they could not find me lying snug for a couple of days  this state of things could not last for ever the constables were not half so ferocious as they seemed for one of them managed to get me off on board a coaster called the gov russel where i engaged i may say as chief mate and all hands the gov russel was a buford trader making trips about fifteen or twenty leagues long this was the smallest navigation and the smallest craft a gunboat excepted with which i ever had anything to do the crew consisted of two negroes both slaves to the owner while the captain and myself were aft whether she would have held so many or not i never knew as the captain did not join while i belonged to her the schooner lay three miles below the town and in so much was a good craft for me as no one would think of following an old canton trader into such a longshorelooking thing we busied ourselves in painting her and in overhauling her rigging while the ships husband and his myrmidons amused themselves in searching for me up in town  i had been on board the gov russel three days when it came on to blow from the southward and westward in true southern style the gale came on buttend foremost and was thought to be as severe as anything seen in the port for many a year most of the shipping broke adrift from the wharves and everything that was anchored a manofwar and a revenuecutter excepted struck adrift or dragged as for ourselves we were lying at single anchor and soon began to walk down towards the bar i let go the spare anchor but she snapped her cables as if they had been packthread and away she went to leeward making sail was out of the question had any been bent as ours were not and i had to let her travel her own road  all this happened at night when it was so dark one could not see between the spray the storm and the hour the length of the craft i knew we were going towards the ocean and my great cause of apprehension was the bar looking for the channel was out of the question i did not know it in the first place and had i been a branchpilot i could not find it in the dark i never was more completely adrift in my life ashore or afloat we passed a most anxious hour or two the schooner driving broadsideto i knew not whither or to what fate the two blacks were frightened out of their wits and were of no assistance to me  at length i felt the keel come down upon the sands and then i knew we were on the bar this happened amid a whirlwind of spray with nothing visible but the white foam of the waters and the breakers around us the first blow threw both masts out of the steps ripping up the decks to a considerable extent the next minute we were on our beamends the sea making a clear breach over us all we could do was to hold on and this we did with difficulty i and the two blacks got on the weatherquarter of the schooner where we lashed ourselves with the mainsheet as this was a stout rope something must part before we could be washed away the craft made but two raps on the bar when she drifted clear  i now knew we were at sea and were drifting directly off the coast as we got into deep water the sea did not make such terrible surges over us though they continued to break over our quarter the masts were thumping away but for this i cared little the hold being full of water already sink we could not having a wept hold and being built in a great measure of pine the schooner floated with about five feet of her quarterdeck above water her bows had settled the most and this gave us rather a better chance aft  fortunately we got the worst of this blow at the first go off the wind began to lessen in strength soon after we passed the bar and by daylight it only blew a stiff breeze no land was in sight though i knew by the colour of the water that we could not be a very great distance from the coast we had come out on an ebbtide and this had set us off the land but all that southern coast is so low that it was not to be seen from the surface of the ocean at any great distance  the day that succeeded was sad and dreary enough the weather was fine the sun coming out even hot upon us but the wind continued to blow fresh off the land and we were drifting further out every instant upon the bosom of the ocean our only hope was in falling in with some coaster and i began to dread drifting outside of their track we were without food or water and were partly seated on the rail and partly supported by the mainsheet neither of us attempted to change his berth that day little was said between us though i occasionally encouraged the negroes to hold on as something would yet pick us up i had a feeling of security on this head that was unreasonable perhaps but a sanguine temperament has ever made me a little too indifferent to consequences  night brought no change unless it was to diminish the force of the wind a short time before the sun set one of the negroes said to me masser ned john gone i was forward of the two blacks and was not looking at them at the time i suppose i may have been dozing but on looking up i found that one of the negroes had indeed disappeared how this happened i cannot say as he appeared to be well lashed but i suppose he worked himself free and being exhausted he fell into the water and sunk before i could get a glimpse of him there was nothing to be done however and the loss of this man had a tendency to make me think our situation worse than it had before seemed to be some persons all good christians i should suppose will feel some curiosity to know whether a man in my situations had no disposition to take a religious view of his case and whether his conscience did not apprise him of the chances of perdition that seemed to stare him in the face in answer to this i am compelled to say that no such thoughts came over me in all my risks and emergencies i am not sensible of having given a thought to my maker i had a sense of fear an apprehension of death and an instinctive desire to save my life but no consciousness of the necessity of calling on any being to save my soul notwithstanding all the lessons i had received in childhood i was pretty nearly in the situation of one who had never heard the name of the saviour mentioned the extent of my reflections on such subjects was the selfdelusion of believing that i was to save myselfi had done no great harm according to the notions of sailors had not robbed had not murdered and had observed the mariners code of morals so far as i understood them and this gave me a sort of claim on the mercy of god in a word the future condition of my soul gave me no trouble whatever  i dare say my two companions on this little wreck had the same indifference on this subject as i felt myself i heard no prayer no appeal to god for mercy nothing indeed from any of us to show that we thought at all on the subject hunger gave me a little trouble and during the second night i would fall into a doze and wake myself up by dreaming of eating meals that were peculiarly grateful to me i have had the same thing happen on other occasions when on short allowance of food neither of the blacks said anything on the subject of animal suffering and the one that was lost went out as it might be like a candle  the sun rose on the morning of the second day bright and clear the wind shifted about this time to a gentle breeze from the southward and eastward this was a little encouraging as it was setting the schooner inshore again but i could discover nothing in sight there was still a good deal of sea going and we were so low in the water that our range of sight was very limited  it was late in the forenoon when the negro called out suddenly massa ned dere a vessel almost at the same instant i heard voices calling out and looking round i saw a small coasting schooner almost upon us she was coming down before the wind had evidently seen us some time before we saw her and now ranged up under our lee and hoveto the schooner down boat and took us on board without any delay we moved with difficulty and i found my limbs so stiff as to be scarcely manageable the black was in a much worse state than i was myself and i think twelve hours longer would have destroyed both of us  the schooner that picked us up was manned entirely with blacks and was bound into charleston at the time she fell in with us we must have been twenty miles from the bar it taking us all the afternoon with a fair wind to reach it we went below and as soon as i got in the cabin i discovered a kettle of boiled rice on which i pounced like a hawk the negroes wished to get it away from me thinking i should injure myself but i would not part with it the sweetest meal i ever had in my life was this rice a fair portion of which however i gave to my companion we had not fasted long enough materially to weaken our stomachs and no ill consequences followed from the indulgence after eating heartily we both lay down on the cabin floor and went to sleep we reached the wharf about eight in the evening just within the bar the schooner was spoken by a craft that was going out in search of the gov russel the blacks told her people where the wreck was to be found and the craft stood out to sea  i was strong enough to walk up to my boardinghouse where i went again into quarantine the gov russel was found towed into port was repaired and went about her business as usual in the buford trade i never saw her or her captain again however i parted with the negro that was saved with me on the wharf and never heard anything about him afterwards either such is the life of a sailor  i was still afraid of the constables so much damage had been done to more important shipping and so many lives lost however that little was said of the escape of the gov russel then i was not known in this schooner by my surname when i threw the ships husband down the hold i was mr myers when wrecked in the coaster only ned    chapter xiv    notwithstanding my comparative insignificance there was no real security in remaining long in charleston and it was my strong desire to quit the place as beggars cannot be choosers i was glad to get on board the schooner carpenter bound to st marys and philadelphia for and with shiptimber as a foremast hand i got on board undetected and we sailed the same day nothing occurred until after we left st marys when we met with a singular accident a few days out it blowing heavy at the time our deckload pressed so hard upon the beams as to loosen them and the schooner filled as far as her cargoyellow pinewould allow this calamity proceeded from the fact that the negroes who stowed the craft neglected to wedge up the beams a precaution that should never be forgotten with a heavy weight on deck no very serious consequences followed however as we managed to drive the craft ahead and finally got her into philadelphia with all her cargo on board we did not lose a stick which showed that our captain was game and did not like to let go when he had once got hold this person was a downeaster and was well acquainted with the johnstons and wiscasset he tried hard to persuade me to continue in the schooner as mate with a view to carrying me back to my old friends but i turned a deaf ear to his advice to own the truth i was afraid to go back to wiscassett my own desertion could not well be excused and then i was apprehensive the family might attribute to me the desertion and death of young swett he had been my senior it is true and was as able to influence me as i was to influence him but conscience is a thing so sensitive that when we do wrong it is apt to throw the whole error into our faces  quitting the carpenter in philadelphia therefore i went to live in a respectable boardinghouse and engaged to go out in a brig called the margaret working on board as a rigger and stevedore until she should be ready to sail my berth was to be that of mate the owner of this brig was as notorious in his way as the ships husband in charleston i had heard his character and was determined if he attempted to ride me as he was said to do many of his mates and even captains he should find himself mounted on a hardgoing animal one day things came to a crisis the owner was on the wharf with me and such a string of abuse as he launched out upon me i never before listened to a crowd collected and my blood got up i seized the man and dropped him off the wharf into the water alongside of some hooppoles that i knew must prevent any accident in this last respect i was sufficiently careful though the ducking was very thorough the crowd gave three cheers which i considered as a proof i was not so very wrong nothing was said of any suit on this occasion but i walked off and went directly on board a ship called the coromandel on which i had had an eye as a lee for several days in this vessel i shipped as secondmate carrying with me all the better character for the ducking given to the notorious  the coromandel was bound to cadiz and thence round the horn the outward bound cargo was flour but to which ports we were going in south america i was ignorant our crew were all blacks the officers excepted we had a good passage until we got off cape trafalgar when it came on to blow heavily directly on end we layto off the cape two days and then ran into gibraltar and anchored here we lay about a fortnight when there came on a gale from the southwest which sent a tremendous sea in from the atlantic this gale commenced in the afternoon and blew very heavily all that night the force of the wind increased little by little until it began to tell seriously among the shipping of which a great number were lying in front of the rock the second day of the gale our ship was pitching bows under sending the water aft to the taffrail while many other craft struck adrift or foundered at their anchors the coromandel had one chain cable and this was out it was the only cable we used for the first twentyfour hours as the gale increased however it was thought necessary to let go the sheetanchor which had a hempen cable bent to it our chain indeed was said to be the first that was ever used out of philadelphia though it had then been in the ship for some time and had proved itself a faithful servant the voyage before unfortunately most of the chain was out before we let go the sheetanchor and there was no possibility of getting out a scope of the hempen cable dragging on shore where we lay was pretty much out of the question as the bottom shelved inward and the anchor to come home must have gone up hill14  in this manner the coromandel rode for two nights and two days the sea getting worse and worse and the wind it anything rather increasing we took the weight of the last in squalls some of which were terrific by this time the bay was well cleared of craft nearly everything having sunk or gone ashore an english packet lay directly ahead of us rather more than a cables length distant and she held on like ourselves the governor brooks of boston lay over nearer to algesiras where the sea and wind were a little broken and of course she made better weather than ourselves  about eight oclock the third night i was in the cabin when the men on deck sung out that the chain had gone at this time the ship had been pitching her spritsailyard under water and it blew a little hurricane we were on deck in a moment all hands paying out sheet we brought the ship up with this cable but not until she got it nearly to the better end unfortunately we had got into shoal water or what became shoal water by the depth of the troughs it was said afterwards we were in five fathoms water at this time but for this i will not vouch it seems too much water for what happened our anchor however did actually lie in sixteen fathoms  we had hardly paid out the cable before the ship came down upon the bottom on an even keel apparently with a force that almost threw those on deck off their feet these blows were repeated from time to time at intervals of several minutes some of the thumps being much heavier than others the english packet must have struck adrift at the same time with ourselves for she came down upon us letting go an anchor in a way to overlay our cable i suppose the rocks and this sawing together parted our hempen cable and away we went towards the shore broadsideto as the ship drifted in she continued to thump but luckily for us the sea made no breaches over her the old coromandel was a very strong ship and she continued working her way inshore until she lay in a good substantial berth without any motion we manned the pumps and kept the ship tolerably free of water though she lay over considerably the english packet followed us in going ashore more towards the spanish lines this vessel bilged and lost some of her crew as for ourselves we had a comfortable berth considering the manner in which we had got into it no apprehension was felt for our personal safety and perfect order was observed on board the men worked as usual nor was there any extra liquor drunk  that night the gale broke and before morning it had materially moderated lighters were brought alongside and we began to discharge our flour into them the cargo was all discharged and all in good order so far as the water was concerned though several of the keelson bolts were driven into the ground tier of barrels i am almost afraid to tell this story but i know it to be true as i released the barrels with my own hands as soon as clear the ship was hove off into deep water on the top of a high tide and was found to leak so much as to need a shoregang at the pumps to keep her afloat she was accordingly sold for the benefit of the underwriters she was subsequently docked and sent to sea  of course this broke up our voyage the captain advised me to take a secondmates berth in the governor brooks the only american that escaped the gale and i did so this vessel was a brig bound round the horn also and a large new craft i know of no other vessel that lay in front of the rock that rode out this gale and she did it with two hempen cables out partly protected however by a good berth there was a swede that came back next day to her anchorage which was said to have got backstrapped behind the rock by some legerdemain and so escaped also i do not know how many lives were lost on this occasion but the destruction of property must have been very great  three weeks after the gale the governor brooks sailed we had a hard time in doubling the cape being a fortnight knocking about between falkland and the main we were one hundred and fortyfour days out touching nowhere until we anchored at callao we found flour of which our cargo was composed at seven dollars a barrel with seven dollars duty the franklin 74 was lying here with the aurora english frigate the castle being at war with the people inland our flour was landed and what became of it is more than i can tell  we now took in ballast and ran down to guayaquil here an affair occurred that might very well have given me the most serious cause of regret all the days of my life our steward was a portuguese negro of the most vicious and surly temper most of the people and officers were really afraid of him one evening the captain and chief mate being both ashore i was sitting on deck idle and i took a fancy to a glass of grog i ordered the steward accordingly to pour me out one and bring it up the man pretended that the captain had carried off the keys and no rum was to be had i thought this a little extraordinary and as one would be very apt to be felt much hurt at the circumstance i had never been drunk in the craft and was not a drunkard in one sense of the term at all seldom drinking so as to affect me except when on a frolic ashore  as i sat brooding over this fancied insult however i smelt rum and looking down the skylight saw this same steward passing forward with a pot filled with the liquor i was fairly blinded with passion running down i met the fellow just as he was coming out of the cabin and brought him up all standing the man carried a knife along his leg a weapon that had caused a good deal of uneasiness in the brig and he now reached down to get it seeing there was no time to parley i raised him from the floor and threw him down with great force his head coming under there he lay like a log and all my efforts with vinegar and water had no visible effect  i now thought the man dead he gave no sign of life that i could detect and fear of the consequences came over me the devil put it into my head to throw the body overboard as the most effectual means of concealing what i had done the steward had threatened to run by swimming more than once and i believe had been detected in making such an attempt and i fancied if i could get the body through one of the cabinwindows it would seem as if he had been drowned in carrying his project into execution i tried all i could first to restore the steward to life but failing of this i actually began to drag him aft in order to force his body out of a cabinwindow the transom was high and the man very heavy so i was a good while in dragging the load up to the necessary height just as i got it there the fellow gave a groan and i felt a relief that i had never before experienced it seemed to me like a reprieve from the gallows  i now took the steward down upon one of the lower transoms where he sat rubbing his head a few minutes i watching him closely the whole time at length he got up and staggered out of the cabin he went and turned in and i saw no more of him until next day as it turned out good instead of harm resulted from this affair the black being ever afterwards greatly afraid of me if i did not break his neck i broke his temper and the captain used to threaten to set me at him whenever he behaved amiss i owned the whole affair to the captain and mate both of whom laughed heartily at what had happened though i rejoiced in my inmost heart that it was no worse  the brig loaded with cocao in bulk at guayaquil and sailed for cadiz the passage was a fine one as we doubled the horn at midsummer on this occasion we beat round the cape under topgallantsails the weather was so fine we stood close in to get the benefit of the currents after tacking as it seemed to me within a league of the land our passage to cadiz lasted one hundred and fortyone or two days being nearly the same length as that out though much smoother  the french had just got possession of cadiz as we got in and we found the white flag flying we lay here a month and then went round to the rock after passing a week at gibraltar to take in some dollars we sailed for new orleans in ballast as i had been on twentytwo dollars a month there was a pretty good whack coming to me as soon as we reached an american port and i felt a desire to spend it before i went to sea again they wished me to stick by the brig which was going the very same voyage over but i could not make up my mind to travel so long a road with a pocket full of money i had passed so many years at sea that a short land cruise was getting to be grateful as a novelty  the only craft i could get on board of to come round into my own latitude in order to enjoy myself in the old way was an eastern schooner called the james on board this vessel i shipped as mate bound to philadelphia she was the most meagre craft in the way of outfit i ever put to sea in her boat would not swim and she had not a spare spar on board her in this style we went jogging along north until we were met by a northwest gale between bermuda and cape hatteras which forced us to heaveto during this gale i had a proof of the truth that where the treasure is there will the heart be also  i was standing leaning on the rail and looking over the schooners quarter when i saw what i supposed to be a plank come up alongside the idea of sailing in a craft of which the bottom was literally dropping out was not very pleasant and i thought all was lost i cannot explain the folly of my conduct except by supposing that my many escapes at sea had brought me to imagine i was to be saved myself let what would happen to all the rest on board without stopping to reflect i ran below and secured my dollars tearing up a blanket i made a belt and lashed about twentyfive pounds weight of silver to my body with the prospect before me of swimming two or three hundred miles with it before i could get ashore as for boat or spars the former would not float and of the last there was not one i now look back on my acts of this day with wonder for i had forgotten all my habitual knowledge of vessels in the desire to save the paltry dollars for the first and only time in my life i felt avaricious and lost sight of everything in money  it was my duty to sound the pumps but this i did not deem necessary no sooner were the dollars secure or rather ready to anchor me in the bottom of the ocean than i remembered the captain he was asleep and waking him up i told him what had happened the old man a dry drawling cool downeaster laughed in my face for my pains telling me i had seen one of the sheetingboards with which he had had the bottom of the schooner covered to protect it from the worms at campeachy and that i need be under no concern about the schooners bottom this was the simple truth and i cast off the dollars again with a sneaking consciousness of not having done my duty i suppose all men have moments when they are not exactly themselves in which they act very differently from what it has been their practice to act on this occasion i was not alarmed for myself but i thought the course i took was necessary to save that dross which lures so many to perdition avarice blinded me to the secrets of my own trade  i had come all the way from new orleans to philadelphia to spend my four hundred dollars to my satisfaction for two months i lived respectably and actually began to go to church i did not live in a boardinghouse but in a private family my landlady was a pious woman and a member of the dutch reformed church but her husband was a universalist i must say i liked the doctrine of the last the best as it made smooth water for the whole cruise i usually went with the man to church of a morning which was falling among shoals as a poor fellow was striving to get into port i received a great deal of good advice from my landlady however and it made so much impression on me as to influence my conduct though i cannot say it really touched my heart i became more considerate and better mannered if i were not truly repentant for my sins these two months were passed more rationally than any time of mine on shore since the hour when i ran from the sterling  the james was still lying in philadelphia undergoing repairs and waiting for freight but being now ready for sea i shipped in her again on a voyage to st thomas with a cargo of flour when we sailed i left near a hundred dollars behind me besides carrying some money to sea the good effects of good company at st thomas we discharged and took in ballast for turks island where we got a cargo of salt returning with it to philadelphia my conduct had been such on board this schooner that her commander who was her owner and very old having determined to knock off going to sea tried to persuade me to stick by the craft promising to make me her captain as soon as he could carry her down east where she belonged i now think i made a great mistake in not accepting this offer though i was honestly diffident about my knowledge of navigation i never had a clear understanding of the lunars though i worked hard to master them it is true chronometers were coming into general use in large vessels and i could work the time but a chronometer was a thing never heard of on board the james attachment to the larger towns and a dislike for little voyages had as much influence on me as anything else i declined the offer the only direct one ever made me to command any sort of craft and remained what i am i had a little contempt too for vessels of such a rig and outfit which probably had its influence i liked rich owners  on my return to philadelphia i found the family in which i had last lived much deranged by illness i got my money but was obliged to look for new lodgings the respectable people with whom i had been before did not keep lodgers i being their only boarder but i now went to a regular sailors boardinghouse there was a little aristocracy it is true in my new lodgings to which none but mates dickies and thorough salts came but this was getting into the hurricane latitudes as to morals i returned to all my old habits throwing the dollars right and left and forgetting all about even a universalist church  a month cleaned me out in such company i spent every cent i had with the exception of about fifteen dollars that i had laid by as nesteggs i then shipped as secondmate in the rebecca simms a ship bound to st jago de cuba with flour the voyage lasted four months producing nothing of moment but a little affair that was personal to myself and which cost me nearly all my wages the steward was a saucy black and on one occasion in bad weather he neglected to give me anything warm for breakfast i took an opportunity to give him a taste of the end of the mainclewgarnet as an admonisher and there the matter ended so long as i remained in the ship it seemed quite right to all on board but the steward he bore the matter in mind and set a whole pack of quakers on me as soon as we got in the suit was tried and it cost me sixty dollars in damages beside legal charges i dare say it was all right according to law and evidence but i feel certain just such a rubbing down once a week would have been very useful to that same steward wellmeaning men often do quite as much harm in this world as the evildisposed philanthropists of this school should not forget that if colour is no sufficient reason why a man should be always wrong it is no sufficient reason why he should be always right  the lawsuit drove me to sea again in a very short time finding no better berth and feeling very savage at the blindness of justice i shipped before the mast in the superior an indiaman of quite eight hundred tons bound to canton this was the pleasantest voyage i ever made to sea in a merchantman so far as the weather and i may say usage were concerned we lost our topgallantmasts homeward bound but this was the only accident that occurred the ship was gone nine months the passage from whampao to the capes having been made in ninetyfour days when we got in the owners had failed and there was no money forthcoming at the moment to remain and libel the ship was dull business so leaving a power of attorney behind me i went on board a schooner called the sophia bound to vera cruz as foremast jack  the sophia was a clipper and made the run out in a few days we went into vera cruz but found it nearly deserted our cargo went ashore a little irregularly sometimes by day and sometimes by night being assorted and suited to all classes of customers as soon as ready we sailed for philadelphia again where we arrived after an absence of only two months  i now got my wages for the canton voyage but they lasted me only a fortnight it was necessary to go to sea again and i went on board the caledonia once more bound to canton this voyage lasted eleven months but like most china voyages produced no event of importance we lost our topgallantmasts this time too but that is nothing unusual off good hope i can say but little in favour of the ship or the treatment  on getting back to philadelphia the money went in the old way i occasionally walked round to see my good religious friends with whom i had once lived but they ceased to have any great influence over my conduct as soon as necessary i shipped in the delaware a vessel bound to savannah and liverpool southern fashion i ran from this vessel in savannah owing her nothing however but was obliged to leave my protection behind as it was in the captains hands i cannot give any reason but caprice for quitting this ship the usage was excellent and the wages high yet run i did as long as the delaware remained in port i kept stowed away but as soon as she sailed i came out into the world and walked about the wharves as big as an owner  i now went on board a ship called the tobacco plant bound to liverpool and philadelphia for two dollars a month less wages worse treatment and no grog so much for following the fashion the voyage produced nothing to be mentioned  on my return to philadelphia i resolved to shift my ground and try a new tack i was now thirtyfour and began to give up all thoughts of getting a lift in my profession i had got so many sternboards on me every time i was going ahead and was so completely alone in the world that i had become indifferent and had made up my mind to take things as they offered as for money my rule had come to be to spend it as i got it and go to sea for more if i tumbled overboard i said to myself there is none to cry over me therefore let things jog on their own course all the disposition to morality that had been aroused within me at philadelphia was completely gone and i thought as little of church and of religion as ever it is true i had bought a bible on board the superior and i was in the practice of reading in it from time to time though it was only the narratives such as those of sampson and goliah that formed any interest for me the history of jonah and the whale i read at least twenty times i cannot remember that the morality or thought or devotion of a single passage ever struck me on these occasions in word i read this sacred book for amusement and not for light  i now wanted change and began to think of going back to the navy by way of novelty i had been round the world once had been to canton five times doubling the cape round the horn twice to batavia once the westindies on the spanish main and had crossed the atlantic so often that i thought i knew all the milestones i had seen but little of the mediterranean and fancied a manofwars cruise would show me those seas most of the tobacco plants had shipped in philadelphia and i determined to go with them to go in the navy there is a fashion in all things and just then it was the fashion to enter in the service  i was shipped by lieutenant mkean now commander mkean a grandson of the old governor of pennsylvania as they tell me all hands of us were sent on board the cyane an english prize twentygun ship where we remained about six weeks a draft was then made and more than a hundred of us were sent round to norfolk in a sloop to join the delaware 80 then fitting out for the mediterranean we found the ship lying alongside the navyyard wharf and after passing one night in the receivingship were sent on board the twodecker the delaware soon hauled out and was turned over to captain downes the very officer who had almost persuaded me to go in that illfated brig the epervier  i was stationed on the delawares forecastle and was soon ordered to do second captains duty we had for lieutenants on board mr ramage first messrs williamson ten eick shubrick byrne chauncey harris and several whose names i have forgotten mr ramage has since been cashiered i understand and messrs ten eick shubrick chauncey harris and byrne are now all commanders  the ship sailed in the winter of 1828 in the month of january i think having on board the prince of musignano and his family who were going to italy this gentleman was charles bonaparte eldest son of lucien prince of canino they tell me and is now prince of canino himself he had been living some time in america and got a passage in our ship on account of the difficulty of travelling in europe for one of his name and family he was the first and only prince i ever had for a shipmate    chapter xv    our passage out in the delaware was very rough the ship rolling heavily it was the first time she had been at sea and it required some little time to get her trim and sailing she turned out however to be a good vessel sailing fairly steering well and proving an excellent seaboat we went into algesiras where we lay only twentyfour hours we then sailed for mahon but were met by orders off the port to proceed to leghorn and land our passengers i have been told this was done on account of the princess of musignanos being a daughter of the exking of spain and it was not thought delicate to bring her within the territory of the reigning king i have even heard that the commodore was offered an order of knighthood for the delicacy he manifested on this occasion which offer he declined accepting as a matter of course  the ship had a good run from off mahon to leghorn where we anchored in the outer roads we landed the passengers the afternoon of the day we arrived that very night it came on to blow heavily from the northward and eastward or a little off shore according to the best of my recollection this was the first time i ever saw preparations made to send down lower yards and to house topmastsmerchantmen not being stronghanded enough to cut such capers with their sticks we had three anchors ahead if not four the ship labouring a good deal we lost one man from the starboard forechains by his getting caught in the buoyrope as we let go a sheetanchor the poor fellow could not be picked up on account of the sea and the darkness of the night though an attempt was made to save him  the next day the weather moderated a little and we got under way for mahon our passage down was pleasant and this time we went in captain downes now left us and commodore crane hoisted his broadpennant on board us the ship now lay a long time in port the commodore went aloft in one of the sloops and was absent several months i was told he was employed in making a treaty with the turks but us poor jacks knew little of such matters on his return there was a regular blowup with the firstlieutenant who left the ship to nobodys regret so far as i know mr mix who had led our party to the lakes in 1812 and was with us in all my lake service and who was mr osgoods brotherinlaw now joined us as firstlieutenant i had got to be firstcaptain of the forecastle a berth i held to the end of the cruise  the treatment on board this ship was excellent the happiest time i ever spent at sea was in the delaware after mr mix took mr ramages place everybody seemed contented and i never knew a better satisfied ships company the third year out we had a long cruise off cape de gatte keeping the ship under her canvass quite three months we took in supplies at sea the object being to keep us from getting rusty on the fourth of july we had a regular holiday at four in the morning the ship was close in under the north shore and we wore off the land sail was then shortened after this we had music and more saluting and grog the day was passed merrily and i do not remember a fight or a black eye in the ship  i volunteered to go one cruise in the warren under mr byrne the present commodore kearny commanded this ship and he took us down to the rock the reason of our volunteering was this the menofwar of the dutch and the french rendezvoused at mahon as well as ourselves the french and our people had several rows ashore which was right and which wrong i cannot say as it was the javas men and not the delawares that were engaged in them on our side one of the javas was run through the body and a french officer got killed it was said the french suspected us of a design of sending away the man who killed their officer and meant to stop the warren which was bound to the rock on duty all i know is that two french brigs anchored at the mouth of the harbour and some of us were called on to volunteer fortyfive of us did so and went on board the sloop  after the warren got under way we went to quarters manning both batteries in this manner we stood down between the two french brigs with topgallantsails furled and the courses in the brails we passed directly between the two brigs keeping a broadside trained upon each but nothing was said or done to us we anchored first at the rock but next day crossed over to the spanish coast in a short time we returned to mahon and we volunteers went back to the delaware the two brigs had gone but there was still a considerable french force in port nothing came of the difficulty however so far as i could see or hear  in the season of 1830 the constellation commodore biddle came out and our ship and commodore were relieved we had a run up as far as sicily however before this took place and went off tripoli there i saw a wreck lying across the bay that they told me was the bones of the philadelphia frigate we were also at leghorn several weeks the commodore going to some baths in the neighbourhood for his health  among other ports the delaware visited carthagena malta and syracuse at the latter place the ship lay six weeks i should think this was the season of our arrival out here we underwent a course of severe exercise that brought the crew up to a high state of discipline at four in the morning we would turn out and commence our work all the manoeuvres of unmooring making sail reefing furling and packing on her again were gone through until the people got so much accustomed to work together the great secret of the efficiency of a manofwar that the officer of the deck was forced to sing out belay before the yards were up by a foot lest the men should spring the spars when we got through this drill the commodore told us we would do and that he was not ashamed to show us alongside of anything that floated i do not pretend to give our movements in the order in which they occurred however nor am i quite certain what year it was the commodore went up to smyrna on reflection it may have been later than i have stated  our cruise off cape de gatte was one of the last things we did and when we came back to mahon we took in supplies for america we made the southern passage home and anchored in hampton roads in the winter of 1831 i believe the whole crew of the delaware was sorry when the cruise was up there are always a certain number of longshore chaps in a manofwar who are never satisfied with discipline and the wholesome restraints of a ship but as for us old salts i never heard one give the delaware a bad name we had heard an awful report of the commodore who was called a burster and expected sharp times under him and his manner of taking possession was of a nature to alarm us all hands had been called to receive him and the first words he said were call all hands to witness punishment a pin might have been heard falling among us for this sounded ominous it was to clear the brig only captain downes having left three men in it whom he would not release on quitting the vessel the offences were serious and could not be overlooked these three chaps got it but there was only one other man brought regularly to the gangway while i was in the ship and he was under the sentence of a court and belonged to the warren as soon as the brig was cleared the commodore told us we should be treated as we treated others and then turned away among the officers the next day we found we were to live under a just rule and that satisfied us one of the great causes of the contentment that reigned in the ship was the method and the regularity of the hours observed the men knew on what they could calculate in ordinary times and this left them their own masters within certain hours i repeat she was the happiest ship i ever served in though i have always found good treatment in the navy  i can say conscientiously that were my life to be passed over again without the hope of commanding a vessel it should be passed in the navy the food is better the service is lighter the treatment is better if a man behave himself at all well he is better cared for has a port under his lee in case of accidents and gets good steady wages with the certainty of being paid if his ship is lost his wages are safe and if he gets hurt he is pensioned then he is pretty certain of having gentlemen over him and that is a great deal for any man he has good quarters below and if he serve in a ship as large as a frigate he has a cover over his head half the time at least in bad weather this is the honest opinion of one who has served in all sorts of crafts liners indiamen coasters smugglers whalers and transient ships i have been in a ship of the line two frigates three sloops of war and several smaller craft and such is the result of all my experience in uncle sams navy no man can go to sea and always meet with fairweather but he will get as little of foul in one of our vessels of war as in any craft that floats if a man only behave himself i think the american merchantmen give better wages than are to be found in other services and i think the american menofwar as a rule give better treatment than the american merchantman god bless the flag i say and this too without the fear of being hanged  the delaware lay two or three weeks in the roads before she went up to the yard at the latter place we began to strip the ship while thus employed we were told that seventyfive of us whose times were not quite out were to be drafted for the brandywine 44 then fitting out at new york for a short cruise in the gulf this was bad news for jack likes a swing ashore after a long service abroad go we must and did however we were sent round to new york in a schooner and found the frigate still lying at the yard we were hulked on board the hudson until she was ready to receive us when we were sent to our new vessel captain ballard commanded the brandywine and among her lieutenants mr mkenny was the first this is a fine ship and she got her name from the battle in which la fayette was wounded in this country having been first fitted out to carry him to france after his last visit to america she is a firstclass frigate mounting thirty long thirtytwos on her gundeck and i conceive it to be some honour to a sailor to have it in his power to say he has been captain of the forecastle in such a ship for i was rated in this frigate the same as i had been rated in the delaware with this difference that for my service in the brandywine i received my regular eighteen dollars a month as a petty officer whereas though actually captain of the delawares forecastle for quite two years and secondcaptain nearly all the rest of the time i was in the ship i never got more than seamans wages or twelve dollars a month i do not know how this happened though i supposed it to have arisen from some mistake connected with the circumstance that i was paid off for my services in the delaware by the purser of the frigate this was in consequence of the transfer  the brandywine sailed in march for the gulf our cruise lasted about five months during which time we went to vera cruz pensacola and the havana we appeared to me to be a single ship as we were never in squadron and saw no broadpennant no accident happened the cruise being altogether pleasant the ship returned to norfolk and twentyfive of us principally old delawares were discharged our times being out we all of us intended to return to the frigate after a cruise ashore and we chartered a schooner to carry us to philadelphia in a body determining not to part company  the morning the schooner sailed i was leading the whole party along one of the streets of norfolk when i saw something white lying in the middle of the carriageway it turned out to be an old messmate jack dove who had been discharged three days before and had left us to go to philadelphia but had been brought up by king grog while we were overhauling the poor fellow who could not speak his landlady came out to us and told us that he had eat nothing for three days and did nothing but drink she begged us to take care of him as he disregarded all she said this honest woman gave us jacks wages to a cent for i knew what they had come to and we made a collection of ten dollars for her calculating that jack must have swallowed that much in three days jack we took with us bag and hammock but he would eat nothing on the passage calling out constantly for drink we gave him liquor thinking it would do him good but he grew worse and when we reached philadelphia he was sent to the hospital here in the course of a few days he died  never in all my folly and excesses did i give myself so much up to drink as when i reached philadelphia this time i was not quite as bad as jack dove but i soon lost my appetite living principally on liquor when we heard of jacks death we proposed among ourselves to give him a sailors funeral we turned out accordingly to the number if a hundred or more in blue jackets and white trowsers and marched up to the hospital in a body i was one of the leaders in this arrangement and felt much interest in it as jack had been my messmate but the instant i saw his coffin a fit of the horrors came over me and i actually left the place running down street towards the river as if pursued by devils luckily i stopped to rest on the stoop of a druggist the worthy man took me in gave me some soda water and some good advice when a little strengthened i made my way home but gave up at the door then followed a severe indisposition which kept me in bed for a fortnight during which i suffered the torments of the damned  i have had two or three visits from the horrors in the course of my life but nothing to equal this attack i came near following jack dove to the grave but god in his mercy spared me from such an end it is not possible for one who has never experienced the effects of his excesses in this particular form to get any correct notions of the sufferings i endured among other conceits i thought the colour which the tar usually leaves on seamens nails was the sign that i had the yellow fever this idea haunted me for days and gave me great uneasiness in short i was like a man suspended over a yawning chasm expecting every instant to fall and be dashed to pieces and yet who could not die  for some time after my recovery i could not bear the smell of liquor but evil companions lured me back to my old habits i was soon in a bad way again and it was only owing to the necessity of going to sea that i had not a return of the dreadful malady when i shipped in the delaware i had left my watch quadrant and good clothes to the value of near two hundred dollars with my present landlord and he now restored them all to me safe and sound i made considerable additions to the stock of clothes and when i again went to sea left the whole and more with the same landlord  our plan of going back to the brandywine was altered by circumstances and a party of us shipped in the monongahela a liverpool liner out of philadelphia the cabin of this vessel was taken by two gentlemen going to visit europe viz mr hare powell and mr edward burd and getting these passengers with their families on board the ship sailed by this time i had pretty much given up the hope of preferment and did not trouble myself whether i lived forward or aft i joined the monongahela as a forward hand therefore quite as well satisfied as if her chief mate  we left the delaware in the month of august and a short time out encountered one of the heaviest gales of wind i ever witnessed at sea it came on from the eastward and would have driven us ashore had not the wind suddenly shifted to southwest the ship was lyingto under bare poles pressed down upon the water in such a way that she lay almost as steady as if in a river nor did the force of the wind allow the sea to get up a part of the time our lee lower yardarms were nearly in the water we had everything aloft but sending them down was quite out of the question it was not possible at one time for a man to go aloft at all i tried it myself and could with difficulty keep my feet on the ratlins i make no doubt i should have been blown out of the top could i have reached it did i let go my hold to do any work  we had sailed in company with the kensington a corvette belonging to the emperor of russia and saw a ship during the gale that was said to be she the kensington was dismasted and had to return to refit but we did not part a ropeyarn when the wind shifted we were on soundings and it still continuing to blow a gale we set the maintopsail closereefed and the foresail and shoved the vessel off the land at the rate of a steamboat after this the wind favoured us and our passage out was very short we stayed but a few days in liverpool took in passengers and got back to philadelphia after an absence of a little more than two months the kensingtons report of the gale and of our situation had caused much uneasiness in philadelphia but our two passages were so short that we brought the news of our safety  i now inquired for the brandywine but found she had sailed for the mediterranean it was my intention to have gone on board her but missing this ship and a set of officers that i knew i looked out for a merchantman i found a brig called the amelia bound to bordeaux and shipped in her before the mast  the amelia had a bad passage out it was in the autumn and the brig leaked badly this kept us a great deal at the pumps an occupation that a sailor does anything but delight in i am of opinion that pumping a leaky ship is the most detestable work in the world nothing but the dread of drowning ought to make a man do it although some men will pump to save their property as for myself i am not certain i would take twentyfour hours of hard pumping to save any sum i shall probably ever own or ever did own  after a long passage we made the cordovan but the wind blowing heavy off the land we could not get in for near a fortnight not a pilot would come out and if they had it would have done us no good after a while the wind shifted and we got into the river and up to the town we took in a return cargo of brandy and sailed for philadelphia our homewardbound passage was long and stormy but we made the capes at last here we were boarded by a pilot who told us we were too late the delaware had frozen up and we had to keep away with a southeast wind for new york we had a bad time of it as soon as night came on the gale increased blowing directly into the bight and we had to haul up under closereefed topsails and reefed foresail to claw off the land the weather was very thick and the night dark and all we could do was to get round when the land gave us a hint it was time this we generally did in five fathoms water we had to ware for the brig would not tack under such short canvass and of course lost much ground in so doing about three in the morning we knew that it was nearly up with us the soundings gave warning of this and we got round on what i supposed would be the amelias last leg but providence took care of us when we could not help ourselves the wind came out at northwest as it might be by word of command the mist cleared up and we saw the lights for the first time close aboard us the brig was taken aback but we got her round shortened sail and hove her to under a closedreefed maintopsail we now got it from the northwest making very bad weather the gale must have set us a long way to leeward as we did not get in for a fortnight we shipped a heavy sea that stove our boat and almost swept the decks we were out of pork and beef and our firewood was nearly gone the binnacle was also gone as good luck would have it we killed a porpoise soon after the wind shifted and on this we lived in a great measure for more than a week sometimes cooking it but oftener eating it raw at length the wind shifted and we got in  i was no sooner out of this difficulty than a hasty temper got me into another while still in the stream an irish boatman called me a yankee son of a and i lent him a clip the fellow sued me and contriving to catch me before i left the vessel i was sent to jail for the first and only time in my life this turned out to be a new and very revolting school for me i was sent among as precious a set of rascals as new york could furnish their conversation was very edifying one would tell how he cut the hoses of the engines at fires with razorblades fastened to his shoes another how many pocketbooks he and his associates had taken at this or that fire and a third the mariner of breaking open stores and the best mode of disposing of stolen goods the cool open impudent manner in which these fellows spoke of such transactions fairly astounded me they must have thought i was in jail for some crime similar to their own or they would not have talked so freely before a stranger these chaps seemed to value a man by the enormity and number of his crimes  at length the captain and my landlord found out where i had been sent and i was immediately bailed glad enough was i to get out of prison and still more so to get out of the company i found in it such association is enough to undermine the morals of a saint in a week or two and yet these fellows were well dressed and well enough looking and might very well pass for a sort of gentlemen with those who had seen but little of men of the true quality  i had got enough of law and wished to push the matter no farther the irishman was sent for and i compromised with him on the spot the whole affair cost me my entire wages and i was bound over to keep the peace for i do not know how long this scrape compelled me to weigh my anchor at a short notice as there is no living in new york without money i went on board the sully thereforea havre linera day or two after getting out of the atmosphere of the city hall they may talk of batavia if they please but in my judgement it is the healthiest place of the two  our passages out and home produced nothing worth mentioning and i left the ship in new york my wages went in the old way and then i shipped in a schooner called the susan and mary that was about to sail for buenos ayres in the expectation that she would be sold there the craft was a good one though our passage out was very long on reaching our port i took my discharge under the impression the vessel would be sold a notion now came over me that i would join the buenos ayrean navy in order to see what sort of a service it was i knew it was a mixed american and english affair and by this time i had become very reckless as to my own fate i wished to do nothing very wrong but was incapable of doing anything that was very right  my windfall carried me on board a schooner of eight or ten guns called the suradaha i did not ship making an arrangement by which i was to be left to decide for myself whether i would remain in her or not although a pretty good craft i soon got enough of this service in one week i was thoroughly disgusted and left the schooner it is well i did as there was a revolution on board of her a few days later and she was carried up the river and as i was told was there sunk with her sunk all my laurels in that service  the susan and mary was not sold but took in hides for new york i returned to her therefore and we sailed for home in due time the passage proved long but mild and we were compelled to run in off point petre gaudaloupe where we took in some provisions after this nothing occurred until we reached new york  i now shifted the name of my craft end for end joining a halfrigged brig called the mary and susan i gained little by the change this vessel being just the worstlooking hooker i did ever sail in still she was tight strong enough and not a very bad sailing vessel but for some reason or other externals were not regarded and we made anything but a holiday appearance on the water i had seen the time when i would disdain to go chiefmate of such a looking craft but i now shipped in her as a common hand  we sailed for para in brazil a port nearly under the line having gunpowder drygoods c our passage until we came near the coast of south america was good and nothing occurred to mention when under the line however we made a rakishlooking schooner carrying two topsails one forenoon we made no effort to escape knowing it to be useless the schooner set a spanish ensign and brought us to we were ordered to lower our boat and to go on board the schooner which were done i happened to be at the helm and remained in the mary and susan the strangers ordered our people out of the boat and sent an armed party in her on board us these men rummaged about for a short time and then were hailed from their vessel to know if we promised well our looks deceived the head man of the boarders who answered that we were very poor on receiving this information the captain of the schooner ordered his boarding party to quit us our boat came back but was ordered to return and bring another gang of the strangers this time we were questioned about canvass but got off by concealing the truth we had thirty bolts on board but produced only one the bolt shown did not happen to suit and the strangers again left us we were told not to make sail until we received notice by signal and the schooner hauled her wind after standing on some time however these gentry seemed indisposed to quit us for they came down again and rounded to on our weatherbeam we were now questioned about our longitude and whether we had a chronometer we gave the former but had nothing like the latter on board telling us once more not to make sail without the signal the schooner left us standing on until fairly out of sight we waited until she sunk her topsails and then went on our course  none of us doubted that this fellow was a pirate the men on board us were an illlooking set of rascals of all countries they spoke spanish but we gave them credit for being a mixture our escape was probably owing to our appearance which promised anything but a rich booty our drygoods and powder were concealed in casks under he ballast and i suppose the papers were not particularly minute at any rate when we get into para most of the cargo went out of our schooner privately being landed from lighters we had a passenger who passed for some revolutionary man who also landed secretly this gentleman was in a good deal of concern about the pirates keeping himself hid while they were near us    chapter xvi    our passage from para was good until the brig reached the latitude of bermuda here one morning for the first time in this craft sundays excepted we got a forenoon watch below i was profiting by the opportunity to do a little work for myself when the mate an inexperienced young man who was connected with the owners came and ordered us up to help jibe ship it was easy enough to do this in the watch but he thought differently as an old seaman i do not hesitate to say that the order was both inconsiderate and unnecessary though i do not wish to appear even to justify my own conduct on the occasion a hasty temper is one of my besetting weaknesses and at that time i was in no degree influenced by any considerations of a moral nature as connected with language exceedingly exasperated at this interference with our comfort i did not hesitate to tell the mate my opinion of his order warming with my own complaints i soon became fearfully profane and denunciatory i called down curses on the brig and all that belonged to her not hesitating about wishing that she might founder at sea and carry all hands of us to the bottom of the ocean in a word i indulged in all that looseness and profanity of the tongue which is common enough with those who feel no restraints on the subject and who are highly exasperated  i do think the extent to which i carried my curses and wishes on this occasion frightened the officers they said nothing but let me curse myself out to my hearts content a man soon wearies of so bootless a task and the storm passed off like one in the heavens with a low rumbling i gave myself no concern about the matter afterwards but things took their course until noon while the people were at dinner the mate came forward again however and called all hands to shorten sail going on deck i saw a very menacing black cloud astern and went to work with a will to discharge a duty that everybody could see was necessary  we gathered in the canvass as fast as we could but before we could get through and while i was lending a hand to furl the foresail the squall struck the brig i call it a squall but it was more like the tail of a hurricane most of our canvass blew from the gaskets the cloth going in ribands the foresail and foretopsail we managed to save but all our light canvass went i was still aloft when the brig broachedto as she came up to the wind the foretopmast went over to leeward being carried away at the cap all the hamper came down and began to thresh against the larboard side of the lower rigging just at this instant a sea seemed to strike the brig under her bilge and fairly throw her on her beamends  all this appeared to me to be the work of only a minute i had scrambled to windward to get out of the way of the wreck and stood with one foot on the upper side of the bitts holding on to steady myself by some of the running rigging this was being in a very different attitude but on the precise spot where two or three hours before i had called on the almighty to pour out his vials of wrath upon the vessel myself and all she contained at that fearful instant conscience pricked me and i felt both shame and dread at my recent language it seemed to me as if i had been heard and that my impious prayers were about to be granted in the bitterness of my heart i vowed should my life be spared never to be guilty of such gross profanity again  these feelings however occupied me but a moment i was too much of a real seadog to be standing idle at a time like that there was but one man before the mast on whom i could call for anything in such a strait and that was a new yorker of the name of jack neal this man was near me and i suggested to him the plan of getting the foretopmast staysail loose notwithstanding the mast was gone in the hope it might blow open and help the brigs bows round jack was a fellow to act and he succeeded in loosening the sail which did blow out in a way greatly to help us as i think i then proposed we should clamber aft and try to get the helm up this we did also though i question if the rudder could have had much power in the position in which the brig lay  either owing to the foretopmast staysail or to some providential sea the vessel did fall off however and presently she righted coming up with great force with a heavy roll to windward the staysail helped us i feel persuaded as the stay had got taut in the wreck and the wind had blown out the hanks the brigs helm being hard up as soon as she got way the craft flew round like a top coming up on the other tack in spite of us and throwing her nearly over again she did not come fairly down however though i thought she was gone for an instant  finding it possible to move i now ran forward and succeeded in stopping the wreck into the rigging and bitts at this time the brig minded her helm and fell off coming under command to help us the head of the spencer got loose from the throatbrail up and blowing out against the wreck the whole formed together a body of hamper that acted as a sort of sail which helped the brig to keep clear of the seas by close attention to the helm we were enabled to prevent the vessel from broachingto again and of course managed to sail her on her bottom about sunset it moderated and next morning the weather was fine we then went to work and rigged jurymasts reaching new york a few days later  had this accident occurred to our vessel in the night as did that to the scourge our fate would probably have been decided in a few minutes as it was half an hour in the sort of sea that was going would have finished her as for my repentance if i can use the term on such an occasion and for such a feeling it was more lasting than thorough i have never been so fearfully profane since and often when i have felt the disposition to give way to passion in this revolting form my feelings as i stood by those bitts have recurred to my mindmy vow has been remembered and i hope together they did some good until i was made to see the general errors of my life and the necessity of throwing all my sins on the merciful interposition of my saviour  i was not as reckless and extravagant this time in port as i had usually been of late years i shipped before my money was all gone on board the henry kneeland for liverpool viâ new orleans on reaching the latter port all hands of us were beset by the landsharks in the shape of landlords who told us how much better we should be off by running than by sticking by the ship we listened to these tales and went in a body what made the matter worse and our conduct the less excusable was the fact that we got good wages and good treatment in the henry kneeland the landlords came with two boats in the night we passed our dunnage down to them and away we went leaving only one man on board the very next day we all shipped on board the marian united states revenue cutter where i was rated a quartermate at fifteen dollars a month leaving seventeen to obtain this preferment  we got a good craft for our money however she was a large comfortable schooner that mounted a few light guns and our duty was far from heavy the treatment turned out to be good also as some relief to our folly one of our henry kneelands died of the horrors before we got to sea and we buried him at the wateringplace near the lower bar i must have been about four months in the marion during which time we visited the different keys and went into key west at this place our crew became sickly and i was landed among others and sent to a boardinghouse it was near a month before we could get the crew together again when we sailed for norfolk at norfolk six of us had relapses and were sent to the hospital the cutter sailing without us i never saw the craft afterwards  i was but a fortnight in the hospital the disease being only the fever and ague just as i came out the alert the new york cutter came in and i was sent on board her this separated me from all the henry kneelands but one old man the alert was bound south on duty connected with the nullification troubles and soon after i joined her she sailed for charleston south carolina here a little fleet of cutters soon collected no less than seven of us being at anchor in the waters of south carolina to prevent any breach of the tariff laws when i had been on board the alert about a month a new cutter called the jackson came in from new york and being the finest craft on the station our officers and crew were transferred to her in a body our captain being the senior of all the revenue captains present  i must have been at least six months in the waters of south carolina thus employed we never went to sea but occasionally dropped down as far as rebellion roads we were not allowed to go ashore except on rare occasions and towards the last matters got to be so serious that we almost looked upon ourselves as in an enemys country commodore elliott joined the station in the natchez sloopofwar and the experiment manofwar schooner also arrived and remained after the arrival of the natchez the commodore took command of all hands of us afloat and we were kept in a state of high preparation for service we were occasionally at quarters nights though i never exactly knew the reasons it was said attacks on us were anticipated general scott was in the fort and matters looked very warlike for several weeks  at length we got the joyful news that nullification had been thrown overboard and that no more was to be apprehended it seems that the crews of the different cutters had been increased for this particular service but now it was over there were more men employed than government had needed we were told in consequence that those among us who wished our discharges might have them on application  i had been long enough in this longshore service and applied to be discharged under this provision my time was so near out however that i should have got away soon in regular course  i now went ashore at charleston and had my swig as long as the money lasted i gave myself no trouble about the ships husband whose collarbone i had broken nor do i now know whether he was then living or dead in a word i thought only of the present time the past and the future being equally indifferent to me my old landlord was dead and i fell altogether into the hands of a new set i never took the precaution to change my name at any period of my life with the exception that i dropped the robert in signing shippingarticles i also wrote my name myers instead of meyers as i have been informed by my sister was the true spelling but this proceeded from ignorance and not from intention in all times and seasons and weathers and services i have sailed as ned myers and as nothing else  it soon became necessary to ship again and i went on board the harriet and jesse which was bound to havre de grace this proved to be a pleasant easy voyage the ship coming back to new york filled with passengers who were called swiss but most of whom as i understand came from wurtemberg alsace and the countries on the rhine on reaching new york i went on to philadelphia to obtain the effects i had left there when i went out in the amelia but my landlord was dead his family was scattered and my property had disappeared i never knew who got it but a quadrant watch and some entirely new clothes went in the wreck i suppose i lost at least two hundred dollars in this way what odds did it make to me it would have gone in grog if it had not gone in this manner  i staid but a short time in philadelphia joining a brig called the topaz bound to havana we arrived out after a short passage and here i was exposed to as strong a temptation to commit crime as a poor fellow need encounter a beautiful americanbuilt brig was lying in port bound to africa for slaves she was the loveliest craft i ever laid eyes on and the very sight of her gave me a longing to go in her she offered forty dollars a month with the privilege of a slave and a half i went so far as to try to get on board her but met with some difficulty in having my things seized the captain found it out and by pointing out to me the danger i ran succeeded in changing my mind  i will not deny that i knew the trade was immoral but so is smuggling and i viewed them pretty much as the same thing in this sense i am now told that the law of this country pronounces the american citizen who goes in a slaver a pirate and treats him as such which to me seems very extraordinary i do not understand how a spaniard can do that and be no pirate which makes an american a pirate if he be guilty of it i feel certain that very few sailors know in what light the law views slaving now piracy is robbing on the high seas and has always been contrary to law but slaving was encouraged by all nations a short time since and we poor tars look upon the change as nothing but a change in policy as for myself i should have gone in that brig in utter ignorance of the risks i ran and believing myself to be about as guilty in a moral sense as i was when i smuggled tobacco on the coast of ireland or opium in canton 15  as the topaz was coming out of the port of havana homeward bound and just as she was abreast of the moro the brig carried away her bobstay i was busy in helping to unreeve the stay when i was seized with sudden and violent cramps this attack proved to be the cholera which came near carrying me off the captain had me taken aft where i was attended with the greatest care god be praised for his mercy i got well though scarcely able to do any more duty before we got in  a short voyage gives short commons and i was soon obliged to look out for another craft this time i shipped in the erie captain funk a havre liner and sailed soon after this was a noble ship with the best of usage both our passages were pleasant and give me nothing to relate while i was at work in the hold at havre a poor female passenger who came to look at the ship fell through the hatch and was so much injured as to be left behind i mention the circumstance merely to show how near i was to a meeting with my old shipmate who is writing these pages and yet missed him on comparing notes i find he was on deck when this accident happened having come to see after some effects he was then shipping to new york these very effects i handled and supposed them to belong to a passenger who was to come home in the ship but as they were addressed to another name i could not recognise them mr cooper did not come home in the erie but passed over to england and embarked at london and so i failed to see him  in these liners the captains wish to keep the good men of their crews as long as they can we liked the erie and her captain so much that eight or ten of us stuck by the ship and went out in her again this time our luck was not so good the passage out was well enough but homewardbound we had a hard time of it while in havre too we had a narrow escape christmas night a fire broke out in the cabin and came near smothering us all forward before we knew anything about it our chief mate whose name was everdy16 saved the vessel by his caution and exertions the captain not getting on board until the fire had come to a head we kept everything closed until an engine was ready then cut away the deck and sent down the hose this expedient with a free use of water saved the ship it is not known how the fire originated a good deal of damage was done and some property was lost  notwithstanding this accident we had the ship ready for sea early in january 1834 for the first week out we met with head winds and heavy weather so heavy indeed as to render it difficult to get rid of the pilot the ship beat down channel with him on board as low as the eddystone here we saw the sully outward bound running up channel before the wind signals were exchanged and our ship which was then well off the land ran in and spoke the sully we put our pilot on board this ship which was doing a good turn all round the afternoon proving fair and the wind moderating captain funk filled and stood in near to the coast as his best tack towards night however the gale freshened and blew into the bay between the start point and the lizard in a heavy steady manner  the first thing was to ware off shore after which we were compelled to take in nearly all our canvass the gale continued to increase and the night set in dark there were plenty of ports to leeward but it was ticklish work to lose a foot of ground unless one knew exactly where he was going we had no pilot and the captain decided to hold on i have seldom known it to blow harder than it did that night and for hours everything depended on our maintopsails standing which sail we had set closereefed i did not see anything to guide us but the compass until about ten oclock when i caught a view of a light close on our lee bow this was the eddystone which stands pretty nearly in a line between the start and the lizard and rather more than three leagues from the land as we headed we might lay past should everything stand but if our topsail went we should have been pretty certain of fetching up on those famous rocks where a threedecker would have gone to pieces in an hours time in such a gale  i suppose we passed the eddystone at a safe distance or the captain would not have attempted going to windward of it but to me it appeared that we were fearfully near the sea was breaking over the light tremendously and could be plainly seen as it flashed up near the lantern we went by however surging slowly ahead though our drift must have been very material  the start and the point to the westward of it were still to be cleared they were a good way off and but a little to leeward as the ship headed in smooth water and with a wholesail breeze it would have been easy enough to lay past the start when at the eddystone with a southwest wind but in a gale it is a serious matter especially on a floodtide i know all hands of us forward and aft looked upon our situation as very grave we passed several uneasy hours after we lost sight of the eddystone before we got a view of the land near the start when i saw it the heights appeared like a dark cloud hanging over us and i certainly thought the ship was gone at this time the captain and mate consulted together and the latter came to us in a very calm steady manner and saidcome boys we may as well go ashore without masts as with them and our only hope is in getting more canvass to stand we must turnto and make sail on the ship  everybody was in motion on this hint and the first thing we did was to board foretack the clews of that sail came down as if so many giants had hold of the tack and sheet we set it doublereefed which made it but a rag of a sail and yet the ship felt it directly we next tried the foretopsail closereefed and this stood it was well we did for i feel certain the ship was now in the groundswell that black hill seemed ready to fall on our heads we tried the mizentopsail but we found it would not do and we furled it again not without great difficulty things still looked serious the land drawing nearer and nearer and we tried to get the mainsail doublereefed on the ship everybody mustered at the tack and sheet and we dragged down that bit of cloth as if it had been muslin the good ship now quivered like a horse that is overridden but in those liners everything is strong and everything stood i never saw spray thrown from a ships bows as it was thrown from the eries that night we had a breathless quarter of an hour after the mainsail was set everybody looking to see what would go first every rope and bolt in the craft was tried to the utmost but all stood at the most critical moment we caught a glimpse of a light in a house that was known to stand near the start and the mate came among us pointed it out and said if we weathered that we should go clear after hearing this my eyes were never off that light and glad was i to see it slowly drawing more astern and more under our lee at last we got it on our quarter and knew that we had gone clear the gloomylooking land disappeared to leeward in a deep broad bay giving us plenty of searoom  we now took in canvass to ease the ship the mainsail and foretopsail were furled leaving her to jog along under the maintopsail foresail and foretopmast staysail i look upon this as one of my narrowest escapes from shipwreck and i consider the escape under the mercy of god to have been owing to the steadiness of our officers and the goodness of the ship and her outfit it was like pushing a horse to the trial of every nerve and sinew and only winning the race under whip and spur wood and iron and cordage and canvass can do no more than they did that night  next morning at breakfast the crew talked the matter over we had a hard set in this ship the men being prime seamen but of reckless habits and characters some of the most thoughtless among them admitted that they had prayed secretly for succour and for myself i am most thankful that i did these confessions were made halfjestingly but i believe them to have been true judging from my own case it may sound bravely in the ears of the thoughtless and foolish to boast of indifference on such occasions but few men can face death under circumstances like those in which we were placed without admitting to themselves however reluctantly that there is a power above on which they must lean for personal safety as well as for spiritual support more than usual care was had for the future welfare of sailors among the havre liners there being a mariners church at havre at which our captain always attended as well as his mates and efforts were made to make us go also the effect was good the men being better behaved and more sober in consequence  the wind shifted a day or two after this escape giving us a slant that carried us past scilly fairly out into the atlantic a fortnight or so after our interview with the eddystone we carried away the pintals of the rudder which was saved only by the modern invention that prevents the head from dropping by means of the deck to prevent the strain and to get some service from the rudder however we found it necessary to sling the latter and to breast it into the sternpost by means of purchases a spar was laid athwart the coachhouse directly over the rudder and we rove a chain through the tillerhole and passed it over this spar for this purpose the smallest chaincable was used the rudder being raised from the deck by means of sheers we then got a set of chaintopsail sheets parcelled them well and took a clove hitch with them around the rudder about halfway up one end was brought into each mainchain and set up by tackles in this manner the wheel did tolerably well though we had to let the ship lieto in heavy weather  the chain sheets held on near a month and then gave way on examination it was found that the parcelling had gone under the ships counter and that the copper had nearly destroyed the iron after this we mustered all the chains of the ship of proper size parcelled them very thoroughly got another clove hitch around the rudder as before and brought the ends to the hawseholes letting the bights fall one on each side of the ships keel the ends were next brought to the windlass and hove taut this answered pretty well and stood until we got the ship into new york our whole passage was stormy and lasted seventy days as near as i can recollect the ship was almost given up when we got in and great was the joy at our arrival  as the erie lost her turn in consequence of wanting repairs most of us went on board the henry ivth in the same line this voyage was comfortable and successful a fine ship and good usage on our return to new york most of us went back to the erie liking both vessel and captain as well as her other officers i went twice more to havre and back in this ship making four voyages in her in all at the end of the fourth voyage our old mate left us to do business ashore and we took a dislike to his successor though it was without trying him the mate we lost had been a great favourite and we seemed to think if he went we must go too at any rate nearly all hands went to the silvie de grasse where we got another good ship good officers and good treatment in fact all these havre liners were very much alike in these respects the silvie de grasse being the fourth in which i had then sailed and to me they all seemed as if they belonged to the same family i went twice to havre in this ship also when i left her for the normandy in the same line i made this change in consequence of an affair about some segars in havre in which i had no other concern than to father another mans fault the captain treated me very handsomely but my temperament is such that i am apt to fly off in a tangent when anything goes up stream it was caprice that took me from the silvie de grasse and put me in her sisterliner  i liked the normandy as well as the rest of these liners except that the vessel steered badly i made only one voyage in her however as will be seen in the next chapter    chapter xvii    i had now been no less than eight voyages in the havre trade without intermission so regular had my occupation become that i began to think i was a part of a liner myself i liked the treatment the food the ships and the officers whenever we got home i worked in the ship at days work until paid off after which no more was seen of ned until it was time to go on board to sail when i got in in the normandy it happened as usual though i took a short swing only mr everdy our old mate in the erie was working gangs of stevedores riggers c ashore and when i went and reported myself to him as ready for work in the normandy again he observed that her gang was full but that by going uptown next morning to the screwdock i should find an excellent job on board a brig the following day accordingly i took my dinner in a pail and started off for the dock as directed on my way i fell in with an old shipmate in the navy a boatswainsmate of the name of benson this man asked me where i was bound with my pail and i told him whats the use says he of dragging your soul out in these liners when you have a manofwar under your lee then he told me he meant to ship and advised me to do the same i drank with him two or three times and felt half persuaded to enter but recollecting the brig i left him and pushed on to the dock when i got there it was so late that the vessel had got off the dock and was already under way in the stream  my days work was now up and i determined to make a full holiday of it as i went back i fell in with captain mix the officer with whom i had first gone on the lakes and my old firstlieutenant in the delaware and had a bit of navy talk with him after which i drifted along as far as the rendezvous the officer in charge was mr mkenny my old firstlieutenant in the brandywine and before i quitted the house my name was down again for one of uncle sams sailormen in this accidental manner have i floated about the world most of my lifenot dreaming in the morning what would fetch me up before night  when it was time to go off i was ready and was sent on board the hudson which vessel captain mix then commanded i have the consolation of knowing that i never ran or thought of running from either of the eleven menofwar on board of which i have served counting big and little service of days and service of years i had so long a pull in the receivingship as to get heartily tired of her and when an opportunity offered i put my name down for the constellation 38 which was then fitting out for the west india station in norfolk a draft of us was sent round to that ship accordingly and we found she had hauled off from the yard and was lying between the forts when i got on board i ascertained that something like fifty of my old liners were in this very ship some common motive inducing them to take service in the navy all at the same time as for myself it happened just as i have related though i always liked the navy and was ever ready to join a ship of war for a pleasant cruise  commodore dallass pennant was flying in the constellation when i joined her a short time afterwards the ship sailed for the west indies as there was nothing material occurred in the cruise it is unnecessary to relate things in the order in which they took place the ship went to havana trinidad curaçoa laguayra santa cruz vera cruz campeachy tampico key west c we lay more or less time at all these ports and in santa cruz we had a great ball on board after passing several months in this manner we went to pensacola the st louis was with us most of this time though she did not sail from america in company the next season the whole squadron went to vera cruz in company seven or eight sail of us in all giving the mexicans some alarm i believe  but the florida war gave us the most occupation i was out in all sorts of ways on expeditions and can say i never saw an indian except those who came to give themselves up i was in steamboats cutters launches and on shore marching like a soldier with a gun on my shoulder and precious duty it was for a sailor  the st louis being short of hands i was also drafted for a cruise in her going the rounds much as we had done in the frigate this was a fine ship and was then commanded by captain rousseau an officer much respected and liked by us all mr byrne my old shipmate in the delaware went out with us as firstlieutenant of the constellation but he did not remain out the whole cruise  altogether i was out on the west india station three years but got into the hospital for several months of the time in consequence of a broken bone while in the hospital the frigate made a cruise leaving me ashore on her return i was invalided home in the levant captain paulding another solid excellent officer in a word i was lucky in my officers generally the treatment on board the frigate being just and good the duty in the constellation was very hard being a sort of soldier duty which may be very well for those that are trained to it but makes bad weather for us bluejackets captain mix the officer with whom i went to the lakes was out on the station in command of the concord sloop of war and for some time was in charge of our ship during the absence of commodore dallas in his own vessel in this manner are old shipmates often thrown together after years of separation  in the hospital i was rated as porter captain bolton and captain latirner being my commanding officers the first being in charge of the yard and the second his next in rank from these two gentlemen i received so many favours that it would be ungrateful in me not to mention them dr terrill the surgeon of the hospital too was also exceedingly kind to me during the time i was under his care  as i had much leisure time in the hospital i took charge of a garden and got to be somewhat of a gardener it was said i had the best garden about pensacola which is quite likely true as i never saw but one other  the most important thing however that occurred to me while in the hospital was a disposition that suddenly arose in my mind to reflect on my future state and to look at religious things with serious eyes dr terrill had some blacks in his service who were in the habit of holding little methodist meetings where they sang hymns and conversed together seriously i never joined these people being too white for that down at pensacola but i could overhear them from my own little room a roman catholic in the hospital had a prayerbook in english which he lent to me and i got into the habit of reading a prayer in it daily as a sort of worshipping of the almighty this was the first act of mine that approached private worship since the day i left mr marchintons if i except the few hasty mental petitions put up in moments of danger  after a time i began to think it would never do for me a protestant born and baptised to be studying a romish prayerbook and i hunted up one that was protestant and which had been written expressly for seamen this i took to my room and used in place of the romish book dr terrill had a number of bibles under his charge and i obtained one of these also and i actually got into the practice of reading a chapter every night as well as of reading a prayer also knocked off from drink and ceased to swear my reading in the bible now was not for the stories but seriously to improve my mind and morals  i must have been several months getting to be more and more in earnest on the subject of morality if not of vital religion when i formed an acquaintance with a new steward who had just joined the hospital this man was ready enough to converse with me about the bible but he turned out to be a deist notwithstanding my own disposition to think more seriously of my true situation i had many misgivings on the subject of the saviours being the son of god it seemed improbable to me and i was falling into the danger which is so apt to beset the new beginnerthat of selfsufficiency and the substituting of human wisdom for faith the steward was not slow in discovering this and he produced some of tom paines works by way of strengthening me in the unbelief i now read tom paine instead of the bible and soon had practical evidence of the bad effects of his miserable system i soon got sternway on me in morals began to drink as before though seldom intoxicated and grew indifferent to my bible and prayerbook as well as careless of the future i began to think that the things of this world were to be enjoyed and he was the wisest who made the most of his time  i must confess also that the bad examples which i saw set by men professing to be christians had a strong tendency to disgust me with religion the great mistake i made was in supposing i had undergone any real change of heart circumstances disposed me to reflect and reflection brought me to be serious on subjects that i had hitherto treated with levity but the grace of god was still in a great degree withheld from me leaving me a prey to such arguments as those of the steward and his great prophet and master mr paine  in the hospital and that too at a place like pensacola there was little opportunity for me to break out into my old excesses though i found liquor on one or two occasions even there and got myself into some disgrace in consequence on the whole however the discipline my situation and my own resolution kept me tolerably correct it is the restraint of a ship that alone prevents sailors from dying much sooner than they do for it is certain no man could hold out long who passed three or four months every year in the sort of indulgencies into which i myself have often run after returning from long voyages this is one advantage of the navy two or three days of riotous living being all a fellow can very well get in a three years cruise any man who has ever been in a vessel of war particularly in old times can see the effect produced by the system and regular living of a ship when the crew first came on board the men were listless almost lifeless with recent dissipation some suffering with the horrors perhaps but a few weeks of regular living would bring them all round and by the end of the cruise most of the people would come into port and be paid off with renovated constitutions it is a little different now to be sure as the men ship for general service and commonly serve a short apprenticeship in a receiving vessel before they are turned over to the seagoing craft this brings them on board the last in a little better condition than used to be the case but even now six months in a manofwar is a new lease for a seamans life  i say i got myself into disgrace in the hospital of pensacola in consequence of my habit of drinking the facts were as follows for i have no desire to conceal or to parade before the world my own delinquencies but i confess them with the hope that the pictures they present may have some salutary influence on the conduct of others the doctor who was steadily my friend and often gave me excellent advice went north in order to bring his wife to pensacola i was considered entitled to a pension for the hurt which had brought me into the hospital and the doctor had promised to see something about it while at washington this was not done in consequence of his not passing through washington as had been expected now nature has so formed me that any disgust or disappointment makes me reckless and awakens a desire to revenge myself on myself as i may say it was this feeling which first carried me from halifax it was this feeling that made me run from the sterling and which has often changed and sometimes marred my prospects as i have passed through life as soon as i learned that nothing had been said about my pension this same feeling came over me and i became reckless i had not drawn my grog for months and indeed had left off drinking entirely but i now determined to have my fill at the first good opportunity i meant to make the officers sorry by doing something that was very wrong and for which i should be sorry myself  i kept the keys of the liquor of the hospital the first thing was to find a confederate which i did in the person of a baltimore chap who entered into my plan from pure love of liquor i then got a stock of the wine and we went to work on it in my room the liquor was sherry and it took nine bottles of it to lay us both up even this did not make me beastly drunk but it made me desperate and impudent i abused the doctor and came very near putting my foot into it with captain latimer who is an officer that it will not do always to trifle with still these gentlemen with captain bolton had more consideration for me than i had for myself and i escaped with only a good reprimand it was owing to this frolic however that i was invalided homeas they call it out there no one seeming to consider pensacola as being in the united states  when landed from the levant i was sent to the navy yard hospital brooklyn after staying two or three days here i determined to go to the seat of government and take a look at the great guns stationed there uncle sam and all i was paid off from the levant accordingly and leaving the balance with the purser of the yard i set off on my journey with fifty dollars in my pockets which they tell me is about a member of congress mileage for the distance i had to go of course this was enough as a member of congress would naturally take care and give himself as much as he wanted  when i got on board the southamboy boat i found a party of indians there going to headquarters like myself the sight of these chaps set up all my rigging and i felt ripe for fun i treated them to a breakfast each and gave them as much to drink as they could swallow we all got merry and had our own coarse fun in the usual thought less manner of seamen this was a bad beginning and by the time we reached a tavern i was ready to anchor where this was is more than i know for i was not in a state to keep a ships reckoning whether any of my money was stolen or not i cannot say but i know that some of my clothes were next day i got to philadelphia where i had another frolic after this i went on to washington keeping it up the whole distance i fell in with a soldier chap who was out of cash and who was going to washington to get a pension too and so we lived in common when we reached washington my cash was diminished to three dollars and a half and all was the consequences of brandy and folly i had actually spent fortysix dollars and a half in a journey that might have been made with ten respectably  i got my travelling companion to recommend a boardinghouse which he did i felt miserable from my excesses and went to bed in the morning the three dollars and a half were gone i felt too ill to go to the department that day but kept on drinkingeating nothing next day my landlord took the trouble to inquire into the state of my pocket and i told him the truth this brought about a pretty free explanation between us in which i was given to understand that my time was up in that place i afterwards found out i had got into a regular soldierhouse and it was no wonder they did not know how to treat an old salt  captain mix had given me a letter to commodore chauncey who was then living and one of the commissioners i felt pretty certain the old gentleman would not let one of the scourges founder at headquarters and so i crawled up to the department and got admission to him the commodore seemed glad to see me questioned me a good deal about the loss of the schooner and finally gave me directions how to proceed i then discovered that my pension ticket had actually reached washington but had been sent back to pensacola to get some informality corrected this would compel me to remain some time at washington i felt unwell and got back to my boardinghouse with these tidings the gentleman who kept the house was far from being satisfied with this and he gave me a hint that at once put the door between us this was the first time i ever had a door shut upon me and i am thankful it happened at a soldier rendezvous i gave the man all my spare clothes in pawn and walked away from his house  i had undoubtedly brought on myself a fit of the horrors by my recent excesses as i went along the streets i thought every one was sneering at me and though burning with thirst i felt ashamed to enter any house to ask even for water a black gave me the direction of the navy yard and i shaped my course for it feeling more like lying down to die than anything else when about halfway across the bit of vacant land between the capitol and the yard i sat down under a high picketfence and the devil put it into my head that it would be well to terminate sufferings that seemed too hard to be borne by hanging myself on that very fence i took the handkerchief from my neck made a running bowline and got so far as to be at work at a standing bowline to hitch over the top of one of the poles of the fence  i now stood up and began to look for a proper picket to make fast to when in gazing about i caught sight of the mastheads of the shipping at the yard and of the ensign under which i had so long served these came over me as a lighthouse comes over a mariner in distress at sea and i thought there must be friends for me in that quarter the sight gave me courage and strength and i determined no old shipmate should hear of a bluejackets hanging himself on a picket in a fit of the horrors casting off the bowlines i replaced the handkerchief on my neck and made the best of my way towards those blessed mastheads which under gods mercy were the means of preventing me from committing suicide  as i came up to the gate of the yard the marine on post sung out to me halloo myers where are you come from you look as if you had been dragged through h and beaten with a sootbag this man the first i met at the navy yard had been with me three years in the delaware and knew me in spite of my miserable appearance he advised me to go on board the fulton then lying at the yard where he said i should find several more old delawares who would take good care of me i did as he directed and on getting on board i fell in with lots of acquaintances some brought me tea and some brought me grog i told my yarn and the chaps around me laid a plan to get ashore on liberty that night and razée the house from which i had been turned away but i persuaded them out of the notion and the landlord went clear  alter a while i got a direction to a boardinghouse near the yard and went to it with a message from my old shipmates that they would be responsible for the pay but to this the man would not listen he took me in on my own account saying that no bluejacket should be turned from his door in distress here i staid and got a comfortable nights rest next day i was a new man holystoned the decks and went a second time to the department  all the gentlemen in the office showed a desire to serve and advise me the pension clerk gave me a letter to mr boyle the chief clerk who gave me another letter to commodore patterson the commandant of the navyyard it seems that government provides a boardinghouse for us pensioners to stay in while at washington looking after our rights this letter of mr boyles got me a berth in that house where i was supplied with everything even to washing and mending for six weeks through the purser i drew a stock of money from the purser at new york and now began again to live soberly and respectably considering all things  the house in which i lived was a sort of halfhospital and may have had six or eight of us in it altogether several of us were cripples from wounds and hurts and among others was one reuben james a thorough old manofwars man who had been in the service ever since he was a youth this man had the credit of saving decaturs life before tripoli but he owned to me that he was not the person who did it he was in the fight and boarded with decatur but did not save his commanders life he had been often wounded and had just had a leg amputated for an old wound received in the war of 1812 i believe liquor brought him to that  the reader will remember that the night the scourge went down i received a severe blow from her jibsheet blocks a lump soon formed on the spot where the injury had been inflicted and it had continued to increase until it was now as large as my fist or even larger i showed this lump to james one day and he mentioned it to dr foltz the surgeon who attended the house the doctor took a look at my arm and recommended an operation as the lump would continue to increase and was already so large as to be inconvenient i cannot say that it hurt me any though it was an awkward sort of swab to be carrying on a fellows shoulder i had no great relish for being carved and think i should have refused to submit to the operation were it not for james who told me he would not be carrying bunker hill about on his arm and would show me his own stump by way of encouragement this man seemed to think an old sailor ought to have a wooden leg or something of the sort after he had reached a certain time of life at all events he persuaded me to let the doctor go to work and i am now glad i did as everything turned out well doctor foltz operated after i had been about a week under medicine doing the job as neatly as man could wish he told me the lump he removed weighed a pound and three quarters and of course i was so much the lighter i was about a month after this under his care when he pronounced me to be seaworthy again  i now got things straight as regards my pension for the hurt received on board the constellation it was no great matter only three dollars a month being one of the small pensions and the clerks when they came to hear about the hurt for which dr foltz had operated advised me to get evidence and procure a pension for that i saw the secretary mr paulding on this subject and the gentlemen were so kind as to overhaul their papers in order to ascertain who could be found as a witness they wrote to captain deacon the officer who commanded the growler but he knew nothing of me as i never was on board his schooner this gentleman however wrote me a letter himself inviting me to come and see him which i had it not in my power to do i understand he is now dead mr trant had been dead many years and as for mr bogardus i never knew what became of him he was not in the line of promotion and probably left the navy at the peace in overhauling the books however the pensionclerk came across the name of lemuel bryant this man received a pension for the wound he got at little york and was one of those i had hauled into the boat when the scourge went down he was then living at portland in maine his native state mr paulding advised me to get his certificate for all hands in the department seemed anxious i should not go away without something better than the three dollars a month i promised to go on and see lemuel bryant and obtain his testimony  quitting washington i went to alexandria and got on board a brig called the isabella bound to new york at which port we arrived in due time here i obtained the rest of my money and kept myself pretty steady more on account of my wounds i fear than anything else still i drank too much and by way of putting a check on myself i went to the sailors retreat staten island and of course got out of the reach of liquor here i staid eight or ten days until my wounds healed while at the retreat the last day i remained there indeed which was a sunday the physician came in and told me that a clergyman of the dutch reformed church of the name of miller was about to have service down stairs and that i had better go down and be present to this request not only civilly but kindly made i answered that i had seen enough of the acts of religious men to satisfy me and that i believed a story i was then reading in a magazine would do me as much good as a sermon the physician said a little in the way of reproof and admonition and left me as soon as his back was turned some of my companions began to applaud the spirit i had shown and the answer i had given the doctor but i was not satisfied with myself i had more secret respect for such things than i was willing to own and conscience upbraided me for the manner in which i had slighted so wellmeaning a request suddenly telling those around me that my mind was changed and that i would go below and hear what was said i put this new resolution in effect immediately  i had no recollection of the text from which mr miller preached it is possible i did not attend to it at the moment it was given out but during the whole discourse i fancied the clergyman was addressing himself particularly to me and that his eyes were never off me that he touched my conscience i know for the effect produced by this sermon though not uninterruptedly lasting is remembered to the present hour i made many excellent resolutions and secretly resolved to reform and to lead a better life my thoughts were occupied the whole night with what i had heard and my conscience was keenly active  the next morning i quitted the retreat and saw no more of mr miller at that time but i carried away with me many resolutions that would have been very admirable had they only been adhered to how shortlived they were and how completely i was the slave of a vicious habit will be seen when i confess that i landed in new york a good deal the worse for having treated some militiamen who were in the steamer to nearly a dozen glasses of hotstuff in crossing the bay i had plenty of money and a sailors disposition to get rid of it carelessly and what i thought generously it was evacuationday and severely cold and the hotstuff pleased everybody on such an occasion nor was this all in passing whitehall slip i saw the ohios firstcutter lying there and it happened that i not only knew the officer of the boat who had been one of the midshipmen of the constellation but that i knew most of its crew i was hailed of course and then i asked leave to treat the men the permission was obtained and this second act of liberality reduced me to the necessity of going into port under a pilots charge still i had not absolutely forgotten the sermon nor all my good resolutions  at the boardinghouse i found a prussian named godfrey a steady sedate man and i agreed with him to go to savannah to engage in the shadfishery for the winter and to come north together in the spring my landlord was not only ill and poor but he had many children to support and it is some proof that all my good resolutions were not forgotten that i was ready to go south before my money was gone and willing it should do some good in the interval of my absence a check for fifty dollars still remained untouched and i gave it to this man with the understanding he was to draw the money use it for his own wants and return it to me if he could when i got back the money was drawn but the man died and i saw no more of it  godfrey and i were shipped in a vessel called the william taylor a regular savannah packet it was our intention to quit her as soon as she got inby running if necessary we had a bad passage and barely missed shipwreck on hatteras saving the brig by getting a sudden view of the light in heavy thick weather we got round under closereefed topsails and that was all we did after this we had a quick run to savannah godfrey had been taken with the smallpox before we arrived and was sent to a hospital as soon as possible in order to prevent running i feigned illness too and went to another here the captain paid me several visits but my conscience was too much hardened by the practices of seamen to let me hesitate about continuing to be ill the brig was obliged to sail without me and the same day i got well as suddenly as i had fallen ill  i was not long in making a bargain with a fisherman to aid in catching shad all this time i lived at a sailor boardinghouse and was surrounded by men who like myself had quitted the vessels in which they had arrived one night the captain of a ship called the hope came to the house to look for a crew he was bound to rotterdam and his ship lay down at the second bar all ready for sea after some talk one man signed the articles then another and another and another until his crew was complete to one man i was now called on to ship and was ridiculed for wishing to turn shadman my pride was touched and i agreed to go leaving my fisherman in the lurch  the hope turned out to be a regular downeast craft and i had been in so many flyers and crack ships as to be saucy enough to laugh at the economical outfit and staid ways of the vessel i went on board half drunk and made myself conspicuous for such sort of strictures from the first hour the captain treated me mildly even kindly but i stuck to my remarks during most of the passage i was a seaman and did my duty but this satisfied me i had taken a disgust to the ship and though i had never blasphemed since the hour of the accident in the way i did the day the susan and mary was thrown on her beamends i may be said to have crossed the atlantic in the hope grumbling and swearing at the ship still our living and our treatment were both good  at rotterdam we got a little money with liberty when he last was up i asked for more and the captain refused it this brought on an explosion and i swore i would quit the ship after a time the captain consented as well as he could leaving my wages on the cabintable where i found them and telling me i should repent of what i was then doing little did i then think he would prove so true a prophet    chapter xviii    i had left the hope in a fit of the sulks the vessel never pleased me and yet i can now look back and acknowledge that both her master and her mate were respectable considerate men who had my own good in view more than i had myself there was an american ship called the plato in port and i had half a mind to try my luck in her the master of this vessel was said to be a tartar however and a set of us had doubts about the expediency of trusting ourselves with such a commander when we came to sound around him we discovered he would have nothing to do with us as he intended to get a crew of regular dutchmen this ship had just arrived from batavia and was bound to new york how he did this legally or whether he did it at all is more than i know for i only tell what i was told myself on this subject  there was a heavy dutch indiaman then fitting out for java lying at rotterdam the name of this vessel was the stadtdeelso pronounced how spelt i have no ideaand i began to think i would try a voyage in her as is common with those who have great reason to find fault with themselves i was angry with the whole world i began to think myself a sort of outcast forgetting that i had deserted my natural relatives run from my master and thrown off many friends who were disposed to serve me in everything in which i could be served i have a cheerful temperament by nature and i make no doubt that the sombre view i now began to take of things was the effects of drink it was necessary for me to get to sea for there i was shut out from all excesses by discipline and necessity  after looking around us and debating the matter among ourselves a party of five of us shipped in the stadtdeel what the others contemplated i do not know but it was my intention to double good hope and never to return chances enough would offer on the other side to make a man comfortable and i was no stranger to the ways of that quarter of the world i could find enough to do between bombay and canton and if i could not there were the islands and all of the pacific before me i could do a seamans whole duty was now in tolerable health and strength and knew that such men were always wanted wherever a ship goes jack must go with her and ships dollars and hogs are now to be met with all over the globe  the stadtdeel lay at dort and we went to that place to join her she was not ready for sea and as things moved dutchman fashion slow and sure we were about six weeks at dort before she sailed this ship was a vessel of the size of a frigate and carried twelve guns she had a crew of about forty souls which was being very shorthanded the ships company was a strange mixture of seamen though most of them came from the north of europe among us were russians danes swedes prussians english americans and but a very few dutch one of the mates and two of the petty officers could speak a little english this made us eight who could converse in that language we had to learn dutch as well as we could and made out tolerably well before the ship sailed i could understand the common orders without much difficulty indeed the language is nothing but english a little flattened down  so long as we remained at dort the treatment on board this vessel was well enough we were never well fed though we got enough food such as it was the work was hard and the weather cold but these did not frighten me the wages were eight dollars a monthi had abandoned eighteen and an american ship for this preferment a wayward temper had done me this service  the stadtdeel no sooner got into the stream than there was a great change in the treatment we were put on an allowance of food and water in sight of our place of departure and the ropesend began to fly round among the crew we five excepted for some reason that i cannot explain neither of us was ever struck we got plenty of curses in low dutch as we supposed and we gave them back with interest in high english the expression of our faces let the parties into the secret of what was going on  it is scarcely necessary to add that we english and americans soon repented of the step we had taken i heartily wished myself on board the hope again and the masters prophecy became true much sooner perhaps than he had himself anticipated this time i conceive that my disgust was fully justified though i deserved the punishment i was receiving for entering so blindly into a service every way so inferior to that to which i properly belonged the bread in this ship was wholesome i do suppose but it was nearly black and such as i was altogether unused to inferior as it was we got but five pounds each per week in our navy a man gets per week seven pounds of such bread as might be put on a gentlemans table the meat was little better than the bread in quality and quite as scant in quantity we got one good dish in the stadtdeel and that we got every morning it was a dish of boiled barley of which i became very fond and which indeed supplied me with the strength necessary for my duty it was one of the best dishes i ever fell in with at sea and i think it might be introduced to advantage in our service good food produces good work  as all our movements were of the slow and easy order the ship lay three weeks at the helvoetsluys waiting for passengers during this time our party three english and two americans came to a determination to abandon the ship our plan was to seize a boat as we passed down channel and get ashore in england we were willing to run all the risks of such a step in preference of going so long a voyage under such treatment and food by this time our discontent amounted to disgust  at length we got all our passengers on board these consisted of a family of which the head was said to be or to have been an admiral in the dutch navy this gentleman was going to java to remain and he took with him his wife several children servants and a lady who seemed to be a companion to his wife as soon as this party was on board the wind coming fair we sailed the plato went to sea in company with us and little did i then think while wishing myself on board her how soon i should be thrown into this very shipthe last craft in which i ever was at sea i was heaving the lead as we passed her our ship dutchman or not having a fleet pair of heels the stadtdeel whatever might be her usage or her food sailed and worked well and was capitally found in everything that related to the safety of the vessel this was her first voyage and she was said to be the largest ship out of rotterdam  the stadtdeel must have sailed from helvoetsluys in may 1839 or about thirtythree years after i sailed from new york on my first voyage in the sterling during all this time i had been toiling at sea like a dog risking my health and life in a variety of ways and this ship with my station on board her was nearly all i had to show for it god be praised this voyage which promised so little in its commencement proved in the end the most fortunate of any in which i embarked  there was no opportunity for us to put our plans in execution in going down channel the wind was fair and it blew so fresh it would not have been easy to get a boat into the water and we passed the straits of dover by daylight the very day we sailed the wind held in the same quarter until we reached the northeast trades giving us a quick run as low down as the calm latitudes all this time the treatment was as bad as ever or if anything worse and our discontent increased daily there were but one or two native hollanders in the forecastle boys excepted but among them was a man who had shipped as an ordinary seaman he had been a soldier i believe at all events he had a medal received in consequence of having been in one of the late affairs between his country and belgium it is probable this man may not have been very expert in a seamans duty and it is possible he may have been drinking though to me he appeared sober at the time the thing occurred which i am about to relate one day the captain fell foul of him and beat him with a rope severely the ladies interfered and got the poor fellow out of the scrape the captain letting him go and telling him to go forward as the man complied he fell in with the chief mate who attacked him afresh and beat him very severely the man now went below and was about to turn in as the captain had orderedwhich renders it probable he had been drinkingwhen the second mate possibly ignorant of what had occurred missing him from his duty went below and beat him up on deck again these different assaults seem to have made the poor fellow desperate he ran and jumped into the sea just forward of the starboard lowerstuddingsailboom the ship was then in the northeast trades and had eight or nine knots way on her notwithstanding she was rounded to and a boat was loweredbut the man was never found there is something appalling in seeing a fellowcreature driven to such acts of madness and the effect produced on all of us by what we witnessed was profound and sombre  i shall not pretend to say that this man did not deserve chastisement or that the two mates were not ignorant of what had happened but brutal treatment was so much in use on board this ship that the occurrence made us five nearly desperate i make no doubt a crew of americans who were thus treated would have secured the officers and brought the ship in it is true that flogging seems necessary to some natures and i will not say that such a crew as ours could very well get along without it but we might sometimes be treated as men and no harm follow  as i have said the loss of this man produced a great impression in the ship generally the passengers appeared much affected by it and i thought the captain in particular regretted it greatly he might not have been in the least to blame for the chastisement he inflicted was such as masters of ships often bestow on their men but the crew felt very indignant against the mates one of whom was particularly obnoxious to us all as for my party we now began to plot again in order to get quit of the ship after a great deal of discussion we came to the following resolution  about a dozen of us entered into the conspiracy we contemplated no piracy no act of violence that should not be rendered necessary in selfdefence nor any robbery beyond what we conceived indispensable to our object as the ship passed the straits of sunda we intended to lower as many boats as should be necessary arm ourselves place provisions and water in the boats and abandon the ship we felt confident that if most of the men did not go with us they would not oppose us i can now see that this was a desperate and unjustifiable scheme but for myself i was getting desperate on board the ship and preferred risking my life to remaining i will not deny that i was a ringleader in this affair though i know i had no other motive than escape this was a clear case of mutiny and the only one in which i was ever implicated i have a thousand times seen reason to rejoice that the attempt was never made since so deep was the hostility of the crew to the officersthe mates in particularthat i feel persuaded a horrible scene of bloodshed must have followed i did not think of this at the time making sure of getting off unresisted but if we had what would have been the fate of a parcel of seamen who came into an english port in ships boats tried for piracy probably and the execution of some if not all of us  the ship had passed the island of st pauls and we were impatiently waiting for her entrance into the straits of sunda when an accident occurred that put a stop to the contemplated mutiny and changed the whole current as i devoutly hope of all my subsequent life at the calling of the middle watch one stormy night the ship being under closereefed topsails at the time with the mainsail furled i went on deck as usual to my duty in stepping across the deck between the launch and the galley i had to cross some spars that were lashed there while on the pile of spars the ship lurched suddenly and i lost my balance falling my whole length on deck upon my left side nothing broke the fall my arms being raised to seize a hold above my head and i came down upon deck with my entire weight the hip taking the principal force of the fall the anguish i suffered was acute and it was some time before i would allow my shipmates even to touch me  after a time i was carried down into the steerage where it was found necessary to sling me on a grating instead of a hammock we had a doctor on board but he could do nothing for me my clothes could not be taken off and there i lay wet and suffering to a degree that i should find difficult to describe hours and hours  i was now really on the stool of repentance in body i was perfectly helpless though my mind seemed more active than it had ever been before i overhauled my whole life beginning with the hour when i first got drunk as a boy on board the sterling and underrunning every scrape i have mentioned in this sketch of my life with many of which i have not spoken and all with a fidelity and truth that satisfy me that man can keep no logbook that is as accurate as his own conscience i saw that i had been my own worst enemy and how many excellent opportunities of getting ahead in the world i had wantonly disregarded liquor lay at the root of all my calamities and misconduct enticing me into bad company undermining my health and strength and blasting my hopes i tried to pray but did not know how and it appeared to me as if i were lost body and soul without a hope of mercy  my shipmates visited me by stealth and i pointed out to them as clearly as in my power the folly as well as the wickedness of our contemplated mutiny i told them we had come on board the ship voluntarily and we had no right to be judges in our own case that we should have done a cruel thing in deserting a ship at sea with women and children on board that the malays would probably have cut our throats and the vessel herself would have been very apt to be wrecked of all this mischief we should have been the fathers and we had every reason to be grateful that our project was defeated the men listened attentively and promised to abandon every thought of executing the revolt they were as good as their words and i heard no more of the matter  as for my hurt it was not easy to say what it was the doctor was kind to me but he could do no more than give me food and little indulgencies as for the captain i think he was influenced by the mate who appeared to believe i was feigning an injury much greater than i had actually received on board the ship there was a boy of good parentage who had been sent out to commence his career at sea he lived aft and was a sort of genteel cabinboy he could not have been more than ten or eleven years old but he proved to be a ministering angel to me he brought me delicacies sympathised with me and many a time did we shed tears in company the ladies and the admirals children sometimes came to see me too manifesting much sorrow for my situation and then it was that my conscience pricked the deepest for the injury or risks i had contemplated exposing them to altogether the scenes i saw daily and my own situation softened my heart and i began to get views of my moral deformity that were of a healthful and safe character  i lay on that grating two months and bitter months they were to me the ship had arrived at batavia and the captain and mate came to see what was to be done with me i asked to be sent to the hospital but the mate insisted nothing was the matter with me and asked to have me kept in the ship this was done and i went round to terragall in her where we landed our passengers these last all came and took leave of me the admiral making me a present of a good jacket that he had worn himself at sea with a quantity of tobacco i have got that jacket at this moment the ladies spoke kindly to me and all this gave my heart fresh pangs  from terragall we went to sourabaya where i prevailed on the captain to send me to the hospital the mate still insisting i was merely shamming inability to work the surgeons at sourabaya one of whom was a scotchman thought with the mate and at the end of twenty days i was again taken on board the ship which sailed for samarang while at sourabaya there were five english sailors in the hospital these men were as forlorn and miserable as my self death grinning in our faces at every turn the men who were brought into the hospital one day were often dead the next and none of us knew whose turn would come next we often talked together on religious subjects after our own uninstructed manner and greatly did we long to find an english bible a thing not to be had there then it was i thought again of the sermon i had heard at the sailors retreat of the forfeited promises i had made to reform and more than once did it cross my mind should god permit me to return home that i would seek out that minister and ask his prayers and spiritual advice  on our arrival at samarang the mate got a doctor from a dutch frigate to look at me who declared nothing ailed me by these means nearly all hands in the ship were set against me but my four companions and the little boy fancying that i was a skulk and throwing labour on them i was ordered on deck and set to work graffing ringbolts for the guns walk i could not being obliged literally to crawl along the deck on my hands and knees i suffered great pain but got no credit for it the work was easy enough for me when once seated at it but it caused me infinite suffering to move i was not alone in being thought a skulk however the doctor himself was taken ill and the mate accused him too very much as he did me of shirking duty unfortunately the poor man gave him the lie by dying  i was kept at the sort of duty i have mentioned until the ship reached batavia again here a doctor came on board from another ship on a visit and my case was mentioned the mate ordered me aft and i crawled upon the quarterdeck to be examined they got me into the cabin where the strange doctor looked at me this man said i must be operated on by a burning process all of which was said to frighten me to duty after this i got down into the forecastle and positively refused to do anything more there i lay abused and neglected by all but my four friends i told the mate i suffered too much to work and that i must be put ashore suffering had made me desperate and i cared not for the consequences  fortunately for me there were two cases of fever and ague in the ship our own doctor being dead that of the admirals ship was sent for to visit the sick the mate seemed anxious to set evidence against me and he asked the admirals surgeon to come down and see me the moment this gentleman laid eyes on me he raised both arms and exclaimed that they were killing me he saw at once that i was no impostor and stated as much in pretty plain language so far as i could understand what he said the mate appeared to be struck with shame and contrition and i do believe that every one on board was sorry for the treatment i had received i took occasion to remonstrate with the mate and to tell him of the necessity of my being sent immediately to the hospital the man promised to represent my case to the captain and the next day i was landed  my two great desires were to get to the hospital and to procure a bible i did not expect to live one of my legs being shrivelled to half its former size and was apparently growing worse and could i find repose for my body and relief for my soul i felt that i could be happy i had heard my american shipmate who was a new yorker a hudson river man say he had a bible but i had never seen it it lay untouched in the bottom of his chest sailorfashion i offered this man a shirt for his bible but he declined taking any pay cheerfully giving me the book i forced the shirt on him however as a sort of memorial of me now i was provided with the book i could not read for want of spectacles i had reached a time of life when the sight begins to fail and i think my eyes were injured in florida in sourayaba hospital i had raised a few rupees by the sale of a black silk handkerchief and wanted now to procure a pair of spectacles i sold a pair of boots and adding the little sum thus raised to that which i had already i felt myself rich and happy in the prospect of being able to study the word of god on quitting the ship everybody forward and aft shook hands with me the opinion of the manofwar surgeon suddenly changing all their opinions of me and my conduct  the captain appeared to regret the course things had taken and was willing to do all he could to make me comfortable my wages were left in a merchants hands and i was to receive them could i quit this island or get out of the hospital i was to be sent to holland in the latter case and everything was to be done according to law and right the reader is not to imagine i considered myself a suffering saint all this time on the contrary while i was thought an impostor i remembered that i had shammed sickness in this very island and as i entered the hospital i could not forget the circumstances under which i had been its tenant fifteen or twenty years before then i was in the pride of my youth and strength and now as if in punishment for the deception i was berthed a miserable cripple within halfadozen beds of that on which i was berthed when feigning an illness i did not really suffer under such circumstances conscience is pretty certain to remind a sinner of his misdeeds  the physician of the hospital put me on very low diet and gave me an ointment to smear myself with as he called it and i was ordered to remain in my berth by means of one of the coolies of the hospital i got a pair of spectacles from the town and such a pair as to size and form that people in america regard what is left of them as a curiosity they served my purpose however and enabled me to read the precious book i had obtained from my northriver shipmate this book was a copy from the american bible societys printingoffice and if no other of their works did good this must be taken for an exception it has since been placed in the societys library in memory of the good it has done  my sole occupation was reading and reflecting there i lay in a distant island surrounded by disease death daily nay hourly making his appearance among men whose language was mostly unknown to me it was several weeks before i was allowed even to quit my bunk i had begun to pray before i left the ship and this practice i continued almost hourly until i was permitted to rise a converted lascar was in the hospital and seeing my occupation he came and conversed with me in his broken english this man gave me a hymnbook and one of the first hymns i read in it afforded me great consolation it was written by a man who had been a sailor like myself and one who had been almost as wicked as myself but who has since done a vast deal of good by means of precept and example this hymnbook i now read in common with my bible but i cannot express the delight i felt at a copy of pilgrims progress which this same lascar gave me that book i consider as second only to the bible it enabled me to understand and to apply a vast deal that i found in the word of god and set before my eyes so many motives for hope that i began to feel christ had died for me as well as for the rest of the species i thought if the thief on the cross could be saved even one as wicked as i had been had only to repent and believe to share in the redeemers mercy all this time i fairly pined for religious instruction and my thoughts would constantly recur to the sermon i had heard at the sailors retreat and to the clergyman who had preached it  there was an american carpenter in the fever hospital who hearing of my state gave me some tracts that he had brought from home with him this man was not pious but circumstances had made him serious and being about to quit the place he was willing to administer to my wants he told me there were several englishmen and one american in his hospital who wanted religious consolation greatly and he advised me to crawl over and see them which i did as soon as it was in my power  at first i thought myself too wicked to offer to pray and converse with these men but my conscience would not let me rest until i did so it appeared to me as if the bible had been placed in my way as much for their use as my own and i could not rest until i had offered them all the consolation it was in my power to bestow i read with these men for two or three weeks chapman the american being the man who considered his own moral condition the most hopeless when unable to go myself i would send my books and we had the bible and pilgrims progress watch and watch between us  all this time we were living as it might be on a bloody battlefield men died in scores around us and at the shortest notice batavia at that season was the most sickly and although the town was by no means as dangerous then as it had been in my former visit it was still a sort of golgotha or place of skulls more than half who entered the fever hospital left it only as corpses  among my english associates as i call them was a young scotchman of about fiveandtwenty this man had been present at most of our readings and conversations though he did not appear to me as much impressed with the importance of caring for his soul as some of the others one day he came to take leave of me he was to quit the hospital the following morning i spoke to him concerning his future life and endeavoured to awaken in him some feelings that might be permanent he listened with proper respect but his answers were painfully inconsiderate though i do believe he reasoned as nine in ten of mankind reason when they think at all on such subjects whats the use of my giving up so soon he said i am young and strong and in good health and have plenty of searoom to leeward of me and can fetch up when there is occasion for it if a fellow dont live while he can hell never live i read to him the parable of the wise and foolish virgins but he left me holding the same opinion to the last  directly in front of my ward was the deadhouse thither all the bodies of those who died in the hospital were regularly carried for dissection scarcely one escaped being subjected to the knife this deadhouse stood some eighty or a hundred yards from the hospital and between them was an area containing a few large trees i was in the habit after i got well enough to go out to hobble to one of these trees where i would sit for hours reading and meditating it was a good place to make a man reflect on the insignificance of worldly things disease and death being all around him i frequently saw six or eight bodies carried across this area while sitting in it and many were taken to the deadhouse at night hundreds if not thousands were in the hospital and a large proportion died  the morning of the day but one after i had taken leave of the young scotchman i was sitting under a tree as usual when i saw some coolies carrying a dead body across the area they passed quite near me and one of the coolies gave me to understand it was that of this very youth he had been seized with the fever a short time after he left me and here was a sudden termination to all his plans of enjoyment and his hopes of life his schemes of future repentance  such things are of frequent occurrence in that island but this event made a very deep impression on me it helped to strengthen me in my own resolutions and i used it i hope with effect with my companions whose lives were still spared  all the englishmen got well and were discharged chapman the american however remained being exceedingly feeble with the disease of the country with this poor young man i prayed as well as i knew how and read daily to his great comfort and consolation i believe the reader may imagine how one dying in a strange land surrounded by idolaters would lean on a single countryman who was disposed to aid him in this manner did chap man lean on me and all my efforts were to induce him to lean on the saviour he thought he had been too great a sinner to be entitled to any hope and my great task was to overcome in him some of those stings of conscience which it had taken the grace of god to allay in myself one day the last time i was with him i read the narrative of the thief on the cross he listened to it eagerly and when i had ended for the first time he displayed some signs of hope and joy as i left him he took leave of me saying we should never meet again he asked my prayers and i promised them i went to my own ward and while actually engaged in redeeming my promise one came to tell me he had gone he sent me a message to say he died a happy man the poor fellowhappy fellow would be a better termsent back all the books he had borrowed and it will serve to give some idea of the condition we were in in a temporal sense if i add that he also sent me a few coppers in order that they might contribute to the comfort of his countrymen    chapter xix    about three months after the death of chapman i was well enough to quit the hospital i could walk with the aid of crutches but had no hope of ever being a sound man again of course i had an anxious desire to get home for all my resolutions misanthropical feelings and resentments had vanished in the moral change i had undergone my health as a whole was now good temperance abstinence and a happy frame of mind had proved excellent doctors and although i had not and never shall altogether recover from the effects of my fall i had quite done with the horrors the last fit of them i suffered was in the deep conviction i felt concerning my sinful state i knew nothing of temperance societieshad never heard that such things existed or if i had forgot it as soon as heard and yet unknown to myself had joined the most effective and most permanent of all these bodies since my fall i have not tasted spirituous liquors except as medicine and in very small quantities nor do i now feel the least desire to drink by the grace of god the great curse of my life has been removed and i have lived a perfectly sober man for the last five years i look upon liquor as one of the great agents of the devil in destroying souls and turn from it almost as sensitively as i could wish to turn from sin  i wrote to the merchant who held my wages on the subject of quitting the hospital but got no answer i then resolved to go to batavia myself and took my discharge from the hospital accordingly i can truly say i left that place into which i had entered a miserable heartbroken cripple a happy man still i had nothing not even the means of seeking a livelihood but i was lightened of the heaviest of all my burthens and felt i could go through the world rejoicing though literally moving on crutches  the hospital is seven miles from the town and i went this distance in a canalboat dutch fashion many of these canals exist in java and they have had the effect to make the island much more healthy by draining the marshes they told me the canal i was on ran fifty miles into the interior the work was done by the natives but under the direction of their masters the dutch  on reaching the town i hobbled up to the merchant who gave me a very indifferent reception he said i had cost too much already but that i must return to the hospital until an opportunity offered for sending me to holland this i declined doing return to the hospital i would not as i knew it could do no good and my wish was to get back to america i then went to the american consul who treated me kindly i was told however he could do nothing for me as i had come out in a dutch ship unless i relinquished all claims to my wages and all claims on the dutch laws my wages were a trifle and i had no difficulty in relinquishing them and as for claims i wished to present none on the laws of holland  the consul then saw the dutch merchant and the matter was arranged between them the plato the very ship that left helvoetsluys in company with us was then at batavia taking in cargo for bremenhaven she had a new cap tain and he consented to receive me as a consuls man this matter was all settled the day i reached the town and i was to go on board the ship in the morning  i said nothing to the consul about money but left his office with the expectation of getting some from the dutch merchant i had tasted no food that day and on reaching the merchants i found him on the point of going into the country no one sleeping in the town at that season who could help it he took no notice of me and i got no assistance perhaps i was legally entitled to none i now sat down on some boxes and thought i would remain at that spot until morning sleeping in the open air on an empty stomach in that town and at that season would probably have proved my death had i been so fortunate as to escape being murdered by the malays for the clothes i had on providence took care of me one of the clerks a portuguese took pity on me and led me to a house occupied by a negro who had been converted to christianity we met with a good deal of difficulty in finding admission the black said the english and americans were so wicked he was afraid of them but finding by my discourse that i was not one of the christian heathen he altered his tone and nothing was then too good for me i was fed and he sent for my chest receiving with it a bed and three blankets as a present from the charitable clerk thus were my prospects for that night suddenly changed for the better i could only thank god in my inmost heart for all his mercies  the old black who was a man of some means was also about to quit the town but before he went he inquired if i had a bible i told him yes still he would not rest until he had pressed upon me a large bible in english which language he spoke very well this book had prayers for seamen bound up with it it was in fact a sort of english prayerbook as well as bible this i accepted and have now with me as soon as the old man went away leaving his son behind him for the moment i began to read in my pilgrims progress the young man expressed a desire to examine the book understanding english perfectly after reading in it for a short time he earnestly begged the book telling me he had two sisters who would be infinitely pleased to possess it i could not refuse him and he promised to send another book in its place which i should find equally good he thus left me taking the pilgrims progress with him half an hour later a servant brought me the promised book which proved to be doddridges rise and progress on looking through the pages i found a mexican dollar wafered between two of the leaves all this i regarded as providential and as a proof that the lord would not desert me my gratitude i hope was in proportion this whole household appeared to be religious for i passed half the night in conversing with the malay servants on the subject of christianity concerning which they had already received many just ideas i knew that my teaching was like the blind instructing the blind but it had the merit of coming from god though in a degree suited to my humble claims on his grace  in the morning these malays gave me breakfast and then carried my chest and other articles to the platos boat i was happy enough to find myself once more under the stars and stripes where i was well received and humanely treated the ship sailed for bremen about twenty days after i got on board her  of course i could do but little on the passage whenever i moved along the deck it was by crawling though i could work with the needle and palm a fortnight out the carpenter a new york man died i tried to read and pray with him but cannot say that he showed any consciousness of his true situation we touched at st helena for water and napoleon being then dead had no difficulty in getting ashore after watering we sailed again and reached our port in due time  i was now in europe a part of the world that i had little hopes of seeing ten months before still it was my desire to get to america and i was permitted to remain in the ship i was treated in the kindest manner by captain bunting and mr bowden the mate who gave me everything i needed at the end of a few weeks we sailed again for new york where we arrived in the month of august 1840  i left the plato at the quarantine ground going to the sailors retreat here the physician told me i never could recover the use of my limb as i had possessed it before but that the leg would gradually grow stronger and that i might get along without crutches in the end all this has turned out to be true the pain had long before left me weakness being now the great difficulty the hipjoint is injured and this in a way that still compels me to rely greatly on a stick in walking  at the sailors retreat i again met mr miller i now for the first time received regular spiritual advice and it proved to be of great benefit to me after remaining a month at the retreat i determined to make an application for admission to the sailors snug harbour a richly endowed asylum for seamen on the same island in order to be admitted it was necessary to have sailed under the flag five years and to get a character i had sailed with two short exceptions thirtyfour years under the flag and i do believe in all that time the nineteen months of imprisonment excluded i had not been two years unattached to a ship i think i must have passed at least a quarter of a century out of sight of land17  i now went up to new york and hunted up captain pell with whom i had sailed in the sully and in the normandy this gentleman gave me a certificate and as i left him handed me a dollar this was every cent i had on earth next i found captain witheroudt of the silvie de grasse who treated me in precisely the same way i told him i had one dollar already but he insisted it should be two with these two dollars in my pocket i was passing up wall street when in looking about me i saw the pension office the reader will remember that i left washington with the intention of finding lemuel bryant in order to obtain his certificate that i might get a pension for the injury received on board the scourge with this project i had connected a plan of returning to boston and of getting some employment in the navy yard my pensionticket had in consequence been made payable at boston my arrival at new york and the shadding expedition had upset all this plan and before i went to savannah i had carried my pensionticket to the agent in this wall street office and requested him to get another made payable in new york this was the last i had seen of my ticket and almost the last i had thought of my pension but i now crossed the street went into the office and was recognised immediately everything was in rule and i came out of the office with fiftysix dollars in my pockets i had no thought of this pension at all in coming up to town it was so much money showered down upon me unexpectedly  for a man of my habits who kept clear of drink i was now rich instead of remaining in town however i went immediately down to the harbour and presented myself to its respectable superintendant the venerable captain whetten18 i was received into the institution without any difficulty and have belonged to it ever since my entrance at sailors snug harbour took place sept 17 1840 just one month after i landed at sailors retreat the last of these places is a seamens hospital where men are taken in only to be cured while the first is an asylum for wornout mariners for life the last is supported by a bequest made many years ago by an old shipmaster whose remains lie in front of the building  knowing myself now to be berthed for the rest of my days should i be so inclined and should i remain worthy to receive the benefits of so excellent an institution i began to look about me like a man who had settled down in the world one of my first cares was to acquit myself of the duty of publicly joining some church of christ and thus acknowledge my dependence on his redemption and mercy mr miller he whose sermons had made so deep an impression on my mind was living within a mile and a half of the harbour and to him i turned in my need i was an episcopalian by infant baptism and i am still as much attached to that form of worship as to any other but sects have little weight with me the heart being the mainstay under gods grace two of us then joined mr millers church and i have ever since continued one of his communicants i have not altogether deserted the communion in which i was baptized occasionally communing in the church of mr moore to me there is no difference though i suppose more learned christians may find materials for a quarrel in the distinctions which exist between these two churches i hope never to quarrel with either  to my surprise sometime after i was received into the harbour i ascertained that my sister had removed to new york and was then living in the place i felt it now to be a duty to hunt her up and see her this i did and we met again after a separation of fiveandtwenty years she could tell me very little of my family but i now learned for the first time that my father had been killed in battle who or what he was i have not been able to ascertain beyond the facts already stated in the opening of the memoir  i had ever retained a kind recollection of the treatment of captain johnston and accident threw into my way some information concerning him the superintendant had put me in charge of the library of the institution and one day i overheard some visiters talking of wiscasset upon this i ventured to inquire after my old master and was glad to learn that he was not only living but in good health and circumstances to my surprise i was told that a nephew of his was actually living within a mile of me in september 1842 i went to wiscasset to visit captain johnston and found myself received like the repentant prodigal the old gentleman and his sisters seemed glad to see me and i found that the former had left the seas though he still remained a shipowner having a stout vessel of five hundred tons which is at this moment named after our old craft the sterling  i remained at wiscasset several weeks during this time captain johnston and myself talked over old times as a matter of course and i told him i thought one of our old shipmates was still living on his asking whom i inquired if he remembered the youngster of the name of cooper who had been in the sterling he answered perfectly well and that he supposed him to be the captain cooper who was then in the navy i had thought so too for a long time but happened to be on board the hudson at new york when a captain cooper visited her hearing his name i went on deck expressly to see him and was soon satisfied it was not my old shipmate there are two captains cooper in the navyfather and sonbut neither had been in the sterling now the author of many naval tales and of the naval history was from cooperstown new york and i had taken it into my head this was the very person who had been with us in the sterling captain johnston thought not but i determined to ascertain the fact immediately on my return to new york  quitting wiscasset i came back to the harbour in the month of november 1842 i ought to say that the men at this institution who maintain good characters can always get leave to go where they please returning whenever they please there is no more restraint than is necessary to comfort and good order the object being to make old tars comfortable soon after my return to the harbour i wrote a letter to mr fenimore cooper and sent it to his residence at cooperstown making the inquiries necessary to know if he were the person of the same family who had been in the sterling i got an answer beginning in these wordsi am your old shipmate ned mr cooper informed me when he would be in town and where he lodged  in the spring i got a message from mr blancard the keeper of the globe hotel and the keeper also of brighton near the harbour to say that mr cooper was in town and wished to see me next day i went up accordingly but did not find him in after paying one or two visits i was hobbling up broadway to go to the globe again when my old commander at pensacola commodore bolton passed down street arminarm with a stranger i saluted the commodore who nodded his head to me and this induced the stranger to look round presently i heard ned in a voice that i knew immediately though i had not heard it in thirtyseven years it was my old shipmatethe gentleman who has written out this account of my career from my verbal narrative of the facts  mr cooper asked me to go up to his place in the country and pass a few weeks there i cheerfully consented and we reached cooperstown early in june here i found a neat village a beautiful lake nine miles long and altogether a beautiful country i had never been as far from the sea before the time when i served on lake ontario excepted cooperstown lies in a valley but mr cooper tells me it is at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above tidewater to me the clouds appeared so low i thought i could almost shake hands with them and altogether the air and country were different from any i had ever seen or breathed before  my old shipmate took me often on the lake which i will say is a slippery place to navigate i thought i had seen all sorts of winds before i saw the otsego but on this lake it sometimes blew two or three different ways at the same time while knocking about this piece of water in a good stout boat i related to my old shipmate many of the incidents of my wandering life until one day he suggested it might prove interesting to publish them i was willing could the work be made useful to my brother sailors and those who might be thrown into the way of temptations like those which came so near wrecking all my hopes both for this world and that which is to come we accordingly went to work between us and the result is now laid before the world i wish it understood that this is literally my own story logged by my old shipmate  it is now time to clew up when a man has told all he has to say the sooner he is silent the better every word that has been related i believe to be true when i am wrong it proceeds from ignorance or want of memory i may possibly have made some trifling mistakes about dates and periods but i think they would turn out to be few on inquiry in many instances i have given my impressions which like those of other men may be right or may be wrong as for the main facts however i know them to be true nor do i think myself much out of the way in any of the details  this is the happiest period of my life and has been so since i left the hospital at batavia i do not know that i have ever passed a happier summer than the present has been i should be perfectly satisfied with everything did not my time hang so idle on my hands at the harbour i want something to occupy my leisure moments and do not despair of yet being able to find a mode of life more suitable to the activity of my early days i have friends enoughmore than i deserveand yet a man needs occupation who has the strength and disposition to be employed that which is to happen is in the hands of providence and i humbly trust i shall be cared for to the end as i have been cared for through so many scenes of danger and trial  my great wish is that this picture of a sailors risks and hardships may have some effect in causing this large and useful class of men to think on the subject of their habits i entertain no doubt that the money i have disposed of far worse than if i had thrown it into the sea which went to reduce me to that mental hell the horrors and which on one occasion at least drove me to the verge of suicide would have formed a sum had it been properly laid by on which i might now have been enjoying an old age of comfort and respectability it is seldom that a seaman cannot lay by a hundred dollars in a twelvemonthoftentimes i have earned double that amount beyond my useful outlaysand a hundred dollars a year at the end of thirty years would give such a man an independence for the rest of his days this is far from all however the possession of means would awaken the desire of advancement in the calling and thousands who now remain before the mast would long since have been officers could they have commanded the selfrespect that property is apt to create  on the subject of liquor i can say nothing that has not often been said by others in language far better than i can use i do not think i was as bad in this respect as perhaps a majority of my associates yet this narrative will show how often the habit of drinking to excess impeded my advance it was fast converting me into a being inferior to a man and but for gods mercy might have rendered me the perpetrator of crimes that it would shock me to think of in my sober and sane moments  the past i have related as faithfully as i have been able so to do the future is with god to whom belongeth power and glory for ever and ever    the end      footnotes    1 the writer left a blank for this regiment and now inserts it from memory it is probable he is wrong  2 edward duke of kent was born november 2 1767 and made a peer april 23 1799 when he was a little turned of oneandthirty it is probable that this creation took place on his return to england after passing some six or eight years in america and the west indies he served in the west indies with great personal distinction during his stay in this hemisphereeditor  3 this is neds pronunciation though it is probable the name is not spelt correctly the names of ned are taken a good deal at random and doubtless are often misspellededitor  4 i well remember using these arguments to ned though less with any expectations of being admitted than the boy seemed to believe there was more roguery than anything else in my persuasion though it was mixed with a latent wish to see the interior of the palaceeditor  5 secondmate  6 22deditor  7 when myers related this circumstance i remembered that a lieutenantcolonel meyers had been killed in the affair at fort george something in the way here mentioned on consulting the american official account i found that my recollection was just so far as thisa lieutenantcolonel meyers was reported as wounded and taken prisoner i then recollected to have been present at a conversation between majorgeneral lewis and major baker his adjutantgeneral shortly after the battle in which the question arose whether the same shot had killed colonel meyers that killed his horse general lewis thought not major baker thought it had on my referring to the official account as reporting this gentleman to have been only wounded i was told it was a mistake he having been killed now for the probabilities both ned and his sister understand that their father was slain in battle about this time ned thought this occurred at waterloo but the sister thinks not neither knew anything of the object of my inquiry the sister says letters were received from quebec in relation to the fathers personal effects it would be a strange thing if ned had actually found his own fathers body on the field in this extraordinary manner i pretend not to say it is so but it must be allowed it looks very much like it the lady may have been a wife married between the years 1796 and 1813 when mr meyers had got higher rank this occurrence was related by ned without the slightest notion of the inference that i have here drawneditor  8 it is supposed that capt deacon died a few years since in consequence of an injury he received on board the growler this night a shot struck her mainboom within a short distance of one of his ears and he ever after complained of its effects at his death this side of his head was much swollen and affectededitor  9 by this ned means six men had to subsist on the usual allowance of four men a distinction that was made between men on duty and men off prisoners too are commonly allowed to help themselves in a variety of wayseditor  10 the name of this young officer was king he is now dead having been lost in the lynx lt madisoneditor  11 if this be true this could hardly have been a court but must have been a mere investigation as sir john borlase warren was commanderinchief and would scarcely sit in a court of his own orderingeditor  12 ned means loto probablyeditor  13 ned might have added few duchesses the ambassadors bags in europe might ten many a tale of foulards c sent from one court to another the writer believes that the higher class of american gentlemen and ladies smuggle less than those of any other country it should be remembered too that no seaman goes in a smuggler thut is not sent by traders ashoreeditor  14 a friend who was then american consul at gibraltar and an old navy officer tells me ned is mistaken as to the nature of the anchorage the ship was a little too far out for the best holding ground the same friend adds that the character of this gale is not at all overcharged the vessels actually lost including small craft of every description amounting to the every way extraordinary number of just three hundred and sixtyfiveeditor  15 this is the reasoning of ned i have always looked upon the american law as erroneous in principle and too severe in its penalties erroneous in principle as piracy is a crime against the law of nations and it is not legal for any one community to widen or narrow the action of international law it is peculiarly the policy of this country rigidly to observe this principle since she has so many interests dependent on its existence the punishment of death is too severe when we consider that nabobs are among us who laid the foundations of their wealth as slaving merchants when slaving was legal sudden mutations in morals are not to be made by a dash of the pen and even public sentiment can hardly be made to consider slaving much of a crime in a slaveholding community but even the punishment of death might be inflicted without arrogating to congress a power to say what is and what is not piracy  it will probably be said the error is merely one of language the jurisdiction being clearly legal is this true can congress legally or constitutionally legislate for american citizens when undeniably within the jurisdiction of foreign states admit this as a principle and what is to prevent congress from punishing acts that it may be the policy of foreign countries to exact from even casual residents if congress can punish me as a pirate for slaving under a foreign flag and in foreign countries it can punish me for carrying arms against all american allies and yet military service may be exacted of even an american citizen resident in a foreign state under particular circumstances the same difficulty in principle may be extended to the whole catalogue of legal crime  congress exists only for specified purposes it can punish piracy but it cannot declare what shall or shall not be piracy as this would be invading the authority of international law under the general power to pass laws that are necessary to carry out the system it can derive no authority since there can be no legal necessity for any such double legislation under the comity of nations suppose for instance england should legalize slaving again could the united states claim the american citizen who had engaged in slaving under the english flag and from a british port under the renowned ashburton treaty would england give such a man up no more than she will now give up the slaves that run from the american vessel which is driven in by stress of weather one of the vices of philanthropy is to overreach its own policy by losing sight of all collateral principles and interestseditor  16 neds pronunciation  17 i find in looking over his papers and accounts that ned exclusively of all the prisonships transports and vessels in which he made passages has belonged regularly to seventytwo different crafts in some of these vessels he made many voyages in the sterling he made several passages with the writer besides four european voyages at a later day he made four voyages to havre in the erie which counts as only one vessel in the above list he was three voyages to london in the washington c c c and often made two voyages in the same ship i am of opinion that neds calculation of his having been twentyfive years out of sight of land is very probably true he must have sailed in all ways in near a hundred different crafteditor  18 pronounced wheatoneditor
