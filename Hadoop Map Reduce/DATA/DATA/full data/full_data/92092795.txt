seven years ago a short while before his death in 1844 john sterling committed the care of his literary character and printed writings to two friends archdeacon hare and myself his estimate of the bequest was far from overweening to few men could the small sumtotal of his activities in this world seem more inconsiderable than in those last solemn days it did to him he had burnt much found much unworthy looking steadfastly into the silent continents of death and eternity a brave mans judgments about his own sorry work in the field of time are not apt to be too lenient but in fine here was some portion of his work which the world had already got hold of and which he could not burn this too since it was not to be abolished and annihilated but must still for some time live and act he wished to be wisely settled as the rest had been and so it was left in charge to us the survivors to do for it what we judged fittest if indeed doing nothing did not seem the fittest to us this message communicated after his decease was naturally a sacred one to mr hare and me  after some consultation on it and survey of the difficulties and delicate considerations involved in it archdeacon hare and i agreed that the whole task of selecting what writings were to be reprinted and of drawing up a biography to introduce them should be left to him alone and done without interference of mineas accordingly it was 1 in a manner surely far superior to the common in every good quality of editing and visibly everywhere bearing testimony to the friendliness the piety perspicacity and other gifts and virtues of that eminent and amiable man  in one respect however if in one only the arrangement had been unfortunate archdeacon hare both by natural tendency and by his position as a churchman had been led in editing a work not free from ecclesiastical heresies and especially in writing a life very full of such to dwell with preponderating emphasis on that part of his subject by no means extenuating the fact nor yet passing lightly over it which a layman could have done as needing no extenuation but carefully searching into it with the view of excusing and explaining it dwelling on it presenting all the documents of it and as it were spreading it over the whole field of his delineation as if religious heterodoxy had been the grand fact of sterlings life which even to the archdeacons mind it could by no means seem to be hinc illae lachrymae for the religious newspapers and periodical heresyhunters getting very lively in those years were prompt to seize the cue and have prosecuted and perhaps still prosecute it in their sad way to all lengths and breadths john sterlings character and writings which had little business to be spoken of in any churchcourt have hereby been carried thither as if for an exclusive trial and the mournfulest set of pleadings out of which nothing but a misjudgment can be formed prevail there ever since the noble sterling a radiant child of the empyrean clad in bright auroral hues in the memory of all that knew himwhat is he doing here in inquisitorial sanbenito with nothing but ghastly spectralities prowling round him and inarticulately screeching and gibbering what they call their judgment on him  the sin of hares book says one of my correspondents in those years is easily defined and not very condemnable but it is nevertheless ruinous to his task as biographer he takes up sterling as a clergyman merely sterling i find was a curate for exactly eight months during eight months and no more had he any special relation to the church but he was a man and had relation to the universe for eightandthirty years and it is in this latter character to which all the others were but features and transitory hues that we wish to know him his battle with hereditary church formulas was severe but it was by no means his one battle with things inherited nor indeed his chief battle neither according to my observation of what it was is it successfully delineated or summed up in this book the truth is nobody that had known sterling would recognize a feature of him here you would never dream that this book treated of him at all a pale sickly shadow in torn surplice is presented to us here weltering bewildered amid heaps of what you call hebrew oldclothes wrestling with impotent impetuosity to free itself from the baleful imbroglio as if that had been its one function in life who in this miserable figure would recognize the brilliant beautiful and cheerful john sterling with his everflowing wealth of ideas fancies imaginations with his frank affections inexhaustible hopes audacities activities and general radiant vivacity of heart and intelligence which made the presence of him an illumination and inspiration wherever he went it is too bad let a man be honestly forgotten when his life ends but let him not be misremembered in this way to be hung up as an ecclesiastical scarecrow as a target for heterodox and orthodox to practice archery upon is no fate that can be due to the memory of sterling it was not as a ghastly phantasm choked in thirtyninearticle controversies or miserable semitic antisemitic streetriotsin scepticisms agonized selfseekings that this man appeared in life nor as such if the world still wishes to look at him should you suffer the worlds memory of him now to be once for all it is unjust emphatically untrue as an image of john sterling perhaps to few men that lived along with him could such an interpretation of their existence be more inapplicable   whatever truth there might be in these rather passionate representations and to myself there wanted not a painful feeling of their truth it by no means appeared what help or remedy any friend of sterlings and especially one so related to the matter as myself could attempt in the interim perhaps endure in patience till the dust laid itself again as all dust does if you leave it well alone much obscuration would thus of its own accord fall away and in mr hares narrative itself apart from his commentary many features of sterlings true character would become decipherable to such as sought them censure blame of this work of mr hares was naturally far from my thoughts a work which distinguishes itself by human piety and candid intelligence which in all details is careful lucid exact and which offers as we say to the observant reader that will interpret facts many traits of sterling besides his heterodoxy censure of it from me especially is not the thing due from me a far other thing is due  on the whole my private thought was first how happy it comparatively is for a man of any earnestness of life to have no biography written of him but to return silently with his small sorely foiled bit of work to the supreme silences who alone can judge of it or him and not to trouble the reviewers and greater or lesser public with attempting to judge it the idea of fame as they call it posthumous or other does not inspire one with much ecstasy in these points of viewsecondly that sterlings performance and real or seeming importance in this world was actually not of a kind to demand an express biography even according to the worlds usages his character was not supremely original neither was his fate in the world wonderful what he did was inconsiderable enough and as to what it lay in him to have done this was but a problem now beyond possibility of settlement why had a biography been inflicted on this man why had not nobiography and the privilege of all the weary been his lotthirdly that such lot however could now no longer be my good sterlings a tumult having risen around his name enough to impress some pretended likeness of him about as like as the guyfauxes are on gunpowderday upon the minds of many men so that he could not be forgotten and could only be misremembered as matters now stood  whereupon as practical conclusion to the whole arose by degrees this final thought that at some calmer season when the theological dust had well fallen and both the matter itself and my feelings on it were in a suitabler condition i ought to give my testimony about this friend whom i had known so well and record clearly what my knowledge of him was this has ever since seemed a kind of duty i had to do in the world before leaving it   and so having on my hands some leisure at this time and being bound to it by evident considerations one of which ought to be especially sacred to me i decide to fling down on paper some outline of what my recollections and reflections contain in reference to this most friendly bright and beautiful human soul who walked with me for a season in this world and remains to me very memorable while i continue in it gradually if facts simple enough in themselves can be narrated as they came to pass it will be seen what kind of man this was to what extent condemnable for imaginary heresy and other crimes to what extent laudable and lovable for noble manful orthodoxy and other virtuesand whether the lesson his life had to teach us is not much the reverse of what the religious newspapers hitherto educe from it  certainly it was not as a sceptic that you could define him whatever his definition might be belief not doubt attended him at all points of his progress rather a tendency to too hasty and headlong belief of all men he was the least prone to what you could call scepticism diseased selflistenings selfquestionings impotently painful dubitations all this fatal nosology of spiritual maladies so rife in our day was eminently foreign to him quite on the other side lay sterlings faults such as they were in fact you could observe in spite of his sleepless intellectual vivacity he was not properly a thinker at all his faculties were of the active not of the passive or contemplative sort a brilliant improvisatore rapid in thought in word and in act everywhere the promptest and least hesitating of men i likened him often in my banterings to sheetlightning and reproachfully prayed that he would concentrate himself into a bolt and rive the mountainbarriers for us instead of merely playing on them and irradiating them  true he had his religion to seek and painfully shape together for himself out of the abysses of conflicting disbelief and shambelief and bedlam delusion now filling the world as all men of reflection have and in this respect toomore especially as his lot in the battle appointed for us all was if you can understand it victory and not defeathe is an expressive emblem of his time and an instruction and possession to his contemporaries for i say it is by no means as a vanquished doubter that he figures in the memory of those who knew him but rather as a victorious believer and under great difficulties a victorious doer an example to us all not of lamed misery helpless spiritual bewilderment and sprawling despair or any kind of drownage in the foul welter of our socalled religious or other controversies and confusions but of a swift and valiant vanquisher of all these a noble asserter of himself as worker and speaker in spite of all these continually so far as he went he was a teacher by act and word of hope clearness activity veracity and human courage and nobleness the preacher of a good gospel to all men not of a bad to any man the man whether in priests cassock or other costume of men who is the enemy or hater of john sterling may assure himself that he does not yet know himthat miserable differences of mere costume and dialect still divide him whatsoever is worthy catholic and perennial in him from a brother soul who more than most in his day was his brother and not his adversary in regard to all that  nor shall the irremediable drawback that sterling was not current in the newspapers that he achieved neither what the world calls greatness nor what intrinsically is such altogether discourage me what his natural size and natural and accidental limits were will gradually appear if my sketching be successful and i have remarked that a true delineation of the smallest man and his scene of pilgrimage through life is capable of interesting the greatest man that all men are to an unspeakable degree brothers each mans life a strange emblem of every mans and that human portraits faithfully drawn are of all pictures the welcomest on human walls monitions and moralities enough may lie in this small work if honestly written and honestly readand in particular if any image of john sterling and his pilgrimage through our poor nineteenth century be one day wanted by the world and they can find some shadow of a true image here my swift scribbling which shall be very swift and immediate may prove useful by and by    chapter ii birth and parentage  john sterling was born at kaimes castle a kind of dilapidated baronial residence to which a small farm was then attached rented by his father in the isle of buteon the 20th july 1806 both his parents were irish by birth scotch by extraction and became as he himself did essentially english by long residence and habit of john himself scotland has little or nothing to claim except the birth and genealogy for he left it almost before the years of memory and in his mature days regarded it if with a little more recognition and intelligence yet without more participation in any of its accents outward or inward than others natives of middlesex or surrey where the scene of his chief education lay  the climate of bute is rainy soft of temperature with skies of unusual depth and brilliancy while the weather is fair in that soft rainy climate on that wildwooded rocky coast with its gnarled mountains and green silent valleys with its seething rainstorms and manysounding seas was young sterling ushered into his first schooling in this world i remember one little anecdote his father told me of those first years one of the cows had calved young john still in petticoats was permitted to go holding by his fathers hand and look at the newly arrived calf a mystery which he surveyed with open intent eyes and the silent exercise of all the scientific faculties he hadvery strange mystery indeed this new arrival and fresh denizen of our universe wullt eat abody said john in his first practical scotch inquiring into the tendencies this mystery might have to fall upon a little fellow and consume him as provision will it eat one fatherpoor little openeyed john the family long bantered him with this anecdote and we in far other years laughed heartily on hearing itsimple peasant laborers ploughers houseservants occasional fisherpeople too and the sight of ships and crops and natures doings where art has little meddled with her this was the kind of schooling our young friend had first of all on this bench of the grand worldschool did he sit for the first four years of his life  edward sterling his father a man who subsequently came to considerable notice in the world was originally of waterford in munster son of the episcopalian clergyman there and chief representative of a family of some standing in those parts family founded it appears by a colonel robert sterling called also sir robert sterling a scottish gustavusadolphus soldier whom the breaking out of the civil war had recalled from his german campaignings and had before long though not till after some waverings on his part attached firmly to the duke of ormond and to the kings party in that quarrel a little bit of genealogy since it lies ready to my hand gathered long ago out of wider studies and pleasantly connects things individual and present with the dim universal crowd of things pastmay as well be inserted here as thrown away  this colonel robert designates himself sterling of glorat i believe a younger branch of the wellknown stirlings of keir in stirlingshire it appears he prospered in his soldiering and other business in those bad ormond times being a man of energy ardor and intelligenceprobably prompt enough both with his word and with his stroke there survives yet in the commons journals 2 dim notice of his controversies and adventures especially of one controversy he had got into with certain victorious parliamentary official parties while his own party lay vanquished during what was called the ormond cessation or temporary peace made by ormond with the parliament in 1646in which controversy colonel robert after repeated applications journeyings to london attendances upon committees and such like finds himself worsted declared to be in the wrong and so vanishes from the commons journals  what became of him when cromwell got to ireland and to munster i have not heard his knighthood dating from the very year of cromwells invasion 1649 indicates a man expected to do his best on the occasionas in all probability he did had not tredah storm proved ruinous and the neck of this irish war been broken at once doubtless the colonel sir robert followed or attended his duke of ormond into foreign parts and gave up his management of munster while it was yet time for after the restoration we find him again safe and as was natural flourishing with new splendor gifted recompensed with landssettled in short on fair revenues in those munster regions he appears to have had no children but to have left his property to william a younger brother who had followed him into ireland from this william descends the family which in the years we treat of had edward sterling father of our john for its representative and now enough of genealogy   of edward sterling captain edward sterling as his title was who in the latter period of his life became well known in london political society whom indeed all england with a curious mixture of mockery and respect and even fear knew well as the thunderer of the times newspaper there were much to be said did the present task and its limits permit as perhaps it might on certain terms what is indispensable let us not omit to say the history of a mans childhood is the description of his parents and environment this is his inarticulate but highly important history in those first times while of articulate he has yet none  edward sterling had now just entered on his thirtyfourth year and was already a man experienced in fortunes and changes a native of waterford in munster as already mentioned born in the deanery house of waterford 27th february 1773 say the registers for his father as we learn resided in the deanery house though he was not himself dean but only curate of the cathedral whatever that may mean he was withal rector of two other livings and the deans friendfriend indeed of the deans kinsmen the beresfords generally whose grand house of curraghmore near by waterford was a familiar haunt of his and his childrens this reverend gentleman along with his three livings and high acquaintanceships had inherited political connectionsinherited especially a government pension with survivorship for still one life beyond his own his father having been clerk of the irish house of commons at the time of the union of which office the lost salary was compensated in this way the pension was of two hundred pounds and only expired with the life of edward johns father in 1847 there were and still are daughters of the family but edward was the only sondescended too from the scottish hero wallace as the old gentleman would sometimes admonish him his own wife edwards mother being of that name and boasting herself as most scotch wallaces do to have that blood in her veins  this edward had picked up at waterford and among the young beresfords of curraghmore and elsewhere a thoroughly irish form of character fire and fervor vitality of all kinds in genial abundance but in a much more loquacious ostentatious much louder style than is freely patronized on this side of the channel of irish accent in speech he had entirely divested himself so as not to be traced by any vestige in that respect but his irish accent of character in all manner of other more important respects was very recognizable an impetuous man full of real energy and immensely conscious of the same who transacted everything not with the minimum of fuss and noise but with the maximum a very captain whirlwind as one was tempted to call him  in youth he had studied at trinity college dublin visited the inns of court here and trained himself for the irish bar to the bar he had been duly called and was waiting for the resultswhen in his twentyfifth year the irish rebellion broke out whereupon the irish barristers decided to raise a corps of loyal volunteers and a complete change introduced itself into edward sterlings way of life for naturally he had joined the array of volunteersfought i have heard in three actions with the rebels vinegar hill for one and doubtless fought well but in the messrooms among the young military and civil officials with all of whom he was a favorite he had acquired a taste for soldier life and perhaps high hopes of succeeding in it at all events having a commission in the lancashire militia offered him he accepted that altogether quitted the bar and became captain sterling thenceforth from the militia it appears he had volunteered with his company into the line and under some disappointments and official delays of expected promotion was continuing to serve as captain there captain of the eighth battalion of reserve say the military almanacs of 1803in which year the quarters happened to be derry where new events awaited him at a ball in derry he met with miss hester coningham the queen of the scene and of the fair world in derry at that time the acquaintance in spite of some opposition grew with vigor and rapidly ripened and at fehan church diocese of derry where the brides father had a countryhouse on thursday 5th april 1804 hester coningham only daughter of john coningham esquire merchant in derry and of elizabeth campbell his wife was wedded to captain sterling she happiest to him happiestas by natures kind law it is arranged  mrs sterling even in her later days had still traces of the old beauty then and always she was a woman of delicate pious affectionate character exemplary as a wife a mother and a friend a refined female nature something tremulous in it timid and with a certain rural freshness still unweakened by long converse with the world the tall slim figure always of a kind of quaker neatness the innocent anxious face anxious bright hazel eyes the timid yet gracefully cordial ways the natural intelligence instinctive sense and worth were very characteristic her voice too with its something of soft querulousness easily adapting itself to a light thinflowing style of mirth on occasion was characteristic she had retained her ulster intonations and was withal somewhat copious in speech a fine tremulously sensitive nature strong chiefly on the side of the affections and the graceful insights and activities that depend on thesetruly a beautiful muchsuffering muchloving housemother from her chiefly as one could discern john sterling had derived the delicate aroma of his nature its piety clearness sincerity as from his father the ready practical gifts the impetuosities and the audacities were also though in strange new form visibly inherited a man was lucky to have such a mother to have such parents as both his were  meanwhile the new wife appears to have had for the present no marriageportion neither was edward sterling richaccording to his own ideas and aims far from it of course he soon found that the fluctuating barracklife especially with no outlooks of speedy promotion was little suited to his new circumstances but how change it his father was now dead from whom he had inherited the speaker pension of two hundred pounds but of available probably little or nothing more the rents of the small family estate i suppose and other property had gone to portion sisters two hundred pounds and the pay of a marching captain within the limits of that revenue all plans of his had to restrict themselves at present  he continued for some time longer in the army his wife undivided from him by the hardships of that way of life their first son anthony captain anthony sterling the only child who now survives was born to them in this position while lying at dundalk in january 1805 two months later some eleven months after their marriage the regiment was broken and captain sterling declining to serve elsewhere on the terms offered and willingly accepting such decision of his doubts was reduced to halfpay this was the end of his soldiering some five or six years in all from which he had derived for life among other things a decided military bearing whereof he was rather proud an incapacity for practicing lawand considerable uncertainty as to what his next course of life was now to be  for the present his views lay towards farming to establish himself if not as country gentleman which was an unattainable ambition then at least as some kind of gentlemanfarmer which had a flattering resemblance to that kaimes castle with a reasonable extent of land which in his inquiries after farms had turned up was his first place of settlement in this new capacity and here for some few months he had established himself when john his second child was born this was captain sterlings first attempt towards a fixed course of life not a very wise one i have understoodyet on the whole who then and there could have pointed out to him a wiser  a fixed course of life and activity he could never attain or not till very late and this doubtless was among the important points of his destiny and acted both on his own character and that of those who had to attend him on his wayfarings    chapter iii schools llanblethian paris london  edward sterling never shone in farming indeed i believe he never took heartily to it or tried it except in fits his bute farm was at best a kind of apology for some far different ideal of a country establishment which could not be realized practically a temporary landingplace from which he could make sallies and excursions in search of some more generous field of enterprise stormy brief efforts at energetic husbandry at agricultural improvement and rapid fieldlabor alternated with sudden flights to dublin to london whithersoever any flush of bright outlook which he could denominate practical or any gleam of hope which his impatient ennui could represent as such allured him this latter was often enough the case in wet haytimes and harvesttimes the dripping outdoor world and lounging indoor one in the absence of the master offered far from a satisfactory appearance here was in fact a man much imprisoned haunted i doubt not by demons enough though ever brisk and brave withaliracund but cheerfully vigorous opulent in wise or unwise hope a fiery energetic soul consciously and unconsciously storming for deliverance into better arenas and this in a restless rapid impetuous rather than in a strong silent and deliberate way  in rainy bute and the dilapidated kaimes castle it was evident there lay no goshen for such a man the lease originally but for some three years and a half drawing now to a close he resolved to quit bute had heard i know not where of an eligible cottage without farm attached in the pleasant little village of llanblethian close by cowbridge in glamorganshire of this he took a lease and thither with his family he moved in search of new fortunes glamorganshire was at least a better climate than bute no groups of idle or of busy reapers could here stand waiting on the guidance of a master for there was no farm hereand among its other and probably its chief though secret advantages llanblethian was much more convenient both for dublin and london than kaimes castle had been  the removal thither took place in the autumn of 1809 chief part of the journey perhaps from greenock to swansea or bristol was by sea john just turned of three years could in aftertimes remember nothing of this voyage anthony some eighteen months older has still a vivid recollection of the gray splashing tumult and dim sorrow uncertainty regret and distress he underwent to him a dissolvingview which not only left its effect on the plate as all views and dissolvingviews doubtless do on that kind of plate but remained consciously present there john in the close of his twentyfirst year professes not to remember anything whatever of bute his whole existence in that earliest scene of it had faded away from him bute also with its shaggy mountains moaning woods and summer and winter seas had been wholly a dissolvingview for him and had left no conscious impression but only like this voyage an effect  llanblethian hangs pleasantly with its white cottages and orchard and other trees on the western slope of a green hill looking far and wide over green meadows and little or bigger hills in the pleasant plain of glamorgan a short mile to the south of cowbridge to which smart little town it is properly a kind of suburb plain of glamorgan some ten miles wide and thirty or forty long which they call the vale of glamorganthough properly it is not quite a vale there being only one range of mountains to it if even one certainly the central mountains of wales do gradually rise in a miscellaneous manner on the north side of it but on the south are no mountains not even land only the bristol channel and far off the hills of devonshire for boundarythe english hills as the natives call them visible from every eminence in those parts on such wide terms is it called vale of glamorgan but called by whatever name it is a most pleasant fruitful region kind to the native interesting to the visitor a waving grassy region cut with innumerable ragged lanes dotted with sleepy unswept human hamlets old ruinous castles with their ivy and their daws gray sleepy churches with their ditto ditto for ivy everywhere abounds and generally a rank fragrant vegetation clothes all things hanging in rude manycolored festoons and fringed odoriferous tapestries on your right and on your left in every lane a country kinder to the sluggard husbandman than any i have ever seen for it lies all on limestone needs no draining the soil everywhere of handsome depth and finest quality will grow good crops for you with the most imperfect tilling at a safe distance of a days riding lie the tartarean copperforges of swansea the tartarean ironforges of merthyr their sooty battle far away and not at such safe distance a defilement to the face of the earth and sky but rather an encouragement to the earth at least encouraging the husbandman to plough better if he only would  the peasantry seem indolent and stagnant but peaceable and wellprovided much given to methodism when they have any characterfor the rest an innocent goodhumored people who all drink homebrewed beer and have brown loaves of the most excellent homebaked bread the native peasant village is not generally beautiful though it might be were it swept and trimmed it gives one rather the idea of sluttish stagnancyan interesting peep into the welsh paradise of sleepy hollow stones old kettles naves of wheels all kinds of broken litter with live pigs and etceteras lie about the street for as a rule no rubbish is removed but waits patiently the action of mere natural chemistry and accident if even a house is burnt or falls you will find it there after half a century only cloaked by the everready ivy sluggish man seems never to have struck a pick into it his new hut is built close by on ground not encumbered and the old stones are still left lying  this is the ordinary welsh village but there are exceptions where people of more cultivated tastes have been led to settle and llanblethian is one of the more signal of these a decidedly cheerful group of human homes the greater part of them indeed belonging to persons of refined habits trimness shady shelter whitewash neither conveniency nor decoration has been neglected here its effect from the distance on the eastward is very pretty you see it like a little sleeping cataract of white houses with trees overshadowing and fringing it and there the cataract hangs and does not rush away from you  john sterling spent his next five years in this locality he did not again see it for a quarter of a century but retained all his life a lively remembrance of it and just in the end of his twentyfirst year among his earliest printed pieces we find an elaborate and diffuse description of it and its relations to himpart of which piece in spite of its otherwise insignificant quality may find place here  the fields on which i first looked and the sands which were marked by my earliest footsteps are completely lost to my memory and of those ancient walls among which i began to breathe i retain no recollection more clear than the outlines of a cloud in a moonless sky but of l the village where i afterwards lived i persuade myself that every line and hue is more deeply and accurately fixed than those of any spot i have since beheld even though borne in upon the heart by the association of the strongest feelings  my home was built upon the slope of a hill with a little orchard stretching down before it and a garden rising behind at a considerable distance beyond and beneath the orchard a rivulet flowed through meadows and turned a mill while above the garden the summit of the hill was crowned by a few gray rocks from which a yewtree grew solitary and bare extending at each side of the orchard toward the brook two scattered patches of cottages lay nestled among their gardens and beyond this streamlet and the little mill and bridge another slight eminence arose divided into green fields tufted and bordered with copsewood and crested by a ruined castle contemporary as was said with the conquest i know not whether these things in truth made up a prospect of much beauty since i was eight years old i have never seen them but i well know that no landscape i have since beheld no picture of claude or salvator gave me half the impression of living heartfelt perfect beauty which fills my mind when i think of that green valley that sparkling rivulet that broken fortress of dark antiquity and that hill with its aged yew and breezy summit from which i have so often looked over the broad stretch of verdure beneath it and the countrytown and churchtower silent and white beyond  in that little town there was and i believe is a school where the elements of human knowledge were communicated to me for some hours of every day during a considerable time the path to it lay across the rivulet and past the mill from which point we could either journey through the fields below the old castle and the wood which surrounded it or along a road at the other side of the ruin close to the gateway of which it passed the former track led through two or three beautiful fields the sylvan domain of the keep on one hand and the brook on the other while an oak or two like giant warders advanced from the wood broke the sunshine of the green with a soft and graceful shadow how often on my way to school have i stopped beneath the tree to collect the fallen acorns how often run down to the stream to pluck a branch of the hawthorn which hung over the water the road which passed the castle joined beyond these fields the path which traversed them it took i well remember a certain solemn and mysterious interest from the ruin the shadow of the archway the discolorizations of time on all the walls the dimness of the little thicket which encircled it the traditions of its immeasurable age made st quentins castle a wonderful and awful fabric in the imagination of a child and long after i last saw its mouldering roughness i never read of fortresses or heights or spectres or banditti without connecting them with the one ruin of my childhood  it was close to this spot that one of the few adventures occurred which marked in my mind my boyish days with importance when loitering beyond the castle on the way to school with a brother somewhat older than myself who was uniformly my champion and protector we espied a round sloe high up in the hedgerow we determined to obtain it and i do not remember whether both of us or only my brother climbed the tree however when the prize was all but reachedand no alchemist ever looked more eagerly for the moment of projection which was to give him immortality and omnipotencea gruff voice startled us with an oath and an order to desist and i well recollect looking back for long after with terror to the vision of an old and illtempered farmer armed with a billhook and vowing our decapitation nor did i subsequently remember without triumph the eloquence whereby alone in my firm belief my brother and myself had been rescued from instant death  at the entrance of the little town stood an old gateway with a pointed arch and decaying battlements it gave admittance to the street which contained the church and which terminated in another street the principal one in the town of c in this was situated the school to which i daily wended i cannot now recall to mind the face of its good conductor nor of any of his scholars but i have before me a strong general image of the interior of his establishment i remember the reverence with which i was wont to carry to his seat a wellthumbed duodecimo the history of greece by oliver goldsmith i remember the mental agonies i endured in attempting to master the art and mystery of penmanship a craft in which alas i remained too short a time under mr r to become as great a proficient as he made his other scholars and which my awkwardness has prevented me from attaining in any considerable perfection under my various subsequent pedagogues but that which has left behind it a brilliant trait of light was the exhibition of what are called christmas pieces things unknown in aristocratic seminaries but constantly used at the comparatively humble academy which supplied the best knowledge of reading writing and arithmetic to be attained in that remote neighborhood  the long desks covered from end to end with those painted masterpieces the life of robinson crusoe the hunting of chevychase the history of jack the giantkiller and all the little eager faces and trembling hands bent over these and filling them up with some choice quotation sacred or profaneno the galleries of art the theatrical exhibitions the reviews and processionswhich are only not childish because they are practiced and admired by men instead of childrenall the pomps and vanities of great cities have shown me no revelation of glory such as did that crowded schoolroom the week before the christmas holidays but these were the splendors of life the truest and the strongest feelings do not connect themselves with any scenes of gorgeous and gaudy magnificence they are bound up in the remembrances of home  the narrow orchard with its grove of old appletrees against one of which i used to lean and while i brandished a beanstalk roar out with fitzjames       come one come all this rock shall fly      from its firm base as soon as i  while i was ready to squall at the sight of a cur and run valorously away from a casually approaching cow the field close beside it where i rolled about in summer among the hay the brook in which despite of maid and mother i waded by the hour the garden where i sowed flowerseeds and then turned up the ground again and planted potatoes and then rooted out the potatoes to insert acorns and applepips and at last as may be supposed reaped neither roses nor potatoes nor oaktrees nor apples the grassplots on which i played among those with whom i never can play nor work again all these are places and employmentsand alas playmatessuch as if it were worth while to weep at all it would be worth weeping that i enjoy no longer  i remember the house where i first grew familiar with peacocks and the millstream into which i once fell and the religious awe wherewith i heard in the warm twilight the psalmsinging around the house of the methodist miller and the doorpost against which i discharged my brazen artillery i remember the window by which i sat while my mother taught me french and the patch of garden which i dug for but her name is best left blank it was indeed writ in water these recollections are to me like the wealth of a departed friend a mournful treasure but the public has heard enough of them to it they are worthless they are a coin which only circulates at its true value between the different periods of an individuals existence and good for nothing but to keep up a commerce between boyhood and manhood i have for years looked forward to the possibility of visiting l but i am told that it is a changed village and not only has man been at work but the old yew on the hill has fallen and scarcely a low stump remains of the tree which i delighted in childhood to think might have furnished bows for the norman archers 3  in cowbridge is some kind of free school or grammarschool of a certain distinction and this to captain sterling was probably a motive for settling in the neighborhood of it with his children of this however as it turned out there was no use made the sterling family during its continuance in those parts did not need more than a primary school the worthy master who presided over these christmas galas and had the honor to teach john sterling his reading and writing was an elderly mr reece of cowbridge who still in 1851 survives or lately did and is still remembered by his old pupils as a worthy ingenious and kindly man who wore drab breeches and white stockings beyond the reece sphere of tuition john sterling did not go in this locality  in fact the sterling household was still fluctuating the problem of a task for edward sterlings powers and of anchorage for his affairs in any sense was restlessly struggling to solve itself but was still a good way from being solved anthony in revisiting these scenes with john in 1839 mentions going to the spot where we used to stand with our father looking out for the arrival of the london mail a little chink through which is disclosed to us a big restless section of a human life the hill of welsh llanblethian then is like the mythic caucasus in its degree as indeed all hills and habitations where men sojourn are and here too on a small scale is a prometheus chained edward sterling i can well understand was a man to tug at the chains that held him idle in those the prime of his years and to ask restlessly yet not in anger and remorse so much as in hope locomotive speculation and evernew adventure and attempt is there no task nearer my own natural size then so he looks out from the hillside for the arrival of the london mail thence hurries into cowbridge to the postoffice and has a wide web of threads and gossamers upon his loom and many shuttles flying in this world  by the marquis of butes appointment he had very shortly after his arrival in that region become adjutant of the glamorganshire militia local militia i suppose and was in this way turning his military capabilities to some use the office involved pretty frequent absences in cardiff and elsewhere this doubtless was a welcome outlet though a small one he had also begun to try writing especially on public subjects a much more copious outletwhich indeed gradually widening itself became the final solution for him of the year 1811 we have a pamphlet of his entitled military reform this is the second edition dedicated to the duke of kent the first appears to have come out the year before and had thus attained a certain notice which of course was encouraging he now furthermore opened a correspondence with the times newspaper wrote to it in 1812 a series of letters under the signature vetus voluntary letters i suppose without payment or preengagement one successful letter calling out another till vetus and his doctrines came to be a distinguishable entity and the business amounted to something out of my own earliest newspaper reading i can remember the name vetus as a kind of editorial hacklog on which ableeditors were wont to chop straw now and then nay the letters were collected and reprinted both this first series of 1812 and then a second of next year two very thin very dimcolored cheap octavos stray copies of which still exist and may one day become distillable into a drop of history should such be wanted of our poor scavenger age in time coming though the reading of them has long ceased in this generation4 the first series we perceive had even gone to a second edition the tone wherever one timidly glances into this extinct cockpit is trenchant and emphatic the name of vetus strenuously fighting there had become considerable in the talking political world and no doubt was especially of mark as that of a writer who might otherwise be important with the proprietors of the times the connection continued widened and deepened itselfin a slow tentative manner passing naturally from voluntary into remunerated and indeed proving more and more to be the true ultimate arena and battlefield and seedfield for the exuberant impetuosities and faculties of this man  what the letters of vetus treated of i do not know doubtless they ran upon napoleon catholic emancipation true methods of national defence of effective foreign antigallicism and of domestic ditto which formed the staple of editorial speculation at that time i have heard in general that captain sterling then and afterwards advocated the marquis of wellesleys policy but that also what it was i have forgotten and the world has been willing to forget enough the heads of the times establishment perhaps already the marquis of wellesley and other important persons had their eye on this writer and it began to be surmised by him that here at last was the career he had been seeking   accordingly in 1814 when victorious peace unexpectedly arrived and the gates of the continent after fiveandtwenty years of fierce closure were suddenly thrown open and the hearts of all english and european men awoke staggering as if from a nightmare suddenly removed and ran hither and thitheredward sterling also determined on a new adventure that of crossing to paris and trying what might lie in store for him for curiosity in its idler sense there was evidently pabulum enough but he had hopes moreover of learning much that might perhaps avail him afterwardshopes withal i have understood of getting to be foreign correspondent of the times newspaper and so adding to his income in the mean while he left llanblethian in may dates from dieppe the 27th of that month he lived in occasional contact with parisian notabilities all of them except madame de stael forgotten now all summer diligently surveying his groundreturned for his family who were still in wales but ready to move in the beginning of august took them immediately across with him a house in the neighborhood of paris in the pleasant village of passy at once town and country being now ready and so under foreign skies again set up his household there  here was a strange new school for our friend john now in his eighth year out of which the little anthony and he drank doubtless at all pores vigorously as they had done in no school before a change total and immediate somniferous green llanblethian has suddenly been blotted out presto here are wakeful passy and the noises of paved paris instead innocent ingenious mr reece in drab breeches and white stockings he with his mild christmas galas and peaceable rules of dilworth and butterworth has given place to such a saturnalia of panoramic symbolic and other teachers and monitors addressing all the five senses at once who johns express tutors were at passy i never heard nor indeed especially in his case was it much worth inquiring to him and to all of us the expressly appointed schoolmasters and schoolings we get are as nothing compared with the unappointed incidental and continual ones whose schoolhours are all the days and nights of our existence and whose lessons noticed or unnoticed stream in upon us with every breath we draw anthony says they attended a french school though only for about three months and he well remembers the last scene of it the boys shouting vive lempereur when napoleon came back  of john sterlings express schooling perhaps the most important feature and by no means a favorable one to him was the excessive fluctuation that prevailed in it change of scene change of teacher both express and implied was incessant with him and gave his young life a nomadic characterwhich surely of all the adventitious tendencies that could have been impressed upon him so volatile swift and airy a being as him was the one he needed least his gentle pioushearted mother ever watching over him in all outward changes and assiduously keeping human pieties and good affections alive in him was probably the best counteracting element in his lot and on the whole have we not all to run our chance in that respect and take the most victoriously we can such schooling as pleases to be attainable in our year and place not very victoriously the most of us a wise wellcalculated breeding of a young genial soul in this world or alas of any young soul in it lies fatally over the horizon in these epochsthis french scene of things a grand school of its sort and also a perpetual banquet for the young soul naturally captivated john sterling he said afterwards new things and experiences here were poured upon his mind and sense not in streams but in a niagara cataract this too however was but a scene lasted only some six or seven months and in the spring of the next year terminated as abruptly as any of the rest could do  for in the spring of the next year napoleon abruptly emerged from elba and set all the populations of the world in motion in a strange mannerset the sterling household afloat in particular the big european tide rushing into all smallest creeks at passy and elsewhere in brief on the 20th of march 1815 the family had to shift almost to fly towards home and the seacoast and for a day or two were under apprehension of being detained and not reaching home mrs sterling with her children and effects all in one big carriage with two horses made the journey to dieppe in perfect safety though in continual tremor here they were joined by captain sterling who had stayed behind at paris to see the actual advent of napoleon and to report what the aspect of affairs was downcast looks of citizens with fierce saturnalian acclaim of soldiery after which they proceeded together to london without farther apprehensionthere to witness in due time the tarbarrels of waterloo and other phenomena that followed   captain sterling never quitted london as a residence any more and indeed was never absent from it except on autumnal or other excursions of a few weeks till the end of his life nevertheless his course there was as yet by no means clear nor had his relations with the heads of the times or with other high heads assumed a form which could be called definite but were hanging as a cloudy maze of possibilities firm substance not yet divided from shadow it continued so for some years the sterling household shifted twice or thrice to new streets or localitiesrussell square or queen square blackfriars road and longest at the grove blackheathbefore the vapors of wellesley promotions and such like slowly sank as useless precipitate and the firm rock which was definite employment ending in lucrative coproprietorship and more and more important connection with the times newspaper slowly disclosed itself  these changes of place naturally brought changes in john sterlings schoolmasters nor were domestic tragedies wanting still more important to him new brothers and sisters had been born two little brothers more three little sisters he had in all some of whom came to their eleventh year beside him some passed away in their second or fourth but from his ninth to his sixteenth year they all died and in 1821 only anthony and john were left 5 how many tears and passionate pangs and soft infinite regrets such as are appointed to all mortals in one year i find indeed in one halfyear he lost three little playmates two of them within one month his own age was not yet quite twelve for one of these three for little edward his next younger who died now at the age of nine mr hare records that john copied out in large schoolhand a history of valentine and orson to beguile the poor childs sickness which ended in death soon leaving a sad cloud on john   of his grammar and other schools which as i said are hardly worth enumerating in comparison the most important seems to have been a dr burneys at greenwich a large dayschool and boardingschool where anthony and john gave their attendance for a year or two 181819 from blackheath john frequently did themes for the boys says anthony and for myself when i was aground his progress in all school learning was certain to be rapid if he even moderately took to it a lean tallish loosemade boy of twelve strange alacrity rapidity and joyous eagerness looking out of his eyes and of all his ways and movements i have a picture of him at this stage a little portrait which carries its verification with it in manhood too the chief expression of his eyes and physiognomy was what i might call alacrity cheerful rapidity you could see here looked forth a soul which was winged which dwelt in hope and action not in hesitation or fear anthony says he was an affectionate and gallant kind of boy adventurous and generous daring to a singular degree apt enough withal to be petulant now and then on the whole very selfwilled doubtless not a little discursive in his thoughts and ways and difficult to manage  i rather think anthony as the steadier more substantial boy was the mothers favorite and that john though the quicker and cleverer perhaps cost her many anxieties among the papers given me is an old browned halfsheet in stiff school hand unpunctuated occasionally ill speltjohn sterlings earliest remaining letterwhich gives record of a crowning escapade of his the first and the last of its kind and so may be inserted here a very headlong adventure on the boys part so hasty and so futile at once audacious and impracticable emblematic of much that befell in the history of the man                     to mrs sterling blackheath                                                 21st september 1818  dear mammai am now at dover where i arrived this morning about seven oclock when you thought i was going to church i went down the kent road and walked on till i came to gravesend which is upwards of twenty miles from blackheath at about seven oclock in the evening without having eat anything the whole time i applied to an inkeeper sic there pretending that i had served a haberdasher in london who left of sic business and turned me away he believed me and got me a passage in the coach here for i said that i had an uncle here and that my father and mother were deadwhen i wandered about the quays for some time till i met captain keys whom i asked to give me a passage to boulogne which he promised to do and took me home to breakfast with him but mrs keys questioned me a good deal when i not being able to make my story good i was obliged to confess to her that i had run away from you captain keys says that he will keep me at his house till you answer my letter                                                          j sterling  anthony remembers the business well but can assign no origin to itsome penalty indignity or cross put suddenly on john which the hasty john considered unbearable his mothers inconsolable weeping and then his own astonishment at such a culprits being forgiven are all that remain with anthony the steady historical style of the young runaway of twelve narrating merely not in the least apologizing is also noticeable  this was some six months after his little brother edwards death three months after that of hester his little sister next in the family series to him troubled days for the poor mother in that small household on blackheath as there are for mothers in so many households in this world i have heard that mrs sterling passed much of her time alone at this period her husbands pursuits with his wellesleys and the like often carrying him into town and detaining him late there she would sit among her sleeping children such of them as death had still spared perhaps thriftily plying her needle full of mournful affectionate nightthoughtsapprehensive too in her tremulous heart that the head of the house might have fallen among robbers in his way homeward    chapter iv universities glasgow cambridge  at a later stage john had some instruction from a dr waite at blackheath and lastly the family having now removed into town to seymour street in the fashionable region there he read for a while with dr trollope master of christs hospital which ended his school history  in this his everchanging course from reece at cowbridge to trollope in christs which was passed so nomadically under ferulas of various color the boy had on the whole snatched successfully a fair share of what was going competent skill in construing latin i think also an elementary knowledge of greek add ciphering to a small extent euclid perhaps in a rather imaginary condition a swift but not very legible or handsome penmanship and the copious prompt habit of employing it in all manner of unconscious english prose composition or even occasionally in verse itself this or something like this he had gained from his grammarschools this is the most of what they offer to the poor young soul in general in these indigent times the express schoolmaster is not equal to much at presentwhile the unexpress for good or for evil is so busy with a poor little fellow other departments of schooling had been infinitely more productive for our young friend than the gerundgrinding one a voracious reader i believe he all along washad read the whole edinburgh review in these boyish years and out of the circulating libraries one knows not what cartloads wading like ulysses towards his palace through infinite dung a voracious observer and participator in all things he likewise all along was and had had his sights and reflections and sorrows and adventures from kaimes castle onwardand had gone at least to dover on his own score puer bonae spei as the schoolalbums say a boy of whom much may be hoped surely in many senses yes a frank veracity is in him truth and courage as the basis of all and of wild gifts and graces there is abundance i figure him a brilliant swift voluble affectionate and pleasant creature out of whom if it were not that symptoms of delicate health already show themselves great things might be made promotions at least especially in this country and epoch of parliaments and eloquent palavers are surely very possible for such a one   being now turned of sixteen and the family economics getting yearly more propitious and flourishing he as his brother had already been was sent to glasgow university in which city their mother had connections his brother and he were now all that remained of the young family much attached to one another in their college years as afterwards glasgow however was not properly their college scene here except that they had some tuition from mr jacobson then a senior fellowstudent now 1851 the learned editor of st basil and regius professor of divinity in oxford who continued ever afterwards a valued intimate of johns i find nothing special recorded of them the glasgow curriculum for john especially lasted but one year who after some farther tutorage from mr jacobson or dr trollope was appointed for a more ambitious sphere of education  in the beginning of his nineteenth year in the autumn of 1824 he went to trinity college cambridge his brother anthony who had already been there a year had just quitted this establishment and entered on a military life under good omens i think at dublin under the lord lieutenants patronage to whose service he was in some capacity attached the two brothers ever in company hitherto parted roads at this point and except on holiday visits and by frequent correspondence did not again live together but they continued in a true fraternal attachment while life lasted and i believe never had any even temporary estrangement or on either side a cause for such the family as i said was now for the last three years reduced to these two the rest of the young ones with their laughter and their sorrows all gone the parents otherwise were prosperous in outward circumstances the fathers position more and more developing itself into affluent security an agreeable circle of acquaintance and a certain real influence though of a peculiar sort according to his gifts for work in this world   sterlings tutor at trinity college was julius hare now the distinguished archdeacon of leweswho soon conceived a great esteem for him and continued ever afterwards in looser or closer connection his loved and loving friend as the biographical and editorial work above alluded to abundantly evinces mr hare celebrates the wonderful and beautiful gifts the sparkling ingenuity ready logic eloquent utterance and noble generosities and pieties of his pupilrecords in particular how once on a sudden alarm of fire in some neighboring college edifice while his lecture was proceeding all hands rushed out to help how the undergraduates instantly formed themselves in lines from the fire to the river and in swift continuance kept passing buckets as was needful till the enemy was visibly fast yieldingwhen mr hare going along the line was astonished to find sterling at the riverend of it standing up to his waist in water deftly dealing with the buckets as they came and went you in the river sterling you with your coughs and dangerous tendencies of healthsomebody must be in it answered sterling why not i as well as another sterlings friends may remember many traits of that kind the swiftest in all things he was apt to be found at the head of the column whithersoever the march might be if towards any brunt of danger there was he surest to be at the head and of himself and his peculiar risks or impediments he was negligent at all times even to an excessive and plainly unreasonable degree  mr hare justly refuses him the character of an exact scholar or technical proficient at any time in either of the ancient literatures but he freely read in greek and latin as in various modern languages and in all fields in the classical as well his lively faculty of recognition and assimilation had given him large booty in proportion to his labor one cannot under any circumstances conceive of sterling as a steady dictionary philologue historian or archaeologist nor did he here nor could he well attempt that course at the same time greek and the greeks being here before him he could not fail to gather somewhat from it to take some hue and shape from it accordingly there is to a singular extent especially in his early writings a certain tinge of grecism and heathen classicality traceable in himclassicality indeed which does not satisfy ones sense as real or truly living but which glitters with a certain genial if perhaps almost meretricious halfjapannish splendorgreatly distinguishable from mere gerundgrinding and death in longs and shorts if classicality mean the practical conception or attempt to conceive what human life was in the epoch called classicalperhaps few or none of sterlings contemporaries in that cambridge establishment carried away more of available classicality than even he  but here as in his former schools his studies and inquiries diligently prosecuted i believe were of the most discursive wideflowing character not steadily advancing along beaten roads towards college honors but pulsing out with impetuous irregularity now on this tract now on that towards whatever spiritual delphi might promise to unfold the mystery of this world and announce to him what was in our new day the authentic message of the gods his speculations readings inferences glances and conclusions were doubtless sufficiently encyclopedic his grand tutors the multifarious set of books he devoured and perhapsas is the singular case in most schools and educational establishments of this unexampled epochit was not the express set of arrangements in this or any extant university that could essentially forward him but only the implied and silent ones less in the prescribed course of study which seems to tend nowhither thanif you will consider itin the generous not ungenerous rebellion against said prescribed course and the voluntary spirit of endeavor and adventure excited thereby does help lie for a brave youth in such places curious to consider the fagging the illicit boating and the things forbidden by the schoolmasterthese i often notice in my eton acquaintances are the things that have done them good these and not their inconsiderable or considerable knowledge of the greek accidence almost at all what is greek accidence compared to spartan discipline if it can be had that latter is a real and grand attainment certainly if rebellion is unfortunately needful and you can rebel in a generous manner several things may be acquired in that operationrigorous mutual fidelity reticence steadfastness mild stoicism and other virtues far transcending your greek accidence nor can the unwisest prescribed course of study be considered quite useless if it have incited you to try nobly on all sides for a course of your own a singular condition of schools and highschools which have come down in their strange old clothes and courses of study from the monkish ages into this highly unmonkish onetragical condition at which the intelligent observer makes deep pause  one benefit not to be dissevered from the most obsolete university still frequented by young ingenuous living souls is that of manifold collision and communication with the said young souls which to every one of these coevals is undoubtedly the most important branch of breeding for him in this point as the learned huber has insisted 6 the two english universitiestheir studies otherwise being granted to be nearly useless and even ill done of their kindfar excel all other universities so valuable are the rules of human behavior which from of old have tacitly established themselves there so manful with all its sad drawbacks is the style of english character frank simple rugged and yet courteous which has tacitly but imperatively got itself sanctioned and prescribed there such in full sight of continental and other universities is hubers opinion alas the question of university reform goes deep at present deep as the worldand the real university of these new epochs is yet a great way from us another judge in whom i have confidence declares further that of these two universities cambridge is decidedly the more catholic not roman catholic but human catholic in its tendencies and habitudes and that in fact of all the miserable schools and highschools in the england of these years he if reduced to choose from them would choose cambridge as a place of culture for the young idea so that in these bad circumstances sterling had perhaps rather made a hit than otherwise   sterling at cambridge had undoubtedly a wide and rather genial circle of comrades and could not fail to be regarded and beloved by many of them their life seems to have been an ardently speculating and talking one by no means excessively restrained within limits and in the more adventurous heads like sterlings decidedly tending towards the latitudinarian in most things they had among them a debating society called the union where on stated evenings was much logic and other spiritual fencing and ingenuous collisionprobably of a really superior quality in that kind for not a few of the then disputants have since proved themselves men of parts and attained distinction in the intellectual walks of life frederic maurice richard trench john kemble spedding venables charles buller richard milnes and othersi have heard that in speaking and arguing sterling was the acknowledged chief in this union club and that none even came near him except the late charles buller whose distinction in this and higher respects was also already notable  the questions agitated seem occasionally to have touched on the political department and even on the ecclesiastical i have heard one trait of sterlings eloquence which survived on the wings of grinning rumor and had evidently borne upon church conservatism in some form have they notor perhaps it was has she the church nota black dragoon in every parish on good pay and rations horsemeat and mansmeat to patrol and battle for these things the black dragoon which naturally at the moment ruffled the general young imagination into stormy laughter points towards important conclusions in respect to sterling at this time i conclude he had with his usual alacrity and impetuous daring frankly adopted the antisuperstitious side of things and stood scornfully prepared to repel all aggressions or pretensions from the opposite quarter in short that he was already what afterwards there is no doubt about his being at all points a radical as the name or nickname then went in other words a young ardent soul looking with hope and joy into a world which was infinitely beautiful to him though overhung with falsities and foul cobwebs as world never was before overloaded overclouded to the zenith and the nadir of it by incredible uncredited traditions solemnly sordid hypocrisies and beggarly deliriums old and new which latter class of objects it was clearly the part of every noble heart to expend all its lightnings and energies in burning up without delay and sweeping into their native chaos out of such a cosmos as this which process it did not then seem to him could be very difficult or attended with much other than heroic joy and enthusiasm of victory or of battle to the gallant operator in his part of it this was with modifications such as might be the humor and creed of college radicalism fiveandtwenty years ago rather horrible at that time seen to be not so horrible now at least to have grown very universal and to need no concealment now the natural humor and attitude we may well regret to sayand honorable not dishonorable for a brave young soul such as sterlings in those years in those localities  i do not find that sterling had at that stage adopted the then prevalent utilitarian theory of human things but neither apparently had he rejected it still less did he yet at all denounce it with the damnatory vehemence we were used to in him at a later period probably he so much occupied with the negative side of things had not yet thought seriously of any positive basis for his world or asked himself too earnestly what then is the noble rule of living for a man in this world so eclipsed and scandalously overhung with fable and hypocrisy what is the eternal fact on which a man may front the destinies and the immensities the day for such questions sure enough to come in his case was still but coming sufficient for this day be the work thereof that of blasting into merited annihilation the innumerable and immeasurable recognized deliriums and extirpating or coercing to the due pitch those legions of black dragoons of all varieties and purposes who patrol with horsemeat and mansmeat this afflicted earth so hugely to the detriment of it   sterling it appears after above a year of trinity college followed his friend maurice into trinity hall with the intention of taking a degree in law which intention like many others with him came to nothing and in 1827 he left trinity hall and cambridge altogether here ending after two years his brief university life    chapter v a profession  here then is a young soul brought to the years of legal majority furnished from his trainingschools with such and such shining capabilities and ushered on the scene of things to inquire practically what he will do there piety is in the man noble human valor bright intelligence ardent proud veracity light and fire in none of their many senses wanting for him but abundantly bestowed a kingly kind of manwhose kingdom however in this bewildered place and epoch of the world will probably be difficult to find and conquer  for alas the world as we said already stands convicted to this young soul of being an untrue unblessed world its high dignitaries many of them phantasms and playersmasks its worthships and worships unworshipful from dan to beersheba a mad world my masters and surely we may say and none will now gainsay this his idea of the world at that epoch was nearer to the fact than at most other epochs it has been truly in all times and places the young ardent soul that enters on this world with heroic purpose with veracious insight and the yet unclouded inspiration of the almighty which has given us our intelligence will find this world a very mad one why else is he with his little outfit of heroisms and inspirations come hither into it except to make it diligently a little saner of him there would have been no need had it been quite sane this is true this will in all centuries and countries be true  and yet perhaps of no time or country for the last two thousand years was it so true as here in this wasteweltering epoch of sterlings and ours a world all rocking and plunging like that old roman one when the measure of its iniquities was full the abysses and subterranean and supernal deluges plainly broken loose in the wild dimlighted chaos all stars of heaven gone out no star of heaven visible hardly now to any man the pestiferous fogs and foul exhalations grown continual have except on the highest mountaintops blotted out all stars willowisps of various course and color take the place of stars over the wildsurging chaos in the leaden air are only sudden glares of revolutionary lightning then mere darkness with philanthropistic phosphorescences empty meteoric lights here and there an ecclesiastical luminary still hovering hanging on to its old quaking fixtures pretending still to be a moon or sunthough visibly it is but a chinese lantern made of paper mainly with candleend foully dying in the heart of it surely as mad a world as you could wish  if you want to make sudden fortunes in it and achieve the temporary hallelujah of flunkies for yourself renouncing the perennial esteem of wise men if you can believe that the chief end of man is to collect about him a bigger heap of gold than ever before in a shorter time than ever before you will find it a most handy and every way furthersome blessed and felicitous world but for any other human aim i think you will find it not furthersome if you in any way ask practically how a noble life is to be led in it you will be luckier than sterling or i if you get any credible answer or find any made road whatever alas it is even so your hearts question if it be of that sort most things and persons will answer with a nonsense noble life is in drury lane and wears yellow boots you fool compose yourself to your puddingsurely in these times if ever in any the young heroic soul entering on life so opulent full of sunny hope of noble valor and divine intention is tragical as well as beautiful to us  of the three learned professions none offered any likelihood for sterling from the church his notions of the black dragoon had there been no other obstacle were sufficient to exclude him law he had just renounced his own radical philosophies disheartening him in face of the ponderous impediments continual uphill struggles and formidable toils inherent in such a pursuit with medicine he had never been in any contiguity that he should dream of it as a course for him clearly enough the professions were unsuitable they to him he to them professions built so largely on speciosity instead of performance clogged in this bad epoch and defaced under such suspicions of fatal imposture were hateful not lovable to the young radical soul scornful of gross profit and intent on ideals and human noblenesses again the professions were they never so perfect and veracious will require slow steady pulling to which this individual young radical with his swift fardarting brilliancies and nomadic desultory ways is of all men the most averse and unfitted no profession could in any case have well gained the early love of sterling and perhaps withal the most tragic element of his life is even this that there now was none to which he could fitly by those wiser than himself have been bound and constrained that he might learn to love it so swift lightlimbed and fiery an arab courser ought for all manner of reasons to have been trained to saddle and harness roaming at full gallop over the heathsespecially when your heath was london and english and european life in the nineteenth centuryhe suffered much and did comparatively little i have known few creatures whom it was more wasteful to send forth with the bridle thrown up and to set to steeplehunting instead of running on highways but it is the lot of many such in this dislocated timeheaven mend it in a better time there will be other professions than those three extremely cramp confused and indeed almost obsolete ones professions if possible that are true and do not require you at the threshold to constitute yourself an impostor human associationwhich will mean discipline vigorous wise subordination and coordinationis so unspeakably important professions regimented human pursuits how many of honorable and manful might be possible for men and which should not in their results to society need to stumble along in such an unwieldy futile manner with legs swollen into such enormous elephantiasis and no go at all in them men will one day think of the force they squander in every generation and the fatal damage they encounter by this neglect   the career likeliest for sterling in his and the worlds circumstances would have been what is called public life some secretarial diplomatic or other official training to issue if possible in parliament as the true field for him and here beyond question had the gross material conditions been allowed his spiritual capabilities were firstrate in any arena where eloquence and argument was the point this man was calculated to have borne the bell from all competitors in lucid ingenious talk and logic in all manner of brilliant utterance and tonguefence i have hardly known his fellow so ready lay his store of knowledge round him so perfect was his ready utterance of the samein coruscating wit in jocund drollery in compact articulated clearness or high poignant emphasis as the case requiredhe was a match for any man in argument before a crowd of men one of the most supplewristed dexterous graceful and successful fencers in that kind a man as mr hare has said able to argue with four or five at once could do the parrying all round in a succession swift as light and plant his hits wherever a chance offered in parliament such a soul put into a body of the due toughness might have carried it far if ours is to be called as i hear some call it the talking era sterling of all men had the talent to excel in it  probably it was with some vague view towards chances in this direction that sterlings first engagement was entered upon a brief connection as secretary to some club or association into which certain public men of the reforming sort mr crawford the oriental diplomatist and writer mr kirkman finlay then member for glasgow and other political notabilities had now formed themselveswith what specific objects i do not know nor with what result if any i have heard vaguely it was to open the trade to india of course they intended to stir up the public mind into cooperation whatever their goal or object was mr crawford an intimate in the sterling household recognized the fine literary gift of john and might think it a lucky hit that he had caught such a secretary for three hundred pounds a year that was the salary agreed upon and for some months actually worked for and paid sterling becoming for the time an intimate and almost an inmate in mr crawfords circle doubtless not without results to himself beyond the secretarial work and pounds sterling so much is certain but neither the secretaryship nor the association itself had any continuance nor can i now learn accurately more of it than what is here statedin which vague state it must vanish from sterlings history again as it in great measure did from his life from himself in afteryears i never heard mention of it nor were his pursuits connected afterwards with those of mr crawford though the mutual goodwill continued unbroken  in fact however splendid and indubitable sterlings qualifications for a parliamentary life there was that in him withal which flatly put a negative on any such project he had not the slow steadypulling diligence which is indispensable in that as in all important pursuits and strenuous human competitions whatsoever in every sense his momentum depended on velocity of stroke rather than on weight of metal beautifulest sheetlightning as i often said not to be condensed into thunderbolts add to thiswhat indeed is perhaps but the same phenomenon in another formhis bodily frame was thin excitable already manifesting pulmonary symptoms a body which the tear and wear of parliament would infallibly in few months have wrecked and ended by this path there was clearly no mounting the fardarting restlessly coruscating soul equips beyond all others to shine in the talking era and lead national palavers with their spolia opima captive is imprisoned in a fragile hectic body which quite forbids the adventure es ist dafur gesorgt says goethe provision has been made that the trees do not grow into the skymeans are always there to stop them short of the sky    chapter vi literature the athenaeum  of all forms of public life in the talking era it was clear that only one completely suited sterlingthe anarchic nomadic entirely aerial and unconditional one called literature to this all his tendencies and fine gifts positive and negative were evidently pointing and here after such brief attempting or thoughts to attempt at other posts he already in this same year arrives as many do and ever more must do in these our years and times this is the chaotic haven of so many frustrate activities where all manner of good gifts go up in farseen smoke or conflagration and whole fleets that might have been warfleets to conquer kingdoms are consumed too truly often amid fame enough and the admiring shouts of the vulgar which is always fond to see fire going on the true canaan and mount zion of a talking era must ever be literature the extraneous miscellaneous selfelected indescribable parliamentum or talking apparatus which talks by books and printed papers  a literary newspaper called the athenaeum the same which still subsists had been founded in those years by mr buckingham james silk buckingham who has since continued notable under various figures mr buckinghams athenaeum had not as yet got into a flourishing condition and he was willing to sell the copyright of it for a consideration perhaps sterling and old cambridge friends of his had been already writing for it at all events sterling who had already privately begun writing a novel and was clearly looking towards literature perceived that his gifted cambridge friend frederic maurice was now also at large in a somewhat similar situation and that here was an opening for both of them and for other gifted friends the copyright was purchased for i know not what sum nor with whose money but guess it may have been sterlings and no great sumand so under free auspices themselves their own captains maurice and he spread sail for this new voyage of adventure into all the world it was about the end of 1828 that readers of periodical literature and quidnuncs in those departments began to report the appearance in a paper called the athenaeum of writings showing a superior brilliancy and height of aim one or perhaps two slight specimens of which came into my own hands in my remote corner about that time and were duly recognized by me while the authors were still far off and hidden behind deep veils  some of sterlings best papers from the athenaeum have been published by archdeacon hare firstfruits by a young man of twentytwo crude imperfect yet singularly beautiful and attractive which will still testify what high literary promise lay in him the ruddiest glow of young enthusiasm of noble incipient spiritual manhood reigns over them once more a divine universe unveiling itself in gloom and splendor in auroral firelight and manytinted shadow full of hope and full of awe to a young melodious pious heart just arrived upon it often enough the delineation has a certain flowing completeness not to be expected from so young an artist here and there is a decided felicity of insight everywhere the point of view adopted is a high and noble one and the result worked out a result to be sympathized with and accepted so far as it will go good reading still those papers for the lessfurnished mindthriceexcellent reading compared with what is usually going for the rest a grand melancholy is the prevailing impression they leavepartly as if while the surface was so blooming and opulent the heart of them was still vacant sad and cold here is a beautiful mirage in the dry wilderness but you cannot quench your thirst there the writers heart is indeed still too vacant except of beautiful shadows and reflexes and resonances and is far from joyful though it wears commonly a smile  in some of the greek delineations the lycian painter for example we have already noticed a strange opulence of splendor characterizable as halflegitimate halfmeretriciousa splendor hovering between the raffaelesque and the japannish what other things sterling wrote there i never knew nor would he in any mood in those later days have told you had you asked this period of his life he always rather accounted as the arabs do the idolatrous times before mahomets advent the period of darkness    chapter vii regent street  on the commercial side the athenaeum still lacked success nor was like to find it under the highly uncommercial management it had now got into this by and by began to be a serious consideration for money is the sinews of periodical literature almost as much as of war itself without money and under a constant drain of loss periodical literature is one of the things that cannot be carried on in no long time sterling began to be practically sensible of this truth and that an unpleasant resolution in accordance with it would be necessary by him also after a while the athenaeum was transferred to other hands better fitted in that respect and under these it did take vigorous root and still bears fruit according to its kind  for the present it brought him into the thick of london literature especially of young london literature and speculation in which turbid exciting element he swam and revelled nothing loath for certain months longera period short of two years in all he had lodgings in regent street his fathers house now a flourishing and stirring establishment in south place knightsbridge where under the warmth of increasing revenue and success miscellaneous cheerful socialities and abundant speculations chiefly political and not johns kind but that of the times newspaper and the clubs were rife he could visit daily and yet be master of his own studies and pursuits maurice trench john mill charles buller these and some few others among a wide circle of a transitory phantasmal character whom he speedily forgot and cared not to remember were much about him with these he in all ways employed and disported himself a first favorite with them all  no pleasanter companion i suppose had any of them so frank open guileless fearless a brother to all worthy souls whatsoever come when you might here is he openhearted rich in cheerful fancies in grave logic in all kinds of bright activity if perceptibly or imperceptibly there is a touch of ostentation in him blame it not it is so innocent so good and childlike he is still fonder of jingling publicly and spreading on the table your big purse of opulences than his own abrupt too he is cares little for bigwigs and garnitures perhaps laughs more than the real fun he has would order but of arrogance there is no vestige of insincerity or of illnature none these must have been pleasant evenings in regent street when the circle chanced to be well adjusted there at other times philistines would enter what we call bores dullards children of darkness and thenexcept in a hunt of dullards and a borebaiting which might be permissiblethe evening was dark sterling of course had innumerable cares withal and was toiling like a slave his very recreations almost a kind of work an enormous activity was in the mansufficient in a body that could have held it without breaking to have gone far even under the unstable guidance it was like to have  thus too an extensive very variegated circle of connections was forming round him besides his athenaeum work and evenings in regent street and elsewhere he makes visits to countryhouses the bullers and others converses with established gentlemen with honorable women not a few is gay and welcome with the young of his own age knows also religious witty and other distinguished ladies and is admiringly known by them on the whole he is already locomotive visits hither and thither in a very rapid flying manner thus i find he had made one flying visit to the cumberland lakeregion in 1828 and got sight of wordsworth and in the same year another flying one to paris and seen with no undue enthusiasm the saintsimonian portent just beginning to preach for itself and france in general simmering under a scum of impieties levities saintsimonisms and frothy fantasticalities of all kinds towards the boilingover which soon made the three days of july famous but by far the most important foreign home he visited was that of coleridge on the hill of highgateif it were not rather a foreign shrine and dodonaoracle as he then reckonedto which onwards from 1828 as would appear he was already an assiduous pilgrim concerning whom and sterlings allimportant connection with him there will be much to say anon  here from this period is a letter of sterlings which the glimpses it affords of bright scenes and figures now sunk so many of them sorrowfully to the realm of shadows will render interesting to some of my readers to me on the mere letter not on its contents alone there is accidentally a kind of fateful stamp a few months after charles bullers death while his loss was mourned by many hearts and to his poor mother all light except what hung upon his memory had gone out in the world a certain delicate and friendly hand hoping to give the poor bereaved lady a good moment sought out this letter of sterlings one morning and called with intent to read it to heralas the poor lady had herself fallen suddenly into the languors of death help of another grander sort now close at hand and to her this letter was never read  on fanny kemble it appears there is an essay by sterling in the athenaeum of this year 16th december 1829 very laudatory i conclude he much admired her genius nay was thought at one time to be vaguely on the edge of still more chivalrous feelings as the letter itself may perhaps indicate           to anthony sterling esq 24th regiment dublin                                       knightsbridge 10th nov 1829  my dear anthonyhere in the capital of england and of europe there is less so far as i hear of movement and variety than in your provincial dublin or among the wicklow mountains we have the old prospect of bricks and smoke the old crowd of busy stupid faces the old occupations the old sleepy amusements and the latest news that reaches us daily has an air of tiresome doting antiquity the world has nothing for it but to exclaim with faust give me my youth again and as for me my month of cornish amusement is over and i must tie myself to my old employments i have not much to tell you about these but perhaps you may like to hear of my expedition to the west  i wrote to polvellan mr bullers to announce the day on which i intended to be there so shortly before setting out that there was no time to receive an answer and when i reached devonport which is fifteen or sixteen miles from my place of destination i found a letter from mrs buller saying that she was coming in two days to a ball at plymouth and if i chose to stay in the mean while and look about me she would take me back with her she added an introduction to a relation of her husbands a certain captain buller of the rifles who was with the depot therea pleasant person who i believe had been acquainted with charlotte 7 or at least had seen her under his superintendence  on leaving devonport with mrs buller i went some of the way by water up the harbor and river and the prospects are certainly very beautiful to say nothing of the large ships which i admire almost as much as you though without knowing so much about them there is a great deal of fine scenery all along the road to looe and the house itself a very unpretending gothic cottage stands beautifully among trees hills and water with the sea at the distance of a quarter of a mile  and here among pleasant goodnatured wellinformed and clever people i spent an idle month i dined at one or two corporation dinners spent a few days at the old mansion of mr buller of morval the patron of west looe and during the rest of the time read wrote played chess lounged and ate red mullet he who has not done this has not begun to live talked of cookery to the philosophers and of metaphysics to mrs buller and altogether cultivated indolence and developed the faculty of nonsense with considerable pleasure and unexampled success charles buller you know he has just come to town but i have not yet seen him arthur his younger brother i take to be one of the handsomest men in england and he too has considerable talent mr buller the father is rather a clever man of sense and particularly goodnatured and gentlemanly and his wife who was a renowned beauty and queen of calcutta has still many striking and delicate traces of what she was her conversation is more brilliant and pleasant than that of any one i know and at all events i am bound to admire her for the kindness with which she patronizes me i hope that some day or other you may be acquainted with her  i believe i have seen no one in london about whom you would care to hearunless the fame of fanny kemble has passed the channel and astonished the irish barbarians in the midst of their bloodyminded politics young kemble whom you have seen is in germany but i have the happiness of being also acquainted with his sister the divine fanny and i have seen her twice on the stage and three or four times in private since my return from cornwall i had seen some beautiful verses of hers long before she was an actress and her conversation is full of spirit and talent she never was taught to act at all and though there are many faults in her performance of juliet there is more power than in any female playing i ever saw except pastas medea she is not handsome rather short and by no means delicately formed but her face is marked and the eyes are brilliant dark and full of character she has far more ability than she ever can display on the stage but i have no doubt that by practice and selfculture she will be a far finer actress at least than any one since mrs siddons i was at charles kembles a few evenings ago when a drawing of miss kemble by sir thomas lawrence was brought in and i have no doubt that you will shortly see even in dublin an engraving of her from it very unlike the caricatures that have hitherto appeared i hate the stage and but for her should very likely never have gone to a theatre again even as it is the annoyance is much more than the pleasure but i suppose i must go to see her in every character in which she acts if charlotte cares for plays let me know and i will write in more detail about this new melpomene i fear there are very few subjects on which i can say anything that will in the least interest her                        ever affectionately yours                                                         j sterling  sterling and his circle as their ardent speculation and activity fermented along were in all things clear for progress liberalism their politics and view of the universe decisively of the radical sort as indeed that of england then was more than ever the crust of old hidebound toryism being now openly cracking towards some incurable disruption which accordingly ensued as the reform bill before long the reform bill already hung in the wind old hidebound toryism long recognized by all the world and now at last obliged to recognize its very self for an overgrown imposture supporting itself not by human reason but by flunky blustering and brazen lying superadded to mere brute force could be no creed for young sterling and his friends in all things he and they were liberals and as was natural at this stage democrats contemplating rootandbranch innovation by aid of the hustings and ballotbox hustings and ballotbox had speedily to vanish out of sterlings thoughts but the character of rootandbranch innovator essentially of radical reformer was indelible with him and under all forms could be traced as his character through life  for the present his and those young peoples aim was by democracy or what means there are be all impostures put down speedy end to superstitiona gentle one if you can contrive it but an end what can it profit any mortal to adopt locutions and imaginations which do not correspond to fact which no sane mortal can deliberately adopt in his soul as true which the most orthodox of mortals can only and this after infinite essentially impious effort to put out the eyes of his mind persuade himself to believe that he believes away with it in the name of god come out of it all true men  piety of heart a certain reality of religious faith was always sterlings the gift of nature to him which he would not and could not throw away but i find at this time his religion is as good as altogether ethnic greekish what goethe calls the heathen form of religion the church with her articles is without relation to him and along with obsolete spiritualisms he sees all manner of obsolete thrones and bigwigged temporalities and for them also can prophesy and wish only a speedy doom doom inevitable registered in heavens chancery from the beginning of days doom unalterable as the pillars of the world the gods are angry and all nature groans till this doom of eternal justice be fulfilled  with gay audacity with enthusiasm tempered by mockery as is the manner of young gifted men this faith grounded for the present on democracy and hustings operations and giving to all life the aspect of a chivalrous battlefield or almost of a gay though perilous tournament and bout of a hundred knights against all comerswas maintained by sterling and his friends and in fine after whatever loud remonstrances and solemn considerations and such shaking of our wigs as is undoubtedly natural in the case let us be just to it and him we shall have to admit nay it will behoove us to see and practically know for ourselves and him and others that the essence of this creed in times like ours was right and not wrong that however the ground and form of it might change essentially it was the monition of his natal genius to this as it is to every brave man the behest of all his clear insight into this universe the message of heaven through him which he could not suppress but was inspired and compelled to utter in this world by such methods as he had there for him lay the first commandment this is what it would have been the unforgivable sin to swerve from and desert the treason of treasons for him it were there compared with which all other sins are venial  the message did not cease at all as we shall see the message was ardently if fitfully continued to the end but the methods the tone and dialect and all outer conditions of uttering it underwent most important modifications    chapter viii coleridge  coleridge sat on the brow of highgate hill in those years looking down on london and its smoketumult like a sage escaped from the inanity of lifes battle attracting towards him the thoughts of innumerable brave souls still engaged there his express contributions to poetry philosophy or any specific province of human literature or enlightenment had been small and sadly intermittent but he had especially among young inquiring men a higher than literary a kind of prophetic or magician character he was thought to hold he alone in england the key of german and other transcendentalisms knew the sublime secret of believing by the reason what the understanding had been obliged to fling out as incredible and could still after hume and voltaire had done their best and worst with him profess himself an orthodox christian and say and print to the church of england with its singular old rubrics and surplices at allhallowtide esto perpetua a sublime man who alone in those dark days had saved his crown of spiritual manhood escaping from the black materialisms and revolutionary deluges with god freedom immortality still his a king of men the practical intellects of the world did not much heed him or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character and sat there as a kind of magus girt in mystery and enigma his dodona oakgrove mr gilmans house at highgate whispering strange things uncertain whether oracles or jargon  the gilmans did not encourage much company or excitation of any sort round their sage nevertheless access to him if a youth did reverently wish it was not difficult he would stroll about the pleasant garden with you sit in the pleasant rooms of the placeperhaps take you to his own peculiar room high up with a rearward view which was the chief view of all a really charming outlook in fine weather close at hand wide sweep of flowery leafy gardens their few houses mostly hidden the very chimneypots veiled under blossomy umbrage flowed gloriously down hill gloriously issuing in widetufted undulating plaincountry rich in all charms of field and town waving blooming country of the brightest green dotted all over with handsome villas handsome groves crossed by roads and human traffic here inaudible or heard only as a musical hum and behind all swam under olivetinted haze the illimitable limitary ocean of london with its domes and steeples definite in the sun big pauls and the many memories attached to it hanging high over all nowhere of its kind could you see a grander prospect on a bright summer day with the set of the air going southwardsouthward and so draping with the citysmoke not you but the city here for hours would coleridge talk concerning all conceivable or inconceivable things and liked nothing better than to have an intelligent or failing that even a silent and patient human listener he distinguished himself to all that ever heard him as at least the most surprising talker extant in this worldand to some small minority by no means to all as the most excellent  the good man he was now getting old towards sixty perhaps and gave you the idea of a life that had been full of sufferings a life heavyladen halfvanquished still swimming painfully in seas of manifold physical and other bewilderment brow and head were round and of massive weight but the face was flabby and irresolute the deep eyes of a light hazel were as full of sorrow as of inspiration confused pain looked mildly from them as in a kind of mild astonishment the whole figure and air good and amiable otherwise might be called flabby and irresolute expressive of weakness under possibility of strength he hung loosely on his limbs with knees bent and stooping attitude in walking he rather shuffled than decisively steps and a lady once remarked he never could fix which side of the garden walk would suit him best but continually shifted in corkscrew fashion and kept trying both a heavyladen highaspiring and surely muchsuffering man his voice naturally soft and good had contracted itself into a plaintive snuffle and singsong he spoke as if preachingyou would have said preaching earnestly and also hopelessly the weightiest things i still recollect his object and subject terms of continual recurrence in the kantean province and how he sang and snuffled them into ommmject and summmject with a kind of solemn shake or quaver as he rolled along no talk in his century or in any other could be more surprising  sterling who assiduously attended him with profound reverence and was often with him by himself for a good many months gives a record of their first colloquy 8 their colloquies were numerous and he had taken note of many but they are all gone to the fire except this first which mr hare has printedunluckily without date it contains a number of ingenious true and halftrue observations and is of course a faithful epitome of the things said but it gives small idea of coleridges way of talkingthis one feature is perhaps the most recognizable our interview lasted for three hours during which he talked two hours and three quarters nothing could be more copious than his talk and furthermore it was always virtually or literally of the nature of a monologue suffering no interruption however reverent hastily putting aside all foreign additions annotations or most ingenuous desires for elucidation as wellmeant superfluities which would never do besides it was talk not flowing anywhither like a river but spreading everywhither in inextricable currents and regurgitations like a lake or sea terribly deficient in definite goal or aim nay often in logical intelligibility what you were to believe or do on any earthly or heavenly thing obstinately refusing to appear from it so that most times you felt logically lost swamped near to drowning in this tide of ingenious vocables spreading out boundless as if to submerge the world  to sit as a passive bucket and be pumped into whether you consent or not can in the longrun be exhilarating to no creature how eloquent soever the flood of utterance that is descending but if it be withal a confused unintelligible flood of utterance threatening to submerge all known landmarks of thought and drown the world and youi have heard coleridge talk with eager musical energy two stricken hours his face radiant and moist and communicate no meaning whatsoever to any individual of his hearerscertain of whom i for one still kept eagerly listening in hope the most had long before given up and formed if the room were large enough secondary humming groups of their own he began anywhere you put some question to him made some suggestive observation instead of answering this or decidedly setting out towards answer of it he would accumulate formidable apparatus logical swimbladders transcendental lifepreservers and other precautionary and vehiculatory gear for setting out perhaps did at last get under waybut was swiftly solicited turned aside by the glance of some radiant new game on this hand or that into new courses and ever into new and before long into all the universe where it was uncertain what game you would catch or whether any  his talk alas was distinguished like himself by irresolution it disliked to be troubled with conditions abstinences definite fulfilmentsloved to wander at its own sweet will and make its auditor and his claims and humble wishes a mere passive bucket for itself he had knowledge about many things and topics much curious reading but generally all topics led him after a pass or two into the high seas of theosophic philosophy the hazy infinitude of kantean transcendentalism with its summmjects and ommmjects sad enough for with such indolent impatience of the claims and ignorances of others he had not the least talent for explaining this or anything unknown to them and you swam and fluttered in the mistiest wide unintelligible deluge of things for most part in a rather profitless uncomfortable manner  glorious islets too i have seen rise out of the haze but they were few and soon swallowed in the general element again balmy sunny islets islets of the blest and the intelligibleon which occasions those secondary humming groups would all cease humming and hang breathless upon the eloquent words till once your islet got wrapt in the mist again and they could recommence humming eloquent artistically expressive words you always had piercing radiances of a most subtle insight came at intervals tones of noble pious sympathy recognizable as pious though strangely colored were never wanting long but in general you could not call this aimless cloudcapt cloudbased lawlessly meandering human discourse of reason by the name of excellent talk but only of surprising and were reminded bitterly of hazlitts account of it excellent talker veryif you let him start from no premises and come to no conclusion coleridge was not without what talkers call wit and there were touches of prickly sarcasm in him contemptuous enough of the world and its idols and popular dignitaries he had traits even of poetic humor but in general he seemed deficient in laughter or indeed in sympathy for concrete human things either on the sunny or on the stormy side one right peal of concrete laughter at some convicted fleshandblood absurdity one burst of noble indignation at some injustice or depravity rubbing elbows with us on this solid earth how strange would it have been in that kantean hazeworld and how infinitely cheering amid its vacant aircastles and dimmelting ghosts and shadows none such ever came his life had been an abstract thinking and dreaming idealistic passed amid the ghosts of defunct bodies and of unborn ones the moaning singsong of that theosophicometaphysical monotony left on you at last a very dreary feeling  in close colloquy flowing within narrower banks i suppose he was more definite and apprehensible sterling in aftertimes did not complain of his unintelligibility or imputed it only to the abtruse high nature of the topics handled let us hope so let us try to believe so there is no doubt but coleridge could speak plain words on things plain his observations and responses on the trivial matters that occurred were as simple as the commonest mans or were even distinguished by superior simplicity as well as pertinency ah your tea is too cold mr coleridge mourned the good mrs gilman once in her kind reverential and yet protective manner handing him a very tolerable though belated cupits better than i deserve snuffled he in a low hoarse murmur partly courteous chiefly pious the tone of which still abides with me its better than i deserve  but indeed to the young ardent mind instinct with pious nobleness yet driven to the grim deserts of radicalism for a faith his speculations had a charm much more than literary a charm almost religious and prophetic the constant gist of his discourse was lamentation over the sunk condition of the world which he recognized to be given up to atheism and materialism full of mere sordid misbeliefs mispursuits and misresults all science had become mechanical the science not of men but of a kind of human beavers churches themselves had died away into a godless mechanical condition and stood there as mere cases of articles mere forms of churches like the dried carcasses of once swift camels which you find left withering in the thirst of the universal desertghastly portents for the present beneficent ships of the desert no more mens souls were blinded hebetated and sunk under the influence of atheism and materialism and hume and voltaire the world for the present was as an extinct world deserted of god and incapable of welldoing till it changed its heart and spirit this expressed i think with less of indignation and with more of longdrawn querulousness was always recognizable as the groundtonein which truly a pious young heart driven into radicalism and the opposition party could not but recognize a too sorrowful truth and ask of the oracle with all earnestness what remedy then  the remedy though coleridge himself professed to see it as in sunbeams could not except by processes unspeakably difficult be described to you at all on the whole those dead churches this dead english church especially must be brought to life again why not it was not dead the soul of it in this parchedup body was tragically asleep only atheistic philosophy was true on its side and hume and voltaire could on their own ground speak irrefragably for themselves against any church but lift the church and them into a higher sphere of argument they died into inanition the church revivified itself into pristine florid vigorbecame once more a living ship of the desert and invincibly bore you over stock and stone but how but how by attending to the reason of man said coleridge and duly chaining up the understanding of man the vernunft reason and verstand understanding of the germans it all turned upon these if you could well understand themwhich you couldnt for the rest mr coleridge had on the anvil various books especially was about to write one grand book on the logos which would help to bridge the chasm for us so much appeared however churches though proved false as you had imagined were still true as you were to imagine here was an artist who could burn you up an old church root and branch and then as the alchemists professed to do with organic substances in general distil you an astral spirit from the ashes which was the very image of the old burnt article its airdrawn counterpartthis you still had or might get and draw uses from if you could wait till the book on the logos were donealas till your own terrene eyes blind with conceit and the dust of logic were purged subtilized and spiritualized into the sharpness of vision requisite for discerning such an ommmjectthe ingenuous young english head of those days stood strangely puzzled by such revelations uncertain whether it were getting inspired or getting infatuated into flat imbecility and strange effulgence of new day or else of deeper meteoric night colored the horizon of the future for it  let me not be unjust to this memorable man surely there was here in his pious everlaboring subtle mind a precious truth or prefigurement of truth and yet a fatal delusion withal prefigurement that in spite of beaver sciences and temporary spiritual hebetude and cecity man and his universe were eternally divine and that no past nobleness or revelation of the divine could or would ever be lost to him most true surely and worthy of all acceptance good also to do what you can with old churches and practical symbols of the noble nay quit not the burnt ruins of them while you find there is still gold to be dug there but on the whole do not think you can by logical alchemy distil astral spirits from them or if you could that said astral spirits or defunct logical phantasms could serve you in anything what the light of your mind which is the direct inspiration of the almighty pronounces incrediblethat in gods name leave uncredited at your peril do not try believing that no subtlest hocuspocus of reason versus understanding will avail for that featand it is terribly perilous to try it in these provinces  the truth is i now see coleridges talk and speculation was the emblem of himself in it as in him a ray of heavenly inspiration struggled in a tragically ineffectual degree with the weakness of flesh and blood he says once he had skirted the howling deserts of infidelity this was evident enough but he had not had the courage in defiance of pain and terror to press resolutely across said deserts to the new firm lands of faith beyond he preferred to create logical fatamorganas for himself on this hither side and laboriously solace himself with these  to the man himself nature had given in high measure the seeds of a noble endowment and to unfold it had been forbidden him a subtle lynxeyed intellect tremulous pious sensibility to all good and all beautiful truly a ray of empyrean lightbut embedded in such weak laxity of character in such indolences and esuriences as had made strange work with it once more the tragic story of a high endowment with an insufficient will an eye to discern the divineness of the heavens spendors and lightnings the insatiable wish to revel in their godlike radiances and brilliances but no heart to front the scathing terrors of them which is the first condition of your conquering an abiding place there the courage necessary for him above all things had been denied this man his life with such ray of the empyrean in it was great and terrible to him and he had not valiantly grappled with it he had fled from it sought refuge in vague daydreams hollow compromises in opium in theosophic metaphysics harsh pain danger necessity slavish harnessed toil were of all things abhorrent to him and so the empyrean element lying smothered under the terrene and yet inextinguishable there made sad writhings for pain danger difficulty steady slaving toil and other highly disagreeable behests of destiny shall in nowise be shirked by any brightest mortal that will approve himself loyal to his mission in this world nay precisely the higher he is the deeper will be the disagreeableness and the detestability to flesh and blood of the tasks laid on him and the heavier too and more tragic his penalties if he neglect them  for the old eternal powers do live forever nor do their laws know any change however we in our poor wigs and churchtippets may attempt to read their laws to steal into heavenby the modern method of sticking ostrichlike your head into

magical ingredient thrown into the wild caldron of such a mind which we have seen occupied hitherto with mere ethnicism radicalism and revolutionary tumult but hungering all along for something higher and better was sure to be eagerly welcomed and imbibed and could not fail to produce important fermentations there fermentations important new directions and withal important new perversions in the spiritual life of this man as it has since done in the lives of so many here then is the new celestial manna we were all in quest of this thricerefined pabulum of transcendental moonshine whoso eateth thereofyes what on the whole will he probably grow to  sterling never spoke much to me of his intercourse with coleridge and when we did compare notes about him it was usually rather in the way of controversial discussion than of narrative so that from my own resources i can give no details of the business nor specify anything in it except the general fact of an ardent attendance at highgate continued for many months which was impressively known to all sterlings friends and am unable to assign even the limitary dates sterlings own papers on the subject having all been destroyed by him inferences point to the end of 1828 as the beginning of this intercourse perhaps in 1829 it was at the highest point and already in 1830 when the intercourse itself was about to terminate we have proof of the influences it was producingin the novel of arthur coningsby then on hand the first and only book that sterling ever wrote his writings hitherto had been sketches criticisms brief essays he was now trying it on a wider scale but not yet with satisfactory results and it proved to be his only trial in that form  he had already as was intimated given up his brief proprietorship of the athenaeum the commercial indications and state of sales and of costs peremptorily ordering him to do so the copyright went by sale or gift i know not at what precise date into other fitter hands and with the copyright all connection on the part of sterling to athenaeum sketches had now in 182930 succeeded arthur coningsby a novel in three volumes indicating when it came to light a year or two afterwards equally hasty and much more ambitious aims in literaturegiving strong evidence too of internal spiritual revulsions going painfully forward and in particular of the impression coleridge was producing on him without and within it was a wild tide of things this ardent light young soul was afloat upon at present and his outlooks into the future whether for his spiritual or economic fortunes were confused enough  among his familiars in this period i might have mentioned one charles barton formerly his fellowstudent at cambridge now an amiable cheerful rather idle young fellow about town who led the way into certain new experiences and lighter fields for sterling his father lieutenantgeneral barton of the lifeguards an irish landlord i think in fermanagh county and a man of connections about court lived in a certain figure here in town had a wife of fashionable habits with other sons and also daughters bred in this sphere these all of them were amiable elegant and pleasant peoplesuch was especially an eldest daughter susannah barton a stately blooming blackeyed young woman attractive enough in form and character full of gay softness of indolent sense and enthusiasm about sterlings own age if not a little older in this house which opened to him more decisively than his fathers a new stratum of society and where his reception for charless sake and his own was of the kindest he liked very well to be and spent i suppose many of his vacant halfhours lightly chatting with the elders or the youngstersdoubtless with the young lady too though as yet without particular intentions on either side  nor with all the coleridge fermentation was democratic radicalism by any means given upthough how it was to live if the coleridgean moonshine took effect might have been an abtruse question hitherto while said moonshine was but taking effect and coloring the outer surface of things without quite penetrating into the heart democratic liberalism revolt against superstition and oppression and help to whosoever would revolt was still the grand element in sterlings creed and practically he stood not ready only but full of alacrity to fulfil all its behests we heard long since of the black dragoonswhom doubtless the new moonshine had considerably silveredover into new hues by this timebut here now while radicalism is tottering for him and threatening to crumble comes suddenly the grand consummation and explosion of radicalism in his life whereby all at once radicalism exhausted and ended itself and appeared no more there   in those years a visible section of the london population and conspicuous out of all proportion to its size or value was a small knot of spaniards who had sought shelter here as political refugees political refugees a tragic succession of that class is one of the possessions of england in our time sixandtwenty years ago when i first saw london i remember those unfortunate spaniards among the new phenomena daily in the cold spring air under skies so unlike their own you could see a group of fifty or a hundred stately tragic figures in proud threadbare cloaks perambulating mostly with closed lips the broad pavements of euston square and the regions about st pancras new church their lodging was chiefly in somers town as i understood and those open pavements about st pancras church were the general place of rendezvous they spoke little or no english knew nobody could employ themselves on nothing in this new scene old steelgray heads many of them the shaggy thick blueblack hair of others struck you their brown complexion dusky look of suppressed fire in general their tragic condition as of caged numidian lions  that particular flight of unfortunates has long since fled again and vanished and new have come and fled in this convulsed revolutionary epoch which already lasts above sixty years what tragic flights of such have we not seen arrive on the one safe coast which is open to them as they get successively vanquished and chased into exile to avoid worse swarm after swarm of evernew complexion from spain as from other countries is thrown off in those everrecurring paroxysms and will continue to be thrown off as there could be suggests linnaeus a flowerclock measuring the hours of the day and the months of the year by the kinds of flowers that go to sleep and awaken that blow into beauty and fade into dust so in the great revolutionary horologe one might mark the years and epochs by the successive kinds of exiles that walk london streets and in grim silent manner demand pity from us and reflections from usthis then extant group of spanish exiles was the trocadero swarm thrown off in 1823 in the riego and quirogas quarrel these were they whom charles tenth had by sheer force driven from their constitutionalisms and their trocadero fortressescharles tenth who himself was soon driven out manifoldly by sheer force and had to head his own swarm of fugitives and has now himself quite vanished and given place to others for there is no end of them propelling and propelled  of these poor spanish exiles now vegetating about somers town and painfully beating the pavement in euston square the acknowledged chief was general torrijos a man of high qualities and fortunes still in the vigor of his years and in these desperate circumstances refusing to despair with whom sterling had at this time become intimate    chapter x torrijos  torrijos who had now in 1829 been here some four or five years having come over in 1824 had from the first enjoyed a superior reception in england possessing not only a language to speak which few of the others did but manifold experiences courtly military diplomatic with fine natural faculties and high spanish manners tempered into cosmopolitan he had been welcomed in various circles of society and found perhaps he alone of those spaniards a certain human companionship among persons of some standing in this country with the elder sterlings among others he had made acquaintance became familiar in the social circle at south place and was much esteemed there with madam torrijos who also was a person of amiable and distinguished qualities an affectionate friendship grew up on the part of mrs sterling which ended only with the death of these two ladies john sterling on arriving in london from his university work naturally inherited what he liked to take up of this relation and in the lodgings in regent street and the democraticoliterary element there torrijos became a very prominent and at length almost the central object  the man himself it is well known was a valiant gallant man of lively intellect of noble chivalrous character fine talents fine accomplishments all grounding themselves on a certain rugged veracity recommended him to the discerning he had begun youth in the court of ferdinand had gone on in wellington and other arduous victorious and unvictorious soldierings familiar in camps and councilrooms in presencechambers and in prisons he knew romantic spainhe was himself standing withal in the vanguard of freedoms fight a kind of living romance infinitely interesting to john sterling for one  it was to torrijos that the poor spaniards of somers town looked mainly in their helplessness for every species of help torrijos it was hoped would yet lead them into spain and glorious victory there meanwhile here in england under defeat he was their captain and sovereign in another painfully inverse sense to whom in extremity everybody might apply when all present resources failed and the exchequer was quite out there still remained torrijos torrijos has to find new resources for his destitute patriots find loans find spanish lessons for them among his english friends in all which charitable operations it need not be said john sterling was his foremost man zealous to empty his own purse for the object impetuous in rushing hither or thither to enlist the aid of others and find lessons or something that would do his friends of course had to assist the bartons among others were wont to assistand i have heard that the fair susan stirring up her indolent enthusiasm into practicality was very successful in finding spanish lessons and the like for these distressed men sterling and his friends were yet new in this business but torrijos and the others were getting old in itand doubtless weary and almost desperate of it they had now been seven years in it many of them and were asking when will the end be  torrijos is described as a man of excellent discernment who knows how long he had repressed the unreasonable schemes of his followers and turned a deaf ear to the temptings of fallacious hope but there comes at length a sumtotal of oppressive burdens which is intolerable which tempts the wisest towards fallacies for relief these weary groups pacing the eustonsquare pavements had often said in their despair were not death in battle better here are we slowly mouldering into nothingness there we might reach it rapidly in flaming splendor flame either of victory to spain and us or of a patriot death the sure harbinger of victory to spain flame fit to kindle a fire which no ferdinand with all his inquisitions and charles tenths could put out enough in the end of 1829 torrijos himself had yielded to this pressure and hoping against hope persuaded himself that if he could but land in the south of spain with a small patriot band well armed and well resolved a band carrying fire in its heartthen spain all inflammable as touchwood and groaning indignantly under its brutal tyrant might blaze wholly into flame round him and incalculable victory be won such was his conclusion not sudden yet surely not deliberate eitherdesperate rather and forced on by circumstances he thought with himself that considering somers town and considering spain the terrible chance was worth trying that this big game of fate go how it might was one which the omens credibly declared he and these poor spaniards ought to play  his whole industries and energies were thereupon bent towards starting the said game and his thought and continual speech and song now was that if he had a few thousand pounds to buy arms to freight a ship and make the other preparations he and these poor gentlemen and spain and the world were made men and a saved spain and world what talks and consultations in the apartment in regent street during those winter days of 182930 setting into open conflagration the young democracy that was wont to assemble there of which there is now left next to no remembrance for sterling never spoke a word of this affair in afterdays nor was any of the actors much tempted to speak we can understand too well that here were young fervid hearts in an explosive condition young rash heads sanctioned by a mans experienced head here at last shall enthusiasm and theory become practice and fact fiery dreams are at last permitted to realize themselves and now is the time or neverhow the coleridge moonshine comported itself amid these hot telluric flames or whether it had not yet begun to play there which i rather doubt must be left to conjecture  mr hare speaks of sterling sailing over to st valery in an open boat along with others upon one occasion in this enterprisein the final english scene of it i suppose which is very possible unquestionably there was adventure enough of other kinds for it and running to and fro with all his speed on behalf of it during these months of his history money was subscribed collected the young cambridge democrats were all ablaze to assist torrijos nay certain of them decided to go with himand went only as yet the funds were rather incomplete and here as i learn from a good hand is the secret history of their becoming complete which as we are upon the subject i had better give but for the following circumstance they had perhaps never been completed nor had the rash enterprise or its catastrophe so influential on the rest of sterlings life taken place at all  a certain lieutenant robert boyd of the indian army an ulster irishman a cousin of sterlings had received some affront or otherwise taken some disgust in that service had thrown up his commission in consequence and returned home about this time with intent to seek another course of life having only for outfit these impatient ardors some experience in indian drill exercise and five thousand pounds of inheritance he found the enterprise attended with difficulties and was somewhat at a loss how to dispose of himself some young ulster comrade in a partly similar situation had pointed out to him that there lay in a certain neighboring creek of the irish coast a wornout royal gunbrig condemned to sale to be had dogcheap this he proposed that they two or in fact boyd with his five thousand pounds should buy that they should refit and arm and man itand sail aprivateering to the eastern archipelago philippine isles or i know not where and so conquer the golden fleece  boyd naturally paused a little at this great proposal did not quite reject it came across with it and other fine projects and impatiences fermenting in his head to london there to see and consider it was in the months when the torrijos enterprise was in the birththroes crying wildly for capital of all things boyd naturally spoke of his projects to sterlingof his gunbrig lying in the irish creek among others sterling naturally said if you want an adventure of the seaking sort and propose to lay your money and your life into such a game here is torrijos and spain at his back here is a golden fleece to conquer worth twenty eastern archipelagoesboyd and torrijos quickly met quickly bargained boyds money was to go in purchasing and storing with a certain stock of arms and etceteras a small ship in the thames which should carry boyd with torrijos and the adventurers to the south coast of spain and there the game once played and won boyd was to have promotion enoughthe colonelcy of a spanish cavalry regiment for one express thing what exact share sterling had in this negotiation or whether he did not even take the prudent side and caution boyd to be wary i know not but it was he that brought the parties together and all his friends knew in silence that to the end of his life he painfully remembered that fact  and so a ship was hired or purchased in the thames due furnishings began to be executed in it arms and stores were gradually got on board torrijos with his fifty picked spaniards in the mean while getting ready this was in the spring of 1830 boyds 5000 pounds was the grand nucleus of finance but vigorous subscription was carried on likewise in sterlings young democratic circle or wherever a member of it could find access not without considerable result and with a zeal that may be imagined nay as above hinted certain of these young men decided not to give their money only but themselves along with it as democratic volunteers and soldiers of progress among whom it need not be said sterling intended to be foremost busy weeks with him those spring ones of the year 1830 through this small note accidentally preserved to us addressed to his friend barton we obtain a curious glance into the subterranean workshop          to charles barton esq dorset sq regents park                         no date apparently march or february 1830  my dear charlesi have wanted to see you to talk to you about my foreign affairs if you are going to be in london for a few days i believe you can be very useful to me at a considerable expense and trouble to yourself in the way of buying accoutrements inter alia a sword and a saddlenot you will understand for my own use  things are going on very well but are very even frightfully near only be quiet pray would you in case of necessity take a free passage to holland next week or the week after stay two or three days and come back all expenses paid if you write to b at cambridge tell him above all things to hold his tongue if you are near palace yard tomorrow before two pray come to see me do not come on purpose especially as i may perhaps be away and at all events shall not be there until eleven nor perhaps till rather later  i fear i shall have alarmed your mother by my irruption forgive me for that and all my exactions from you if the next month were over i should not have to trouble any one                          yours affectionately                                                         j sterling  busy weeks indeed and a glowing smithylight coming through the chinksthe romance of arthur coningsby lay written or halfwritten in his desk and here in his heart and among his hands was an acted romance and unknown catastrophes keeping pace with that  doubts from the doctors for his health was getting ominous threw some shade over the adventure reproachful reminiscences of coleridge and theosophy were natural too then fond regrets for literature and its glories if you act your romance how can you also write it regrets and reproachful reminiscences from art and theosophy perhaps some tenderer regrets withal a crisis in life had come when of innumerable possibilities one possibility was to be elected king and to swallow all the rest the rest of course made noise enough and swelled themselves to their biggest   meanwhile the ship was fast getting ready on a certain day it was to drop quietly down the thames then touch at deal and take on board torrijos and his adventurers who were to be in waiting and on the outlook for them there let every man lay in his accoutrements then let every man make his packages his arrangements and farewells sterling went to take leave of miss barton you are going then to spain to rough it amid the storms of war and perilous insurrection and with that weak health of yours andwe shall never see you more then miss barton all her gayety gone the dimpling softness become liquid sorrow and the musical ringing voice one wail of woe burst into tearsso i have it on authorityhere was one possibility about to be strangled that made unexpected noise sterlings interview ended in the offer of his hand and the acceptance of itany sacrifice to get rid of this horrid spanish business and save the health and life of a gifted young man so precious to the world and to another  illhealth as often afterwards in sterlings life when the excuse was real enough but not the chief excuse illhealth and insuperable obstacles and engagements had to bear the chief brunt in apologizing and as sterlings actual presence or that of any englishman except boyd and his money was not in the least vital to the adventure his excuse was at once accepted the english connections and subscriptions are a given fact to be presided over by what english volunteers there are and as for englishmen the fewer englishmen that go the larger will be the share of influence for each the other adventurers torrijos among them in due readiness moved silently one by one down to deal sterling superintending the naval hands on board their ship in the thames was to see the last finish given to everything in that department then on the set evening to drop down quietly to deal and there say andad con dios and return  behold just before the set evening came the spanish envoy at this court has got notice of what is going on the spanish envoy and of course the british foreign secretary and of course also the thames police armed men spring suddenly on board one day while sterling is there declare the ship seized and embargoed in the kings name nobody on board to stir till he has given some account of himself in due time and place huge consternation naturally from stem to stern sterling whose presence of mind seldom forsook him casts his eye over the river and its craft sees a wherry privately signals it drops rapidly on board of it stop fiercely interjects the marine policeman from the ships deckwhy stop what use have you for me or i for you and the oars begin playingstop or ill shoot you cries the marine policeman drawing a pistolno you wonti willif you do youll be hanged at the next maidstone assizes then thats alland sterlings wherry shot rapidly ashore and out of this perilous adventure  that same night he posted down to deal disclosed to the torrijos party what catastrophe had come no passage spainward from the thames well if arrestment do not suddenly come from the thames it was on this occasion i suppose that the passage in the open boat to st valery occurredspeedy flight in what boat or boats open or shut could be got at deal on the sudden sterling himself according to hares authority actually went with them so far enough they got shipping as private passengers in one craft or the other and by degrees or at once arrived all at gibraltarboyd one or two young democrats of regent street the fifty picked spaniards and torrijossafe though without arms still in the early part of the year    chapter xi marriage illhealth westindies  sterlings outlooks and occupations now that his spanish friends were gone must have been of a rather miscellaneous confused description he had the enterprise of a married life close before him and as yet no profession no fixed pursuit whatever his health was already very threatening often such as to disable him from present activity and occasion the gravest apprehensions practically blocking up all important courses whatsoever and rendering the future if even life were lengthened and he had any future an insolubility for him parliament was shut public life was shut literatureif alas any solid fruit could lie in literature  or perhaps ones health would mend after all and many things be better than was hoped sterling was not of a despondent temper or given in any measure to lie down and indolently moan i fancy he walked briskly enough into this tempestuouslooking future not heeding too much its thunderous aspects doing swiftly for the day what his hand found to do arthur coningsby i suppose lay on the anvil at present visits to coleridge were now again more possible grand news from torrijos might be looked for though only small yet camenay here in the hot july is france at least all thrown into volcano again here are the miraculous three days heralding in thunder great things to torrijos and others filling with babblement and vaticination the mouths and hearts of all democratic men  so rolled along in tumult of chaotic remembrance and uncertain hope in manifold emotion and the confused struggle for sterling as for the world to extricate the new from the falling ruins of the old the summer and autumn of 1830 from gibraltar and torrijos the tidings were vague unimportant and discouraging attempt on cadiz attempt on the lines of st roch those attempts or rather resolutions to attempt had died in the birth or almost before it men blamed torrijos little knowing his impediments boyd was still patient at his post others of the young english on the strength of the subscribed moneys were said to be thinking of toursperhaps in the sierra morena and neighboring quixote regions from that torrijos enterprise it did not seem that anything considerable would come   on the edge of winter here at home sterling was married at christchurch marylebone 2d november 1830 say the records his blooming kindly and truehearted wife had not much money nor had he as yet any but friends on both sides were bountiful and hopeful had made up for the young couple the foundations of a modestly effective household and in the future there lay more substantial prospects on the finance side sterling never had anything to suffer his wife though somewhat languid and of indolent humor was a graceful piousminded honorable and affectionate woman she could not much support him in the evershifting struggles of his life but she faithfully attended him in them and loyally marched by his side through the changes and nomadic pilgrimings of which many were appointed him in his short course  unhappily a few weeks after his marriage and before any household was yet set up he fell dangerously ill worse in health than he had ever yet been so many agitations crowded into the last few months had been too much for him he fell into dangerous pulmonary illness sank ever deeper lay for many weeks in his fathers house utterly prostrate his young wife and his mother watching over him friends sparingly admitted long despairing of his life all prospects in this world were now apparently shut upon him  after a while came hope again and kindlier symptoms but the doctors intimated that there lay consumption in the question and that perfect recovery was not to be looked for for weeks he had been confined to bed it was several months before he could leave his sickroom where the visits of a few friends had much cheered him and now when delivered readmitted to the air of day againweak as he was and with such a liability still lurking in himwhat his young partner and he were to do or whitherward to turn for a good course of life was by no means too apparent   one of his mother mrs edward sterlings uncles a coningham from derry had in the course of his industrious and adventurous life realized large property in the west indiesa valuable sugarestate with its equipments in the island of st vincentfrom which mrs sterling and her family were now and had been for some years before her uncles decease deriving important benefits i have heard it was then worth some ten thousand pounds a year to the parties interested anthony sterling john and another a cousin of theirs were ultimately to be heirs in equal proportions the old gentleman always kind to his kindred and a brave and solid man though somewhat abrupt in his ways had lately died leaving a settlement to this effect not without some intricacies and almost caprices in the conditions attached  this property which is still a valuable one was sterlings chief pecuniary outlook for the distant future of course it well deserved taking care of and if the eye of the master were upon it of course too according to the adage the cattle would fatten better as the warm climate was favorable to pulmonary complaints and sterlings occupations were so shattered to pieces and his outlooks here so waste and vague why should not he undertake this duty for himself and others  it was fixed upon as the eligiblest course a visit to st vincent perhaps a permanent residence there he went into the project with his customary impetuosity his young wife cheerfully consenting and all manner of new hopes clustering round it there are the rich tropical sceneries the romance of the torrid zone with its new skies and seas and lands there are blacks and the slavery question to be investigated there are the bronzed whites and yellows and their strange new way of life by all means let us go and tryarrangements being completed so soon as his strength had sufficiently recovered and the harsh spring winds had sufficiently abated sterling with his small household set sail for st vincent and arrived without accident his first child a son edward now living and grown to manhood was born there at brighton in the island of st vincent in the fall of that year 1831    chapter xii island of st vincent  sterling found a pleasant residence with all its adjuncts ready for him at colonarie in this volcanic isle under the hot sun an interesting isle a place of rugged chasms precipitous gnarled heights and the most fruitful hollows shaggy everywhere with luxuriant vegetation set under magnificent skies in the mirror of the summer seas offering everywhere the grandest sudden outlooks and contrasts his letters represent a placidly cheerful riding life a pensive humor but the thunderclouds all sleeping in the distance good relations with a few neighboring planters indifference to the noisy political and other agitations of the rest friendly by no means romantic appreciation of the blacks quiet prosperity economic and domestic on the whole a healthy and recommendable way of life with literature very much in abeyance in it  he writes to mr hare date not given the landscapes around me here are noble and lovely as any that can be conceived on earth how indeed could it be otherwise in a small island of volcanic mountains far within the tropics and perpetually covered with the richest vegetation the moral aspect of things is by no means so good but neither is that without its fair features so far as i see the slaves here are cunning deceitful and idle without any great aptitude for ferocious crimes and with very little scruple at committing others but i have seen them much only in very favorable circumstances they are as a body decidedly unfit for freedom and if left as at present completely in the hands of their masters will never become so unless through the agency of the methodists 9  in the autumn came an immense hurricane with new and indeed quite perilous experiences of westindian life this hasty letter addressed to his mother is not intrinsically his remarkablest from st vincent but the body of fact delineated in it being so much the greatest we will quote it in preference a westindian tornado as john sterling witnesses it and with vivid authenticity describes it may be considered worth looking at         to mrs sterling south place knightsbridge london                             brighton st vincent 28th august 1831  my dear motherthe packet came in yesterday bringing me some newspapers a letter from my father and one from anthony with a few lines from you i wrote some days ago a hasty note to my father on the chance of its reaching you through grenada sooner than any communication by the packet and in it i spoke of the great misfortune which had befallen this island and barbadoes but from which all those you take an interest in have happily escaped unhurt  from the day of our arrival in the west indies until thursday the 11th instant which will long be a memorable day with us i had been doing my best to get ourselves established comfortably and i had at last bought the materials for making some additions to the house but on the morning i have mentioned all that i had exerted myself to do nearly all the property both of susan and myself and the very house we lived in were suddenly destroyed by a visitation of providence far more terrible than any i have ever witnessed  when susan came from her room to breakfast at eight oclock i pointed out to her the extraordinary height and violence of the surf and the singular appearance of the clouds of heavy rain sweeping down the valleys before us at this time i had so little apprehension of what was coming that i talked of riding down to the shore when the storm should abate as i had never seen so fierce a sea in about a quarter of an hour the housenegroes came in to close the outside shutters of the windows they knew that the plantaintrees about the negro houses had been blown down in the night and had told the maidservant tyrrell but i had heard nothing of it a very few minutes after the closing of the windows i found that the shutters of tyrrells room at the south and commonly the most sheltered end of the house were giving way i tried to tie them but the silk handkerchief which i used soon gave way and as i had neither hammer boards nor nails in the house i could do nothing more to keep out the tempest i found in pushing at the leaf of the shutter that the wind resisted more as if it had been a stone wall or a mass of iron than a mere current of air there were one or two people outside trying to fasten the windows and i went out to help but we had no tools at hand one man was blown down the hill in front of the house before my face and the other and myself had great difficulty in getting back again inside the door the rain on my face and hands felt like so much small shot from a gun there was great exertion necessary to shut the door of the house  the windows at the end of the large room were now giving way and i suppose it was about nine oclock when the hurricane burst them in as if it had been a discharge from a battery of heavy cannon the shutters were first forced open and the wind fastened them back to the wall and then the panes of glass were smashed by the mere force of the gale without anything having touched them even now i was not at all sure the house would go my books i saw were lost for the rain poured past the bookcases as if it had been the colonarie river but we carried a good deal of furniture into the passage at the entrance we set susan there on a sofa and the black housekeeper was even attempting to get her some breakfast the house however began to shake so violently and the rain was so searching that she could not stay there long she went into her own room and i stayed to see what could be done  under the forepart of the house there are cellars built of stone but not arched to these however there was no access except on the outside and i knew from my own experience that susan could not have gone a step beyond the door without being carried away by the storm and probably killed on the spot the only chance seemed to be that of breaking through the floor but when the old cook and myself resolved on this we found that we had no instrument with which it would be possible to do it it was now clear that we had only god to trust in the front windows were giving way with successive crashes and the floor shook as you may have seen a carpet on a gusty day in london i went into our bedroom where i found susan tyrrell and a little colored girl of seven or eight years old and told them that we should probably not be alive in half an hour i could have escaped if i had chosen to go alone by crawling on the ground either into the kitchen a separate stone building at no great distance or into the open fields away from trees or houses but susan could not have gone a yard she became quite calm when she knew the worst and she sat on my knee in what seemed the safest corner of the room while every blast was bringing nearer and nearer the moment of our seemingly certain destruction  the house was under two parallel roofs and the one next the sea which sheltered the other and us who were under the other went off i suppose about ten oclock after my old plan i will give you a sketch from which you may perceive how we were situated        in print a figure representing a floorplan appears here  the a a are the windows that were first destroyed b went next my books were between the windows b and on the wall opposite to them the lines c and d mark the directions of the two roofs e is the room in which we were and 2 is a plan of it on a larger scale look now at 2 a is the bed c c the two wardrobes b the corner in which we were i was sitting in an armchair holding my wife and tyrrell and the little black child were close to us we had given up all notion of surviving and only waited for the fall of the roof to perish together  before long the roof went most of the materials however were carried clear away one of the large couples was caught on the bedpost marked d and held fast by the iron spike while the end of it hung over our heads had the beam fallen an inch on either side of the bedpost it must necessarily have crushed us the walls did not go with the roof and we remained for half an hour alternately praying to god and watching them as they bent creaked and shivered before the storm  tyrrell and the child when the roof was off made their way through the remains of the partition to the outer door and with the help of the people who were looking for us got into the kitchen a good while after they were gone and before we knew anything of their fate a negro suddenly came upon us and the sight of him gave us a hope of safety when the people learned that we were in danger and while their own huts were flying about their ears they crowded to help us and the old cook urged them on to our rescue he made five attempts after saving tyrrell to get to us and four times he was blown down the fifth time he and the negro we first saw reached the house the space they had to traverse was not above twenty yards of level ground if so much in another minute or two the overseers and a crowd of negroes most of whom had come on their hands and knees were surrounding us and with their help susan was carried round to the end of the house where they broke open the cellar window and placed her in comparative safety the force of the hurricane was by this time a good deal diminished or it would have been impossible to stand before it  but the wind was still terrific and the rain poured into the cellars through the floor above susan tyrrell and a crowd of negroes remained under it for more than two hours and i was long afraid that the wet and cold would kill her if she did not perish more violently happily we had wine and spirits at hand and she was much nerved by a tumbler of claret as soon as i saw her in comparative security i went off with one of the overseers down to the works where the greater number of the negroes were collected that we might see what could be done for them they were wretched enough but no one was hurt and i ordered them a dram apiece which seemed to give them a good deal of consolation  before i could make my way back the hurricane became as bad as at first and i was obliged to take shelter for half an hour in a ruined negro house this however was the last of its extreme violence by one oclock even the rain had in a great degree ceased and as only one room of the house the one marked f was standing and that ricketyi had susan carried in a chair down the hill to the hospital where in a small paved unlighted room she spent the next twentyfour hours she was far less injured than might have been expected from such a catastrophe  next day i had the passage at the entrance of the house repaired and roofed and we returned to the ruins of our habitation still encumbered as they were with the wreck of almost all we were possessed of the walls of the part of the house next the sea were carried away in less i think than half an hour after we reached the cellar when i had leisure to examine the remains of the house i found the floor strewn with fragments of the building and with broken furniture and our books all soaked as completely as if they had been for several hours in the sea  in the course of a few days i had the other room g which is under the same roof as the one saved rebuilt and susan stayed in this temporary abode for a weekwhen we left colonarie and came to brighton mr munros kindness exceeds all precedent we shall certainly remain here till my wife is recovered from her confinement in the mean while we shall have a new house built in which we hope to be well settled before christmas  the roof was half blown off the kitchen but i have had it mended already the other offices were all swept away the gig is much injured and my horse received a wound in the fall of the stable from which he will not be recovered for some weeks in the mean time i have no choice but to buy another as i must go at least once or twice a week to colonarie besides business in town as to our own comforts we can scarcely expect ever to recover from the blow that has now stricken us no money would repay me for the loss of my books of which a large proportion had been in my hands for so many years that they were like old and faithful friends and of which many had been given me at different times by the persons in the world whom i most value  but against all this i have to set the preservation of our lives in a way the most awfully providential and the safety of every one on the estate and i have also the great satisfaction of reflecting that all the negroes from whom any assistance could reasonably be expected behaved like so many heroes of antiquity risking their lives and limbs for us and our property while their own poor houses were flying like chaff before the hurricane there are few white people here who can say as much for their black dependents and the force and value of the relation between master and slave has been tried by the late calamity on a large scale  great part of both sides of this island has been laid completely waste the beautiful wide and fertile plain called the charib country extending for many miles to the north of colonarie and formerly containing the finest sets of works and best dwellinghouses in the island is i am told completely desolate on several estates not a roof even of a negro hut standing in the embarrassed circumstances of many of the proprietors the ruin is i fear irreparableat colonarie the damage is serious but by no means desperate the crop is perhaps injured ten or fifteen per cent the roofs of several large buildings are destroyed but these we are already supplying and the injuries done to the cottages of the negroes are by this time nearly if not quite remedied  indeed all that has been suffered in st vincent appears nothing when compared with the appalling loss of property and of human lives at barbadoes there the town is little but a heap of ruins and the corpses are reckoned by thousands while throughout the island there are not i believe ten estates on which the buildings are standing the elliotts from whom we have heard are living with all their family in a tent and may think themselves wonderfully saved when whole families round them were crushed at once beneath their houses hugh barton the only officer of the garrison hurt has broken his arm and we know nothing of his prospects of recovery the more horrible misfortune of barbadoes is partly to be accounted for by the fact of the hurricane having begun there during the night the flatness of the surface in that island presented no obstacle to the wind which must however i think have been in itself more furious than with us no other island has suffered considerably  i have told both my uncle and anthony that i have given you the details of our recent historywhich are not so pleasant that i should wish to write them again perhaps you will be good enough to let them see this as soon as you and my father can spare it i am ever dearest mother                      your grateful and affectionate                                                       john sterling  this letter i observe is dated 28th august 1831 which is otherwise a day of mark to the world and methe poet goethes last birthday while sterling sat in the tropical solitudes penning this history little european weimar had its carriages and statecarriages busy on the streets and was astir with compliments and visitingcards doing its best as heretofore on behalf of a remarkable day and was not for centuries or tens of centuries to see the like of it again   at brighton the hospitable home of those munros our friends continued for above two months their first child edward as above noticed was born here 14th october 1831and now the poor lady safe from all her various perils could return to colonarie under good auspices  it was in this year that i first heard definitely of sterling as a contemporary existence and laid up some note and outline of him in my memory as of one whom i might yet hope to know john mill mrs austin and perhaps other friends spoke of him with great affection and much pitying admiration and hoped to see him home again under better omens from over the seas as a gifted amiable being of a certain radiant tenuity and velocity too thin and rapid and diffusive in danger of dissipating himself into the vague or alas into death itself it was so that like a spot of bright colors rather than a portrait with features he hung occasionally visible in my imagination    chapter xiii a catastrophe  the ruin of his house had hardly been repaired when there arrived out of europe tidings which smote as with a still more fatal hurricane on the four corners of his inner world and awoke all the old thunders that lay asleep on his horizon there tidings at last of a decisive nature from gibraltar and the spanish democrat adventure this is what the newspapers had to reportthe catastrophe at once the details by degreesfrom spain concerning that affair in the beginning of the new year 1832  torrijos as we have seen had hitherto accomplished as good as nothing except disappointment to his impatient followers and sorrow and regret to himself poor torrijos on arriving at gibraltar with his wild band and coming into contact with the rough fact had found painfully how much his imagination had deceived him the fact lay round him haggard and ironbound flatly refusing to be handled according to his scheme of it no spanish soldiery nor citizenry showed the least disposition to join him on the contrary the official spaniards of that coast seemed to have the watchfulest eye on all his movements nay it was conjectured they had spies in gibraltar who gathered his very intentions and betrayed them this small project of attack and then that other proved futile or was abandoned before the attempt torrijos had to lie painfully within the lines of gibraltarhis poor followers reduced to extremity of impatience and distress the british governor too though not unfriendly to him obliged to frown as for the young cantabs they as was said had wandered a little over the south border of romantic spain had perhaps seen seville cadiz with picturesque views since not with belligerent ones and their money being done had now returned home so had it lasted for eighteen months  the french three days breaking out had armed the guerrillero mina armed all manner of democratic guerrieros and guerrilleros and considerable clouds of invasion from spanish exiles hung minatory over the north and northeast of spain supported by the newborn french democracy so far as privately possible these torrijos had to look upon with inexpressible feelings and take no hand in supporting from the south these also he had to see brushed away successively abolished by official generalship and to sit within his lines in the painfulest manner unable to do anything the fated gallantminded but too headlong man at length the british governor himself was obliged in official decency and as is thought on repeated remonstrance from his spanish official neighbors to signify how indecorous improper and impossible it was to harbor within ones lines such explosive preparations once they were discovered against allies in full peace with usthe necessity in fact there was for the matter ending it is said he offered torrijos and his people passports and british protection to any country of the world except spain torrijos did not accept the passports spoke of going peaceably to this place or to that promised at least what he saw and felt to be clearly necessary that he would soon leave gibraltar and he did soon leave it he and his boyd alone of the englishmen being now with him  it was on the last night of november 1831 that they all set forth torrijos with fiftyfive companions and in two small vessels committed themselves to their nighdesperate fortune no sentry or official person had noticed them it was from the spanish consul next morning that the british governor first heard they were gone the british governor knew nothing of them but apparently the spanish officials were much better informed spanish guardships instantly awake gave chase to the two small vessels which were making all sail towards malaga and on shore all manner of troops and detached parties were in motion to render a retreat to gibraltar by land impossible  crowd all sail for malaga then there perhaps a regiment will join us thereor if not we are but lost fancy need not paint a more tragic situation than that of torrijos the unfortunate gallant man in the gray of this morning first of december 1831his last free morning noble game is afoot afoot at last and all the hunters have him in their toilsthe guardships gain upon torrijos he cannot even reach malaga has to run ashore at a place called fuengirola not far from that citythe guardships seizing his vessels so soon as he is disembarked the country is all up troops scouring the coast everywhere no possibility of getting into malaga with a party of fiftyfive he takes possession of a farmstead ingles the place is called barricades himself there but is speedily beleaguered with forces hopelessly superior he demands to treat is refused all treaty is granted six hours to consider shall then either surrender at discretion or be forced to do it of course he does it having no alternative and enters malaga a prisoner all his followers prisoners here had the torrijos enterprise and all that was embarked upon it finally arrived  express is sent to madrid express instantly returns military execution on the instant give them shriving if they want it that done fusillade them all so poor torrijos and his followers the whole fiftysix of them robert boyd included meet swift death in malaga in such manner rushes down the curtain on them and their affair they vanish thus on a sudden rapt away as in black clouds of fate poor boyd sterlings cousin pleaded his british citizenship to no purpose it availed only to his dead body this was delivered to the british consul for interment and only this poor madam torrijos hearing at paris where she now was of her husbands capture hurries towards madrid to solicit mercy whither also messengers from lafayette and the french government were hurrying on the like errand at bayonne news met the poor lady that it was already all over that she was now a widow and her husband hidden from her foreversuch was the handsel of the new year 1832 for sterling in his westindian solitudes   sterlings friends never heard of these affairs indeed we were all secretly warned not to mention the name of torrijos in his hearing which accordingly remained strictly a forbidden subject his misery over this catastrophe was known in his own family to have been immense he wrote to his brother anthony i hear the sound of that musketry it is as if the bullets were tearing my own brain to figure in ones sick and excited imagination such a scene of fatal manhunting lost valor hopelessly captured and massacred and to add to it that the victims are not men merely that they are noble and dear forms known lately as individual friends what a dance of the furies and wildpealing deadmarch is this for the mind of a loving generous and vivid man torrijos getting ashore at fuengirola robert boyd and others ranked to die on the esplanade at malaganay had not sterling too been the innocent yet heedless means of boyds embarking in this enterprise by his own kinsman poor boyd had been witlessly guided into the pitfalls i hear the sound of that musketry it is as if the bullets were tearing my own brain    chapter xiv pause  these thoughts dwelt long with sterling and for a good while i fancy kept possession of the proscenium of his mind madly parading there to the exclusion of all elsecoloring all else with their own black hues he was young rich in the power to be miserable or otherwise and this was his first grand sorrow which had now fallen upon him  an important spiritual crisis coming at any rate in some form had hereby suddenly in a very sad form come no doubt as youth was passing into manhood in these tropical seclusions and higher wants were awakening in his mind and years and reflection were adding new insight and admonition much in his young way of thought and action lay already under ban with him and repentances enough over many things were not wanting but here on a sudden had all repentances as it were dashed themselves together into one grand whirlwind of repentance and his past life was fallen wholly as into a state of reprobation a great remorseful misery had come upon him suddenly as with a sudden lightningstroke it had kindled into conflagration all the ruined structure of his past life such ruin had to blaze and flame round him in the painfulest manner till it went out in black ashes his democratic philosophies and mutinous radicalisms already falling doomed in his thoughts had reached their consummation and final condemnation here it was all so rash imprudent arrogant all that false or but half true inapplicable wholly as a rule of noble conductand it has ended thus woe on it another guidance must be found in life or life is impossible  it is evident sterlings thoughts had already since the old days of the black dragoon much modified themselves we perceive that by mere increase of experience and length of time the opposite and much deeper side of the question which also has its adamantine basis of truth was in turn coming into play and in fine that a philosophy of denial and world illuminated merely by the flames of destruction could never have permanently been the restingplace of such a man those pilgrimings to coleridge years ago indicate deeper wants beginning to be felt and important ulterior resolutions becoming inevitable for him if in your own soul there is any tone of the eternal melodies you cannot live forever in those poor outer transitory grindings and discords you will have to struggle inwards and upwards in search of some diviner home for yourselfcoleridges prophetic moonshine torrijoss sad tragedy those were important occurrences in sterlings life but on the whole there was a big ocean for him with impetuous gulfstreams and a doomed voyage in quest of the atlantis before either of those arose as lights on the horizon as important beaconlights let us count them neverthelesssignaldates they form to us at lowest we may reckon this torrijos tragedy the crisis of sterlings history the turningpoint which modified in the most important and by no means wholly in the most favorable manner all the subsequent stages of it   old radicalism and mutinous audacious ethnicism having thus fallen to wreck and a mere black world of misery and remorse now disclosing itself whatsoever of natural piety to god and man whatsoever of pity and reverence of awe and devout hope was in sterlings heart now awoke into new activity and strove for some due utterance and predominance his letters in these months speak of earnest religious studies and effortsof attempts by prayer and longing endeavor of all kinds to struggle his way into the temple if temple there were and there find sanctuary 10 the realities were grown so haggard life a field of black ashes if there rose no temple anywhere on it why like a fated orestes is man so whipt by the furies and driven madly hither and thither if it is not even that he may seek some shrine and there make expiation and find deliverance  in these circumstances what a scope for coleridges philosophy above all if the bottled moonshine be actually substance ah could one but believe in a church while finding it incredible what is faith what is conviction credibility insight can a thing be at once known for true and known for false reason understanding is there then such an internecine war between these two it was so coleridge imagined it the wisest of existing menno it is not an easy matter according to sir kenelm digby this of getting up your astral spirit of a thing and setting it in action when the thing itself is well burnt to ashes poor sterling poor sons of adam in general in this sad age of cobwebs wornout symbolisms reminiscences and simulacra who can tell the struggles of poor sterling and his pathless wanderings through these things long afterwards in speech with his brother he compared his case in this time to that of a young lady who has tragically lost her lover and is willing to be halfhoodwinked into a convent or in any noble or quasinoble way to escape from a world which has become intolerable   during the summer of 1832 i find traces of attempts towards antislavery philanthropy shadows of extensive schemes in that direction halfdesperate outlooks it is likely towards the refuge of philanthropism as a new chivalry of life these took no serious hold of so clear an intellect but they hovered now and afterwards as daydreams when life otherwise was shorn of aimmirages in the desert which are found not to be lakes when you put your bucket into them one thing was clear the sojourn in st vincent was not to last much longer  perhaps one might get some scheme raised into life in downing street for universal education to the blacks preparatory to emancipating them there were a noble work for a man then again poor mrs sterlings health contrary to his own did not agree with warm moist climates and again c c these were the outer surfaces of the measure the unconscious pretexts under which it showed itself to sterling and was shown by him but the inner heart and determining cause of it as frequently in sterlings life and in all our lives was not these in brief he had had enough of st vincent the strangling oppressions of his soul were too heavy for him there solution lay in europe or might lie not in these remote solitudes of the seawhere no shrine or saints well is to be looked for no communing of pious pilgrims journeying together towards a shrine    chapter xv bonn herstmonceux  after a residence of perhaps fifteen months sterling quitted st vincent and never returned he reappeared at his fathers house to the joy of english friends in august 1832 well improved in health and eager for english news but beyond vague schemes and possibilities considerably uncertain what was next to be done  after no long stay in this scenefinding downing street dead as stone to the slaveeducation and to all other schemeshe went across with his wife and child to germany purposing to make not so much a tour as some loose ramble or desultory residence in that country in the rhineland first of all here was to be hoped the picturesque in scenery which he much affected here the new and true in speculation which he inwardly longed for and wanted greatly more at all events here as readily as elsewhere might a temporary household be struck up under interesting circumstancesi conclude he went across in the spring of 1833 perhaps directly after arthur coningsby had got through the press this novel which as we have said was begun two or three years ago probably on his cessation from the athenaeum and was mainly finished i think before the removal to st vincent had by this time fallen as good as obsolete to his own mind and its destination now whether to the press or to the fire was in some sort a matter at once of difficulty and of insignificance to him at length deciding for the milder alternative he had thrown in some completing touches here and thereespecially as i conjecture a proportion of coleridgean moonshine at the end and so sent it forth  it was in the sunny days perhaps in may or june of this year that arthur coningsby reached my own hand far off amid the heathy wildernesses sent by john mill and i can still recollect the pleasant little episode it made in my solitude there the general impression it left on me which has never since been renewed by a second reading in whole or in part was the certain prefigurement to myself more or less distinct of an opulent genial and sunny mind but misdirected disappointed experienced in miserynay crude and hasty mistaking for a solid outcome from its woes what was only to me a gilded vacuity the hero an ardent youth representing sterling himself plunges into life such as we now have it in these anarchic times with the radical utilitarian or mutinous heathen theory which is the readiest for inquiring souls finds by various courses of adventure utter shipwreck in this lies broken very wretched that is the tragic nodus or apogee of his lifecourse in this mood of mind he clutches desperately towards some new method recognizable as coleridges of laying hand again on the old church which has hitherto been extraneous and as if nonextant to his way of thought makes out by some coleridgean legedermain that there actually is still a church for him that this extant church which he long took for an extinct shadow is not such but a substance upon which he can anchor himself amid the storms of fateand he does so even taking orders in it i think such could by no means seem to me the true or tenable solution here clearly struggling amid the tumults was a lovable young fellowsoul who had by no means yet got to land but of whom much might be hoped if he ever did some of the delineations are highly pictorial flooded with a deep ruddy effulgence betokening much wealth in the crude or the ripe state the hope of perhaps one day knowing sterling was welcome and interesting to me arthur coningsby struggling imperfectly in a sphere high above circulatinglibrary novels gained no notice whatever in that quarter gained i suppose in a few scattered heads some such recognition as the above and there rested sterling never mentioned the name of it in my hearing or would hear it mentioned   in those very days while arthur coningsby was getting read amid the scottish moors in june 1833 sterling at bonn in the rhinecountry fell in with his old tutor and friend the reverend julius hare one with whom he always delighted to communicate especially on such topics as then altogether occupied him a man of cheerful serious character of much approved accomplishment of perfect courtesy surely of much piety in all senses of that word mr hare had quitted his scholastic labors and distinctions some time ago the call or opportunity for taking orders having come and as rector of herstmonceux in sussex a place patrimonially and otherwise endeared to him was about entering under the best omens on a new course of life he was now on his return from rome and a visit of some length to italy such a meeting could not but be welcome and important to sterling in such a mood they had much earnest conversation freely communing on the highest matters especially of sterlings purpose to undertake the clerical profession in which course his reverend friend could not but bid him good speed  it appears sterling already intimated his intention to become a clergyman he would study theology biblicalities perfect himself in the knowledge seemly or essential for his new courseread diligently for a year or two in some good german university then seek to obtain orders that was his plan to which mr hare gave his hearty euge adding that if his own curacy happened then to be vacant he should be well pleased to have sterling in that office so they parted  a year or two of serious reflection in some good german university or anywhere in the world might have thrown much elucidation upon these confused strugglings and purposings of sterlings and probably have spared him some confusion in his subsequent life but the talent of waiting was of all others the one he wanted most impetuous velocity allhoping headlong alacrity what we must call rashness and impatience characterized him in most of his important and unimportant procedures from the purpose to the execution there was usually but one big leap with him a few months after mr hare was gone sterling wrote that his purposes were a little changed by the late meeting at bonn that he now longed to enter the church straightway that if the herstmonceux curacy was still vacant and the rectors kind thought towards him still held he would instantly endeavor to qualify himself for that office  answer being in the affirmative on both heads sterling returned to england took ordersordained deacon at chichester on trinity sunday in 1834 he never became technically priestand so having fitted himself and family with a reasonable house in one of those leafy lanes in quiet herstmonceux on the edge of pevensey level he commenced the duties of his curacy   the bereaved young lady has taken the veil then even so life is growing all so dark and brutal must be redeemed into human if it will continue life some pious heroism to give a human color to life again on any termseven on impossible ones  to such length can transcendental moonshine cast by some morbidly radiating coleridge into the chaos of a fermenting life act magically there and produce divulsions and convulsions and diseased developments so dark and abstruse without lamp or authentic fingerpost is the course of pious genius towards the eternal kingdoms grown no fixed highway more the old spiritual highways and recognized paths to the eternal now all torn up and flung in heaps submerged in unutterable boiling mudoceans of hypocrisy and unbelievability of brutal living atheism and damnable dead putrescent cant surely a tragic pilgrimage for all mortals darkness and the mere shadow of death enveloping all things from pole to pole and in the raging gulfcurrents offering us willowisps for loadstarsintimating that there are no stars nor ever were except certain oldjew ones which have now gone out once more a tragic pilgrimage for all mortals and for the young pious soul winged with genius and passionately seeking land and passionately abhorrent of floating carrion withal more tragical than for anya pilgrimage we must all undertake nevertheless and make the best of with our respective means some arrive a glorious few many must be lostgo down upon the floating wreck which they took for land nay courage these also so far as there was any heroism in them have bequeathed their life as a contribution to us have valiantly laid their bodies in the chasm for us of these also there is no ray of heroism lostand on the whole what else of them could or should be saved at any time courage and ever forward  concerning this attempt of sterlings to find sanctuary in the old church and desperately grasp the hem of her garment in such manner there will at present be many opinions and mine must be recorded here in flat reproval of it in mere pitying condemnation of it as a rash false unwise and unpermitted step nay among the evil lessons of his time to poor sterling i cannot but account this the worst properly indeed as we may say the apotheosis the solemn apology and consecration of all the evil lessons that were in it to him alas if we did remember the divine and awful nature of gods truth and had not so forgotten it as poor doomed creatures never did beforeshould we durst we in our most audacious moments think of wedding it to the worlds untruth which is also like all untruths the devils only in the worlds last lethargy can such things be done and accounted safe and pious fools do you think the living god is a buzzard idol sternly asks milton that you dare address him in this mannersuch darkness thick sluggish clouds of cowardice and oblivious baseness have accumulated on us thickening as if towards the eternal sleep it is not now known what never needed proof or statement before that religion is not a doubt that it is a certaintyor else a mockery and horror that none or all of the many things we are in doubt about and need to have demonstrated and rendered probable can by any alchemy be made a religion for us but are and must continue a baleful quiet or unquiet hypocrisy for us and bringsalvation do we fancy i think it is another thing they will bring and are on all hands visibly bringing this good while   the time then with its deliriums has done its worst for poor sterling into deeper aberration it cannot lead him this is the crowning error happily as beseems the superlative of errors it was a very brief almost a momentary one in june 1834 sterling dates as installed at herstmonceux and is flinging as usual his whole soul into the business successfully so far as outward results could show but already in september he begins to have misgivings and in february following quits it altogetherthe rest of his life being in great part a laborious effort of detail to pick the fragments of it off him and be free of it in soul as well as in title  at this the extreme point of spiritual deflexion and depression when the worlds madness unusually impressive on such a man has done its very worst with him and in all future errors whatsoever he will be a little less mistaken we may close the first part of sterlings life     part ii     chapter i curate  by mr hares account no priest of any church could more fervently address himself to his functions than sterling now did he went about among the poor the ignorant and those that had need of help zealously forwarded schools and beneficences strove with his whole might to instruct and aid whosoever suffered consciously in body or still worse unconsciously in mind he had charged himself to make the apostle paul his model the perils and voyagings and ultimate martyrdom of christian paul in those old ages on the great scale were to be translated into detail and become the practical emblem of christian sterling on the coast of sussex in this new age it would be no longer from jerusalem to damascus writes sterling to arabia to derbe lystra ephesus that he would travel but each house of his appointed parish would be to him what each of those great cities wasa place where he would bend his whole being and spend his heart for the conversion purification elevation of those under his influence the whole man would be forever at work for this purpose head heart knowledge time body possessions all would be directed to this end a high enough model set before onehow to be realizedsterling hoped to realize it to struggle towards realizing it in some small degree this is mr hares report of him  he was continually devising some fresh scheme for improving the condition of the parish his aim was to awaken the minds of the people to arouse their conscience to call forth their sense of moral responsibility to make them feel their own sinfulness their need of redemption and thus lead them to a recognition of the divine love by which that redemption is offered to us in visiting them he was diligent in all weathers to the risk of his own health which was greatly impaired thereby and his gentleness and considerate care for the sick won their affection so that though his stay was very short his name is still after a dozen years cherished by many  how beautiful would sterling be in all this rushing forward like a host towards victory playing and pulsing like sunshine or soft lightning busy at all hours to perform his part in abundant and superabundant measure of that which it was to me personally continues mr hare to have such a fellowlaborer to live constantly in the freest communion with such a friend i cannot speak he came to me at a time of heavy affliction just after i had heard that the brother who had been the sharer of all my thoughts and feelings from childhood had bid farewell to his earthly life at rome and thus he seemed given to me to make up in some sort for him whom i had lost almost daily did i look out for his usual hour of coming to me and watch his tall slender form walking rapidly across the hill in front of my window with the assurance that he was coming to cheer and brighten to rouse and stir me to call me up to some height of feeling or down to some depth of thought his lively spirit responding instantaneously to every impulse of nature and art his generous ardor in behalf of whatever is noble and true his scorn of all meanness of all false pretences and conventional beliefs softened as it was by compassion for the victims of those besetting sins of a cultivated age his neverflagging impetuosity in pushing onward to some unattained point of duty or of knowledge all this along with his gentle almost reverential affectionateness towards his former tutor rendered my intercourse with him an unspeakable blessing and time after time has it seemed to me that his visit had been like a shower of rain bringing down freshness and brightness on a dusty roadside hedge by him too the recollection of these our daily meetings was cherished till the last 11  there are many poor people still at herstmonceux who affectionately remember him mr hare especially makes mention of one good man there in his young days a poor cobbler and now advanced to a much better position who gratefully ascribes this outward and the other improvements in his life to sterlings generous encouragement and charitable care for him such was the curate life at herstmonceux so in those actual leafy lanes on the edge of pevensey level in this new age did our poor new paul on hest of certain oracles diligently study to comport himselfand struggle with all his might not to be a moonshine shadow of the first paul   it was in this summer of 1834month of may shortly after arriving in londonthat i first saw sterlings father a stout broad gentleman of sixty perpendicular in attitude rather showily dressed and of gracious ingenious and slightly elaborate manners it was at mrs austins in bayswater he was just taking leave as i entered so our interview lasted only a moment but the figure of the man as sterlings father had already an interest for me and i remember the time well captain edward sterling as we formerly called him had now quite dropt the military title nobody even of his friends now remembering it and was known according to his wish in political and other circles as mr sterling a private gentleman of some figure over whom hung moreover a kind of mysterious nimbus as the principal or one of the principal writers in the times which gave an interesting chiaroscuro to his character in society a potent profitable but somewhat questionable position of which though he affected and sometimes with anger altogether to disown it and rigorously insisted on the rights of anonymity he was not unwilling to take the honors too the private pecuniary advantages were very undeniable and his reception in the clubs and occasionally in higher quarters was a good deal modelled on the universal belief in it   john sterling at herstmonceux that afternoon and his father here in london would have offered strange contrasts to an eye that had seen them both contrasts and yet concordances they were two very differentlooking men and were following two very different modes of activity that afternoon and yet with a strange family likeness too both in the men and their activities the central impulse in each the faculties applied to fulfil said impulse not at all dissimilaras grew visible to me on farther knowledge    chapter ii not curate  thus it went on for some months at herstmonceux but thus it could not last we said there were already misgivings as to health c in september 12 that was but the fourth month for it had begun only in june the like clouds of misgiving flights of dark vapor chequering more and more the bright sky of this promised land rose heavier and rifer month after month till in february following that is in the eighth month from starting the sky had grown quite overshaded and poor sterling had to think practically of departure from his promised land again finding that the goal of his pilgrimage was not there not there wherever it may be march again therefore the abiding city and post at which we can live and die is still ahead of us it would appear  illhealth was the external cause and to all parties concerned to sterling himself i have no doubt as completely as to any the one determining cause nor was the illhealth wanting it was there in too sad reality and yet properly it was not there as the burden it was there as the last ounce which broke the camels back i take it in this as in other cases known to me illhealth was not the primary cause but rather the ultimate one the summingup of innumerable far deeper conscious and unconscious causesthe cause which could boldly show itself on the surface and give the casting vote such was often sterlings way as one could observe in such cases though the most guileless undeceptive and transparent of men he had a noticeable almost childlike faculty of selfdeception and usually substituted for the primary determining motive and set of motives some ultimate ostensible one and gave that out to himself and others as the ruling impulse for important changes in life as is the way with much more ponderous and deliberate menas is the way in a degree with all men  enough in february 1835 sterling came up to london to consult with his physiciansand in fact in all ways to consider with himself and friendswhat was to be done in regard to this herstmonceux business the oracle of the physicians like that of delphi was not exceedingly determinate but it did bear what was a sufficiently undeniable fact that sterlings constitution with a tendency to pulmonary ailments was illsuited for the office of a preacher that total abstinence from preaching for a year or two would clearly be the safer course to which effect he writes to mr hare with a tone of sorrowful agitation gives up his clerical duties at herstmonceuxand never resumed them there or elsewhere he had been in the church eight months in all a brief section of his life but an important one which colored several of his subsequent years and now strangely colors all his years in the memory of some  this we may account the second grand crisis of his history radicalism not long since had come to its consummation and vanished from him in a tragic manner not by radicalism is the path to human nobleness for me and here now had english priesthood risen like a sun over the waste ruins and extinct volcanoes of his dead radical world with promise of new blessedness and healing under its wings and this too has soon found itself an illusion not by priesthood either lies the way then once more where does the way lieto follow illusions till they burst and vanish is the lot of all new souls who luckily or lucklessly are left to their own choice in starting on this earth the roads are many the authentic fingerposts are fewnever fewer than in this era when in so many senses the waters are out sterling of all men had the quickest sense for nobleness heroism and the human summum bonum the liveliest headlong spirit of adventure and audacity few gifted living men less stubbornness of perseverance illusions in his chase of the summum bonum were not likely to be wanting aberrations and wasteful changes of course were likely to be many it is in the history of such vehement trenchant farshining and yet intrinsically light and volatile souls missioned into this epoch to seek their way there that we best see what a confused epoch it is  this clerical aberrationfor such it undoubtedly was in sterlingwe have ascribed to coleridge and do clearly think that had there been no coleridge neither had this beennor had english puseyism or some other strange enough universal portents been nevertheless let us say farther that it lay partly in the general bearing of the world for such a man this battle universal in our sad epoch of all old things passing away against all things becoming new has its summary and animating heart in that of radicalism against church there as in its flaming core and point of focal splendor does the heroic worth that lies in each side of the quarrel most clearly disclose itself and sterling was the man above many to recognize such worth on both sides natural enough in such a one that the light of radicalism having gone out in darkness for him the opposite splendor should next rise as the chief and invite his loyalty till it also failed in one form or the other such an aberration was not unlikely for him but an aberration especially in this form we may certainly call it no man of sterlings veracity had he clearly consulted his own heart or had his own heart been capable of clearly responding and not been dazzled and bewildered by transient fantasies and theosophic moonshine could have undertaken this function his heart would have answered no thou canst not what is incredible to thee thou shalt not at thy souls peril attempt to believeelsewhither for a refuge or die here go to perdition if thou mustbut not with a lie in thy mouth by the eternal maker no  alas once more how are poor mortals whirled hither and thither in the tumultuous chaos of our era and under the thick smokecanopy which has eclipsed all stars how do they fly now after this poor meteor now after thatsterling abandoned his clerical office in february 1835 having held it and ardently followed it so long as we sayeight calendar months in all   it was on this his february expedition to london that i first saw sterlingat the india house incidentally one afternoon where i found him in company with john mill whom i happened like himself to be visiting for a few minutes the sight of one whose fine qualities i had often heard of lately was interesting enough and on the whole proved not disappointing though it was the translation of dream into fact that is of poetry into prose and showed its unrhymed side withal a loose carelesslooking thin figure in careless dim costume sat in a lounging posture carelessly and copiously talking i was struck with the kindly but restless swiftglancing eyes which looked as if the spirits were all out coursing like a pack of merry eager beagles beating every bush the brow rather sloping in form was not of imposing character though again the head was longish which is always the best sign of intellect the physiognomy in general indicated animation rather than strength  we talked rapidly of various unmemorable things i remember coming on the negroes and noticing that sterlings notion on the slavery question had not advanced into the stage of mine in reference to the question whether an engagement for life on just terms between parties who are fixed in the character of master and servant as the whites and the negroes are is not really better than one from day to dayhe said with a kindly jeer i would have the negroes themselves consulted as to thatand would not in the least believe that the negroes were by no means final or perfect judges of ithis address i perceived was abrupt unceremonious probably not at all disinclined to logic and capable of dashing in upon you like a charge of cossacks on occasion but it was also eminently ingenious social guileless we did all very well together and sterling and i walked westward in company choosing whatever lanes or quietest streets there were as far as knightsbridge where our roads parted talking on moralities theological philosophies arguing copiously but except in opinion not disagreeing  in his notions on such subjects the expected coleridge cast of thought was very visible and he seemed to express it even with exaggeration and in a fearless dogmatic manner identity of sentiment difference of opinion these are the known elements of a pleasant dialogue we parted with the mutual wish to meet againwhich accordingly at his fathers house and at mine we soon repeatedly did and already in the few days before his return to herstmonceux had laid the foundations of a frank intercourse pointing towards pleasant intimacies both with himself and with his circle which in the future were abundantly fulfilled his mother essentially and even professedly scotch took to my wife gradually with a most kind maternal relation his father a gallant showy stirring gentleman the magus of the times had talk and argument ever ready was an interesting figure and more and more took interest in us we had unconsciously made an acquisition which grew richer and wholesomer with every new year and ranks now seen in the pale moonlight of memory and must ever rank among the precious possessions of life  sterlings bright ingenuity and also his audacity velocity and alacrity struck me more and more it was i think on the occasion of a party given one of these evenings at his fathers where i remember john mill john crawford mrs crawford and a number of young and elderly figures of distinctionthat a group having formed on the younger side of the room and transcendentalisms and theologies forming the topic a number of deep things were said in abrupt conversational style sterling in the thick of it for example one sceptical figure praised the church of england in humes phrase as a church tending to keep down fanaticism and recommendable for its very indifferency whereupon a transcendental figure urges him you are afraid of the horses kicking but will you sacrifice all qualities to being safe from that then get a dead horse none comparable to that for not kicking in your stable upon which a laugh with new laughs on other the like occasionsand at last in the fire of some discussion sterling who was unusually eloquent and animated broke out with this wild phrase i could plunge into the bottom of hell if i were sure of finding the devil there and getting him strangled which produced the loudest laugh of all and had to be repeated on mrs crawfords inquiry to the house at large and creating among the elders a kind of silent shudderthough we urged that the feat would really be a good investment of human industrychecked or stopt these theologic thunders for the evening i still remember sterling as in one of his most animated moods that evening he probably returned to herstmonceux next day where he proposed yet to reside for some indefinite time  arrived at herstmonceux he had not forgotten us one of his letters written there soon after was the following which much entertained me in various ways it turns on a poor book of mine called sartor resartus which was not then even a book but was still hanging desolately under bibliopolic difficulties now in its fourth or fifth year on the wrong side of the river as a mere aggregate of magazine articles having at last been slit into that form and lately completed so and put together into legibility i suppose sterling had borrowed it of me the adventurous hunter spirit which had started such a bemired auerochs or urus of the german woods and decided on chasing that as game struck me not a littleand the poor woodox so bemired in the forests took it as a compliment rather               to thomas carlyle esq chelsea london                             herstmonceux near battle 29th may 1835  my dear carlylei have now read twice with care the wondrous account of teufelsdrockh and his opinions and i need not say that it has given me much to think of it falls in with the feelings and tastes which were for years the ruling ones of my life but which you will not be angry with me when i say that i am infinitely and hourly thankful for having escaped from not that i think of this state of mind as one with which i have no longer any concern the sense of a oneness of life and power in all existence and of a boundless exuberance of beauty around us to which most men are wellnigh dead is a possession which no one that has ever enjoyed it would wish to lose when to this we add the deep feeling of the difference between the actual and the ideal in nature and still more in man and bring in to explain this the principle of duty as that which connects us with a possible higher state and sets us in progress towards itwe have a cycle of thoughts which was the whole spiritual empire of the wisest pagans and which might well supply food for the wide speculations and richly creative fancy of teufelsdrockh or his prototype jean paul  how then comes it we cannot but ask that these ideas displayed assuredly with no want of eloquence vivacity or earnestness have found unless i am much mistaken so little acceptance among the best and most energetic minds in this country in a country where millions read the bible and thousands shakspeare where wordsworth circulates through bookclubs and drawingrooms where there are innumerable admirers of your favorite burns and where coleridge by sending from his solitude the voice of earnest spiritual instruction came to be beloved studied and mourned for by no small or careless school of disciplesto answer this question would of course require more thought and knowledge than i can pretend to bring to it but there are some points on which i will venture to say a few words  in the first place as to the form of compositionwhich may be called i think the rhapsodicoreflective in this the sartor resartus resembles some of the masterworks of human invention which have been acknowledged as such by many generations and especially the works of rabelais montaigne sterne and swift there is nothing i know of in antiquity like it that which comes nearest is perhaps the platonic dialogue but of this although there is something of the playful and fanciful on the surface there is in reality neither in the language which is austerely determined to its end nor in the method and progression of the work any of that headlong selfasserting capriciousness which if not discernible in the plan of teufelsdrockhs memoirs is yet plainly to be seen in the structure of the sentences the lawless oddity and strange heterogeneous combination and allusion the principle of this difference observable often elsewhere in modern literature for the same thing is to be found more or less in many of our most genial works of imaginationdon quixote for instance and the writings of jeremy taylor seems to be that wellknown one of the predominant objectivity of the pagan mind while among us the subjective has risen into superiority and brought with it in each individual a multitude of peculiar associations and relations these as not explicable from any one external principle assumed as a premise by the ancient philosopher were rejected from the sphere of his aesthetic creation but to us they all have a value and meaning being connected by the bond of our own personality and all alike existing in that infinity which is its arena  but however this may be and comparing the teufelsdrockhean epopee only with those other modern worksit is noticeable that rabelais montaigne and sterne have trusted for the currency of their writings in a great degree to the use of obscene and sensual stimulants rabelais besides was full of contemporary and personal satire and seems to have been a champion in the great cause of his timeas was montaigne alsothat of the right of thought in all competent minds unrestrained by any outward authority montaigne moreover contains more pleasant and lively gossip and more distinct goodhumored painting of his own character and daily habits than any other writer i know sterne is never obscure and never moral and the costume of his subjects is drawn from the familiar experience of his own time and country and swift again has the same merit of the clearest perspicuity joined to that of the most homely unaffected forcible english these points of difference seem to me the chief ones which bear against the success of the sartor on the other hand there is in teufelsdrockh a depth and fervor of feeling and a power of serious eloquence far beyond that of any of these four writers and to which indeed there is nothing at all comparable in any of them except perhaps now and then and very imperfectly in montaigne  of the other points of comparison there are two which i would chiefly dwell on and first as to the language a good deal of this is positively barbarous environment vestural stertorous visualized complected and others to be found i think in the first twenty pagesare words so far as i know without any authority some of them contrary to analogy and none repaying by their value the disadvantage of novelty to these must be added new and erroneous locutions whole other tissues for all the other and similar uses of the word whole orients for pearls lucid and lucent employed as if they were different in meaning hulls perpetually for coverings it being a word hardly used and then only for the husk of a nut to insure a man of misapprehension talented a mere newspaper and hustings word invented i believe by oconnell  i must also mention the constant recurrence of some words in a quaint and queer connection which gives a grotesque and somewhat repulsive mannerism to many sentences of these the commonest offender is quite which appears in almost every page and gives at first a droll kind of emphasis but soon becomes wearisome nay manifold cunning enough significance faculty meaning a mans rational or moral power special not without haunt the reader as if in some uneasy dream which does not rise to the dignity of nightmare some of these strange mannerisms fall under the general head of a singularity peculiar so far as i know to teufelsdrockh for instance that of the incessant use of a sort of odd superfluous qualification of his assertions which seems to give the character of deliberateness and caution to the style but in time sounds like mere trick or involuntary habit almost does more than yeomans almost slaves service in this way something similar may be remarked of the use of the double negative by way of affirmation  under this head of language may be mentioned though not with strict grammatical accuracy two standing characteristics of the professors styleat least as rendered into english first the composition of words such as snowandrosebloom maiden an attractive damsel doubtless in germany but with all her charms somewhat uncouth here lifevision is another example and many more might be found to say nothing of the innumerable cases in which the words are only intelligible as a compound term though not distinguished by hyphens of course the composition of words is sometimes allowable even in english but the habit of dealing with german seems to have produced in the pages before us a prodigious superabundance of this form of expression which gives harshness and strangeness where the matter would at all events have been surprising enough secondly i object with the same qualification to the frequent use of inversion which generally appears as a transposition of the two members of a clause in a way which would not have been practiced in conversation it certainly gives emphasis and force and often serves to point the meaning but a style may be fatiguing and faulty precisely by being too emphatic forcible and pointed and so straining the attention to find its meaning or the admiration to appreciate its beauty  another class of considerations connects itself with the heightened and plethoric fulness of the style its accumulation and contrast of imagery its occasional jerking and almost spasmodic violenceand above all the painful subjective excitement which seems the element and groundwork even of every description of nature often taking the shape of sarcasm or broad jest but never subsiding into calm there is also a point which i should think worth attending to were i planning any similar book i mean the importance in a work of imagination of not too much disturbing in the readers mind the balance of the new and old the former addresses itself to his active the latter to his passive faculty and these are mutually dependent and must coexist in certain proportion if you wish to combine his sympathy and progressive exertion with willingness and ease of attention this should be taken into account in forming a style for of course it cannot be consciously thought of in composing each sentence  but chiefly it seems important in determining the plan of a work if the tone of feeling the line of speculation are out of the common way and sure to present some difficulty to the average reader then it would probably be desirable to select for the circumstances drapery and accessories of all kinds those most familiar or at least most attractive a fable of the homeliest purport and commonest everyday application derives an interest and charm from its turning on the characters and acts of gods and genii lions and foxes arabs and affghauns on the contrary for philosophic inquiry and truths of awful preciousness i would select as my personages and interlocutors beings with whose language and whereabouts my readers would be familiar thus did plato in his dialogues christ in his parables therefore it seems doubtful whether it was judicious to make a german professor the hero of sartor berkeley began his siris with tarwater but what can english readers be expected to make of gukguk by way of prelibation to your nectar and tokay the circumstances and details do not flash with living reality on the minds of your readers but on the contrary themselves require some of that attention and minute speculation the whole original stock of which in the minds of most of them would not be too much to enable them to follow your views of man and nature in short there is not a sufficient basis of the common to justify the amount of peculiarity in the work in a book of science these considerations would of course be inapplicable but then the whole shape and coloring of the book must be altered to make it such and a man who wishes merely to get at the philosophical result or summary of the whole will regard the details and illustrations as so much unprofitable surplusage  the sense of strangeness is also awakened by the marvellous combinations in which the work abounds to a degree that the common reader must find perfectly bewildering this can hardly however be treated as a consequence of the style for the style in this respect coheres with and springs from the whole turn and tendency of thought the noblest images are objects of a humorous smile in a mind which sees itself above all nature and throned in the arms of an almighty necessity while the meanest have a dignity inasmuch as they are trivial symbols of the same one life to which the great whole belongs and hence as i divine the startling whirl of incongruous juxtaposition which of a truth must to many readers seem as amazing as if the pythia on the tripod should have struck up a drinkingsong or thersites had caught the prophetic strain of cassandra  all this of course appears to me true and relevant but i cannot help feeling that it is after all but a poor piece of quackery to comment on a multitude of phenomena without adverting to the principle which lies at the root and gives the true meaning to them all now this principle i seem to myself to find in the state of mind which is attributed to teufelsdrockh in his state of mind i say not in his opinions though these are in him as in all men most importantbeing one of the best indices to his state of mind now what distinguishes him not merely from the greatest and best men who have been on earth for eighteen hundred years but from the whole body of those who have been working forwards towards the good and have been the salt and light of the world is this that he does not believe in a god do not be indignant i am blaming no onebut if i write my thoughts i must write them honestly  teufelsdrockh does not belong to the herd of sensual and thoughtless men because he does perceive in all existence a unity of power because he does believe that this is a real power external to him and dominant to a certain extent over him and does not think that he is himself a shadow in a world of shadows he had a deep feeling of the beautiful the good and the true and a faith in their final victory  at the same time how evident is the strong inward unrest the titanic heaving of mountain on mountain the stormlike rushing over land and sea in search of peace he writhes and roars under his consciousness of the difference in himself between the possible and the actual the hopedfor and the existent he feels that duty is the highest law of his own being and knowing how it bids the waves be stilled into an icy fixedness and grandeur he trusts but with a boundless inward misgiving that there is a principle of order which will reduce all confusion to shape and clearness but wanting peace himself his fierce dissatisfaction fixes on all that is weak corrupt and imperfect around him and instead of a calm and steady cooperation with all those who are endeavoring to apply the highest ideas as remedies for the worst evils he holds himself aloof in savage isolation and cherishes though he dare not own a stern joy at the prospect of that catastrophe which is to turn loose again the elements of mans social life and give for a time the victory to evilin hopes that each new convulsion of the world must bring us nearer to the ultimate restoration of all things fancying that each may be the last wanting the calm and cheerful reliance which would be the spring of active exertion he flatters his own distemper by persuading himself that his own age and generation are peculiarly feeble and decayed and would even perhaps be willing to exchange the restless immaturity of our selfconsciousness and the promise of its long throepangs for the unawakened undoubting simplicity of the worlds childhood of the times in which there was all the evil and horror of our day only with the difference that conscience had not arisen to try and condemn it in these longings if they are teufelsdrockhs he seems to forget that could we go back five thousand years we should only have the prospect of travelling them again and arriving at last at the same point at which we stand now  something of this state of mind i may say that i understand for i have myself experienced it and the root of the matter appears to me a want of sympathy with the great body of those who are now endeavoring to guide and help onward their fellowmen and in what is this alienation grounded it is as i believe simply in the difference on that point viz the clear deep habitual recognition of a one living personal god essentially good wise true and holy the author of all that exists and a reunion with whom is the only end of all rational beings this belief there follow now several pages on personal god and other abstruse or indeed properly unspeakable matters these and a general postscript of qualifying purport i will suppress extracting only the following fractions as luminous or slightly significant to us  now see the difference of teufelsdrockhs feelings at the end of book iii chap 8 i find these words but whence o heaven whither sense knows not faith knows not only that it is through mystery to mystery from god to god                      we are such stuff      as dreams are made of and our little life      is rounded with a sleep  and this tallies with the whole strain of his character what we find everywhere with an abundant use of the name of god is the conception of a formless infinite whether in time or space of a high inscrutable necessity which it is the chief wisdom and virtue to submit to which is the mysterious impersonal base of all existenceshows itself in the laws of every separate beings nature and for man in the shape of duty on the other hand i affirm we do know whence we come and whither we go   and in this state of mind as there is no true sympathy with others just as little is there any true peace for ourselves there is indeed possible the unsympathizing factitious calm of art which we find in goethe but at what expense is it bought simply by abandoning altogether the idea of duty which is the great witness of our personality and he attains his inhuman ghastly calmness by reducing the universe to a heap of material for the idea of beauty to work on   the sum of all i have been writing as to the connection of our faith in god with our feeling towards men and our mode of action may of course be quite erroneous but granting its truth it would supply the one principle which i have been seeking for in order to explain the peculiarities of style in your account of teufelsdrockh and his writings the life and works of luther are the best comment i know of on this doctrine of mine  reading over what i have written i find i have not nearly done justice to my own sense of the genius and moral energy of the book but this is what you will best excusebelieve me most sincerely and faithfully yours                                                        john sterling  here are sufficient points of discrepancy with agreement here is material for talk and argument enough and an expanse of free discussion open which requires rather to be speedily restricted for convenience sake than allowed to widen itself into the boundless as it tends to do  in all sterlings letters to myself and others a large collection of which now lies before me duly copied and indexed there is to one that knew his speech as well a perhaps unusual likeness between the speech and the letters and yet for most part with a great inferiority on the part of these these thrown off one and all of them without premeditation and with most rapidflowing pen are naturally as like his speech as writing can well be this is their grand merit to us but on the other hand the want of the living tones swift looks and motions and manifold dramatic accompaniments tells heavily more heavily than common what can be done with champagne itself much more with sodawater when the gaseous spirit is fled the reader in any specimens he may see must bear this in mind  meanwhile these letters do excel in honesty in candor and transparency their very carelessness secures their excellence in this respect and in another much deeper and more essential respect i must likewise call them excellentin their childlike goodness in the purity of heart the noble affection and fidelity they everywhere manifest in the writer this often touchingly strikes a familiar friend in reading them and will awaken reminiscences when you have the commentary in your own memory which are sad and beautiful and not without reproach to you on occasion to all friends and all good causes this man is true behind their back as before their face the same mansuch traits of the autobiographic sort from these letters as can serve to paint him or his life and promise not to weary the reader i must endeavor to select in the sequel    chapter iii bayswater  sterling continued to reside at herstmonceux through the spring and summer holding by the peaceable retired house he still had there till the vague future might more definitely shape itself and better point out what place of abode would suit him in his new circumstances he made frequent brief visits to london in which i among other friends frequently saw him our acquaintance at each visit improving in all ways like a swift dashing meteor he came into our circle coruscated among us for a day or two with sudden pleasant illumination then again suddenly withdrewwe hoped not for long  i suppose he was full of uncertainties but undoubtedly was gravitating towards london yet on the whole on the surface of him you saw no uncertainties far from that it seemed always rather with peremptory resolutions and swift express businesses that he was charged sickly in body the testimony said but here always was a mind that gave you the impression of peremptory alertness cheery swift decisionof a health which you might have called exuberant i remember dialogues with him of that year one pleasant dialogue under the trees of the park where now in 1851 is the thing called crystal palace with the june sunset flinging long shadows for us the last of the quality just vanishing for dinner and the great night beginning to prophesy of itself our talk like that of the foregoing letter was of the faults of my style of my way of thinking of my c c all which admonitions and remonstrances so friendly and innocent from this young juniorsenior i was willing to listen to though unable as usual to get almost any practical hold of them as usual the garments do not fit you you are lost in the garments or you cannot get into them at all this is not your suit of clothes it must be anothersalas these are not your dimensions these are only the optical angles you subtend on the whole you will never get measured in that way  another time of date probably very contiguous i remember hearing sterling preach it was in some new collegechapel in somersethouse i suppose what is now called kings college a very quiet small place the audience studentlooking youths with a few elder people perhaps mostly friends of the preachers the discourse delivered with a grave sonorous composure and far surpassing in talent the usual run of sermons had withal an air of human veracity as i still recollect and bespoke dignity and piety of mind but gave me the impression rather of artistic excellence than of unction or inspiration in that kind sterling returned with us to chelsea that dayand in the afternoon we went on the thames putneyward together we two with my wife under the sunny skies on the quiet water and with copious cheery talk the remembrance of which is still present enough to me  this was properly my only specimen of sterlings preaching another time late in the same autumn i did indeed attend him one evening to some church in the citya big church behind cheapside built by wren as he carefully informed mebut there in my wearied mood the chief subject of reflection was the almost total vacancy of the place and how an eloquent soul was preaching to mere lamps and prayerbooks and of the sermon i retain no image it came up in the way of banter if he ever urged the duty of church extension which already he very seldom did and at length never what a specimen we once had of bright lamps gilt prayerbooks baizelined pews wrenbuilt architecture and how in almost all directions you might have fired a musket through the church and hit no christian life a terrible outlook indeed for the apostolic laborer in the brickandmortar line   in the autumn of this same 1835 he removed permanently to london whither all summer he had been evidently tending took a house in bayswater an airy suburb half town half country near his fathers and within fair distance of his other friends and objects and decided to await there what the ultimate developments of his course might be his house was in orme square close by the corner of that little place which has only three sides of houses its windows looking to the east the number was and i believe still is no 5 a sufficiently commodious by no means sumptuous small mansion where with the means sure to him he could calculate on finding adequate shelter for his family his books and himself and live in a decent manner in no terror of debt for one thing his income i suppose was not large but he lived generally a safe distance within it and showed himself always as a man bountiful in money matters and taking no thought that way  his studyroom in this house was perhaps mainly the drawingroom looking out safe over the little dingy grassplot in front and the quiet little row of houses opposite with the huge dustwhirl of oxford street and london far enough ahead of you as backgroundas backcurtain blotting out only half your blue hemisphere with dust and smoke on the right you had the continuous growl of the uxbridge road and its wheels coming as lullaby not interruption leftward and rearward after some thin belt of houses lay mere country bright sweeping green expanses crowned by pleasant hampstead pleasant harrow with their rustic steeples rising against the sky here on winter evenings the bustle of removal being all well ended and family and books got planted in their new places friends could find sterling as they often did who was delighted to be found by them and would give and take vividly as few others an hours good talk at any time  his outlooks it must be admitted were sufficiently vague and overshadowed neither the past nor the future of a too joyful kind public life in any professional form is quite forbidden to work with his fellows anywhere appears to be forbidden nor can the humblest solitary endeavor to work worthily as yet find an arena how unfold ones little bit of talent and live and not lie sleeping while it is called today as radical as reforming politician in any public or private formnot only has this in sterlings case received tragical sentence and execution but the opposite extreme the church whither he had fled likewise proves abortive the church also is not the haven for him at all what is to be done something must be done and soonunder penalties whoever has received on him there is an inexorable behest to give fais ton fait do thy little stroke of work this is natures voice and the sum of all the commandments to each man  a shepherd of the people some small agamemnon after his sort doing what little sovereignty and guidance he can in his day and generation such every gifted soul longs and should long to be but how in any measure is the small kingdom necessary for sterling to be attained not through newspapers and parliaments not by rubrics and readingdesks none of the sceptres offered in the worlds marketplace nor none of the crosiers there it seems can be the shepherdscrook for this man a most cheerful hoping man and full of swift faculty though much lamedconsiderably bewildered too and tending rather towards the wastes and solitary places for a home the paved world not being friendly to him hitherto the paved world in fact both on its practical and spiritual side slams to its doors against him indicates that he cannot enter and even must notthat it will prove a chokevault deadly to soul and to body if he enter sceptre crosier sheepcrook is none there for him  there remains one other implement the resource of all adams posterity that are otherwise foiledthe pen it was evident from this point that sterling however otherwise beaten about and set fluctuating would gravitate steadily with all his real weight towards literature that he would gradually try with consciousness to get into literature and on the whole never quit literature which was now all the world for him such is accordingly the sum of his history henceforth such small sum so terribly obstructed and diminished by circumstances is all we have realized from him   sterling had by no means as yet consciously quitted the clerical profession far less the church as a creed we have seen he occasionally officiated still in these months when a friend requested or an opportunity invited nay it turned out afterwards he had unknown even to his own family during a good many weeks in the coldest period of next spring when it was really dangerous for his health and did prove hurtful to itbeen constantly performing the morning service in some chapel in bayswater for a young clerical neighbor a slight acquaintance of his who was sickly at the time so far as i know this of the bayswater chapel in the spring of 1836 a feat severely rebuked by his doctor withal was his last actual service as a churchman but the conscious life ecclesiastical still hung visibly about his inner unconscious and real life for years to come and not till by slow degrees he had unwinded from him the wrappages of it could he become clear about himself and so much as try heartily what his now sole course was alas and he had to live all the rest of his days as in continual flight for his very existence ducking under like a poor unfledged partridgebird as one described it before the mower darting continually from nook to nook and there crouching to escape the scythe of death for literature proper there was but little left in such a life only the smallest broken fractions of his last and heaviestladen years can poor sterling be said to have completely lived his purpose had risen before him slowly in noble clearness clear at lastand even then the inevitable hour was at hand  in those first london months as always afterwards while it remained physically possible i saw much of him loved him as was natural more and more found in him many ways a beautiful acquisition to my existence here he was full of bright speech and argument radiant with arrowy vitalities vivacities and ingenuities less than any man he gave you the idea of illhealth hopeful sanguine nay he did not even seem to need definite hope or much to form any projecting himself in aerial pulses like an aurora borealis like a summer dawn and filling all the world with present brightness for himself and others illhealth nay you found at last it was the very excess of life in him that brought on disease this restless play of being fit to conquer the world could it have been held and guided could not be held it had worn holes in the outer case of it and there found vent for itselfthere since not otherwise  in our many promenades and colloquies which were of the freest most copious and pleasant nature religion often formed a topic and perhaps towards the beginning of our intercourse was the prevailing topic sterling seemed much engrossed in matters theological and led the conversation towards such talked often about church christianity anglican and other how essential the belief in it to man then on the other side about pantheism and such likeall in the coleridge dialect and with eloquence and volubility to all lengths i remember his insisting often and with emphasis on what he called a personal god and other high topics of which it was not always pleasant to give account in the argumentative form in a loud hurried voice walking and arguing through the fields or streets though of warm quick feelings very positive in his opinions and vehemently eager to convince and conquer in such discussions i seldom or never saw the least anger in him against me or any friend when the blows of contradiction came too thick he could with consummate dexterity whisk aside out of their way prick into his adversary on some new quarter or gracefully flourishing his weapon end the duel in some handsome manner one angry glance i remember in him and it was but a glance and gone in a moment flat pantheism urged he once which he would often enough do about this time as if triumphantly of something or other in the fire of a debate in my hearing it is mere pantheism thatand suppose it were pottheism cried the other if the thing is truesterling did look hurt at such flippant heterodoxy for a moment the soul of his own creed in those days was far other than this indifference to pot or pan in such departments of inquiry  to me his sentiments for most part were lovable and admirable though in the logical outcome there was everywhere room for opposition i admired the temper the longing towards antique heroism in this young man of the nineteenth century but saw not how except in some germanenglish empire of the air he was ever to realize it on those terms in fact it became clear to me more and more that here was nobleness of heart striving towards all nobleness here was ardent recognition of the worth of christianity for one thing but no belief in it at all in my sense of the word beliefno belief but one definable as mere theoretic moonshine which would never stand the wind and weather of fact nay it struck me farther that sterlings was not intrinsically nor had ever been in the highest or chief degree a devotional mind of course all excellence in man and worship as the supreme excellence was part of the inheritance of this gifted man but if called to define him i should say artist not saint was the real bent of his being he had endless admiration but intrinsically rather a deficiency of reverence in comparison fear with its corollaries on the religious side he appeared to have none nor ever to have had any  in short it was a strange enough symptom to me of the bewildered condition of the world to behold a man of this temper and of this veracity and nobleness selfconsecrated here by free volition and deliberate selection to be a christian priest and zealously struggling to fancy himself such in very truth undoubtedly a singular present factfrom which as from their point of intersection great perplexities and aberrations in the past and considerable confusions in the future might be seen ominously radiating happily our friend as i said needed little hope today with its activities was always bright and rich to him his unmanageable dislocated devastated world spiritual or economical lay all illuminated in living sunshine making it almost beautiful to his eyes and gave him no hypochondria a richer soul in the way of natural outfit for felicity for joyful activity in this world so far as his strength would go was nowhere to be met with   the letters which mr hare has printed letters addressed i imagine mostly to himself in this and the following year or two give record of abundant changeful plannings and laborings on the part of sterling still chiefly in the theological department translation from tholuck from schleiermacher treatise on this thing then on that are on the anvil it is a life of abstruse vague speculations singularly cheerful and hopeful withal about will morals jonathan edwards jewhood manhood and of books to be written on these topics part of which adventurous vague plans as the translation from tholuck he actually performed other greater part merging always into wider undertakings remained plan merely i remember he talked often about tholuck schleiermacher and others of that stamp and looked disappointed though full of good nature at my obstinate indifference to them and their affairs  his knowledge of german literature very slight at this time limited itself altogether to writers on church mattersevidences counterevidences theologies and rumors of theologies by the tholucks schleiermachers neanders and i know not whom of the true sovereign souls of that literature the goethes richters schillers lessings he had as good as no knowledge and of goethe in particular an obstinate misconception with proper abhorrence appendedwhich did not abate for several years nor quite abolish itself till a very late period till in a word he got goethes works fairly read and studied for himself this was often enough the course with sterling in such cases he had a most swift glance of recognition for the worthy and for the unworthy and was prone in his ardent decisive way to put much faith in it such a one is a worthless idol not excellent only shamexcellent here on this negative side especially you often had to admire how right he wasoften but not quite always and he would maintain with endless ingenuity confidence and persistence his fallacious spectrum to be a real image however it was sure to come all right in the end whatever real excellence he might misknow you had but to let it stand before him soliciting new examination from him none surer than he to recognize it at last and to pay it all his dues with the arrears and interest on them goethe who figures as some absurd highstalking hollow playactor or empty ornamental clockcase of an artist socalled in the tale of the onyx ring was in the throne of sterlings intellectual world before all was done and the theory of goethes want of feeling want of c c appeared to him also abundantly contemptible and forgettable  sterlings days during this time as always were full of occupation cheerfully interesting to himself and others though the wrecks of theology so encumbering him little fruit on the positive side could come of these labors on the negative side they were productive and there also so much of encumbrance requiring removal before fruit could grow there was plenty of labor needed he looked happy as well as busy roamed extensively among his friends and loved to have them about himchiefly old cambridge comrades now settling into occupations in the worldand was felt by all friends by myself as by few to be a welcome illumination in the dim whirl of things a man of altogether social and human ways his address everywhere pleasant and enlivening a certain smile of thin but genuine laughter we might say hung gracefully over all he said and didexpressing gracefully according to the model of this epoch the stoical pococurantism which is required of the cultivated englishman such laughter in him was not deep but neither was it false as lamentably happens often and the cheerfulness it went to symbolize was hearty and beautifulvisible in the silent unsymbolized state in a still gracefuler fashion  of wit so far as rapid lively intellect produces wit he had plenty and did not abuse his endowment that way being always fundamentally serious in the purport of his speech of what we call humor he had some though little nay of real sense for the ludicrous in any form he had not much for a man of his vivacity and you remarked that his laugh was limited in compass and of a clear but not rich quality to the like effect shone something a kind of childlike halfembarrassed shimmer of expression on his fine vivid countenance curiously mingling with its ardors and audacities a beautiful childlike soul he was naturally a favorite in conversation especially with all who had any funds for conversing frank and direct yet polite and delicate withalthough at times too he could crackle with his dexterous petulancies making the air all like needles round you and there was no end to his logic when you excited it no end unless in some form of silence on your part elderly men of reputation i have sometimes known offended by him for he took a frank way in the matter of talk spoke freely out of him freely listening to what others spoke with a kind of hail fellow well met feeling and carelessly measured a men much less by his reputed account in the bank of wit or in any other bank than by what the man had to show for himself in the shape of real spiritual cash on the occasion but withal there was ever a fine element of natural courtesy in sterling his deliberate demeanor to acknowledged superiors was fine and graceful his apologies and the like when in a fit of repentance he felt commanded to apologize were full of naivete and very pretty and ingenuous  his circle of friends was wide enough chiefly men of his own standing old college friends many of them some of whom have now become universally known among whom the most important to him was frederic maurice who had not long before removed to the chaplaincy of guys hospital here and was still as he had long been his intimate and counsellor their views and articulate opinions i suppose were now fast beginning to diverge and these went on diverging far enough but in their kindly union in their perfect trustful familiarity precious to both parties there never was the least break but a steady equable and duly increasing current to the end one of sterlings commonest expeditions in this time was a sally to the other side of london bridge going to guys today maurice in a year or two became sterlings brotherinlaw wedded mrs sterlings younger sistera gentle excellent female soul by whom the relation was in many ways strengthened and beautified for sterling and all friends of the parties with the literary notabilities i think he had no acquaintance his thoughts indeed still tended rather towards a certain class of the clerical but neither had he much to do with these for he was at no time the least of a tufthunter but rather had a marked natural indifference to tufts  the rev mr dunn a venerable and amiable irish gentleman distinguished we were told by having refused a bishopric and who was now living in an opulent enough retirement amid his books and philosophies and friends in londonis memorable to me among this clerical class one of the mildest beautifulest old men i have ever seenlike fenelon sterling said his very face with its kind true smile with its look of suffering cheerfulness and pious wisdom was a sort of benediction it is of him that sterling writes in the extract which mr hare modestly reducing the name to an initial mr d has given us 13 mr dunn for instance the defect of whose theology compounded as it is of the doctrine of the greek fathers of the mystics and of ethical philosophers consistsif i may hint a fault in one whose holiness meekness and fervor would have made him the beloved disciple of him whom jesus lovedin an insufficient apprehension of the reality and depth of sin a characteristic defect of this fine gentle soul on mr dunns death which occurred two or three years later stirling gave in some veiled yet transparent form in blackwoods magazine an affectionate and eloquent notice of him which stript of the veil was excerpted into the newspapers also 14  of coleridge there was little said coleridge was now dead not long since nor was his name henceforth much heard in sterlings circle though on occasion for a year or two to come he would still assert his transcendent admiration especially if maurice were by to help but he was getting into german into various inquiries and sources of knowledge new to him and his admirations and notions on many things were silently and rapidly modifying themselves  so amid interesting human realities and wide cloudcanopies of uncertain speculation which also had their interests and their rainbowcolors to him and could not fail in his life just now did sterling pass his year and half at bayswater such vaporous speculations were inevitable for him at present but it was to be hoped they would subside by and by and leave the sky clear all this was but the preliminary to whatever work might lie in himand alas much other interruption lay between him and that   chapter v to madeira  sterlings dubieties as to continuing at bordeaux were quickly decided the cholera in france the cholera in nice the in fact his moorings were now loose and having been fairly at sea he never could anchor himself here again very shortly after this letter he left belsito again for good as it proved and returned to england with his household there to consider what should next be done  on my return from scotland that year perhaps late in september i remember finding him lodged straitly but cheerfully and in happy humor in a little cottage on blackheath whither his father one day persuaded me to drive out with him for dinner our welcome i can still recollect was conspicuously cordial the place of dinner a kind of upper room half garret and full of books which seemed to be johns place of study from a shelf i remember also the good soul took down a book modestly enough bound in three volumes lettered on the back carlyles french revolution which had been published lately this he with friendly banter bade me look at as a first symptom small but significant that the book was not to die all at once one copy of it at least might hope to last the date of sheepleather i admittedand in my then mood the little fact was welcome our dinner frank and happy on the part of sterling was peppered with abundant jolly satire from his father before tea i took myself away towards woolwich i remember where probably there was another call to make and passage homeward by steamer sterling strode along with me a good bit of road in the bright sunny evening full of lively friendly talk and altogether kind and amiable and beautifully sympathetic with the loads he thought he saw on me forgetful of his own we shook hands on the road near the foot of shooters hillat which point dim oblivious clouds rush down and of small or great i remember nothing more in my history or his for some time  besides running much about among friends and holding counsels for the management of the coming winter sterling was now considerably occupied with literature again and indeed may be said to have already definitely taken it up as the one practical pursuit left for him some correspondence with blackwoods magazine was opening itself under promising omens now and more and more henceforth he began to look on literature as his real employment after all and was prosecuting it with his accustomed loyalty and ardor and he continued ever afterwards in spite of such fitful circumstances and uncertain outward fluctuations as his were sure of being to prosecute it steadily with all the strength he had  one evening about this time he came down to us to chelsea most likely by appointment and with stipulation for privacy and read for our opinion his poem of the sextons daughter which we now first heard of the judgment in this house was friendly but not the most encouraging we found the piece monotonous cast in the mould of wordsworth deficient in real human fervor or depth of melody dallying on the borders of the infantile and goodygoodin fact involved still in the shadows of the surplice and inculcating on hearsay mainly a weak morality which he would one day find not to be moral at all but in good part maudlinhypocritical and immoral as indeed was to be said still of most of his performances especially the poetical a sickly shadow of the parishchurch still hanging over them which he could by no means recognize for sickly imprimatur nevertheless was the concluding wordwith these grave abatements and rhadamanthine admonitions to all which sterling listened seriously and in the mildest humor his reading it might have been added had much hurt the effect of the piece a dreary pulpit or even conventicle manner that flattest moaning hoohoo of predetermined pathos with a kind of rocking canter introduced by way of intonation each stanza the exact fellow of the other and the dull swing of the rockinghorse duly in eachno reading could be more unfavorable to sterlings poetry than his own such a mode of reading and indeed generally in a man of such vivacity the total absence of all gifts for playacting or artistic mimicry in any kind was a noticeable point   after much consultation it was settled at last that sterling should go to madeira for the winter one gray dull autumn afternoon towards the middle of october i remember walking with him to the eastern dock region to see his ship and how the final preparations in his own little cabin were proceeding there a dingy little ship the deck crowded with packages and bustling sailors within eightandforty hours of lifting anchor a dingy chill smoky day as i have said withal and a chaotic element and outlook enough to make a friends heart sad i admired the cheerful careless humor and brisk activity of sterling who took the matter all on the sunny side as he was wont in such cases we came home together in manifold talk he accepted with the due smile my last contribution to his seaequipment a sixpenny box of german lucifers purchased on the sudden in st jamess street fit to be offered with laughter or with tears or with both he was to leave for portsmouth almost immediately and there go on board our next news was of his safe arrival in the temperate isle mrs sterling and the children were left at knightsbridge to pass this winter with his father and mother   at madeira sterling did well improved in health was busy with much literature and fell in with society which he could reckon pleasant he was much delighted with the scenery of the place found the climate wholesome to him in a marked degree and with good news from home and kindly interests here abroad passed no disagreeable winter in that exile there was talking there was writing there was hope of better health he rode almost daily in cheerful busy humor along those fringed shoreroadsbeautiful leafy roads and horsepaths with here and there a wild cataract and bridge to look at and always with the soft sky overhead the dead volcanic mountain on one hand and broad illimitable sea spread out on the other here are two letters which give reasonably good account of him               to thomas carlyle esq chelsea london                                funchal madeira 16th november 1837  my dear carlylei have been writing a good many letters all in a batch to go by the same opportunity and i am thoroughly weary of writing the same things over and over again to different people my letter to you therefore i fear must have much of the character of remainderbiscuit but you will receive it as a proof that i do not wish you to forget me though it may be useless for any other purpose  i reached this on the 2d after a tolerably prosperous voyage deformed by some days of seasickness but otherwise not to be complained of i liked my twenty fellowpassengers far better than i expectedthree or four of them i like much and continue to see frequently the island too is better than i expected so that my barataria at least does not disappoint me the bold rough mountains with mist about their summits verdure below and a bright sun over all please me much and i ride daily on the steep and narrow paved roads which no wheels ever journeyed on the town is clean and there its merits end but i am comfortably lodged with a large and pleasant sittingroom to myself i have met with much kindness and see all the society i wantthough it is not quite equal to that of london even excluding chelsea  i have got about me what books i brought out and have read a little and done some writing for blackwoodall i have the pleasure to inform you prose nay extremely prose i shall now be more at leisure and hope to get more steadily to work though i do not know what i shall begin upon as to reading i have been looking at goethe especially the lifemuch as a shying horse looks at a post in truth i am afraid of him i enjoy and admire him so much and feel i could so easily be tempted to go along with him and yet i have a deeply rooted and old persuasion that he was the most splendid of anachronisms a thoroughly nay intensely pagan life in an age when it is mens duty to be christian i therefore never take him up without a kind of inward check as if i were trying some forbidden spell while on the other hand there is so infinitely much to be learnt from him and it is so needful to understand the world we live in and our own age and especially its greatest minds that i cannot bring myself to burn my books as the converted magicians did or sink them as did prospero there must as i think have been some prodigious defect in his mind to let him hold such views as his about women and some other things and in another respect i find so much coldness and hollowness as to the highest truths and feel so strongly that the heaven he looks up to is but a vault of icethat these two indications leading to the same conclusion go far to convince me he was a profoundly immoral and irreligious spirit with as rare faculties of intelligence as ever belonged to any one all this may be mere goody weakness and twaddle on my part but it is a persuasion that i cannot escape from though i should feel the doing so to be a deliverance from a most painful load if you could help me i heartily wish you would i never take him up without high admiration or lay him down without real sorrow for what he chose to be  i have been reading nothing else that you would much care for southeys amadis has amused me and lyells geology interested me the latter gives one the same sort of bewildering view of the abysmal extent of time that astronomy does of space i do not think i shall take your advice as to learning portuguese it is said to be very ill spoken here and assuredly it is the most direful series of nasal twangs i ever heard one gets on quite well with english  the people here are i believe in a very low condition but they do not appear miserable i am told that the influence of the priests makes the peasantry all miguelites but it is said that nobody wants any more revolutions there is no appearance of riot or crime and they are all extremely civil i was much interested by learning that columbus once lived here before he found america and fame i have been to see a deserted quinta countryhouse where there is a great deal of curious old sculpture in relief upon the masonry many of the figures which are nearly as large as life representing soldiers clad and armed much as i should suppose those of cortez were there are no buildings about the town of the smallest pretensions to beauty or charm of any kind on the whole if madeira were ones world life would certainly rather tend to stagnate but as a temporary refuge a niche in an old ruin where one is sheltered from the shower it has great merit i am more comfortable and contented than i expected to be so far from home and from everybody i am closely connected with but of course it is at best a tolerable exile  tell mrs carlyle that i have written since i have been here and am going to send to blackwood a humble imitation of her watch and canarybird entitled the suit of armor and the skeleton 15 i am conscious that i am far from having reached the depth and fulness of despair and mockery which distinguish the original but in truth there is a lightness of tone about her style which i hold to be invaluable where she makes hairstrokes i make blotches i have a vehement suspicion that my dialogue is an entire failure but i cannot be plagued with it any longer tell her i will not send her messages but will write to her soonmeanwhile i am affectionately hers and yours                                                        john sterling  the next is to his brotherinlaw and in a still hopefuler tone                      to charles barton esq 16                                      funchal madeira 3d march 1838  my dear charlesi have often been thinking of you and your whereabouts in germany and wishing i knew more about you and at last it occurred to me that you might perhaps have the same wish about me and that therefore i should do well to write to you  i have been here exactly four months having arrived on the 2d of novembermy weddingday and though you perhaps may not think it a compliment to susan i have seldom passed four months more cheerfully and agreeably i have of course felt my absence from my family and missed the society of my friends for there is not a person here whom i knew before i left england but on the whole i have been in good health and actively employed i have a good many agreeable and valuable acquaintances one or two of whom i hope i may hereafter reckon as friends the weather has generally been fine and never cold and the scenery of the island is of a beauty which you unhappy northern people can have little conception of  it consists of a great mass of volcanic mountains covered in their lower parts with cottages vines and patches of vegetables when you pass through or over the central ridge and get towards the north there are woods of trees of the laurel kind covering the wild steep slopes and forming some of the strangest and most beautiful prospects i have ever seen towards the interior the forms of the hills become more abrupt and loftier and give the notion of very recent volcanic disturbances though in fact there has been nothing of the kind since the discovery of the island by europeans among these mountains the dark deep precipices and narrow ravines with small streams at the bottom the basaltic knobs and ridges on the summits and the perpetual play of mist and cloud around them under this bright sun and clear skyform landscapes which you would thoroughly enjoy and which i much wish i could give you a notion of the town is on the south and of course the sheltered side of the island perfectly protected from the north and east although we have seen sometimes patches of bright snow on the dark peaks in the distance it is a neat cheerful place all built of gray stone but having many of the houses colored white or red there is not a really handsome building in it but there is a general aspect of comfort and solidity the shops are very poor the english do not mix at all with the portuguese the bay is a very bad anchorage but is wide bright and cheerful and there are some picturesque pointsone a small black islandscattered about it  i lived till a fortnight ago in lodgings having two rooms one a very good one and paying for everything fiftysix dollars a month the dollar being four shillings and twopence this you will see is dear but i could make no better arrangement for there is an unusual affluence of strangers this year i have now come to live with a friend a dr calvert in a small house of our own where i am much more comfortable and live greatly cheaper he is a friend of mrs percivals about my age an oriel man and a very superior person i think the chances are we shall go home together i cannot tell you of all the other people i have become familiar with and shall only mention in addition bingham baring eldest son of lord ashburton who was here for some weeks on account of a dying brother and whom i saw a great deal of he is a pleasant very goodnatured and rather clever man conservative member for north staffordshire  during the first two months i was here i rode a great deal about the island having a horse regularly and was much in agreeable company seeing a great deal of beautiful scenery since then the weather has been much more unsettled though not cold and i have gone about less as i cannot risk the being wet but i have spent my time pleasantly reading and writing i have written a good many things for blackwood one of which the armor and the skeleton i see is printed in the february number i have just sent them a long tale called the onyx ring which cost me a good deal of trouble and the extravagance of which i think would amuse you but its length may prevent its appearance in blackwood if so i think i should make a volume of it i have also written some poems and shall probably publish the sextons daughter when i return  my health goes on most favorably i have had no attack of the chest this spring which has not happened to me since the spring before we went to bonn and i am told if i take care i may roll along for years but i have little hope of being allowed to spend the four first months of any year in england and the question will be whether to go at once to italy by way of germany and switzerland with my family or to settle with them in england perhaps at hastings and go abroad myself when it may be necessary i cannot decide till i return but i think the latter the most probable  to my dear charles i do not like to use the ordinary forms of ending a letter for they are very inadequate to express my sense of your long and most unvarying kindness but be assured no one living could say with more sincerity that he is ever affectionately yours                                                        john sterling  other letters give occasionally views of the shadier side of things dark broken weather in the sky and in the mind ugly clouds covering ones poor fitful transitory prospect for a time as they might well do in sterlings case meanwhile we perceive his literary business is fast developing itself amid all his confusions he is never idle long some of his best piecesthe onyx ring for one as we perceivewere written here this winter out of the turbid whirlpool of the days he strives assiduously to snatch what he can  sterlings communications with blackwoods magazine had now issued in some open sanction of him by professor wilson the distinguished presiding spirit of that periodical a fact naturally of high importance to him under the literary point of view for wilson with his clear flashing eye and great genial heart had at once recognized sterling and lavished stormily in his wild generous way torrents of praise on him in the editorial comments which undoubtedly was one of the gratefulest literary baptisms by fire or by water that could befall a soul like sterlings he bore it very gently being indeed past the age to have his head turned by anybodys praises nor do i think the exaggeration that was in these eulogies did him any ill whatever while surely their generous encouragement did him much good in his solitary struggle towards new activity under such impediments as his laudari a laudato to be called noble by one whom you and the world recognize as noble this great satisfaction never perhaps in such a degree before or after had now been vouchsafed to sterling and was as i compute an important fact for him he proceeded on his pilgrimage with new energy and felt more and more as if authentically consecrated to the same  the onyx ring a curious tale with wild improbable basis but with a noble glow of coloring and with other high merits in it a tale still worth reading in which among the imaginary characters various friends of sterlings are shadowed forth not always in the truest manner came out in blackwood in the winter of this year surely a very high talent for painting both of scenery and persons is visible in this fiction the promise of a novel such as we have few but there wants maturing wants purifying of clear from unclearproperly there want patience and steady depth the basis as we said is wild and loose and in the details lucent often with fine color and dipt in beautiful sunshine there are several things misseen untrue which is the worst species of mispainting witness as sterling himself would have by and by admitted the empty clockcase so we called it which he has labelled goethewhich puts all other untruths in the piece to silence   one of the great alleviations of his exile at madeira he has already celebrated to us the pleasant circle of society he fell into there great luck thinks sterling in this voyage as indeed there was but he himself moreover was readier than most men to fall into pleasant circles everywhere being singularly prompt to make the most of any circle some of his madeira acquaintanceships were really good and one of them if not more ripened into comradeship and friendship for him he says as we saw the chances are calvert and i will come home together  among the english in pursuit of health or in flight from fatal disease that winter was this dr calvert an excellent ingenious cheery cumberland gentleman about sterlings age and in a deeper stage of ailment this not being his first visit to madeira he warmly joining himself to sterling as we have seen was warmly received by him so that there soon grew a close and free intimacy between them which for the next three years till poor calvert ended his course was a leading element in the history of both companionship in incurable malady a touching bond of union was by no means purely or chiefly a companionship in misery in their case the sunniest inextinguishable cheerfulness shone through all manner of clouds in both calvert had been travelling physician in some family of rank who had rewarded him with a pension shielding his own illhealth from one sad evil being hopelessly gone in pulmonary disorder he now moved about among friendly climates and places seeking what alleviation there might be often spending his summers in the house of a sister in the environs of london an insatiable rider on his little brown pony always wherever you might meet him one of the cheeriest of men he had plenty of speculation too clear glances of all kinds into religious social moral concerns and pleasantly incited sterlings outpourings on such subjects he could report of fashionable persons and manners in a fine human cumberland manner loved art a great collector of drawings he had endless help and ingenuity and was in short every way a very human lovable good and nimble manthe laughing blue eyes of him the clear cheery soul of him still redolent of the fresh northern breezes and transparent mountain streams with this calvert sterling formed a natural intimacy and they were to each other a great possession mutually enlivening many a dark day during the next three years they did come home together this spring and subsequently made several of these healthjourneys in partnership    chapter vi literature the sterling club  in spite of these wanderings sterlings course in life so far as his poor life could have any course or aim beyond that of screening itself from swift death was getting more and more clear to him and he pursued it diligently in the only way permitted him by hasty snatches in the intervals of continual fluctuation change of place and other interruption  such once for all were the conditions appointed him and it must be owned he had with a most kindly temper adjusted himself to these nay you would have said he loved them it was almost as if he would have chosen them as the suitablest such an adaptation was there in him of volition to necessityfor indeed they both if well seen into proceeded from one source sterlings bodily disease was the expression under physical conditions of the too vehement life which under the moral the intellectual and other aspects incessantly struggled within him too vehementwhich would have required a frame of oak and iron to contain it in a thin though most wiry body of flesh and bone it incessantly wore holes and so found outlet for itself he could take no rest he had never learned that art he was as we often reproached him fatally incapable of sitting still rapidity as of pulsing auroras as of dancing lightnings rapidity in all forms characterized him this which was his bane in many senses being the real origin of his disorder and of such continual necessity to move and changewas also his antidote so far as antidote there might be enabling him to love change and to snatch as few others could have done from the waste chaotic years all tumbled into ruin by incessant change what hours and minutes of available turned up he had an incredible facility of labor he flashed with most piercing glance into a subject gathered it up into organic utterability with truly wonderful despatch considering the success and truth attained and threw it on paper with a swift felicity ingenuity brilliancy and general excellence of which under such conditions of swiftness i have never seen a parallel essentially an improviser genius as his father too was and of admirable completeness he too though under a very different form  if sterling has done little in literature we may ask what other man than he in such circumstances could have done anything in virtue of these rapid faculties which otherwise cost him so dear he has built together out of those wavering boiling quicksands of his few later years a result which may justly surprise us there is actually some result in those poor two volumes gathered from him such as they are he that reads there will not wholly lose his time nor rise with a malison instead of a blessing on the writer here actually is a real seerglance of some compass into the world of our day blessed glance once more of an eye that is human truer than one of a thousand and beautifully capable of making others see with it i have known considerable temporary reputations gained considerable piles of temporary guineas with loud reviewing and the like to match on a far less basis than lies in those two volumes those also i expect will be held in memory by the world one way or other till the world has extracted all its benefit from them graceful ingenious and illuminative reading of their sort for all manner of inquiring souls a little verdant flowery island of poetic intellect of melodious human verity sunlit island founded on the rockswhich the enormous circumambient continents of mown reedgrass and floating lumber with their mountainranges of ejected stablelitter however alpine cannot by any means or chance submerge nay i expect they will not even quite hide it this modest little island from the welldiscerning but will float past it towards the place appointed for them and leave said island standing allah kereem say the arabs and of the english also some still know that there is a difference in the material of mountains  as it is this last little result the amount of his poor and everinterrupted literary labor that henceforth forms the essential history of sterling we need not dwell at too much length on the foreign journeys disanchorings and nomadic vicissitudes of household which occupy his few remaining years and which are only the disastrous and accidental arena of this he had now excluding his early and more deliberate residence in the west indies made two flights abroad once with his family once without in search of health he had two more in rapid succession to make and many more to meditate and in the whole from bayswater to the end his family made no fewer than five complete changes of abode for his sake but these cannot be accepted as in any sense epochs in his life the one last epoch of his life was that of his internal change towards literature as his work in the world and we need not linger much on these which are the mere outer accidents of that and had no distinguished influence in modifying that  friends still hoped the unrest of that brilliant too rapid soul would abate with years nay the doctors sometimes promised on the physical side a like result prophesying that at fortyfive or some mature age the stress of disease might quit the lungs and direct itself to other quarters of the system but no such result was appointed for us neither fortyfive itself nor the ameliorations promised then were ever to be reached four voyages abroad three of them without his family in flight from death and at home for a like reason five complete shiftings of abode in such wandering manner and not otherwise had sterling to continue his pilgrimage till it ended  once more i must say his cheerfulness throughout was wonderful a certain grimmer shade coming gradually over him might perhaps be noticed in the concluding years not impatience properly yet the consciousness how much he needed patience something more caustic in his tone of wit more trenchant and indignant occasionally in his tone of speech but at no moment was his activity bewildered or abated nor did his composure ever give way no both his activity and his composure he bore with him through all weathers to the final close and on the whole right manfully he walked his wild stern way towards the goal and like a roman wrapt his mantle round him when he felllet us glance with brevity at what he saw and suffered in his remaining pilgrimings and chargings and count up what fractions of spiritual fruit he realized to us from them   calvert and he returned from madeira in the spring of 1838 mrs sterling and the family had lived in knightsbridge with his fathers people through the winter they now changed to blackheath or ultimately hastings and he with them coming up to london pretty often uncertain what was to be done for next winter literature went on briskly here blackwood had from him besides the onyx ring which soon came out with due honor assiduous almost monthly contributions in prose and verse the series called hymns of a hermit was now going on eloquent melodies tainted to me with something of the same disease as the sextons daughter though perhaps in a less degree considering that the strain was in a so much higher pitch still better in clear eloquent prose the series of detached thoughts entitled crystals from a cavern of which the set of fragments generally a little larger in compass called thoughts and images and again those called sayings and essayings 17 are properly continuations add to which his friend john mill had now charge of a review the london and westminster its name wherein sterlings assistance ardently desired was freely afforded with satisfaction to both parties in this and the following years an essay on montaigne with the notes and reminiscences already spoken of was sterlings first contribution here then one on simonides 18 both of the present season  on these and other businesses slight or important he was often running up to london and gave us almost the feeling of his being resident among us in order to meet the most or a good many of his friends at once on such occasions he now furthermore contrived the scheme of a little club where monthly over a frugal dinner some reunion might take place that is where friends of his and withal such friends of theirs as suitedand in fine where a small select company definable as persons to whom it was pleasant to talk togethermight have a little opportunity of talking the scheme was approved by the persons concerned i have a copy of the original regulations probably drawn up by sterling a very solid lucid piece of economics and the list of the proposed members signed james spedding secretary and dated 8th august 1838 19 the club grew was at first called the anonymous club then after some months of success in compliment to the founder who had now left us again the sterling clubunder which latter name it once lately for a time owing to the religious newspapers became rather famous in the world in which strange circumstances the name was again altered to suit weak brethren and the club still subsists in a sufficiently flourishing though happily once more a private condition that is the origin and genesis of poor sterlings club which having honestly paid the shot for itself at wills coffeehouse or elsewhere rashly fancied its bits of affairs were quite settled and once little thought of getting into books of history with them   but now autumn approaching sterling had to quit clubs for matters of sadder consideration a new removal what we call his third peregrinity had to be decided on and it was resolved that rome should be the goal of it the journey to be done in company with calvert whom also the italian climate might be made to serve instead of madeira one of the liveliest recollections i have connected with the anonymous club is that of once escorting sterling after a certain meeting there which i had seen only towards the end and now remember nothing ofexcept that on breaking up he proved to be encumbered with a carpetbag and could not at once find a cab for knightsbridge some small bantering hereupon during the instants of embargo but we carried his carpetbag slinging it on my stick two or three of us alternately through dusty vacant streets under the gaslights and the stars towards the surest cabstand still jesting or pretending to jest he and we not in the mirthfulest manner and had i suppose our own feelings about the poor pilgrim who was to go on the morrow and had hurried to meet us in this way as the last thing before leaving england    chapter vii italy  the journey to italy was undertaken by advice of sir james clark reckoned the chief authority in pulmonary therapeutics who prophesied important improvements from it and perhaps even the possibility henceforth of living all the year in some english home mrs sterling and the children continued in a house avowedly temporary a furnished house at hastings through the winter the two friends had set off for belgium while the due warmth was still in the air they traversed belgium looking well at pictures and such objects ascended the rhine rapidly traversed switzerland and the alps issuing upon italy and milan with immense appetite for pictures and time still to gratify themselves in that pursuit and be deliberate in their approach to rome we will take this freeflowing sketch of their passage over the alps written amid the rocks of aronasanto borromeos country and poor little mignons the elder perdonnets are opulent lausanne people to whose late son sterling had been very kind in madeira the year before                to mrs sterling knightsbridge london                           arona on the lago maggiore 8th oct 1838  my dear motheri bring down the story of my proceedings to the present time since the 29th of september i think it must have been after that day that i was at a great breakfast at the elder perdonnets with whom i had declined to dine not choosing to go out at night i was taken by my hostess to see several pretty pleasuregrounds and points of view in the neighborhood and latterly calvert was better and able to go with us he was in force again and our passports were all settled so as to enable us to start on the morning of the 2d after taking leave of our kind entertainer with thanks for her infinite kindness  we reached st maurice early that evening having had the dent du midi close to us for several hours glittering like the top of a silver teapot far up in the sky our course lay along the valley of the rhone which is considered one of the least beautiful parts of switzerland and perhaps for this reason pleased us as we had not been prepared to expect much we saw before reaching the foot of the alpine pass at brieg two rather celebrated waterfalls the one the pissevache which has no more beauty than any waterfall one hundred or two hundred feet high must necessarily have the other near tourtemagne is much more pleasing having foliage round it and being in a secluded dell if you buy a swiss waterfall choose this one  our second day took us through martigny to sion celebrated for its picturesque towers upon detached hills for its strong romanism and its population of cretinsthat is maimed idiots having the goitre it looked to us a more thriving place than we expected they are building a great deal among other things a new bishops palace and a new nunneryto inhabit either of which ex officio i feel myself very unsuitable from sion we came to brieg a little village in a nook close under an enormous mountain and glacier where it lies like a molehill or something smaller at the foot of a haystack here also we slept and the next day our voiturier who had brought us from lausanne started with us up the simplon pass helped on by two extra horses  the beginning of the road was rather cheerful having a good deal of green pasturage and some mountain villages but it soon becomes dreary and savage in aspect and but for our bright sky and warm air would have been truly dismal however we gained gradually a distinct and near view of several large glaciers and reached at last the high and melancholy valleys of the upper alps where even the pines become scanty and no sound is heard but the wheels of ones carriage except when there happens to be a storm or an avalanche neither of which entertained us there is here and there a small stream of water pouring from the snow but this is rather a monotonous accompaniment to the general desolation than an interruption of it the road itself is certainly very good and impresses one with a strong notion of human power but the common descriptions are much exaggerated and many of what the guidebooks call galleries are merely parts of the road supported by a wall built against the rock and have nothing like a roof above them the stupendous bridges as they are called might be packed a dozen together into one arch of london bridge and they are seldom even very striking from the depth below the roadway is excellent and kept in the best order on the whole i am very glad to have travelled the most famous road in europe and to have had delightful weather for doing so as indeed we have had ever since we left lausanne the italian descent is greatly more remarkable than the other side  we slept near the top at the village of simplon in a very fair and wellwarmed inn close to a mountain stream which is one of the great ornaments of this side of the road we have here passed into a region of granite from that of limestone and what is called gneiss the valleys are sharper and closerlike cracks in a hard and solid massand there is much more of the startling contrast of light and shade as well as more angular boldness of outline to all which the more abundant waters add a fresh and vivacious interest looking back through one of these abysmal gorges one sees two torrents dashing together the precipice and ridge on one side pitchblack with shade and that on the other all flaming gold while behind rises in a huge cone one of the glacier summits of the chain the stream at ones feet rushes at a leap some two hundred feet down and is bordered with pines and beeches struggling through a ruined world of clefts and boulders i never saw anything so much resembling some of the circles described by dante from simplon we made for duomo dossola having broken out as through the mouth of a mine into green and fertile valleys full of vines and chestnuts and white villagesin short into sunshine and italy  at this place we dismissed our swiss voiturier and took an italian one who conveyed us to omegna on the lake of orta a place little visited by english travellers but which fully repaid us the trouble of going there we were lodged in a simple and even rude italian inn where they cannot speak a word of french where we occupied a barnlike room with a huge chimney fit to lodge a hundred ghosts whom we expelled by dint of a hot woodfire there were two beds and as it happened good ones in this strange old apartment which was adorned by pictures of architecture and by heads of saints better than many at the royal academy exhibition and which one paid nothing for looking at the thorough italian character of the whole scene amused us much more than meurices at paris would have done for we had voluble commonplace goodhumor with the aspect and accessories of a den of banditti  today we have seen the lake of orta have walked for some miles among its vineyards and chestnuts and thence have come by baveno to this placehaving seen by the way i believe the most beautiful part of the lago maggiore and certainly the most cheerful complete and extended example of fine scenery i have ever fallen in with here we are much to my wonderfor it seems too good to be truefairly in italy and as yet my journey has been a pleasanter and more instructive and in point of health a more successful one than i at all imagined possible calvert and i go on as well as can be i let him have his way about natural science and he only laughs benignly when he thinks me absurd in my moral speculations my only regrets are caused by my separation from my family and friends and by the hurry i have been living in which has prevented me doing any workand compelled me to write to you at a good deal faster rate than the vapore moves on the lago maggiore it will take me tomorrow to sesto calende whence we go to varese we shall not be at milan for some days write thither if you are kind enough to write at all till i give you another address love to my father                          your affectionate son                                                       john sterling  omitting milan florence nearly all and much about art michael angelo and other aerial matters here are some select terrestrial glimpses the fittest i can find of his progress towards rome                             to his mother  lucca nov 27th 1838i had dreams like other people before i came here of what the lombard lakes must be and the week i spent among them has left me an image not only more distinct but far more warm shining and various and more deeply attractive in innumerable respects than all i had before conceived of them and so also it has been with florence where i spent three weeks enough for the first hazy radiant dawn of sympathy to pass away yet constantly adding an increase of knowledge and of love while i examined and tried to understand the wonderful minds that have left behind them there such abundant traces of their presence on sunday the day before i left florence i went to the highest part of the grand dukes garden of boboli which commands a view of most of the city and of the vale of the arno to the westward where as we had been visited by several rainy days and now at last had a very fine one the whole prospect was in its highest beauty the mass of buildings chiefly on the other side of the river is sufficient to fill the eye without perplexing the mind by vastness like that of london and its name and history its outline and large and picturesque buildings give it grandeur of a higher order than that of mere multitudinous extent the hills that border the valley of the arno are also very pleasing and striking to look upon and the view of the rich plain glimmering away into blue distance covered with an endless web of villages and countryhouses is one of the most delightful images of human wellbeing i have ever seen  very shortly before leaving florence i went through the house of michael angelo which is still possessed by persons of the same family descendants i believe of his nephew there is in it his first work in marble as it is called and a few drawingsall with the stamp of his enginery upon them which was more powerful than all the steam in london on the whole though i have done no work in florence that can be of any use or pleasure to others except my letters to my wifei leave it with the certainty of much valuable knowledge gained there and with a most pleasant remembrance of the busy and thoughtful days i owe to it   we left florence before seven yesterday morning 26th november for this place travelling on the northern side of the arno by prato pistoia pescia we tried to see some old frescos in a church at prato but found the priests all about saying mass and of course did not venture to put our hands into a hive where the bees were buzzing and on the wing pistoia we only coasted a little on one side of it there is a hill the first on the road from florence which we walked up and had a very lively and brilliant prospect over the road we had just travelled and the town of pistoia thence to this place the whole land is beautiful and in the highest degree prosperousin short to speak metaphorically all dotted with leghorn bonnets and streaming with oliveoil the girls here are said to employ themselves chiefly in platting straw which is a profitable employment and the slightness and quiet of the work are said to be much more favorable to beauty than the coarser kinds of labor performed by the countrywomen elsewhere certain it is that i saw more pretty women in pescia in the hour i spent there than i ever before met with among the same numbers of the phare sect wherefore as a memorial of them i bought there several legends of female saints and martyrs and of other ladies quite the reverse and held up as warnings all of which are written in ottava rima and sold for three halfpence apiece but unhappily i have not yet had time to read them this town has 30000 inhabitants and is surrounded by walls laid out as walks and evidently not at present intended to be besiegedfor which reason this morning i merely walked on them round the town and did not besiege them  the cathedral of lucca contains some relics which have undoubtedly worked miracles on the imagination of the people hereabouts the grandfather of all relics as the arabs would say in the place is the volto santo which is a face of the saviour appertaining to a wooden crucifix now you must know that after the ascension of christ nicodemus was ordered by an angel to carve an image of him and went accordingly with a hatchet and cut down a cedar for that purpose he then proceeded to carve the figure and being tired fell asleep before he had done the face which however on awaking he found completed by celestial aid this image was brought to lucca from leghorn i think where it had arrived in a ship more than a thousand years ago and has ever since been kept in purple and fine linen and gold and diamonds quietly working miracles i saw the gilt shrine of it and also a hatchet which refused to cut off the head of an innocent man who had been condemned to death and who prayed to the volto santo i suppose it is by way of economy they being a frugal people that the italians have their book of common prayer and their arabian nights entertainments condensed into one                              to the same  pisa december 2d 1838pisa is very unfairly treated in all the books i have read it seems to me a quiet but very agreeable place with wide clean streets and a look of stability and comfort and i admire the cathedral and its appendages more the more i see them the leaning of the tower is to my eye decidedly unpleasant but it is a beautiful building nevertheless and the view from the top is under a bright sky remarkably lively and satisfactory the lucchese hills form a fine mass and the sea must in clear weather be very distinct there was some haze over it when i was up though the land was all clear i could just see the leghorn lighthouse leghorn itself i shall not be able to visit  the quiet gracefulness of italian life and the mental maturity and vigor of germany have a great charm when compared with the restless whirl of england and the chorus of mingled yells and groans sent up by our parties and sects and by the suffering and bewildered crowds of the laboring people our politics make my heart ache whenever i think of them the base selfish frenzies of factions seem to me at this distance half diabolic and i am out of the way of knowing anything that may be quietly adoing to elevate the standard of wise and temperate manhood in the country and to diffuse the means of physical and moral wellbeing among all the people i will write to my father as soon as i can after reaching the capital of his friend the popewho if he had happened to be born an english gentleman would no doubt by this time be a respectable oldgentlemanly gouty member of the carlton i have often amused myself by thinking what a mere accident it is that phillpotts is not archbishop of tuam and mhale bishop of exeter and how slight a change of dress and of a few catchwords would even now enable them to fill those respective posts with all the propriety and discretion they display in their present positions   at rome he found the crawfords known to him long since and at different dates other english friends old and new and was altogether in the liveliest humor no end to his activities and speculations of all which during the next four months the letters now before me give abundant recordfar too abundant for our objects here his grand pursuit as natural at rome was art into which metaphysical domain we shall not follow him preferring to pick out here and there something of concrete and human of his interests researches speculations and descriptions on this subject of art there is always rather a superabundance especially in the italian tour unfortunately in the hard weather poor calvert fell ill and sterling along with his artstudies distinguished himself as a sicknurse till his poor comrade got afoot again his general impressions of the scene and what it held for him may be read in the following excerpts the letters are all dated rome and addressed to his father or mother  december 21st 1838of rome itself as a whole there are infinite things to be said well worth saying but i shall confine myself to two remarks first that while the monuments and works of art gain in wondrousness and significance by familiarity with them the actual life of rome the papacy and its pride lose and though one gets accustomed to cardinals and friars and swiss guards and ragged beggars and the finery of london and paris all rolling on together and sees how it is that they subsist in a sort of spurious unity one loses all tendency to idealize the metropolis and system of the hierarchy into anything higher than a piece of showy stagedeclamation at bottom in our day thoroughly mean and prosaic my other remark is that rome seen from the tower of the capitol from the pincian or the janiculum is at this day one of the most beautiful spectacles which eyes ever beheld the company of great domes rising from a mass of large and solid buildings with a few stonepines and scattered edifices on the outskirts the broken bare campagna all around the alban hills not far and the purple range of sabine mountains in the distance with a cope of snowthis seen in the clear air and the whole spiritualized by endless recollections and a sense of the grave and lofty reality of human existence which has had this place for a main theatre fills at once the eyes and heart more forcibly and to me delightfully than i can find words to say  january 22d 1839the modern rome pope and all inclusive are a shabby attempt at something adequate to fill the place of the old commonwealth it is easy enough to live among them and there is much to amuse and even interest a spectator but the native existence of the place is now thin and hollow and there is a stamp of littleness and childish poverty of taste upon all the great christian buildings i have seen herenot excepting st peters which is crammed with bits of colored marble and gilding and gogandmagog colossal statues of saints looking prodigiously small and mosaics from the worst pictures in rome and has altogether with most imposing size and lavish splendor a tang of guildhall finery about it that contrasts oddly with the melancholy vastness and simplicity of the ancient monuments though these have not the athenian elegance i recur perpetually to the galleries of sculpture in the vatican and to the frescos of raffael and michael angelo of inexhaustible beauty and greatness and to the general aspect of the city and the country round it as the most impressive scene on earth but the modern city with its churches palaces priests and beggars is far from sublime  of about the same date here is another paragraph worth inserting gladstone has three little agate crosses which he will give you for my little girls calvert bought them as a present for the bodies at martigny in switzerland and i have had no earlier opportunity of sending them will you despatch them to hastings when you have an opportunity i have not yet seen gladstones church and state but as there is a copy in rome i hope soon to lay hands on it i saw yesterday in the times a furious and i am sorry to say most absurd attack on him and it and the new oxonian school  february 28th 1839there is among the people plenty of squalid misery though not nearly so much as they say exists in ireland and here there is a certain freedom and freshness of manners a dash of southern enjoyment in the condition of the meanest and most miserable there is i suppose as little as well can be of conscience or artificial cultivation of any kind but there is not the affectation of a virtue which they do not possess nor any feeling of being despised for the want of it and where life generally is so inert except as to its passions and material wants there is not the bitter consciousness of having been beaten by the more prosperous in a race which the greater number have never thought of running among the laboring poor of rome a bribe will buy a crime but if common work procures enough for a days food or idleness ten times the sum will not induce them to toil on as an english workman would for the sake of rising in the world sixpence any day will put any of them at the top of the only tree they care forthat on which grows the fruit of idleness it is striking to see the way in which in magnificent churches the most ragged beggars kneel on the pavement before some favorite altar in the midst of welldressed women and of gazing foreigners or sometimes you will see one with a child come in from the street where she has been begging put herself in a corner say a prayer probably for the success of her petitions and then return to beg again there is wonderfully little of any moral strength connected with this devotion but still it is better than nothing and more than is often found among the men of the upper classes in rome i believe the clergy to be generally profligate and the state of domestic morals as bad as it has ever been represented  or in sudden contrast take this other glance homeward a letter to his eldest child in which kind of letters more than in any other sterling seems to me to excel readers recollect the hurricane in st vincent the hasty removal to a neighbors house and the birth of a son there soon after the boy has grown to some articulation during these seven years and his father from the new foreign scene of priests and dilettanti thus addresses him                to master edward c sterling hastings                                             rome 21st january 1839  my dear edwardi was very glad to receive your letter which showed me that you have learned something since i left home if you knew how much pleasure it gave me to see your handwriting i am sure you would take pains to be able to write well that you might often send me letters and tell me a great many things which i should like to know about mamma and your sisters as well as yourself  if i go to vesuvius i will try to carry away a bit of the lava which you wish for there has lately been a great eruption as it is called of that mountain which means a great breakingout of hot ashes and fire and of melted stones which is called lava  miss clark is very kind to take so much pains with you and i trust you will show that you are obliged to her by paying attention to all she tells you when you see how much more grown people know than you you ought to be anxious to learn all you can from those who teach you and as there are so many wise and good things written in books you ought to try to read early and carefully that you may learn something of what god has made you able to know there are libraries containing very many thousands of volumes and all that is written in these isaccounts of some part or other of the world which god has made or of the thoughts which he has enabled men to have in their minds some books are descriptions of the earth itself with its rocks and ground and water and of the air and clouds and the stars and moon and sun which shine so beautifully in the sky some tell you about the things that grow upon the ground the many millions of plants from little mosses and threads of grass up to great trees and forests some also contain accounts of living things flies worms fishes birds and fourlegged beasts and some which are the most are about men and their thoughts and doings these are the most important of all for men are the best and most wonderful creatures of god in the world being the only ones able to know him and love him and to try of their own accord to do his will  these books about men are also the most important to us because we ourselves are human beings and may learn from such books what we ought to think and to do and to try to be some of them describe what sort of people have lived in old times and in other countries by reading them we know what is the difference between ourselves in england now and the famous nations which lived in former days such were the egyptians who built the pyramids which are the greatest heaps of stone upon the face of the earth and the babylonians who had a city with huge walls built of bricks having writing on them that no one in our time has been able to make out there were also the jews who were the only ancient people that knew how wonderful and how good god is and the greeks who were the wisest of all in thinking about mens lives and hearts and who knew best how to make fine statues and buildings and to write wise books by books also we may learn what sort of people the old romans were whose chief city was rome where i am now and how brave and skilful they were in war and how well they could govern and teach many nations which they had conquered it is from books too that you must learn what kind of men were our ancestors in the northern part of europe who belonged to the tribes that did the most towards pulling down the power of the romans and you will see in the same way how christianity was sent among them by god to make them wiser and more peaceful and more noble in their minds and how all the nations that now are in europe and especially the italians and the germans and the french and the english came to be what they now areit is well worth knowing and it can be known only by reading how the germans found out the printing of books and what great changes this has made in the world and everybody in england ought to try to understand how the english came to have their parliaments and laws and to have fleets that sail over all seas of the world  besides learning all these things and a great many more about different times and countries you may learn from books what is the truth of gods will and what are the best and wisest thoughts and the most beautiful words and how men are able to lead very right lives and to do a great deal to better the world i have spent a great part of my life in reading and i hope you will come to like it as much as i do and to learn in this way all that i know  but it is a still more serious matter that you should try to be obedient and gentle and to command your temper and to think of other peoples pleasure rather than your own and of what you ought to do rather than what you like if you try to be better for all you read as well as wiser you will find books a great help towards goodness as well as knowledge and above all other books the bible which tells us of the will of god and of the love of jesus christ towards god and men  i had a letter from mamma today which left hastings on the 10th of this month i was very glad to find in it that you were all well and happy but i know mamma is not well and is likely to be more uncomfortable every day for some time so i hope you will all take care to give her as little trouble as possible after sending you so much advice i shall write a little story to divert youi am my dear boy                        your affectionate father                                                       john sterling  the story is lost destroyed as are many such which sterling wrote with great felicity i am told and much to the satisfaction of the young folk when the humor took him  besides these plentiful communications still left i remember long letters not now extant principally addressed to his wife of which we and the circle at knightsbridge had due perusal treating with animated copiousness about all manner of picturegalleries pictures statues and objects of art at rome and on the road to rome and from it wheresoever his course led him into neighborhood of such objects that was sterlings habit it is expected in this nineteenth century that a man of culture shall understand and worship art among the windy gospels addressed to our poor century there are few louder than this of artand if the century expects that every man shall do his duty surely sterling was not the man to balk it various extracts from these picturesurveys are given in hare the others i suppose sterling himself subsequently destroyed not valuing them much  certainly no stranger could address himself more eagerly to reap what artistic harvest rome offers which is reckoned the peculiar produce of rome among cities under the sun to all galleries churches sistine chapels ruins coliseums and artistic or dilettante shrines he zealously pilgrimed and had much to say then and afterwards and with real technical and historical knowledge i believe about the objects of devotion there but it often struck me as a question whether all this even to himself was not more or less a nebulous kind of element prescribed not by nature and her verities but by the century expecting every man to do his duty whether not perhaps in good part temporary dilettante cloudland of our poor centuryor can it be the real diviner pisgah height and everlasting mount of vision for mans soul in any century and i think sterling himself bent towards a negative conclusion in the course of years certainly of all subjects this was the one i cared least to hear even sterling talk of indeed it is a subject on which earnest men abhorrent of hypocrisy and speech that has no meaning are admonished to silence in this sad time and had better in such a babel as we have got into for the present perambulate their picturegallery with little or no speech  here is another and to me much more earnest kind of art which renders rome unique among the cities of the world of this we will in preference take a glance through sterlings eyes  january 22d 1839on friday last there was a great festival at st peters the only one i have seen the church was decorated with crimson hangings and the choir fitted up with seats and galleries and a throne for the pope there were perhaps a couple of hundred guards of different kinds and three or four hundred english ladies and not so many foreign male spectators so that the place looked empty the cardinals in scarlet and monsignori in purple were there and a body of officiating clergy the pope was carried in in his chair on mens shoulders wearing the triple crown which i have thus actually seen it is something like a gigantic egg and of the same color with three little bands of goldvery large eggshell with three streaks of the yolk smeared round it he was dressed in white silk robes with gold trimmings  it was a fine piece of stateshow though as there are three or four such festivals yearly of course there is none of the eager interest which breaks out at coronations and similar rare events no explosion of unwonted velvets jewels carriages and footmen such as london and milan have lately enjoyed i guessed all the people in st peters including performers and spectators at 2000 where 20000 would hardly have been a crushing crowd mass was performed and a stupid but short latin sermon delivered by a lad in honor of st peter who would have been much astonished if he could have heard it the genuflections and trainbearings and folding up the tails of silk petticoats while the pontiff knelt and the train of cardinals going up to kiss his ring and so forthmade on me the impression of something immeasurably old and sepulchral such as might suit the grand lamas court or the inside of an egyptian pyramid or as if the hieroglyphics on one of the obelisks here should begin to pace and gesticulate and nod their bestial heads upon the granite tablets the careless bystanders the london ladies with their eyeglasses and look of an operabox the yawning young gentlemen of the guarda nobile and the laugh of one of the file of vermilion priests round the steps of the altar at the whispered good thing of his neighbor brought one back to nothing indeed of a very lofty kind but still to the nineteenth century  at the great benediction of the city and the world on easter sunday by the pope he writes afterwards there was a large crowd both native and foreign hundreds of carriages and thousands of the lower orders of people from the country but even of the poor hardly one in twenty took off his hat and a still smaller number knelt down a few years ago not a head was covered nor was there a knee which did not bowa very decadent holiness of our lord the pope it would appear  sterlings view of the pope as seen in these his gala days doing his big playactorism under gods earnest sky was much more substantial to me than his studies in the picturegalleries to mr hare also he writes i have seen the pope in all his pomp at st peters and he looked to me a mere lie in livery the romish controversy is doubtless a much more difficult one than the managers of the religioustract society fancy because it is a theoretical dispute and in dealing with notions and authorities i can quite understand how a mere student in a library with no eye for facts should take either one side or other but how any man with clear head and honest heart and capable of seeing realities and distinguishing them from scenic falsehoods should after living in a romanist country and especially at rome be inclined to side with leo against luther i cannot understand 20  it is fit surely to recognize with admiring joy any glimpse of the beautiful and the eternal that is hung out for us in color in form or tone in canvas stone or atmospheric air and made accessible by any sense in this world but it is greatly fitter still little as we are used that way to shudder in pity and abhorrence over the scandalous tragedy transcendent nadir of human ugliness and contemptibility which under the daring title of religious worship and practical recognition of the highest god daily and hourly everywhere transacts itself there and alas not there only but elsewhere everywhere more or less whereby our sense is so blunted to itwhence in all provinces of human life these tears  but let us take a glance at the carnival since we are here the letters as before are addressed to knightsbridge the date rome  february 5th 1839the carnival began yesterday it is a curious example of the trifling things which will heartily amuse tens of thousands of grown people precisely because they are trifling and therefore a relief from serious business cares and labors the corso is a street about a mile long and about as broad as jermyn street but bordered by much loftier houses with many palaces and churches and has two or three small squares opening into it carriages mostly open drove up and down it for two or three hours and the contents were shot at with handfuls of comfits from the windowsin the hope of making them as noncontent as possiblewhile they returned the fire to the best of their inferior ability the populace among whom was i walked about perhaps one in fifty were masked in character but there was little in the masquerade either of splendor of costume or liveliness of mimicry however the whole scene was very gay there were a good many troops about and some of them heavy dragoons who flourished their swords with the magnanimity of our lifeguards to repel the encroachments of too ambitious little boys most of the windows and balconies were hung with colored drapery and there were flags trumpets nosegays and flirtations of all shapes and sizes the best of all was that there was laughter enough to have frightened cassius out of his thin carcass could the lean old homicide have been present otherwise than as a fleshless ghostin which capacity i thought i had a glimpse of him looking over the shoulder of a particolored clown in a carriage full of london cockneys driving towards the capitol this goodhumored foolery will go on for several days to come ending always with the celebrated horserace of horses without riders the long street is cleared in the centre by troops and half a dozen quadrupeds ornamented like grimaldi in a london pantomime scamper away with the mob closing and roaring at their heels  february 9th 1839the usual state of rome is quiet and sober one could almost fancy the actual generation held their breath and stole by on tiptoe in presence of so memorable a past but during the carnival all mankind womankind and childkind think it unbecoming not to play the fool the modern donkey pokes its head out of the lions skin of old rome and brays out the absurdest of asinine roundelays conceive twenty thousand grown people in a long street at the windows on the footways and in carriages amused day after day for several hours in pelting and being pelted with handfuls of mock or real sugarplums and this no name or presence but real downright showers of plaster comfits from which people guard their eyes with meshes of wire as sure as a carriage passes under a window or balcony where are acquaintances of theirs down comes a shower of hail ineffectually returned from below the parties in two crossing carriages similarly assault each other and there are long balconies hung the whole way with a deep canvas pocket full of this mortal shot one russian grand duke goes with a troop of youngsters in a wagon all dressed in brown linen frocks and masked and pelts among the most furious also being pelted the children are of course preeminently vigorous and there is a considerable circulation of real sugarplums which supply consolation for all disappointments  the whole to conclude as is proper with a display with two displays of fireworks in which art as in some others rome is unrivalled  february 9th 1839it seems to be the ambition of all the lower classes to wear a mask and showy grotesque disguise of some kind and i believe many of the upper ranks do the same they even put st peters into masquerade and make it a cathedral of lamplight instead of a stone one two evenings ago this feat was performed and i was able to see it from the rooms of a friend near this which command an excellent view of it i never saw so beautiful an effect of artificial light the evening was perfectly serene and clear the principal lines of the building the columns architrave and pediment of the front the two inferior cupolas the curves of the dome from which the dome rises the ribs of the dome itself the small oriel windows between them and the lantern and ball and crossall were delineated in the clear vault of air by lines of pale yellow fire the dome of another great church much nearer to the eye stood up as a great black massa funereal contrast to the luminous tabernacle  while i was looking at this latter a red blaze burst from the summit and at the same moment seemed to flash over the whole building filling up the pale outline with a simultaneous burst of fire this is a celebrated display and is done i believe by the employment of a very great number of men to light at the same instant the torches which are fixed for the purpose all over the building after the first glare of fire i did not think the second aspect of the building so beautiful as the first it wanted both softness and distinctness the two most animated days of the carnival are still to come  april 4th 1839we have just come to the termination of all the easter spectacles here on sunday evening st peters was a second time illuminated i was in the piazza and admired the sight from a nearer point than when i had seen it before at the time of the carnival  on monday evening the celebrated fireworks were let off from the castle of st angelo they were said to be in some respects more brilliant than usual i certainly never saw any fireworks comparable to them for beauty the girandola is a discharge of many thousands of rockets at once which of course fall back like the leaves of a lily and form for a minute a very beautiful picture there was also in silvery light a very long facade of a palace which looked a residence for oberon and titania and beat aladdins into darkness afterwards a series of cascades of red fire poured down the faces of the castle and of the scaffoldings round it and seemed a burning niagara of course there were abundance of serpents wheels and cannonshot there was also a display of dazzling white light which made a strange appearance on the houses the river the bridge and the faces of the multitude the whole ended with a second and a more splendid girandola  take finally to people the scene a little for us if our imagination be at all lively these three small entries of different dates and so wind up  december 30th 1838i received on christmasday a packet from dr carlyle containing letters from the maurices which were a very pleasant arrival the dr wrote a few lines with them mentioning that he was only at civita vecchia while the steamer baited on its way to naples i have written to thank him for his despatches  march 16th 1839i have seen a good deal of john mill whose society i like much he enters heartily into the interest of the things which i most care for here and i have seldom had more pleasure than in taking him to see raffaels loggie where are the frescos called his bible and to the sixtine chapel which i admire and love more and more he is in very weak health but as fresh and clear in mind as possible english politics seem in a queer state the conservatives creeping on the whigs losing ground like combatants on the top of a breach while there is a social mine below which will probably blow both parties into the air  april 4th 1839i walked out on tuesday on the ancona road and about noon met a travelling carriage which from a distance looked very suspicious and on nearer approach was found really to contain captain sterling and an albanian manservant on the front and behind under the hood mrs a sterling and the she portion of the tail they seemed very well and having turned the albanian back to the rear of the whole machine i sat by anthony and entered rome in triumphhere is indeed a conquest captain a sterling now on his return from service in corfu meets his brother in this manner and the remaining roman days are of a brighter complexion as these suddenly ended i believe he turned southward and found at naples the dr carlyle above mentioned an extremely intimate acquaintance of mine who was still there for we are a most travelling people we of this island in this time and as the prophet threatened see ourselves in so many senses made like unto a wheel  sterling returned from italy filled with much cheerful imagery and reminiscence and great store of artistic serious dilettante and other speculation for the time improved in health too but probably little enriched in real culture or spiritual strength and indeed not permanently altered by his tour in any respect to a sensible extent that one could notice he returned rather in haste and before the expected time summoned about the middle of april by his wifes domestic situation at hastings who poor lady had been brought to bed before her calculation and had in few days lost her infant and now saw a household round her much needing the masters presence he hurried off to malta dreading the alps at that season and came home by steamer with all speed early in may 1839     part iii     chapter i clifton  matters once readjusted at hastings it was thought sterlings health had so improved and his activities towards literature so developed themselves into congruity that a permanent english place of abode might now again be selectedon the southwest coast somewhereand the family once more have the blessing of a home and see its lares and penates and household furniture unlocked from the pantechnicon repositories where they had so long been lying  clifton by bristol with its soft southern winds and high cheerful situation recommended too by the presence of one or more valuable acquaintances there was found to be the eligible place and thither in this summer of 1839 having found a tolerable lodging with the prospect by and by of an agreeable house he and his removed this was the end of what i call his third peregrinityor reckoning the west indies one his fourth this also is since bayswater the fourth time his family has had to shift on his account bayswater then to bordeaux to blackheath and knightsbridge during the madeira time to hastings roman time and now to clifton not to stay there either a sadly nomadic life to be prescribed to a civilized man   at clifton his habitation was speedily enough set up household conveniences methods of work daily promenades on foot or horseback and before long even a circle of friends or of kindly neighborhoods ripening into intimacy were established round him in all this no man could be more expert or expeditious in such cases it was with singular facility in a loving hoping manner that he threw himself open to the new interests and capabilities of the new place snatched out of it whatsoever of human or material would suit him and in brief in all senses had pitched his tenthabitation and grew to look on it as a house it was beautiful too as well as pathetic this man saw himself reduced to be a dweller in tents his house is but a stone tent and he can so kindly accommodate himself to that arrangementhealthy faculty and diseased necessity nature and habit and all manner of things primary and secondary original and incidental conspiring now to make it easy for him with the evils of nomadism he participated to the full in whatever benefits lie in it for a man  he had friends enough old and new at clifton whose intercourse made the place human for him perhaps among the most valued of the former sort may be mentioned mrs edward strachey widow of the late indian judge who now resided here a cultivated graceful most devout and highminded lady whom he had known in old years first probably as charles bullers aunt and whose esteem was constant for him and always precious to him she was some ten or twelve years older than he she survived him some years but is now also gone from us of new friends acquired here besides a skilful and ingenious dr symonds physician as well as friend the principal was francis newman then and still an ardently inquiring soul of fine university and other attainments of sharpcutting restlessly advancing intellect and the mildest pious enthusiasm whose worth since better known to all the world sterling highly estimatedand indeed practically testified the same having by will appointed him some years hence guardian to his eldest son which pious function mr newman now successfully discharges   sterling was not long in certainty as to his abode at clifton alas where could he long be so hardly six months were gone when his old enemy again overtook him again admonished him how frail his hopes of permanency were each winter it turned out he had to fly and after the second of these he quitted the place altogether here meanwhile in a letter to myself and in excerpts from others are some glimpses of his advent and first summer there                             to his mother  clifton june 11th 1839as yet i am personally very uncomfortable from the general confusion of this house which deprives me of my room to sit and read and write in all being more or less lumbered by boxes and invaded by servile domesticities aproned handled bristled and of nondescript varieties we have very fine warm weather with occasional showers and the verdure of the woods and fields is very beautiful bristol seems as busy as need be and the shops and all kinds of practical conveniences are excellent but those of clifton have the usual sentimental not to say meretricious fraudulence of commercial establishments in wateringplaces  the bag which hannah forgot reached us safely at bath on friday morning but i cannot quite unriddle the mystery of the change of padlocks for i left the right one in care of the head steamengine at paddington which seemed a very decent person with a good black coat on and a pen behind its ear i have been meditating much on the story of palareas box of papers which does not appear to be in my possession and i have a strong impression that i gave it to young florez calderon i will write to say so to madam torrijos speedily palarea dr palarea i understand was an old guerilla leader whom they called el medico of him and of the vanished shadows now gone to paris to madrid or out of the world let us say nothing                             to mr carlyle  june 15th 1839we have a room now occupied by robert barton a brotherinlaw to which anthony may perhaps succeed but which after him or in lieu of him would expand itself to receive you is there no hope of your coming i would undertake to ride with you at all possible paces and in all existing directions  as yet my books are lying as ghost books in a limbo on the banks of a certain bristolian styx humanly speaking a canal but the other apparatus of life is gathered about me and performs its diurnal functions the place pleases me better than i expected a far lookout on all sides over green country a sufficient old city lying in the hollow near and civilization in no tumultuous state rather indeed stagnant visible in the rows of houses and gardens which call themselves clifton i hope soon to take a lease of a house where i may arrange myself more methodically keep myself equably boiling in my own kitchen and spread myself over a series of bookshelves i have just been interrupted by a visit from mrs strachey with whom i dined yesterday she seems a very good and thoroughly kindhearted woman and it is pleasant to have her for a neighbor i have read emersons pamphlets i should find it more difficult than ever to write to him                             to his father  june 30th 1839of books i shall have no lack though no plethora and the readingroom supplies all one can want in the way of papers and reviews i go there three or four times a week and inquire how the human race goes on i suppose this turcoegyptian war will throw several diplomatists into a state of great excitement and massacre a good many thousands of africans and asiaticsfor the present it appears the english education question is settled i wish the government had said that in their inspection and superintendence they would look only to secular matters and leave religious ones to the persons who set up the schools whoever these might be it seems to me monstrous that the state should be prevented taking any efficient measures for teaching roman catholic children to read write and cipher merely because they believe in the pope and the pope is an impostorwhich i candidly confess he is there is no question which i can so ill endure to see made a party one as that of educationthe following is of the same day               to thomas carlyle esq chelsea london                                  manor house clifton place clifton                                                      30th june 1839  my dear carlylei have heard this morning from my father that you are to set out on tuesday for scotland so i have determined to fillip away some spurt of ink in your direction which may reach you before you move towards thule  writing to you in fact is considerably easier than writing about you which has been my employment of late at leisure momentsthat is moments of leisure from idleness not work as you partly guessed i took in hand a review of teufelsdrockhfor want of a better heuschrecke to do the work and when i have been well enough and alert enough during the last fortnight have tried to set down some notions about tobacco radicalism christianity assafoetida and so forth but a few abortive pages are all the result as yet if my speculations should ever see daylight they may chance to get you into scrapes but will certainly get me into worse but one must work sic itur ad astraand the astra are always there to befriend one at least as asterisks filling up the gaps which yawn in vain for words  except my unsuccessful efforts to discuss you and your offences i have done nothing that leaves a trace behindunless the endeavor to teach my little boy the latin declensions shall be found at some time short of the last day to have done so i haverather i think from dyspepsia than dyspneumonybeen often and for days disabled from doing anything but read in this way i have gone through a good deal of strausss book which is exceedingly clever and clearheaded with more of insight and less of destructive rage than i expected it will work deep and far in such a time as ours when so many minds are distracted about the history or rather genesis of the gospel it is a great thing for partisans on the one side to have what the other never have wanted a book of which they can say this is our creed and codeor rather anticreed and anticode and strauss seems perfectly secure against the sort of answer to which voltaires critical and historical shallowness perpetually exposed him i mean to read the book through it seems admitted that the orthodox theologians have failed to give any sufficient answeri have also looked through michelets luther with great delight and have read the fourth volume of coleridges literary remains in which there are things that would interest you he has a great hankering after cromwell and explicitly defends the execution of charles  of mrs strachey we have seen a great deal and might have seen more had i had time and spirits for it she is a warmhearted enthusiastic creature whom one cannot but like she seems always excited by the wish for more excitement than her life affords and such a person is always in danger of doing something less wise than his best knowledge and aspirations because he must do something and circumstances do not allow him to do what he desires thence after the first glow of novelty endless selftormenting comes from the contrast between aims and acts she sets out with her daughter and two boys for a tour in wales tomorrow morning her talk of you is always most affectionate and few i guess will read sartor with more interest than she  i am still in a very extempore condition as to house books c one which i have hired for three years will be given up to me in the middle of august and then i may hope to have something like a houseso far as that is possible for any one to whom time itself is often but a worse or a better kind of cave in the desert we have had rainy and cheerless weather almost since the day of our arrival but the sun now shines more lovingly and the skies seem less disdainful of man and his perplexities the earth is green abundant and beautiful but human life so far as i can learn is mean and meagre enough in its purposes however striking to the speculative or sentimental bystander pray be assured that whatever you may say of the landlord at clifton 21 the more i know of him the less i shall like him well with me if i can put up with him for the present and make use of him till at last i can joyfully turn him off forever  love to you wife and self my little charlotte desires me to tell you that she has new shoes for her doll which she will show you when you come                                  yours                                                       john sterling  the visit to clifton never took effect nor to any of sterlings subsequent homes which now is matter of regret to me concerning the review of teufelsdrockh there will be more to say anon as to little charlotte and her doll i remember well enough and was more than once reminded this bright little creature on one of my first visits to bayswater had earnestly applied to me to put her dolls shoes on for her which feat was performedthe next fragment indicates a household settled fallen into wholesome routine again and may close the series here                             to his mother  july 22d 1839a few evenings ago we went to mr griffins and met there dr prichard the author of a wellknown book on the races of mankind to which it stands in the same relation among english books as the racing calendar does to those of horsekind he is a very intelligent accomplished person we had also there the dean a certain dr  of corpus college cambridge a booby and a clever fellow a mr fisher one of the tutors of trinity in my days we had a very pleasant evening  at london we were in the habit of expecting sterling pretty often his presence in this house as in others was looked for once in the month or two and came always as sunshine in the gray weather to me and mine my daily walks with him had long since been cut short without renewal that walk to eltham and edgeworths perhaps the last of the kind he and i had but our intimacy deepening and widening year after year knew no interruption or abatement of increase an honest frank and truly human mutual relation valuable or even invaluable to both parties and a lasting loss hardly to be replaced in this world to the survivor of the two  his visits which were usually of two or three days were always full of business rapid in movement as all his life was to me if possible he would come in the evening a whole cornucopia of talk and speculation was to be discharged if the evening would not do and my affairs otherwise permitted i had to mount into cabs with him fly far and wide shuttling athwart the big babel wherever his calls and pauses had to be this was his way to husband time our talk in such straitened circumstances was loud or low as the circumambient groaning rage of wheels and sound prescribedvery loud it had to be in such thoroughfares as london bridge and cheapside but except while he was absent off for minutes into some bankers office lawyers stationers haberdashers or what office there might be it never paused in this way extensive strange dialogues were carried on to me also very strangeprivate friendly colloquies on all manner of rich subjects held thus amid the chaotic roar of things sterling was full of speculations observations and bright sallies vividly awake to what was passing in the world glanced pertinently with victorious clearness without spleen though often enough with a dash of mockery into its puseyisms liberalisms literary lionisms or what else the mad hour might be producingalways prompt to recognize what grain of sanity might be in the same he was opulent in talk and the rapid movement and vicissitude on such occasions seemed to give him new excitement  once i still rememberit was some years before probably in may on his return from madeirahe undertook a days riding with me once and never again we coursed extensively over the hampstead and highgate regions and the country beyond sauntering or galloping through many leafy lanes and pleasant places in everflowing everchanging talk and returned down regent street at nightfall one of the cheerfulest days i ever hadnot to be repeated said the fates sterling was charming on such occasions at once a child and a gifted man a serious fund of thought he always had a serious drift you never missed in him nor indeed had he much depth of real laughter or sense of the ludicrous as i have elsewhere said but what he had was genuine free and continual his sparkling sallies bubbled up as from aerated natural fountains a mild dash of gayety was native to the man and had moulded his physiognomy in a very graceful way we got once into a cab about charing cross i know not now whence or well whitherward nor that our haste was at all special however the cabman sensible that his pace was slowish took to whipping with a steady passionless businesslike assiduity which though the horse seemed lazy rather than weak became afflictive and i urged remonstrance with the savage fellow let him alone answered sterling he is kindling the enthusiasm of his horse you perceive that is the first thing then we shall do very wellas accordingly we did   at clifton though his thoughts began to turn more on poetic forms of composition he was diligent in prose elaborations toodoing criticism for one thing as we incidentally observed he wrote there and sent forth in this autumn of 1839 his most important contribution to john mills review the article on carlyle which stands also in mr hares collection 22 what its effect on the public was i knew not and know not but remember well and may here be permitted to acknowledge the deep silent joy not of a weak or ignoble nature which it gave to myself in my then mood and situation as it well might the first generous human recognition expressed with heroic emphasis and clear conviction visible amid its fiery exaggeration that ones poor battle in this world is not quite a mad and futile that it is perhaps a worthy and manful one which will come to something yet this fact is a memorable one in every history and for me sterling often enough the stiff gainsayer in our private communings was the doer of this the thought burnt in me like a lamp for several days lighting up into a kind of heroic splendor the sad volcanic wrecks abysses and convulsions of said poor battle and secretly i was very grateful to my daring friend and am still and ought to be what the public might be thinking about him and his audacities and me in consequence or whether it thought at all i never learned or much heeded to learn  sterlings gainsaying had given way on many points but on others it continued stiff as ever as may be seen in that article indeed he fought parthianlike in such cases holding out his last position as doggedly as the first and to some of my notions he seemed to grow in stubbornness of opposition with the growing inevitability and never would surrender especially that doctrine of the greatness and fruitfulness of silence remained afflictive and incomprehensible silence he would say yes truly if they give you leave to proclaim silence by cannonsalvos my harpocratesstentor in like manner intellect and virtue how they are proportional or are indeed one gift in us the same great summary of gifts and again might and right the identity of these two if a man will understand this godsuniverse and that only he who conforms to the law of it can in the longrun have any might all this at the first blush often awakened sterlings musketry upon me and many volleys i have had to standthe thing not being decidable by that kind of weapon or strategy  in such cases your one method was to leave our friend in peace by smallarms practice no mortal could dislodge him but if you were in the right the silent hours would work continually for you and sterling more certainly than any man would and must at length swear fealty to the right and passionately adopt it burying all hostilities under foot a more candid soul once let the stormful velocities of it expend themselves was nowhere to be met with a son of light if i have ever seen one recognizing the truth if truth there were hurling overboard his vanities petulances big and small interests in ready loyalty to truth very beautiful at once a loyal child as i said and a gifted manhere is a very pertinent passage from one of his letters which though the name continues blank i will insert                             to his father  october 15th 1839as to my overestimate of  your expressions rather puzzle me i suppose there may be at the outside a hundred persons in england whose opinions on such a matter are worth as much as mine if by the public you and my mother mean the other ninetynine i submit i have no doubt that on any matter not relating peculiarly to myself the judgment of the ninetynine most philosophical heads in the country if unanimous would be right and mine if opposed to them wrong but then i am at a loss to make out how the decision of the very few really competent persons has been ascertained to be thus in contradiction to me and on the other hand i conceive myself from my opportunities knowledge and attention to the subject to be alone quite entitled to outvote tens of thousands of gentlemen however much my superiors as men of business men of the world or men of merely dry or merely frivolous literature  i do not remember ever before to have heard the saying whether of talleyrand or of any one else that all the world is a wiser man than any man in the world had it been said even by the devil it would nevertheless be false i have often indeed heard the saying on peut etre plus fin quun autre mais pas plus fin que tous les autres but observe that fin means cunning not wise the difference between this assertion and the one you refer to is curious and worth examining it is quite certain there is always some one man in the world wiser than all the rest as socrates was declared by the oracle to be and as i suppose bacon was in his day and perhaps burke in his there is also some one whose opinion would be probably true if opposed to that of all around him and it is always indubitable that the wise men are the scores and the unwise the millions the millions indeed come round in the course of a generation or two to the opinions of the wise but by that time a new race of wise men have again shot ahead of their contemporaries so it has always been and so in the nature of things it always must be but with cunning the matter is quite different cunning is not dishonest wisdom which would be a contradiction in terms it is dishonest prudence acuteness in practice not in thought and though there must always be some one the most cunning in the world as well as some one the most wise these two superlatives will fare very differently in the world in the case of cunning the shrewdness of a whole people of a whole generation may doubtless be combined against that of the one and so triumph over it which was pretty much the case with napoleon but although a man of the greatest cunning can hardly conceal his designs and true character from millions of unfriendly eyes it is quite impossible thus to club the eyes of the mind and to constitute by the union of ten thousand follies an equivalent for a single wisdom a hundred schoolboys can easily unite and thrash their one master but a hundred thousand schoolboys would not be nearer than a score to knowing as much greek among them as bentley or scaliger to all which i believe you will assent as readily as iand i have written it down only because i have nothing more important to say   besides his prose labors sterling had by this time written publishing chiefly in blackwood a large assortment of verses sextons daughter hymns of a hermit and i know not what other extensive stock of pieces concerning which he was now somewhat at a loss as to his true course he could write verses with astonishing facility in any given form of metre and to various readers they seemed excellent and high judges had freely called them so but he himself had grave misgivings on that latter essential point in fact here once more was a parting of the ways write in poetry write in prose upon which before all else it much concerned him to come to a settlement  my own advice was as it had always been steady against poetry and we had colloquies upon it which must have tried his patience for in him there was a strong leaning the other way but as i remarked and urged had he not already gained superior excellence in delivering by way of speech or prose what thoughts were in him which is the grand and only intrinsic function of a writing man call him by what title you will cultivate that superior excellence till it become a perfect and superlative one why sing your bits of thoughts if you can contrive to speak them by your thought not by your mode of delivering it you must live or diebesides i had to observe there was in sterling intrinsically no depth of tune which surely is the real test of a poet or singer as distinguished from a speaker in music proper he had not the slightest ear all music was mere impertinent noise to him nothing in it perceptible but the mere march or time nor in his way of conception and utterance in the verses he wrote was there any contradiction but a constant confirmation to me of that fatal prognosticas indeed the whole man in ear and heart and tongue is one and he whose soul does not sing need not try to do it with his throat sterlings verses had a monotonous rubadub instead of tune no trace of music deeper than that of a wellbeaten drum to which limited range of excellence the substance also corresponded being intrinsically always a rhymed and slightly rhythmical speech not a song  in short all seemed to me to say in his case you can speak with supreme excellence sing with considerable excellence you never can and the age itself does it not beyond most ages demand and require clear speech an age incapable of being sung to in any but a trivial manner till these convulsive agonies and wild revolutionary overturnings readjust themselves intelligible word of command not musical psalmody and fiddling is possible in this fell storm of battle beyond all ages our age admonishes whatsoever thinking or writing man it has oh speak to me some wise intelligible speech your wise meaning in the shortest and clearest way behold i am dying for want of wise meaning and insight into the devouring fact speak if you have any wisdom as to song so called and your fiddling talenteven if you have one much more if you have nonewe will talk of that a couple of centuries hence when things are calmer again homer shall be thrice welcome but only when troy is taken alas while the siege lasts and battles fury rages everywhere what can i do with the homer i want achilleus and odysseus and am enraged to see them trying to be homers  sterling who respected my sincerity and always was amenable enough to counsel was doubtless much confused by such contradictory diagnosis of his case the question poetry or prose became more and more pressing more and more insoluble he decided at last to appeal to the public upon itgot ready in the late autumn a small select volume of his verses and was now busy pushing it through the press unfortunately in the mean while a grave illness of the old pulmonary sort overtook him which at one time threatened to be dangerous this is a glance again into his interior household in these circumstances                             to his mother  december 21st 1839the tin box came quite safe with all its miscellaneous contents i suppose we are to thank you for the comic almanac which as usual is very amusing and for the book on watt which disappointed me the scientific part is no doubt very good and particularly clear and simple but there is nothing remarkable in the account of watts character and it is an absurd piece of french impertinence in arago to say that england has not yet learnt to appreciate men like watt because he was not made a peer which were our peerage an institution like that of france would have been very proper  i have now finished correcting the proofs of my little volume of poems it has been a great plague to me and one that i would not have incurred had i expected to be laid up as i have been but the matter was begun before i had any notion of being disabled by such an illnessthe severest i have suffered since i went to the west indies the book will after all be a botched business in many respects and i much doubt whether it will pay its expenses but i try to consider it as out of my hands and not to fret myself about it i shall be very curious to see carlyles tractate on chartism whichbut we need not enter upon that  sterlings little book was printed at his own expense 23 published by moxon in the very end of this year it carries an appropriate and pretty epigraph       feeling thought and fancy be      gentle sister graces three      if these prove averse to me      they will punishpardon ye  he had dedicated the little volume to mr hareand he submitted very patiently to the discouraging neglect with which it was received by the world for indeed the ye said nothing audible in the way of pardon or other doom so that whether the sister graces were averse or not remained as doubtful as ever    chapter ii two winters  as we said above it had been hoped by sterlings friends not very confidently by himself that in the gentler air of clifton his health might so far recover as to enable him to dispense with autumnal voyages and to spend the year all round in a house of his own these hopes favorable while the warm season lasted broke down when winter came in november of this same year while his little volume was passing through the press bad and worse symptoms spitting of blood to crown the sad list reappeared and sterling had to equip himself again at this late season for a new flight to madeira wherein the good calvert himself suffering and ready on all grounds for such an adventure offered to accompany him sterling went by land to falmouth meaning there to wait for calvert who was to come by the madeira packet and there take him on board  calvert and the packet did arrive in stormy january weather which continued wildly blowing for weeks forbidding all egress westward especially for invalids these elemental tumults and blustering wars of sea and sky with nothing but the misty solitude of madeira in the distance formed a very discouraging outlook in the mean while falmouth itself had offered so many resources and seemed so tolerable in climate and otherwise while this wintry ocean looked so inhospitable for invalids it was resolved our voyagers should stay where they were till spring returned which accordingly was done with good effect for that season and also with results for the coming seasons here again from letters to knightsbridge are some glimpses of his winterlife  falmouth february 5th 1840i have been today to see a new tinmine two or three miles off which is expected to turn into a coppermine by and by so they will have the two constituents of bronze close together this by the way was the brass of homer and the ancients generally who do not seem to have known our brass made of copper and zinc achilles in his armor must have looked like a bronze statuei took sheridans advice and did not go down the mine  february 15thto some ironworks the other day where i saw half the beam of a great steamengine a piece of iron forty feet long and seven broad cast in about five minutes it was a very striking spectacle i hope to go to penzance before i leave this country and will not fail to tell you about it he did make trial of penzance among other places next year but only of falmouth this  february 20thi am going on asy here in spite of a great change of weather the eastwinds are come at last bringing with them snow which has been driving about for the last twentyfour hours not falling heavily nor lying long when fallen neither is it as yet very cold but i suppose there will be some six weeks of unpleasant temperature the marine climate of this part of england will no doubt modify and mollify the air into a happier sort of substance than that you breathe in london  the large vessels that had been lying here for weeks waiting for a wind have now sailed two of them for the east indies and having three hundred soldiers on board it is a curious thing that the longcontinued westerly winds had so prevented the coasters arriving that the town was almost on the point of a famine as to bread the change has brought in abundance of flourthe people in general seem extremely comfortable their houses are excellent almost all of stone their habits are very little agricultural but mining and fishing seem to prosper with them there are hardly any gentry here i have not seen more than two gentlemens carriages in the town indeed i think the nearest one comes from five miles off  i have been obliged to try to occupy myself with natural science in order to give some interest to my walks and have begun to feel my way in geology i have now learnt to recognize three or four of the common kinds of stone about here when i see them but i find it stupid work compared with poetry and philosophy in the mornings however for an hour or so before i get up i generally light my candle and try to write some verses and since i have been here i have put together short poems almost enough for another small volume in the evenings i have gone on translating some of goethe but six or seven hours spent on my legs in the open air do not leave my brain much energy for thinking thus my life is a dull and unprofitable one but still better than it would have been in madeira or on board ship i hear from susan every day and write to her by return of post  at falmouth sterling had been warmly welcomed by the wellknown quaker family of the foxes principal people in that place persons of cultivated opulent habits and joining to the fine purities and pieties of their sect a reverence for human intelligence in all kinds to whom such a visitor as sterling was naturally a welcome windfall the family had grave elders bright cheery younger branches men and women truly amiable all after their sort they made a pleasant image of home for sterling in his winter exile most worthy respectable and highly cultivated people with a great deal of money among them writes sterling in the end of february who make the place pleasant to me they are connected with all the large quaker circle the gurneys frys c and also with buxton the abolitionist it is droll to hear them talking of all the common topics of science literature and life and in the midst of it does thou know wordsworth or did thou see the coronation or will thou take some refreshment they are very kind and pleasant people to know  calvert continues our diarist is better than he lately was though he has not been at all laid up he shoots little birds and dissects and stuffs them while i carry a hammer and break flints and slates to look for diamonds and rubies inside and admire my success in the evening when i empty my greatcoat pocket of its specimens on the whole i doubt whether my physical proceedings will set the thames on fire give my love to anthonys charlotte also remember me affectionately to the carlyles  at this time too john mill probably encouraged by sterling arrived in falmouth seeking refuge of climate for a sickly younger brother to whom also while he continued there and to his poor patient the doors and hearts of this kind family were thrown wide open falmouth during these winter weeks especially while mill continued was an unexpectedly engaging place to sterling and he left it in spring for clifton with a very kindly image of it in his thoughts so ended better than it might have done his first years flight from the clifton winter  in april 1840 he was at his own hearth again cheerily pursuing his old laborsstruggling to redeem as he did with a gallant constancy the available months and days out of the wreck of so many that were unavailable for the business allotted him in this world his swift decisive energy of character the valiant rally he made again and ever again starting up fresh from amid the wounded and cheerily storming in anew was admirable and showed a noble fund of natural health amid such an element of disease somehow one could never rightly fancy that he was diseased that those fatal everrecurring downbreaks were not almost rather the penalties paid for exuberance of health and of faculty for living and working criminal forfeitures incurred by excess of selfexertion and such irrepressible overrapidity of movement and the vague hope was habitual with us that increase of years as it deadened this overenergy would first make the man secure of life and a sober prosperous worker among his fellows it was always as if with a kind of blame that one heard of his being ill again poor sterlingno man knows anothers burden these things were not and were not to be in the way we had fancied them  summer went along in its usual quiet tenor at clifton health good as usual while the warm weather lasted and activity abundant the scene as still as the busiest could wish you metropolitan signors writes sterling to his father cannot conceive the dulness and scantiness of our provincial chronicle here is a little excursion to the seaside the lady of the family being againfor good reasonsin a weakly state            to edward sterling esq knightsbridge london                                  portshead bristol 1st sept 1840  my dear fatherthis place is a southern headland at the mouth of the avon susan and the children too were all suffering from languor and as she is quite unfit to travel in a carriage we were obliged to move if at all to some place accessible by water and this is the nearest where we could get the fresher air of the bristol channel we sent to take a house for a week and came down here in a steamer yesterday morning it seems likely to do every one good we have a comfortable house with eight rather small bedrooms for which we pay four guineas and a half for the week we have brought three of our own maids and leave one to take care of the house at clifton  a week ago my horse fell with me but did not hurt seriously either himself or me it was however rather hard that as there were six legs to be damaged the one that did scratch itself should belong to the part of the machine possessing only two instead of the quadrupedal portion i grazed about the size of a halfpenny on my left knee and for a couple of days walked about as if nothing had happened i found however that the skin was not returning correctly and so sent for a doctor he treated the thing as quite insignificant but said i must keep my leg quiet for a few days it is still not quite healed and i lie all day on a sofa much to my discomposure but the thing is now rapidly disappearing and i hope in a day or two more i shall be free again i find i can do no work while thus crippled in my leg the man in horace who made verses stans pede in uno had the advantage of me  the great western came in last night about eleven and has just been making a flourish past our windows looking very grand with four streamers of bunting and one of smoke of course i do not yet know whether i have letters by her as if so they will have gone to clifton first this place is quiet green and pleasant and will suit us very well if we have good weather of which there seems every appearance  milnes spent last sunday with me at clifton and was very amusing and cordial it is impossible for those who know him well not to like himi send this to knightsbridge not knowing where else to hit you love to my mother                            your affectionate                                                       john sterling  the expected letters by the great western are from anthony now in canada doing military duties there the milnes is our excellent richard whom all men know and truly whom none can know well without even doing as sterling saysin a week the family had returned to clifton and sterling was at his poetizings and equitations again his grand business was now poetry all effort outlook and aim exclusively directed thither this good while  of the published volume moxon gave the worst tidings no man had hailed it with welcome unsold it lay under the leaden seal of general neglect the public when asked what it thought had answered hitherto by a lazy stare it shall answer otherwise thought sterling by no means taking that as the final response it was in this same september that he announced to me and other friends under seal of secrecy as usual the completion or complete firstdraught of a new poem reaching to two thousand verses by working three hours every morning he had brought it so far this piece entitled the election of which in due time we obtained perusal and had to give some judgment proved to be in a new veinwhat might be called the mockheroic or sentimental hudibrastic reminding one a little too of wielands oberonit had touches of true drollery combined not ill with grave clear insight showed spirit everywhere and a plainly improved power of execution our stingy verdict was to the effect better but still not good enoughwhy follow that sad metrical course climbing the loose sandhills when you have a firm path along the plain to sterling himself it remained dubious whether so slight a strain new though it were would suffice to awaken the sleeping public and the piece was thrown away and taken up again at intervals and the question publish or not publish lay many months undecided  meanwhile his own feeling was now set more and more towards poetry and in spite of symptoms and dissuasions and perverse prognostics of outward wind and weather he was rallying all his force for a downright struggle with it resolute to see which was the stronger it must be owned he takes his failures in the kindliest manner and goes along bating no jot of heart or hope perhaps i should have more admired this than i did my dissuasions in that case might have been fainter but then my sincerity which was all the use of my poor counsel in assent or dissent would have been less he was now furthermore busy with a tragedy of strafford the theme of many failures in tragedy planning it industriously in his head eagerly reading in whitlocke rushworth and the puritan books to attain a vesture and local habitation for it faithful assiduous studies i do believeof which knowing my stubborn realism and savage humor towards singing by the thespian or other methods he told me little during his visits that summer   the advance of the dark weather sent him adrift again to torquay for this winter there in his old falmouth climate he hoped to do welland did so far as welldoing was readily possible in that sad wandering way of life however be where he may he tries to work two or three hours in the morning were it even with a lamp in bed before the fires are lit and so makes something of it from abundant letters of his now before me i glean these two or three small glimpses sufficient for our purpose at present the general date is tor near torquay                     to mrs charles fox falmouth  tor november 30th 1840i reached this place on thursday having after much hesitation resolved to come here at least for the next three weekswith some obscure purpose of embarking at the new year from falmouth for malta and so reaching naples which i have not seen there was also a doubt whether i should not after christmas bring my family here for the first four months of the year all this however is still doubtful but for certain inhabitants of falmouth and its neighborhood this place would be far more attractive than it but i have here also friends whose kindness like much that i met with last winter perpetually makes me wonder at the stock of benignity in human nature a brother of my friend julius hare marcus by name a naval man and though not a man of letters full of sense and knowledge lives here in a beautiful place with a most agreeable and excellent wife a daughter of lord stanley of alderley i had hardly seen them before but they are fraternizing with me in a much better than the jacobin fashion and one only feels ashamed at the enormity of some peoples goodnature i am in a little rural sort of lodging and as comfortable as a solitary oyster can expect to be                              to c barton  december 5ththis place is extremely small much more so than falmouth even but pretty cheerful and very mild in climate there are a great many villas in and about the little town having three or four receptionrooms eight or ten bedrooms and costing about fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds each and occupied by persons spending a thousand or more pounds a year if the country would acknowledge my merits by the gift of one of these i could prevail on myself to come and live here which would be the best move for my health i could make in england but in the absence of any such expression of public feeling it would come rather dear                           to mrs fox again  december 22dby the way did you ever read a novel if you ever mean to do so hereafter let it be miss martineaus deerbrook it is really very striking and parts of it are very true and very beautiful it is not so true or so thoroughly clear and harmonious among delineations of english middleclass gentility as miss austens books especially as pride and prejudice which i think exquisite but it is worth reading the hour and the man is eloquent but an absurd exaggerationi hold out so valorously against this scandinavian weather that i deserve to be ranked with odin and thor and fancy i may go to live at clifton or drontheim have you had the same icy desolation as prevails here                          to w coningham esq  december 28thlooking back to him a deceased uncle father of his correspondent as i now very often do i feel strongly what the loss of other friends has also impressed on me how much death deepens our affection and sharpens our regret for whatever has been even slightly amiss in our conduct towards those who are gone what trifles then swell into painful importance how we believe that could the past be recalled life would present no worthier happier task than that of so bearing ourselves towards those we love that we might ever after find nothing but melodious tranquillity breathing about their graves yet too often i feel the difficulty of always practicing such mild wisdom towards those who are still left meyou will wonder less at my rambling off in this way when i tell you that my little lodging is close to a picturesque old church and churchyard where every day i brush past a tombstone recording that an italian of manferrato has buried there a girl of sixteen his only daughter l unica speranza di mia vitano doubt as you say our mechanical age is necessary as a passage to something better but at least do not let us go back  at the newyear time feeling unusually well he returns to clifton his plans of course were ever fluctuating his movements were swift and uncertain alas his whole life especially his winterlife had to be built as if on wavering driftsand nothing certain in it except if possible the two or three hours of work snatched from the general whirlpool of the dubious fourandtwenty                             to dr carlyle  clifton january 10th 1841i stood the sharp frost at torquay with such entire impunity that at last i took courage and resolved to return home i have been here a week in extreme cold and have suffered not at all so that i hope with care i may prosper in spite of medical prognosticsif you permit such profane language i am even able to work a good deal and write for some hours every morning by dint of getting up early which an arnott stove in my study enables me to dobut at clifton he cannot continue again before long the rude weather has driven him southward the spring finds him in his former haunts doubtful as ever what to decide upon for the future but tending evidently towards a new change of residence for household and self                          to w coningham esq  penzance april 19th 1841my little boy and i have been wandering about between torquay and this place and latterly have had my father for a few days with ushe left us yesterday in all probability i shall endeavor to settle either at torquay at falmouth or here as it is pretty clear that i cannot stand the sharp air of clifton and still less the london eastwinds penzance is on the whole a pleasantlooking cheerful place with a delightful mildness of air and a great appearance of comfort among the people the view of mounts bay is certainly a very noble one torquay would suit the health of my wife and children better or else i should be glad to live here always london and its neighborhood being impracticablesuch was his second wandering winter enough to render the prospect of a third at clifton very uninviting   with the falmouth friends young and old his intercourse had meanwhile continued cordial and frequent the omens were pointing towards that region at his next place of abode accordingly in few weeks hence in the june of this summer 1841 his dubitations and inquirings are again ended for a time he has fixed upon a house in falmouth and removed thither bidding clifton and the regretful clifton friends a kind farewell this was the fifth change of place for his family since bayswater the fifth and to one chief member of it the last mrs sterling had brought him a new child in october last and went hopefully to falmouth dreading other than what befell there    chapter iii falmouth poems  at falmouth as usual he was soon at home in his new environment resumed his labors had his new small circle of acquaintance the ready and constant centre of which was the fox family with whom he lived on an altogether intimate honored and beloved footing realizing his best anticipations in that respect which doubtless were among his first inducements to settle in this new place open cheery heights rather bare of wood fresh southwestern breezes a brisk laughing sea swept by industrious sails and the nets of a most stalwart wholesome frank and interesting population the clean little fishing trading and packet town hanging on its slope towards the eastern sun close on the waters of its basin and intricate baywith the miniature pendennis castle seaward on the right the miniature st mawes landward to left and the mining world and the farming world open boundlessly to the rearall this made a pleasant outlook and environment and in all this as in the other new elements of his position sterling open beyond most men to the worth of things about him took his frank share from the first he had liked the general aspect of the population and their healthy lively ways not to speak of the special friendships he had formed there which shed a charm over them all men of strong character clear heads and genuine goodness writes he are by no means wanting and long after the common people here dress better than in most parts of england and on sundays if the weather be at all fine their appearance is very pleasant one sees them all round the town especially towards pendennis castle streaming in a succession of little groups and seeming for the most part really and quietly happy on the whole he reckoned himself lucky and so far as locality went found this a handsome shelter for the next two years of his life two years and not without an interruption that was all here we have no continuing city he less than any of us one other flight for shelter and then it is ended and he has found an inexpugnable refuge let us trace his remote footsteps as we have opportunity                        to dr symonds clifton  falmouth june 28th 1841newman writes to me that he is gone to the rhine i wish i were and yet the only wish at the bottom of my heart is to be able to work vigorously in my own way anywhere were it in some circle of dantes inferno this however is the secret of my soul which i disclose only to a few                             to his mother  falmouth july 6th 1841i have at last my own study made comfortable the carpet being now laid down and most of my appurtenances in tolerable order by and by i shall unless stopped by illness get myself together and begin living an orderly life and doing my daily task i have swung a cot in my dressingroom partly as a convenience for myself partly as a sort of memorial of my poor uncle in whose cot in his dressingroom at lisworney i remember to have slept when a child i have put a good large bookcase in my drawingroom and all the rest of my books fit very well into the study                             to mr carlyle  july 6thno books have come in my way but emersons which i value full as much as you though as yet i have read only some corners of it we have had an election here of the usual stamp to me a droll realized ideal after my late metrical adventures in that line but the oddest sign of the times i know is a cheap translation of strausss leben jesu now publishing in numbers and said to be circulating far and wide what doesor rather what does notthis portend   with the poem called the election here alluded to which had been more than once revised and reconsidered he was still under some hesitations but at last had wellnigh resolved as from the first it was clear he would do on publishing it this occupied some occasional portion of his thoughts but his grand private affair i believe was now strafford to which or to its adjuncts all working hours were devoted sterlings notions of tragedy are high enough this is what he writes once in reference to his own task in these weeks few i fancy know how much harder it is to write a tragedy than to realize or be one every man has in his heart and lot if he pleases and too many whether they please or no all the woes of oedipus and antigone but it takes the one the sophocles of a thousand years to utter these in the full depth and harmony of creative song curious by the way how that dramatic form of the old greek with only some superficial changes remains a law not only for the stage but for the thoughts of all poets and what a charm it has even for the reader who never saw a theatre the greek plays and shakspeare have interested a hundred as books for one who has seen their writings acted how lightly does the mere clown the idle schoolgirl build a private theatre in the fancy and laugh or weep with falstaff and macbeth with how entire an oblivion of the artificial nature of the whole contrivance which thus compels them to be their own architects machinists scenepainters and actors in fact the artifice succeedsbecomes grounded in the substance of the soul and every one loves to feel how he is thus brought face to face with the brave the fair the woful and the great of all past ages looks into their eyes and feels the beatings of their hearts and reads over the shoulder the secret written tablets of the busiest and the largest brains while the juggler by whose cunning the whole strange beautiful absurdity is set in motion keeps himself hidden sings loud with a mouth unmoving as that of a statue and makes the human race cheat itself unanimously and delightfully by the illusion that he preordains while as an obscure fate he sits invisible and hardly lets his being be divined by those who cannot flee him the lyric art is childish and the epic barbarous compared to this but of the true and perfect drama it may be said as of even higher mysteries who is sufficient for these thingson this tragedy of strafford writing it and again writing it studying for it and bending himself with his whole strength to do his best on it he expended many strenuous monthsabove a year of his life he computes in all  for the rest what falmouth has to give him he is willing to take and mingles freely in it in hares collection there is given a lecture which he read in autumn 1841 mr hare says 1842 by mistake to a certain public institution in the placeof which more anona piece interesting in this if not much in any other respect doubtless his friends the foxes were at the heart of that lecturing enterprise and had urged and solicited him something like proficiency in certain branches of science as i have understood characterized one or more of this estimable family love of knowledge taste for art wish to consort with wisdom and wise men were the tendencies of all to opulent means superadd the quaker beneficence quaker purity and reverence there is a circle in which wise men also may love to be sterling made acquaintance here with whatever of notable in worthy persons or things might be afoot in those parts and was led thereby now and then into pleasant reunions in new circles of activity which might otherwise have continued foreign to him the good calvert too was now here and intended to remainwhich he mostly did henceforth lodging in sterlings neighborhood so long as lodging in this world was permitted him still good and clear and cheerful still a lively comrade within doors or withouta diligent rider alwaysthough now wearing visibly weaker and less able to exert himself  among those accidental falmouth reunions perhaps the notablest for sterling occurred in this his first season there is in falmouth an association called the cornwall polytechnic society established about twenty years ago and supported by the wealthy people of the town and neighborhood for the encouragement of the arts in that region it has its library its museum some kind of annual exhibition withal gives prizes publishes reports the main patrons i believe are sir charles lemon a wellknown country gentleman of those parts and the messrs fox to this so far as he liked to go in it sterling was sure to be introduced and solicited the polytechnic meeting of 1841 was unusually distinguished and sterlings part in it formed one of the pleasant occurrences for him in falmouth it was here that among other profitable as well as pleasant things he made acquaintance with professor owen an event of which i too had my benefit in due time and still have the bigger assemblage called british association which met at plymouth this year having now just finished its affairs there owen and other distinguished persons had taken falmouth in their route from it sterlings account of this polytechnic gala still remainsin three letters to his father which omitting the extraneous portions i will give in oneas a piece worth reading among those stilllife pictures            to edward sterling esq knightsbridge london                                          falmouth 10th august 1841  my dear fatheri was not well for a day or two after you went and since i have been busy about an annual show of the polytechnic society here in which my friends take much interest and for which i have been acting as one of the judges in the department of the fine arts and have written a little report for them as i have not said that falmouth is as eminent as athens or florence perhaps the committee will not adopt my statement but if they do it will be of some use for i have hinted as delicately as possible that people should not paint historical pictures before they have the power of drawing a decent outline of a pig or a cabbage i saw sir charles lemon yesterday who was kind as well as civil in his manner and promises to be a pleasant neighbor there are several of the british association heroes here but not whewell or any one whom i know  august 17that the polytechnic meeting here we had several very eminent men among others professor owen said to be the first of comparative anatomists and conybeare the geologist both of these gave evening lectures and after conybeares at which i happened to be present i said i would if they chose make some remarks on the busts which happened to be standing there intended for prizes in the department of the fine arts they agreed gladly the heads were homer pericles augustus dante and michael angelo i got into the boxlike platform with these on a shelf before me and began a talk which must have lasted some three quarters of an hour describing partly the characters and circumstances of the men illustrated by anecdotes and compared with their physiognomies and partly the several styles of sculpture exhibited in the casts referring these to what i considered the true principles of the art the subject was one that interests me and i got on in famous style and had both pit and galleries all applauding in a way that had had no precedent during any other part of the meeting conybeare paid me high compliments owen looked much pleasedan honor well purchased by a years hard workand everybody in short seemed delighted susan was not there and i had nothing to make me nervous so that i worked away freely and got vigorously over the ground after so many years disuse of rhetoric it was a pleasant surprise to myself to find that i could still handle the old weapons without awkwardness more by good luck than good guidance it has done my health no harm i have been at sir charles lemons though only to pay a morning visit having declined to stay there or dine the hours not suiting me they were very civil the person i saw most of was his sister lady dunstanville a pleasant wellinformed and wellbred woman he seems a most amiable kindly man of fair good sense and cultivated tastesi had a letter today from my mother in scotland who says she sent you one which you were to forward me which i hope soon to have  august 29thi returned yesterday from carclew sir c lemons fine place about five miles off where i had been staying a couple of days with apparently the heartiest welcome susan was asked but wanting a governess could not leave home  sir charles is a

apparent force and downrightness of mind combined with much simplicity and frankness  nothing could be pleasanter and easier than the habits of life with what to me was a very unusual degree of luxury though probably nothing but what is common among people of large fortune the library and pictures are nothing extraordinary the general tone of good nature good sense and quiet freedom was what struck me most and i think besides this there was a disposition to be cordially courteous towards me  i took edward a ride of two hours yesterday on calverts pony and he is improving fast in horsemanship the

little matter in which sterling and principally the misses fox bright cheery young creatures were concerned which for the sake of its human interest is worth mention in a certain cornish mine said the newspapers duly specifying it two miners deep down in the shaft were engaged putting in a shot for blasting they had completed their affair and were about to give the signal for being hoisted upone at a time was all their coadjutor at the top could manage and the second was to kindle the match and then mount with all speed now it chanced while they were both still below one of them thought the match too long tried to break it shorter took a couple of stones a flat and a sharp to cut it shorter did cut it of the due length but horrible to relate kindled it at the same time and both were still below both shouted vehemently to the coadjutor at the windlass both sprang at the basket the windlass man could not move it with them both here was a moment for poor miner jack and miner will instant horrible death hangs over bothwhen will generously resigns himself go aloft jack and sits down away in one minute i shall be in heaven jack bounds aloft the explosion instantly follows bruises his face as he looks over he is safe above ground and poor will descending eagerly they find will too as if by miracle buried under rocks which had arched themselves over him and little injured he too is brought up safe and all ends joyfully say the newspapers  such a piece of manful promptitude and salutary human heroism was worth investigating it was investigated found to be accurate to the letterwith this addition and explanation that will an honest ignorant good man entirely given up to methodism had been perfect in the faith of assurance certain that he should get to heaven if he died certain that jack would not which had been the ground of his decision in that great momentfor the rest that he much wished to learn reading and writing and find some way of life above ground instead of below by aid of the misses fox and the rest of that family a subscription modest antihudson testimonial was raised to this methodist hero he emerged into daylight with fifty pounds in his pocket did strenuously try for certain months to learn reading and writing found he could not learn those arts or either of them took his money and bought cows with it wedding at the same time some religious likely milkmaid and is last time i heard of him a prosperous modest dairyman thankful for the upper light and safety from the wrath to come sterling had some hand in this affair but as i said it was the two young ladies of the family that mainly did it  in the end of 1841 after many hesitations and revisals the election came out a tiny duodecimo without name attached 24 again inquiring of the public what its suffrage was again to little purpose my vote had never been loud for this step but neither was it quite adverse and now in reading the poor little poem over again after ten years space i find it with a touching mixture of pleasure and repentance considerably better than it then seemed to me my encouragement if not to print this poem yet to proceed with poetry since there was such a resolution for it might have been a little more decided  this is a small piece but aims at containing great things a multum in parvo after its sort and is executed here and there with undeniable success the style is free and flowing the rhyme dances along with a certain joyful triumph everything of due brevity withal that mixture of mockery on the surface which finely relieves the real earnestness within and flavors even what is not very earnest and might even be insipid otherwise is not ill managed an amalgam difficult to effect well in writing nay impossible in writingunless it stand already done and effected as a general fact in the writers mind and character which will betoken a certain ripeness there  as i said great things are intended in this little piece the motto

opposite way       now in her chamber all alone the maid      her polished limbs and shoulders disarrayed      one little taper gave the only light      one little mirror caught so dear a sight      mid hangings dusk and shadows wide she stood      like some pale nymph in darkleafed solitude      of rocks and gloomy waters all alone      where sunshine scarcely breaks on stump or stone      to scare the dreamy vision  thus did she      a star in deepest night intent but free      gleam through the eyeless darkness heeding not      her beautys praise but musing oer her lot       her garments one by one she laid aside      and then her knotted hairs long locks untied      with careless hand and down her cheeks they fell      and oer her maiden bosoms blueveined swell      the righthand fingers played amidst her hair      and with her reverie wandered here and there      the other hand sustained the only dress      that now but half concealed her loveliness      and pausing aimlessly

snowy frame      and struck from top to toe with burning dread      she blew the light out and escaped to bed 26  which also is a very pretty movement  it must be owned withal the piece is crude in parts and far enough from perfect our good painter has yet several things to learn and to unlearn his brush is not always of the finest and dashes about sometimes in a recognizably sprawling way but it hits many a feature with decisive accuracy and felicity and on the palette as usual lie the richest colors a grand merit too is the brevity of everything by no means a spontaneous or quite common merit with sterling  this new poetic duodecimo as the last had done and as the next also did met with little or no recognition from the world which was not very inexcusable on the worlds part though many a poem with far less proof of merit than this offers has run when the accidents favored it through its tens of editions and raised the writer to the demigods for a year or two if not longer such as it is we may take it as marking in its small way in a noticed or unnoticed manner a new height arrived at by sterling in his poetic course and almost as vindicating the determination he had formed to keep climbing by that method poor poem or rather promise of a poem in sterlings brave struggle this little election is the highest point he fairly lived to see attained and openly demonstrated in print his next public adventure in this kind was of inferior worth and a third which had perhaps intrinsically gone much higher than any of its antecessors was cut off as a fragment and has not hitherto been published steady courage is needed on the poetic course as on all courses  shortly after this publication in the beginning of 1842 poor calvert long a hopeless sufferer was delivered by death sterlings faithful fellowpilgrim could no more attend him in his wayfarings through this world the weary and heavyladen man had borne his burden well sterling says of him to hare since i wrote last i have lost calvert the man with whom of all others i have been during late years the most intimate simplicity benevolence practical good sense and moral earnestness were his great unfailing characteristics and no man i believe ever possessed them more entirely his illness had latterly so prostrated him both in mind and body that those who most loved him were most anxious for his departure there was something touching in this exit in the quenching of so kind and bright a little life under the dark billows of death to me he left a curious old print of james nayler the quaker which i still affectionately preserve   sterling from this greater distance came perhaps rather seldomer to london but we saw him still at moderate intervals and through his family here and other direct and indirect channels were kept in lively communication with him literature was still his constant pursuit and with encouragement or without poetic composition his chosen department therein on the ill success of the election or any ill success with the world nobody ever heard him utter the least murmur condolence upon that or any such subject might have been a questionable operation by no means called for nay my own approval higher than this of the world had been languid by no means enthusiastic but our valiant friend took all quietly and was not to be repulsed from his poetics either by the worlds coldness or by mine he labored at his strafforddetermined to labor in all ways till he felt the end of his tether in this direction  he sometimes spoke with a certain zeal of my starting a periodical why not lift up some kind of warflag against the obese platitudes and sickly superstitious aperies and impostures of the time but i had to answer who will join it my friend he seemed to say i for one and there was occasionally a transient temptation in the thought but transient only no fighting regiment with the smallest attempt towards drill cooperation commissariat or the like unspeakable advantages could be raised in sterlings time or mine which truly to honest fighters is a rather grievous want a grievous but not quite a fatal one for failing this failing all things and all men there remains the solitary battle and were it by the poorest weapon the tongue only or were it even by wise abstinence and silence and without any weapon such as each man for himself can wage while he has life an indubitable and infinitely comfortable fact for every man said battle shaped itself for sterling as we have long since seen chiefly in the poetic form in the singing or hymning rather than the speaking form and in that he was cheerfully assiduous according to his light the unfortunate strafford is far on towards completion a coeurdelion of which we shall hear farther coeurdelion greatly the best of all his poems unluckily not completed and still unpublished already hangs in the wind  his letters to friends continue copious and he has as always a loyally interested eye on whatsoever of notable is passing in the world especially on whatsoever indicates to him the spiritual condition of the world of strauss in english or in german we now hear nothing more of church matters and that only to special correspondents less and less strauss whom he used to mention had interested him only as a sign of the times in which sense alone do we find for a year or two back any notice of the church or its affairs by sterling and at last even this as good as ceases adieu o church thy road is that way mine is this in gods name adieu what we are going to says he once is abundantly obscure but what all men are going from is very plainsifted out of many pages not of sufficient interest here are one or two miscellaneous sentences about the date we are now arrived at                             to dr symonds  falmouth 3d november 1841yesterday was my weddingday eleven years of marriage and on the whole my verdict is clear for matrimony i solemnized the day by

darley has real lyrical genius taylor wonderful sense clearness and weight of purpose tennyson a rich and exquisite fancy all the other men of our tiny generation that i know of are in poetry either

numbers of the hoggarty diamond and read them with extreme delight what is there better in fielding or goldsmith the man is a true genius and with quiet and comfort might produce masterpieces that would last as long as any we have and delight millions of unborn readers there is more truth and nature in one of these papers than in all s novels togetherthackeray always a close friend of the

of coleridges little book on inspirationgreat part of the obscurity of the letters arises from his anxiety to avoid the difficulties and absurdities of the common views and his panic terror of saying anything that bishops and good people would disapprove he paid a heavy price viz all his own candor and simplicity in hope of gaining the favor of persons like lady  and you see what his reward is a good lesson for us all                              to the same  february 1st 1842english toryism has even in my eyes about as much to say for itself as any other form of doctrine but irish toryism is the downright proclamation of brutal injustice and all in the name of god and the bible it is almost enough to make one turn mahometan but for the fear of the four wives                             to his father  march 12th 1842 important to me as these matters are it almost seems as if there were something unfeeling in writing of them under the pressure of such news as ours from india if the cabool troops have perished england has not received such a blow from an enemy nor anything approaching it since buckinghams expedition to the isle of rhe walcheren destroyed us by climate and corunna with all its losses had much of glory but here we are dismally injured by mere barbarians in a war on our part shamefully unjust as well as foolish a combination of disgrace and calamity that would have shocked augustus even more than the defeat of varus one of the four officers with macnaghten was george lawrence a brotherinlaw of nat barton a distinguished man and the father of five totally unprovided children he is a prisoner if not since murdered macnaghten i do not pity he was the prime author of the whole mad war but burnes and the women and our regiments india however i feel sure is

arabs lovesong o ghalia if my father were a jackass i would sell him to purchase ghalia a beautiful parallel to the french avec cette sauce on mangerait son pere    chapter iv naples poems  in the bleak weather of this spring 1842 he was again abroad for a little while partly from necessity or at least utility and partly as i guess because these circumstances favored and he could with a good countenance indulge a little wish he had long had in the italian tour which ended suddenly by mrs sterlings illness recalling him he had missed naples a loss which he always thought to be considerable and which from time to time he had formed little projects failures hitherto for supplying the rigors of spring were always dangerous to him in england and it was always of advantage to get out of them and then the sight of naples too this always a thing to be done some day was now possible enough with the real or imaginary hope of bettering himself in health and the certain one of seeing naples and catching a glance of italy again he now made a run thither it was not long after calverts death the tragedy of strafford lay finished in his desk several things sad and bright were finished a little intermezzo of ramble was not unadvisable  his tour by water and by land was brief and rapid enough hardly above two months in all of which the following letters will with some abridgment give us what details are needful                  to charles barton esq leamington                                           falmouth 25th march 1842  my dear charlesmy attempts to shoot you flying with my paper pellets turned out very ill i hope young ladies succeed better when they happen to make appointments with you even now i hardly know whether you have received a letter i wrote on sunday last and addressed to the cavendish i sent it thither by susans advice  in this missivehappily for us both it did not contain a hundredpound note or any trifle of that kindi informed you that i was compelled to plan an expedition towards the south pole stopping however in the mediterranean and that i designed leaving this on monday next for cadiz or gibraltar and then going on to malta whence italy and sicily would be accessible of course your company would be a great pleasure if it were possible for you to join me the delay in hearing from you through no fault of yours has naturally put me out a little but on the whole my plan still holds and i shall leave this on monday for gibraltar where the great liverpool will catch me and carry me to malta the great liverpool leaves southampton on the 1st of april and falmouth on the 2d and will reach gibraltar in from four to five days  now if you should be able and disposed to join me you have only to embark in that sumptuous teakettle and pick me up under the guns of the rock we could then cruise on to malta sicily naples rome c a discretion it is just possible though extremely improbable that my steamer of monday most likely the montrose may not reach gibraltar so soon as the liverpool if so and if you should actually be on board you must stop at gibraltar but there are ninetynine chances to one against this write at all events to susan to let her know what you propose  i do not wait till the great liverpool goes because the object for me is to get into a warm climate as soon as possible i am decidedly better                        your affectionate brother                                                       john sterling  barton did not go with him none went but he arrives safe and not hurt in health which is something

send you a line instead of waiting for the longer english conveyance  we reached this the day before yesterday in the evening having had a strong breeze against us for a day or two before which made me extremely uncomfortableand indeed my headache is hardly gone yet from about the 4th to the 9th of the month we had beautiful weather and i was happy enough you will see by the map that the straightest line from gibraltar to this place goes close along the african coast which accordingly we saw with the utmost clearness and found it generally a line of mountains the higher peaks and ridges covered with snow we went close in to algiers which looks strong but entirely from art the town lies on the slope of a straight coast and is not at all embayed though there is some little shelter for shipping within the mole it is a square patch of white buildings huddled together fringed with batteries and commanded by large forts on the ridge above a most uncomfortablelooking place though no doubt there are cafes and billiardrooms and a theatre withinfor the french like to have their houris c on this side of paradise if possible  our party of fifty people we had taken some on board at gibraltar broke up on reaching this never of course to meet again the greater part do not proceed to alexandria considering that there was a bundle of midshipmen ensigns c we had as much reason among us as could perhaps be looked for and from several i gained bits of information and traits of character though nothing very remarkable  i have established myself in an inn rather than go to lady louiss 27 i not feeling quite equal to company except in moderate doses i have however seen her a good deal and dine there today very privately for sir john is not quite well and they will have no guests the place however is full of official banqueting for various unimportant reasons when here before i was in much distress and anxiety on my way from rome and i suppose this it was that prevented its making the same impression on me as now when it seems really the stateliest town i have ever seen the architecture is generally of a corrupt roman kind with something of the varied and picturesque look though much more massive of our elizabethan buildings we have the finest english summer and a pellucid sky your affectionate                                                        john sterling  at naples next for three weeks was due admiration of the sceneries and antiquities bay and mountain by no means forgetting art and the museum to pozzuoli to baiae round the promontory of sorrentoabove all twice to pompeii where the elegance and classic simplicity of ancient housekeeping strikes us much and again to paestum where the temple of neptune is far the noblest building i have ever seen and makes both greek and revived roman seem quite barbaric lord ponsonby lodges in the same house with mebut of course i do not countenance an adherent of a beaten party 28or let us take this more compendious account which has much more of human in it from an onward stage ten days later               to thomas carlyle esq chelsea london                                                 rome 13th may 1842  my dear carlylei hope i wrote to you before leaving england to tell you of the necessity for my doing so though coming to italy there was little comfort in the prospect of being divided from my family and pursuits which grew on me every day however i tried to make the best of it and have gained both health and pleasure  in spite of scanty communications from england owing to the uncertainty of my position a word or two concerning you and your dear wife have reached me lately it has often occurred to me that the sight of the bay of naples of the beautiful coast from that to this place and of rome itself all bathed in summer sunshine and green with spring foliage would be some consolation to her 29 pray give her my love  i have been two days here and almost the first thing i did was to visit the protestant burialground and the graves of those i knew when here before but much as being now alone here i feel the difference there is no scene where death seems so little dreadful and miserable as in the lonelier neighborhoods of this old place all ones impressions however as to that and everything else appear to me on reflection more affected than i had for a long time any notion of by ones own isolation all the feelings and activities which family friends and occupation commonly engage are turned here in ones solitude with strange force into the channels of mere observation and contemplation and the objects one is conversant with seem to gain a tenfold significance from the abundance of spare interest one now has to bestow on them this explains to me a good deal of the peculiar effect that italy has always had on me and something of that artistic enthusiasm which i remember you used to think so singular in goethes travels darley who is as much a brooding hermit in england as here felt nothing but disappointment from a country which fills me with childish wonder and delight  of you i have received some slight notice from mrs strachey who is on her way hither and will she writes be at florence on the 15th and here before the end of the month she notices having received a letter of yours which had pleased her much she now proposes spending the summer at sorrento or thereabouts and if mere delight of landscape and climate were enough adam and eve had their courier taken them to that region might have done well enough without paradiseand not been tempted either by any tree of knowledge a kind that does not flourish in the two sicilies  the ignorance of the neapolitans from the highest to the lowest is very eminent and excites the admiration of all the rest of italy in the great building containing all the works of art and a library of 150000 volumes i asked for the best existing book a german one published ten years ago on the statues in that very collection and after a rabble of clerks and custodes got up to a dirty priest who bowing to the ground regretted they did not possess it but at last remembered that they had entered into negotiations on the subject which as yet had been unsuccessfulthe favorite device on the walls at naples is a vermilion picture of a male and female soul respectively up to the waist the waist of a soul in fire and an angel above each watering the sufferers from a wateringpot this is intended to gain alms for masses the same populace sit for hours on the mole listening to rhapsodists who recite ariosto i have seen i think five of them all within a hundred yards of each other and some sets of fiddlers to boot yet there are few parts of the world where i have seen less laughter than there the miracle of januariuss blood is on the whole my most curious experience the furious entreaties shrieks and sobs of a set of old women yelling till the miracle was successfully performed are things never to be forgotten  i spent three weeks in this most glittering of countries and saw most of the usual wondersthe paestan temples being to me much the most valuable but pompeii and all that it has yielded especially the fresco paintings have also an infinite interest when one considers that this prodigious series of beautiful designs supplied the place of our common roompapersthe wealth of poetic imagery among the ancients and the corresponding traditional variety and elegance of pictorial treatment seem equally remarkable the greek and latin books do not give one quite so fully this sort of impression because they afford no direct measure of the extent of their own diffusion but these are ornaments from the smaller class of decent houses in a little country town and the greater number of them by the slightness of the execution show very clearly that they were adapted to ordinary taste and done by mere artisans in general clearness symmetry and simplicity of feeling i cannot say that on the whole the works of raffaelle equal them though of course he has endless beauties such as we could not find unless in the great original works from which these sketches at pompeii were taken yet with all my much increased reverence for the greeks it seems more plain than ever that they had hardly anything of the peculiar devotional feeling of christianity  rome which i loved before above all the earth now delights me more than everthough at this moment there is rain falling that would not discredit oxford street the depth sincerity and splendor that there once was in the semipaganism of the old catholics comes out in st peters and its dependencies almost as grandly as does greek and roman art in the forum and the vatican galleries i wish you were here but at all events hope to see you and your wife once more during this summer                                  yours                                                       john

nigh forgotten as other influenzas are he writes to his father i have not yet met a single frenchman who could give me any rational explanation why they were all in such a confounded rage against us definite causes of quarrel a statesman may know how to deal with inasmuch as the removal of them may help to settle the dispute but it must be a puzzling task to negotiate about instincts to which class as it seems to me we must have recourse for an understanding of the present abhorrence which everybody on the other side of the channel not only feels but makes a point to boast of against the name of britain france is slowly arming especially with steam en attendant a more than possible contest in which they reckon confidently on the eager cooperation of the yankees as vice versa an american told me that his countrymen do on that of france one person at paris m  whom you know provoked me to tell him that england did not want another battle of trafalgar but if france did she might compel england to gratify herafter a couple of pleasant and profitable months he was safe home again in the first days of june and saw falmouth not under gray iron skies and whirls of march dust but bright with summer opulence and the roses coming out  it was what i call his fifth peregrinity his fifth and last he soon afterwards came up to london spent a couple of weeks with all his old vivacity among us here the aesculapian oracles it would appear gave altogether cheerful prophecy the highest medical authority expresses the most decided opinion that i have gradually mended for some years and in truth i have not for six or seven been so free from serious symptoms of illness as at present so uncertain are all oracles aesculapian and other  during this visit he made one new acquaintance which he much valued drawn thither as i guess by the wish to take counsel about strafford he writes to his clifton friend under date 1st july 1842 lockhart of the quarterly review i made my first oral acquaintance with and found him as neat clear and cutting a brain as you would expect but with an amount of knowledge good nature and liberal antibigotry that would much surprise many the tone of his children towards him seemed to me decisive of his real kindness he quite agreed with me as to the threatening seriousness of our present social perplexities and the necessity and difficulty of doing something effectual for so satisfying the manual multitude as not to overthrow all legal security  of other persons whom i saw in london continues he there are several that would much interest youthough i missed tennyson by a mere chance john mill has completely finished and sent to the bookseller his great work on logic the labor of many years of a singularly subtle patient and comprehensive mind it will be our chief speculative monument of this age mill and i could not meet above two or three times but it was with the openness and freshness of schoolboy friends though our

or comicodidactic vein had been on hand for some time the scope of it greatly deepening and expanding itself since it first took hold of him and now soon after the naples journey it rose into shape on the wider plan shaken up probably by this new excitement and indebted to calabria palermo and the mediterranean scenes for much of the vesture it had with this which opened higher hopes for him than any of his previous efforts he was now employing all his time and strengthand continued to do so this being the last effort granted him among us  already for some months strafford lay complete but how to get it from the stocks in what method to launch it the step was questionable before going to italy he had sent me the manuscript still loyal and friendly and willing to hear the worst that could be said of his poetic enterprise i had to afflict him again the good brave soul with the deliberate report that i could not accept this drama as his picture of the life of strafford or as any picture of that strange fact to which he answered with an honest manfulness in a tone which is now pathetic enough to me that he was much grieved yet much obliged and uncertain how to decide on the other hand mr hare wrote warmly eulogizing lockhart too spoke kindly though taking some exceptions it was a questionable case on the whole strafford remained for the present unlaunched and coeur delion was getting its first timbers diligently laid down so passed in peaceable seclusion in wholesome employment and endeavor the autumn and winter of 184243 on christmasday he reports to his mother  i wished to write to you yesterday but was prevented by the important business of preparing a tree in the german fashion for the children this project answered perfectly as it did last year and gave them the greatest pleasure i wish you and my father could have been here to see their merry faces johnny was in the thick of the fun and much happier than lord anson on capturing the galleon we are all going on well and quietly but with nothing very new among us the last book i have lighted on is moffats missionary labors in south africa which is worth reading there is the best collection of lion stories in it that i have ever seen but the man is also really a very good fellow and fit for something much better than most lions are he is very ignorant and mistaken in some things but has strong sense and heart and his narrative adds another to the many proofs of the enormous power of christianity on rude minds nothing can be more chaotic that is human at all than the notions of these poor blacks even after what is called their conversion but the effect is produced they do adopt pantaloons and abandon polygamy and i suppose will soon have newspapers and literary soirees    chapter v disaster on disaster  during all these years of struggle and wayfaring his fathers household at knightsbridge had stood healthful happy increasing in wealth free diligence solidity and honest prosperity a fixed sunny islet towards which in all his voyagings and overclouded roamings he could look with satisfaction as to an everopen port of refuge  the elder sterling after many battles had reached his field of conquest in these years and was to be regarded as a victorious man wealth sufficient increasing not diminishing had rewarded his labors in the times which were now in their full flower he had influence of a sort went busily among busy public men and enjoyed in the questionable form attached to journalism and anonymity a social consideration and position which were abundantly gratifying to him a singular figure of the epoch and when you came to know him which it was easy to fail of doing if you had not eyes and candid insight a gallant truly gifted and manful figure of his kind we saw much of him in this house much of all his family and had grown to love them all right wellhim too though that was the difficult part of the feat for in his irish way he played the conjurer very muchthree hundred and sixtyfive opinions in the year upon every subject as a wag once said in fact his talk ever ingenious emphatic and spirited in detail was much defective in earnestness at least in clear earnestness of purport and outcome but went tumbling as if in mere welters of explosive unreason a volcano heaving under vague deluges of scoriae ashes and imponderous pumicestones you could not say in what direction nor well whether in any not till after good study did you see the deep molten lavaflood which simmered steadily enough and showed very well by and by whither it was bound for i must say of edward sterling after all his daily explosive sophistries and fallacies of talk he had a stubborn instinctive sense of what was manful strong and worthy recognized with quick feeling the charlatan under his solemnest wig knew as clearly as any man a pusillanimous tailor in buckram an ass under the lions skin and did with his whole heart despise the same  the sudden changes of doctrine in the times which failed not to excite loud censure and indignant amazement in those days were first intelligible to you when you came to interpret them as his changes these sudden whirls from east to west on his part and total changes of party and articulate opinion at a days warning lay in the nature of the man and could not be helped products of his fiery impatience of the combined impetuosity and limitation of an intellect which did nevertheless continually gravitate towards what was loyal true and right on all manner of subjects these as i define them were the mere scoriae and pumice wreck of a steady central lavaflood which truly was volcanic and explosive to a strange degree but did rest as few others on the grand firedepths of the world thus if he stormed along ten thousand strong in the time of the reform bill indignantly denouncing toryism and its obsolete insane pretensions and then if after some experience of whig management he discerned that wellington and peel by whatever name entitled were the men to be depended on by englandthere lay in all this visible enough a deeper consistency far more important than the superficial one so much clamored after by the vulgar which is the lionsskin which is the real lion let a man if he is prudent ascertain that before speakingbut above and beyond all things let him ascertain it and stand valiantly to it when ascertained in the latter essential part of the operation edward sterling was honorably successful to a really marked degree in the former or prudential part very much the reverse as his history in the journalistic department at least was continually teaching him  an amazingly impetuous hasty explosive man this captain whirlwind as i used to call him great sensibility lay in him too a real sympathy and affectionate pity and softness which he had an overtendency to express even by tearsa singular sight in so leonine a man enemies called them maudlin and hypocritical these tears but that was nowise the complete account of them on the whole there did conspicuously lie a dash of ostentation a selfconsciousness apt to become loud and braggart over all he said and did and felt this was the alloy of the man and you had to be thankful for the abundant gold along with it  quizzing enough he got among us for all this and for the singular chiaroscuro manner of procedure like that of an archimagus cagliostro or kaiser joseph incognito which his anonymous knownunknown thunderings in the times necessitated in him and much we laughednot without explosive counterbanterings on his partbut in fine one could not do without him one knew him at heart for a right brave man by jove sir thus he would swear to you with radiant face sometimes not often by a deeper oath with persons of dignity especially with women to whom he was always very gallant he had courtly delicate manners verging towards the wiredrawn and elaborate on common occasions he bloomed out at once into jolly familiarity of the gracefully boisterous kind reminding you of messrooms and old dublin days his offhand mode of speech was always precise emphatic ingenious his laugh which was frequent rather than otherwise had a sincerity of banter but no real depth of sense for the ludicrous and soon ended if it grew too loud in a mere dissonant scream he was broad wellbuilt stout of stature had a long lowish head sharp gray eyes with large strong aquiline face to match and walked or sat in an erect decisive manner a remarkable man and playing especially in those years 183040 a remarkable part in the world  for it may be said the emphatic bigvoiced always influential and often strongly unreasonable times newspaper was the express emblem of edward sterling he more than any other man or circumstance was the times newspaper and thundered through it to the shaking of the spheres and let us assert withal that his and its influence in those days was not ill grounded but rather well that the loud manifold unreason often enough vituperated and groaned over was of the surface mostly that his conclusions unreasonable partial hasty as they might at first be gravitated irresistibly towards the right in virtue of which grand quality indeed the root of all good insight in man his times oratory found acceptance and influential audience amid the loud whirl of an england itself logically very stupid and wise chiefly by instinct  england listened to this voice as all might observe and to one who knew england and it the result was not quite a strange one and was honorable rather than otherwise to both parties a good judge of mens talents has been heard to say of edward sterling there is not a faculty of improvising equal to this in all my circle sterling rushes out into the clubs into london society rolls about all day copiously talking modish nonsense or sense and listening to the like with the multifarious miscellany of men comes home at night redacts it into a times leaderand is found to have hit the essential purport of the worlds immeasurable babblement that day with an accuracy beyond all other men this is what the multifarious babel sound did mean to say in clear words this more nearly than anything else let the most gifted intellect capable of writing epics try to write such a leader for the morning newspapers no intellect but edward sterlings can do it an improvising faculty without parallel in my experiencein this improvising faculty much more nobly developed as well as in other faculties and qualities with unexpectedly new and improved figure john sterling to the accurate observer showed himself very much the son of edward  connected with this matter a remarkable note has come into my hands honorable to the man i am writing of and in some sort to another higher man which as it may now unhappily for us all be published without scruple i will not withhold here the support by edward sterling and the times of sir robert peels first ministry and generally of peels statesmanship was a conspicuous fact in its day but the return it met with from the person chiefly interested may be considered well worth recording the following letter after meandering through i know not what intricate conduits and consultations of the mysterious entity whose address it bore came to edward sterling as the real fleshandblood proprietor and has been found among his papers it is marked private                 private to the editor of the times                                          whitehall 18th april 1835  sirhaving this day delivered into the hands of the king the seals of office i can without any imputation of an interested motive or any impediment from scrupulous feelings of delicacy express my deep sense of the powerful support which that government over which i had the honor to preside received from the times newspaper  if i do not offer the expressions of personal gratitude it is because i feel that such expressions would do injustice to the character of a support which was given exclusively on the highest and most independent grounds of public principle i can say this with perfect truth as i am addressing one whose person even is unknown to me and who during my tenure of power studiously avoided every species of intercourse which could throw a suspicion upon the motives by which he was actuated i should however be doing injustice to my own feelings if i were to retire from office without one word of acknowledgment without at least assuring you of the admiration with which i witnessed during the arduous contest in which i was engaged the daily exhibition of that extraordinary ability to which i was indebted for a support the more valuable because it was an impartial and discriminating supporti have the honor to be sir              ever your most obedient and faithful servant                                                         robert peel  to which with due loftiness and diplomatic gravity and brevity there is answer draught of answer in edward sterlings hand from the mysterious entity so honored in the following terms         to the right hon sir robert peel bart c c c  sirit gives me sincere satisfaction to learn from the letter with which you have honored me bearing yesterdays date that you estimate so highly the efforts which have been made during the last five months by the times newspaper to support the cause of rational and wholesome government which his majesty had intrusted to your guidance and that you appreciate fairly the disinterested motive of regard to the public welfare and to that alone through which this journal has been prompted to pursue a policy in accordance with that of your administration it is permit me to say by such motives only that the times ever since i have known it has been influenced whether in defence of the government of the day or in constitutional resistance to it and indeed there exist no other motives of action for a journalist compatible either with the safety of the press or with the political morality of the great bulk of its readerswith much respect i have the honor to be sir c c c                                            the editor of the times  of this note i do not think there was the least whisper during edward sterlings lifetime which fact also one likes to remember of him so ostentatious and littlereticent a man for the rest his loyal admiration of sir robert peelsanctioned and as it were almost consecrated to his mind by the great example of the duke of wellington whom he reverenced always with true heroworshipwas not a journalistic one but a most intimate authentic feeling sufficiently apparent in the very heart of his mind among the many opinions liable to three hundred and sixtyfive changes in the course of the year this in reference to peel and wellington was one which ever changed but was the same all days and hours to which equally genuine and coming still oftener to light in those times there might one other be added one and hardly more fixed contempt not unmingled with detestation for daniel oconnell this latter feeling we used often laughingly to say was his grand political principle the one firm centre where all else went revolving but internally the other also was deep and constant and indeed these were properly his two centrespoles of the same axis negative and positive the one presupposing the other  oconnell he had known in young dublin daysand surely no man could well venerate another less it was his deliberate unalterable opinion of the then great o that good would never come of him that only mischief and this in huge measure would come that however showy and adroit in rhetoric and management he was a man of incurably commonplace intellect and of no character but a hollow blustery pusillanimous and unsound one great only in maudlin patriotisms in speciosities astucitiesin the miserable gifts for becoming chief demagogos leader of a deepsunk populace towards its lands of promise which trade in any age or country and especially in the ireland of this age our indignant friend regarded and with reason as an extremely ugly one for a man he had himself zealously advocated catholic emancipation and was not without his irish patriotism very different from the orange sort but the liberator was not admirable to him and grew daily less so to an extreme degree truly his scorn of the said liberator now riding in supreme dominion on the wings of blarney devilward of a surety with the liberated all following and huzzaing his fierce gusts of wrath and abhorrence over himrose occasionally almost to the sublime we laughed often at these vehemencesand they were not wholly laughable there was something very serious and very true in them this creed of edward sterlings would not now in either pole of its axis look so strange as it then did in many quarters   during those ten years which might be defined as the culminating period of edward sterlings life his house at south place knights bridge had worn a gay and solid aspect as if built at last on the high tableland of sunshine and success the region of storms and dark weather now all victoriously traversed and lying safe below health work wages whatever is needful to a man he had in rich measure and a frank stout heart to guide the same he lived in such style as pleased him drove his own chariot up and down himself often acting as jehu and reminding you a little of times thunder even in driving consorted after a fashion with the powerful of the world saw in due vicissitude a miscellany of social faces round himpleasant parties which he liked well enough to garnish by a lord irish lord if no better might be as the banter went for the rest he loved men of worth and intellect and recognized them well whatever their title this was his own patent of worth which nature had given him a central light in the man which illuminated into a kind of beauty serious or humorous all the artificialities he had accumulated on the surface of him so rolled his days not quietly yet prosperously in manifold commerce with men at one in the morning when all had vanished into sleep his lamp was kindled in his library and there twice or thrice a week for a threehours space he launched his bolts which next morning were to shake the high places of the world  johns relation to his father when one saw john here was altogether frank joyful and amiable he ignored the times thunder for most part coldly taking the anonymous for nonextant spoke of it floutingly if he spoke at all indeed a pleasant halfbantering dialect was the common one between father and son and they especially with the gentle simplehearted justminded mother for treblevoice between them made a very pretty gleeharmony together  so had it lasted ever since poor johns voyagings began his fathers house standing always as a fixed sunny islet with safe harbor for him so it could not always last this sunny islet was now also to break and go down so many firm islets fixed pillars in his fluctuating world pillar after pillar were to break and go down till swiftly all so to speak were sunk in the dark waters and he with them our little history is now hastening to a close   in the beginning of 1843 news reached us that sterling had in his too reckless way encountered a dangerous accident maids in the room where he was were lifting a heavy table he seeing them in difficulty had snatched at the burden heaved it awaybut had broken a bloodvessel by the business and was now after extensive hemorrhage lying dangerously ill the doctors hoped the worst was over but the case was evidently serious in the same days too his mother had been seized here by some painful disease which from its continuance grew alarming sad omens for edward sterling who by this time had as good as ceased writing or working in the times having comfortably winded up his affairs there and was looking forward to a freer idle life befitting his advanced years henceforth fatal eclipse had fallen over that household of his never to be lifted off again till all darkened into night  by dint of watchful nursing john sterling got on foot once more but his mother did not recover quite the contrary her case too grew very questionable disease of the heart said the medical men at last not immediately not perhaps for a length of years dangerous to life said they but without hope of cure the poor lady suffered much and though affecting hope always grew weaker and weaker john ran up to town in march i saw him on the morrow or next day after in his own room at knightsbridge he had caught fresh cold overnight the servant having left his window up but i was charged to say nothing of it not to flutter the already troubled house he was going home again that very day and nothing ill would come of it we understood the family at falmouth his wife being now near her confinement again could at any rate comport with no long absence he was cheerful even rudely merry himself pale and ill his poor mothers cough audible occasionally through the wall very kind too and gracefully affectionate but i observed a certain grimness in his mood of mind and under his light laughter lay something unusual something stern as if already dimmed in the coming shadows of fate yes yes you are a good man but i understand they mean to appoint you to rhadamanthuss post which has been vacant for some time and you will see how you like that this was one of the things he said a strange effulgence of wild drollery flashing through the ice of earnest pain and sorrow he looked paler than usual almost for the first time i had myself a twinge of misgiving as to his own health for hitherto i had been used to blame as much as pity his fits of dangerous illness and would often angrily remonstrate with him that he might have excellent health would he but take reasonable care of himself and learn the art of sitting still alas as if he could learn it as if nature had not laid her ban on him even there and said in smiles and frowns manifoldly no that thou shalt not learn  he went that day he never saw his good true mother more very shortly afterwards in spite of doctors prophecies and affectionate illusions she grew alarmingly and soon hopelessly worse here are his last two letters to her                to mrs sterling knightsbridge london                                             falmouth 8th april 1843  dearest motheri could do you no good but it would be the greatest comfort to me if i could be near you nothing would detain me but susans condition i feel that until her confinement is over i ought to remain hereunless you wished me to go to you in which case she would be the first to send me off happily she is doing as well as possible and seems even to gain strength every day she sends her love to you  the children are all doing well i rode with edward today through some of the pleasant lanes in the neighborhood and was delighted as i have often been at the same season to see the primroses under every hedge it is pleasant to think that the maker of them can make other flowers for the gardens of his other mansions we have here a softness in the air a smoothness of the clouds and a mild sunshine that combine in lovely peace with the first green of spring and the mellow whiteness of the sails upon the quiet sea the whole aspect of the world is full of a quiet harmony that influences even ones bodily frame and seems to make ones very limbs aware of something living good and immortal in all around us knowing how you suffer and how weak you are anything is a blessing to me that helps me to rise out of confusion and grief into the sense of god and joy i could not indeed but feel how much happier i should have been this morning had you been with me and delighting as you would have done in all the little as well as the large beauty of the world but it was still a satisfaction to feel how much i owe to you of the power of perceiving meaning reality and sweetness in all healthful life and thus i could fancy that you were still near me and that i could see you as i have so often seen you looking with earnest eyes at wayside flowers  i would rather not have written what must recall your thoughts to your present sufferings but dear mother i wrote only what i felt and perhaps you would rather have it so than that i should try to find other topics i still hope to be with you before long meanwhile and always god bless you is the prayer of                          your affectionate son                                                       john sterling                              to the same                                           falmouth 12th april 1843  dearest motheri have just received my fathers letter which gives me at least the comfort of believing that you do not suffer very much pain that your mind has remained so clear and strong is an infinite blessing  i do not know anything in the world that would make up to me at all for wanting the recollection of the days i spent with you lately when i was amazed at the freshness and life of all your thoughts it brought back fardistant years in the strangest most peaceful way i felt myself walking with you in greenwich park and on the seashore at sandgate almost even i seemed a baby with you bending over me dear mother there is surely something uniting us that cannot perish i seem so sure of a love which shall last and reunite us that even the remembrance painful as that is of all my own follies and ill tempers cannot shake this faith when i think of you and know how you feel towards me and have felt for every moment of almost forty years it would be too dark to believe that we shall never meet again it was from you that i first learnt to think to feel to imagine to believe and these powers which cannot be extinguished will one day enter anew into communion with you i have bought it very dear by the prospect of losing you in this worldbut since you have been so ill everything has seemed to me holier loftier and more lasting more full of hope and final joy  it would be a very great happiness to see you once more even here but i do not know if that will be granted to me but for susans state i should not hesitate an instant as it is my duty seems to be to remain and i have no right to repine there is no sacrifice that she would not make for me and it would be too cruel to endanger her by mere anxiety on my account nothing can exceed her sympathy with my sorrow but she cannot know no one can the recollections of all you have been and done for me which now are the most sacred and deepest as well as most beautiful thoughts that abide with me may god bless you dearest mother it is much to believe that he feels for you all that you have ever felt for your children                                                        john sterling  a day or two after this on good friday 1843 his wife got happily through her confinement bringing him he writes a stout little girl who and the mother are doing as well as possible the little girl still lives and does well but for the mother there was another lot till the monday following she too did altogether well he affectionately watching her but in the course of that day some change for the worse was noticed though nothing to alarm either the doctors or him he watched by her bedside all night still without alarm but sent again in the morning tuesday morning for the doctorswho did not seem able to make much of the symptoms she appeared weak and low but made no particular complaint the london post meanwhile was announced sterling went into another room to learn what tidings of his mother it brought him returning speedily with a face which in vain strove to be calm his wife asked how at knightsbridge my mother is dead answered sterling died on sunday she is gone poor old man murmured the other thinking of old edward sterling now left alone in the world and these were her own last words in two hours more she too was dead in two hours mother and wife were suddenly both snatched away from him  it came with awful suddenness writes he to his clifton friend still for a short time i had my susan but i soon saw that the medical men were in terror and almost within half an hour of that fatal knightsbridge news i began to suspect our own pressing danger i received her last breath upon my lips her mind was much sunk and her perceptions slow but a few minutes before the last she must have caught the idea of dissolution and signed that i should kiss her she faltered painfully yes yesreturned with fervency the pressure of my lips and in a few moments her eyes began to fix her pulse to cease she too is gone from me it was tuesday morning april 18th 1843 his mother had died on the sunday before   he had loved his excellent kind mother as he ought and well might in that good heart in all the wanderings of his own there had ever been a shrine of warm pity of mothers love and blessed soft affections for him and now it was closed in the eternities forevermore his poor lifepartner too his other self who had faithfully attended him so long in all his pilgrimings cheerily footing the heavy tortuous ways along with him can follow him no farther sinks now at his side the rest of your pilgrimings alone o friendadieu adieu she too is forever hidden from his eyes and he stands on the sudden very solitary amid the tumult of fallen and falling things my little baby girl is doing well poor little wreck cast upon the seabeach of life my children require me tenfold now what i shall do is all confusion and darkness  the younger mrs sterling was a true good woman loyalhearted willing to do well and struggling wonderfully to do it amid her languors and infirmities rescuing in many ways with beautiful female heroism and adroitness what of fertility their uncertain wandering unfertile way of life still left possible and cheerily making the most of it a genial pious and harmonious fund of character was in her and withal an indolent halfunconscious force of intellect and justness and delicacy of perception which the casual acquaintance scarcely gave her credit for sterling much respected her decision in matters literary often altering and modifying where her feeling clearly went against him and in verses especially trusting to her ear which was excellent while he knew his own to be worth little i remember her melodious rich plaintive tone of voice and an exceedingly bright smile which she sometimes had effulgent with sunny gayety and true humor among other fine qualities  sterling has lost much in these two hours how much that has long been can never again be for him twice in one morning so to speak has a mighty wind smitten the corners of his house and much lies in dismal ruins round him    chapter vi ventnor death  in this sudden avalanche of sorrows sterling weak and worn as we have seen bore up manfully and with pious valor fronted what had come upon him he was not a man to yield to vain wailings or make repinings at the unalterable here was enough to be long mourned over but here for the moment was very much imperatively requiring to be done that evening he called his children round him spoke words of religious admonition and affection to them said he must now be a mother as well as father to them on the evening of the funeral writes mr hare he bade them goodnight adding these words if i am taken from you god will take care of you he had six children left to his charge two of them infants and a dark outlook ahead of them and him the good mrs maurice the childrens young aunt present at this time and often afterwards till all ended was a great consolation   falmouth it may be supposed had grown a sorrowful place to him peopled with haggard memories in his weak state and now again as had been usual with him change of place suggested itself as a desirable alleviationand indeed in some sort as a necessity he has friends here he admits to himself whose kindness is beyond all price all description but his little children if anything befell him have no relative within two hundred miles he is now sole watcher over them and his very life is so precarious nay at any rate it would appear he has to leave falmouth every spring or run the hazard of worse once more what is to be done once moreand now as it turned out for the last time  a still gentler climate greater proximity to london where his brother anthony now was and most of his friends and interests were these considerations recommended ventnor in the beautiful southeastern corner of the isle of wight where on inquiry an eligible house was found for sale the house and its surrounding piece of ground improvable both were purchased he removed thither in june of this year 1843 and set about improvements and adjustments on a frank scale by the decease of his mother he had become rich in money his share of the westindia properties having now fallen to him which added to his former incomings made a revenue he could consider ample and abundant falmouth friends looked lovingly towards him promising occasional visits old herstmonceux which he often spoke of revisiting but never did was not far off and london with all its resources and remembrances was now again accessible he resumed his work and had hopes of again achieving something  the poem of coeurdelion has been already mentioned and the wider form and aim it had got since he first took it in hand it was above a year before the date of these tragedies and changes that he had sent me a canto or couple of cantos of coeurdelion loyally again demanding my opinion harsh as it had often been on that side this time i felt right glad to answer in another tone that here was real felicity and ingenuity on the prescribed conditions a decisively rhythmic quality in this composition thought and phraseology actually dancing after a sort what the plan and scope of the work might be he had not said and i could not judge but here was a light opulence of airy fancy picturesque conception vigorous delineation all marching on as with cheerful drum and fife if without more rich and complicated forms of melody if a man would write in metre this sure enough was the way to try doing it for such encouragement from that stinted quarter sterling i doubt not was very thankful and of course it might cooperate with the inspirations from his naples tour to further him a little in this his now chief task in the way of poetry a thought which among my many almost pathetic remembrances of contradictions to his poetic tendency is pleasant for me  but on the whole it was no matter with or without encouragement he was resolute to persevere in poetry and did persevere when i think now of his modest quiet steadfastness in this business of poetry how in spite of friend and foe he silently persisted without wavering in the form of utterance he had chosen for himself and to what length he carried it and vindicated himself against us allhis character comes out in a new light to me with more of a certain central inflexibility and noble silent resolution than i had elsewhere noticed in it this summer moved by natural feelings which were sanctioned too and in a sort sanctified to him by the remembered counsel of his late wife he printed the tragedy of strafford but there was in the public no contradiction to the hard vote i had given about it the little book fell deadborn and sterling had again to take his disappointmentwhich it must be owned he cheerfully did and resolute to try it again and ever again went along with his coeurdelion as if the public had been all with him an honorable capacity to stand single against the whole world such as all men need from time to time after all who knows whether in his overclouded broken flighty way of life incapable of long hard drudgery and so shut out from the solid forms of prose this poetic form which he could well learn as he could all forms was not the suitablest for him  this work of coeurdelion he prosecuted steadfastly in his new home and indeed employed on it henceforth all the available days that were left him in this world as was already said he did not live to complete it but some eight cantos three or four of which i know to possess high worth were finished before death intervened and there he had to leave it perhaps it will yet be given to the public and in that case be better received than the others were by men of judgment and serve to put sterlings poetic pretensions on a much truer footing i can say that to readers who do prefer a poetic diet this ought to be welcome if you can contrive to love the thing which is still called poetry in these days here is a decidedly superior article in that kindricher than one of a hundred that you smilingly consume  in this same month of june 1843 while the house at ventnor was getting ready sterling was again in london for a few days of course at knightsbridge now fallen under such sad change many private matters needed to be settled by his father and brother and him captain anthony now minded to remove with his family to london and quit the military way of life had agreed to purchase the big family house which he still occupies the old man now rid of that encumbrance retired to a smaller establishment of his own came ultimately to be anthonys guest and spent his last days so he was much lamed and broken the half of his old life suddenly torn awayand other losses which he yet knew not of lay close ahead of him in a year or two the rugged old man borne down by these pressures quite gave way sank into paralytic and other infirmities and was released from lifes sorrows under his son anthonys roof in the fall of 1847the house in knightsbridge was at the time we now speak of empty except of servants anthony having returned to dublin i suppose to conclude his affairs there prior to removal john lodged in a hotel  we had our fair share of his company in this visit as in all the past ones but the intercourse i recollect was dim and broken a disastrous shadow hanging over it not to be cleared away by effort two american gentlemen acquaintances also of mine had been recommended to him by emerson most likely one morning sterling appeared here with a strenuous proposal that we should come to knightsbridge and dine with him and them objections general dissuasions were not wanting the empty dark house such needless trouble and the likebut he answered in his quizzing way nature herself prompts you when a stranger comes to give him a dinner there are servants yonder it is all easy come both of you are bound to come and accordingly we went i remember it as one of the saddest dinners though sterling talked copiously and our friends theodore parker one of them were pleasant and distinguished men all was so haggard in ones memory and half consciously in ones anticipations sad as if one had been dining in a will in the crypt of a mausoleum our conversation was waste and logical i forget quite on what not joyful and harmoniously effusive sterlings silent sadness was painfully apparent through the bright mask he had bound himself to wear withal one could notice now as on his last visit a certain sternness of mood unknown in better days as if strange gorgonfaces of earnest destiny were more and more rising round him and the time for sport were past he looked always hurried abrupt even beyond wont and indeed was i suppose overwhelmed in details of business  one evening i remember he came down hither designing to have a freer talk with us we were all sad enough and strove rather to avoid speaking of what might make us sadder before any true talk had been got into an interruption occurred some unwelcome arrival sterling abruptly rose gave me the signal to rise and we unpolitely walked away adjourning to his hotel which i recollect was in the strand near hungerford market some ancient comfortable quaintlooking place off the street where in a good warm queer old room the remainder of our colloquy was duly finished we spoke of cromwell among other things which i have now forgotten on which subject sterling was trenchant positive and in some essential points wrongas i said i would convince him some day well well answered he with a shake of the headwe parted before long bedtime for invalids being come he escorted me down certain carpeted backstairs and would not be forbidden we took leave under the dim skiesand alas little as i then dreamt of it this so far as i can calculate must have been the last time i ever saw him in the world softly as a common evening the last of the evenings had passed away and no other would come for me forevermore  through the summer he was occupied with fitting up his new residence selecting governesses servants earnestly endeavoring to set his house in order on the new footing it had now assumed extensive improvements in his garden and grounds in which he took due interest to the last were also going on his brother and mr maurice his brotherinlawespecially mrs maurice the kind sister faithfully endeavoring to be as a mother to her poor little nieceswere occasionally with him all hours available for labor on his literary tasks he employed almost exclusively i believe on coeurdelion with what energy the progress he had made in that work and in the art of poetic composition generally amid so many sore impediments best testifies i perceive his life in general lay heavier on him than it had done before his mood of mind is grown more sombreindeed the very solitude of this ventnor as a place not to speak of other solitudes must have been new and depressing but he admits no hypochondria now or ever occasionally though rarely even flashes of a kind of wild gayety break through he works steadily at his task with all the strength left him endures the past as he may and makes gallant front against the world i am going on quietly here rather than happily writes he to his friend newman sometimes quite helpless not from distinct illness but from sad thoughts and a ghastly dreaminess the heart is gone out of my life my children however are doing well and the place is cheerful and mild  from letters of this period i might select some melancholy enough but will prefer to give the following one nearly the last i can give as indicative of a less usual temper               to thomas carlyle esq chelsea london                                          ventnor 7th december 1843  my dear carlylemy irish newspaper was not meant as a hint that i wanted a letter it contained an absurd long advertisementsome project for regenerating human knowledge c c to which i prefixed my private mark a blot thinking that you might be pleased to know of a fellowlaborer somewhere in tipperary  your letter like the scriptural oilthey had no patent lamps then and used the best oil 7s per gallonhas made my face to shine there is but one person in the world i shall not tell you who from whom a letter would give me so much pleasure it would be nearly as good at pekin in the centre of the most enlightened mandarins but here at ventnor where there are few mandarins and no enlightenmentfountains in the wilderness even were they miraculous are nothing compared with your handwriting yet it is sad that you should be so melancholy i often think that though mercury was the pleasanter fellow and probably the happier saturn was the greater godrather cannibal or so but one excuses it in him as in some other heroes one knows of  it is as you say your destiny to write about cromwell and you will make a book of him at which the ears of our grandchildren will tingleand as one may hope that the ears of human nature will be growing longer and longer the tingling will be proportionately greater than we are accustomed to do what you can i fear there will be little gain from the royalists there is something very small about the biggest of them that i have ever fallen in with unless you count old hobbes a royalist  curious to see that you have them exactly preserved in the country gentlemen of our day while of the puritans not a trace remains except in history squirism had already in that day become the caput mortuum that it is now and has therefore like other mummies been able to last what was opposed to it was the life of puritanismthen on the point of disappearing and it too has left its mummy at exeter hall on the platform and elsewhere one must go back to the middle ages to see squirism as rampant and vivacious as biblicism was in the seventeenth century and i suppose our modern country gentlemen are about as near to what the old knights and barons were who fought the crusades as our modern evangelicals to the fellows who sought the lord by the light of their own pistolshots  those same crusades are now pleasant matter for me you remember or perhaps you do not a thing i once sent you about coeurdelion long since i settled to make the cantos you saw part of a larger book and worked at it last autumn and winter till i had a bad illness i am now at work on it again and go full sail like my hero there are six cantos done roughly besides what you saw i have struck out most of the absurdest couplets and given the whole a higher though still sportive tone it is becoming a kind of odyssey with a laughing and christian achilles for hero one may manage to wrap in that chivalrous brocade many things belonging to our time and capable of interesting it the thing is not bad but will require great labor only it is labor that i thoroughly like and which keeps the maggots out of ones brain until their time  i have never spoken to you never been able to speak to you of the change in my lifealmost as great one fancies as ones own death even now although it seems as if i had so much to say i cannot if one could imagine but it is no use i cannot write wisely on this matter i suppose no human being was ever devoted to another more entirely than she and that makes the change not less but more bearable it seems as if she could not be gone quite and that indeed is my faith  mr james your newengland friend was here only for a few days i saw him several times and liked him they went on the 24th of last month back to londonor so purposedbecause there is no pavement here for him to walk on i want to know where he is and thought i should be able to learn from you i gave him a note for mill who perhaps may have seen him i think this is all at present from                                  yours                                                       john sterling  of his health all this while we had heard little definite and understood that he was very quiet and careful in virtue of which grand improvement we vaguely considered all others would follow once let him learn well to be slow as the common run of men are would not all be safe and well nor through the winter or the cold spring months did bad news reach us perhaps less news of any kind than had been usual which seemed to indicate a still and wholesome way of life and work not till april 4th 1844 did the new alarm occur again on some slight accident the breaking of a bloodvessel again prostration under dangerous sickness from which this time he never rose  there had been so many sudden failings and happy risings again in our poor sterlings late course of health we had grown so accustomed to mingle blame of his impetuosity with pity for his sad overthrows we did not for many weeks quite realize to ourselves the stern fact that here at length had the peculiar fall come upon usthe last of all these falls this brittle life which had so often held together and victoriously rallied under pressures and collisions could not rally always and must one time be shivered it was not till the summer came and no improvement and not even then without lingering glimmers of hope against hope that i fairly had to own what had now come what was now day by day sternly advancing with the steadiness of time  from the first the doctors spoke despondently and sterling himself felt well that there was no longer any chance of life he had often said so in his former illnesses and thought so yet always till now with some tacit grain of counterhope he had never clearly felt so as now here is the end the great change is now hereseeing how it was then he earnestly gathered all his strength to do this last act of his tragedy as he had striven to do the others in a pious and manful manner as i believe we can say he did few men in any time more piously or manfully for about six months he sat looking steadfastly at all moments into the eyes of death he too who had eyes to see death and the terrors and eternities and surely it was with perfect courage and piety and valiant simplicity of heart that he bore himself and did and thought and suffered in this trying predicament more terrible than the usual death of men all strength left to him he still employed in working day by day the end came nearer but day by day also some new portion of his adjustments was completed by some small stage his task was nearer done his domestic and other affairs of all sorts he settled to the last item of his own papers he saved a few giving brief pertinent directions about them great quantities among which a certain autobiography begun some years ago at clifton he ruthlessly burnt judging that the best to his friends he left messages memorials of books i have a goughs camden and other relics which came to me in that way and are among my sacred possessions the very letters of his friends he sorted and returned had each friends letters made into a packet sealed with black and duly addressed for delivery when the time should come  at an early period of his illness all visitors had of course been excluded except his most intimate ones before long so soon as the end became apparent he took leave even of his father to avoid excitements and intolerable emotions and except his brother and the maurices who were generally about him coming and going none were admitted this latter form of life i think continued for above three months men were still working about his grounds of whom he took some charge needful works great and small let them not pause on account of him he still rose from bed had still some portion of his day which he could spend in his library besides business there he read a good dealearnest books the bible most earnest of books his chief favorite he still even wrote a good deal to his eldest boy now mr newmans ward who had been removed to the maurices since the beginning of this illness he addressed every day or two sometimes daily for eight or nine weeks a letter of general paternal advice and exhortation interspersing sparingly now and then such notices of his own feelings and condition as could be addressed to a boy these letters i have lately read they give beyond any he has written a noble image of the intrinsic sterlingthe same face we had long known but painted now as on the azure of eternity serene victorious divinely sad the dusts and extraneous disfigurements imprinted on it by the world now washed away one little excerpt not the best but the fittest for its neighborhood here will be welcome to the reader                 to master edward c sterling london                                   hillside ventnor 29th june 1844  my dear boywe have been going on here as quietly as possible with no event that i know of there is nothing except books to occupy me but you may suppose that my thoughts often move towards you and that i fancy what you may be doing in the great citythe greatest on the earthwhere i spent so many years of my life i first saw london when i was between eight and nine years old and then lived in or near it for the whole of the next ten and more there than anywhere else for seven years longer since then i have hardly ever been a year without seeing the place and have often lived in it for a considerable time there i grew from childhood to be a man my little brothers and sisters and since my mother died and are buried there there i first saw your mamma and was there married it seems as if in some strange way london were a part of me or i of london i think of it often not as full of noise and dust and confusion but as something silent grand and everlasting  when i fancy how you are walking in the same streets and moving along the same river that i used to watch so intently as if in a dream when younger than you arei could gladly burst into tears not of grief but with a feeling that there is no name for everything is so wonderful great and holy so sad and yet not bitter so full of death and so bordering on heaven can you understand anything of this if you can you will begin to know what a serious matter our life is how unworthy and stupid it is to trifle it away without heed what a wretched insignificant worthless creature any one comes to be who does not as soon as possible bend his whole strength as in stringing a stiff bow to doing whatever task lies first before him  we have a mist here today from the sea it reminds me of that which i used to see from my house in st vincent rolling over the great volcano and the mountains round it i used to look at it from our windows with your mamma and you a little baby in her arms  this letter is not so well written as i could wish but i hope you will be able to read it                         your affectionate papa                                                       john sterling  these letters go from june 9th to august 2d at which latter date vacationtime arrived and the boy returned to him the letters are preserved and surely well worth preserving  in this manner he wore the slow doomed months away day after day his little period of library went on waning shrinking into less and less but i think it never altogether ended till the general end camefor courage for active audacity we had all known sterling but such a fund of mild stoicism of devout patience and heroic composure we did not hitherto know in him his sufferings his sorrows all his unutterabilities in this slow agony he held right manfully down marched loyally as at the bidding of the eternal into the dread kingdoms and no voice of weakness was heard from him poor noble sterling he had struggled so high and gained so little here but this also he did gain to be a brave man and it was much  summer passed into autumn sterlings earthly businesses to the last detail of them were now all as good as done his strength too was wearing to its end his daily turn in the library shrunk now to a span he had to hold himself as if in readiness for the great voyage at any moment one other letter i must give not quite the last message i had from sterling but the last that can be inserted here a brief letter fit to be forever memorable to the receiver of it               to thomas carlyle esq chelsea london                                 hillside ventnor 10th august 1844  my dear carlylefor the first time for many months it seems possible to send you a few words merely however for remembrance and farewell on higher matters there is nothing to say i tread the common road into the great darkness without any thought of fear and with very much of hope certainty indeed i have none with regard to you and me i cannot begin to write having nothing for it but to keep shut the lid of those secrets with all the iron weights that are in my power towards me it is still more true than towards england that no man has been and done like you heaven bless you if i can lend a hand when there that will not be wanting it is all very strange but not one hundredth part so sad as it seems to the standersby  your wife knows my mind towards her and will believe it without asseverations                            yours to the last                                                       john sterling  it was a bright sunday morning when this letter came to me if in the great cathedral of immensity i did no worship that day the fault surely was my own sterling affectionately refused to see me which also was kind and wise and four days before his death there are some stanzas of verse for me written as if in starfire and immortal tears which are among my sacred possessions to be kept for myself alone  his business with the world was done the one business now to await silently what may lie in other grander worlds god is great he was wont to say god is great the maurices were now constantly near him mrs maurice assiduously watching over him on the evening of wednesday the 18th of september his brother as he did every two or three days came down found him in the old temper weak in strength but not very sensibly weaker they talked calmly together for an hour then anthony left his bedside and retired for the night not expecting any change but suddenly about eleven oclock there came a summons and alarm hurrying to his brothers room he found his brother dying and in a short while more the faint last struggle was ended and all those struggles and strenuous oftenfoiled endeavors of eightandthirty years lay hushed in death    chapter vii conclusion  sterling was of rather slim but wellboned wiry figure perhaps an inch or two from six feet in height of blonde complexion without color yet not pale or sickly darkblonde hair copious enough which he usually wore short the general aspect of him indicated freedom perfect spontaneity with a certain careless natural grace in his apparel you could notice he affected dim colors easy shapes cleanly always yet even in this not fastidious or conspicuous he sat or stood oftenest in loose sloping postures walked with long strides body carelessly bent head flung eagerly forward right hand perhaps grasping a cane and rather by the middle to swing it than by the end to use it otherwise an attitude of frank cheerful impetuosity of hopeful speed and alacrity which indeed his physiognomy on all sides of it offered as the chief expression alacrity velocity joyous ardor dwelt in the eyes too which were of brownish gray full of bright kindly life rapid and frank rather than deep or strong a smile half of kindly impatience half of real mirth often sat on his face the head was long high over the vertex in the brow of fair breadth but not high for such a man  in the voice which was of good tenor sort rapid and strikingly distinct powerful too and except in some of the higher notes harmonious there was a clearringing metallic tonewhich i often thought was wonderfully physiognomic a certain splendor beautiful but not the deepest or the softest which i could call a splendor as of burnished metalfiery valor of heart swift decisive insight and utterance then a turn for brilliant elegance also for ostentation rashness c cin short a flash as of clearglancing sharpcutting steel lay in the whole nature of the man in his heart and in his intellect marking alike the excellence and the limits of them both his laugh which on light occasions was ready and frequent had in it no great depth of gayety or sense for the ludicrous in men or things you might call it rather a good smile become vocal than a deep real laugh with his whole man i never saw him laugh a clear sense of the humorous he had as of most other things but in himself little or no true humornor did he attempt that side of things to call him deficient in sympathy would seem strange him whose radiances and resonances went thrilling over all the world and kept him in brotherly contact with all but i may say his sympathies dwelt rather with the high and sublime than with the low or ludicrous and were in any field rather light wide and lively than deep abiding or great  there is no portrait of him which tolerably resembles the miniature medallion of which mr hare has given an engraving offers us with no great truth in physical details one and not the best superficial expression of his face as if that with vacuity had been what the face contained and even that mr hares engraver has disfigured into the nearly or the utterly irrecognizable two pencilsketches which no artist could approve of hasty sketches done in some social hour one by his friend spedding one by banim the novelist whom he slightly knew and had been kind to tell a much truer story so far as they go of these his brother has engravings but these also i must suppress as inadequate for strangers   nor in the way of spiritual portraiture does there after so much writing and excerpting anything of importance remain for me to say john sterling and his life in this world weresuch as has been already said in purity of character in the socalled moralities in all manner of proprieties of conduct so as teatables and other human tribunals rule them he might be defined as perfect according to the worlds pattern in these outward tangible respects the worlds criticism of him must have been praise and that only an honorable man and good citizen discharging with unblamable correctness all functions and duties laid on him by the customs mores of the society he lived inwith correctness and something more in all these particulars a man perfectly moral or of approved virtue according to the rules  nay in the far more essential tacit virtues which are not marked on stone tables or so apt to be insisted on by human creatures over tea or elsewherein clear and perfect fidelity to truth wherever found in childlike and soldierlike pious and valiant loyalty to the highest and what of good and evil that might send himhe excelled among good men the joys and the sorrows of his lot he took with true simplicity and acquiescence like a true son not like a miserable mutinous rebel he comported himself in this universe extremity of distressand surely his fervid temper had enough of contradiction in this worldcould not tempt him into impatience at any time by no chance did you ever hear from him a whisper of those mean repinings miserable arraignings and questionings of the eternal power such as weak souls even well disposed will sometimes give way to in the pressure of their despair to the like of this he never yielded or showed the least tendency to yieldwhich surely was well on his part for the eternal power i still remark will not answer the like of this but silently and terribly accounts it impious blasphemous and damnable and now as heretofore will visit it as such not a rebel but a son i said willing to suffer when heaven said thou shaltand withal what is perhaps rarer in such a combination willing to rejoice also and right cheerily taking the good that was sent whensoever or in whatever form it came  a pious soul we may justly call him devoutly submissive to the will of the supreme in all things the highest and sole essential form which religion can assume in man and without which all forms of religion are a mockery and a delusion in man doubtless in so clear and filial a heart there must have dwelt the perennial feeling of silent worship which silent feeling as we have seen he was eager enough to express by all good ways of utterance zealously adopting such appointed forms and creeds as the dignitaries of the world had fixed upon and solemnly named recommendable prostrating his heart in such church by such accredited rituals and seemingly fit or halffit methods as his poor time and country had to offer himnot rejecting the said methods till they stood convicted of palpable unfitness and then doing it right gently withal rather letting them drop as pitiably dead for him than angrily hurling them out of doors as needing to be killed by few englishmen of his epoch had the thing called church of england been more loyally appealed to as a spiritual mother  and yet as i said before it may be questioned whether piety what we call devotion or worship was the principle deepest in him in spite of his coleridge discipleship and his once headlong operations following thereon i used to judge that his piety was prompt and pure rather than great or intense that on the whole religious devotion was not the deepest element of him his reverence was ardent and just ever ready for the thing or man that deserved revering or seemed to deserve it but he was of too joyful light and hoping a nature to go to the depths of that feeling much more to dwell perennially in it he had no fear in his composition terror and awe did not blend with his respect of anything in no scene or epoch could he have been a church saint a fanatic enthusiast or have worn out his life in passive martyrdom sitting patient in his grim coalmine looking at the three ells of heaven high overhead there in sorrow he would not dwell all sorrow he swiftly subdued and shook away from him how could you have made an indian fakir of the greek apollo whose bright eye lends brightness and never yet saw a shadowi should say not religious reverence rather artistic admiration was the essential character of him a fact connected with all other facts in the physiognomy of his life and self and giving a tragic enough character to much of the history he had among us  poor sterling he was by nature appointed for a poet thena poet after his sort or recognizer and delineator of the beautiful and not for a priest at all striving towards the sunny heights out of such a level and through such an element as ours in these days is he had strange aberrations appointed him and painful wanderings amid the miserable gaslights bogfires dancing meteors and putrid phosphorescences which form the guidance of a young human soul at present not till after trying all manner of sublimely illuminated places and finding that the basis of them was putridity artificial gas and quaking bog did he when his strength was all done discover his true sacred hill and passionately climb thither while life was fast ebbinga tragic history as all histories are yet a gallant brave and noble one as not many are it is what to a radiant son of the muses and bright messenger of the harmonious wisdoms this poor worldif he himself have not strength enough and inertia enough and amid his harmonious eloquences silence enoughhas provided at present many a highstriving too hasty soul seeking guidance towards eternal excellence from the official blackartists and successful professors of political ecclesiastical philosophical commercial general and particular legerdemain will recognize his own history in this image of a fellowpilgrims  overhaste was sterlings continual fault overhaste and want of the due strengthalas mere want of the due inertia chiefly which is so common a gift for most part and proves so inexorably needful withal but he was good and generous and true joyful where there was joy patient and silent where endurance was required of him shook innumerable sorrows and thickcrowding forms of pain gallantly away from him fared frankly forward and with scrupulous care to tread on no ones toes true above all one may call him a man of perfect veracity in thought word and deed integrity towards all mennay integrity had ripened with him into chivalrous generosity there was no guile or baseness anywhere found in him transparent as crystal he could not hide anything sinister if such there had been to hide a more perfectly transparent soul i have never known it was beautiful to read all those interior movements the little shades of affectations ostentations transient spurts of anger which never grew to the length of settled spleen all so naive so childlike the very faults grew beautiful to you  and so he played his part among us and has now ended it in this first half of the nineteenth century such was the shape of human destinies the world and he made out between them he sleeps now in the little buryingground of bonchurch bright everyoung in the memory of others that must grow old and was honorably released from his toils before the hottest of the day   all that remains in palpable shape of john sterlings activities in this world are those two poor volumes scattered fragments gathered from the general waste of forgotten ephemera by the piety of a friend an inconsiderable memorial not pretending to have achieved greatness only disclosing mournfully to the more observant that a promise of greatness was there like other such lives like all lives this is a tragedy high hopes noble efforts under thickening difficulties and impediments evernew nobleness of valiant effortand the result death with conquests by no means corresponding a life which cannot challenge the worlds attention yet which does modestly solicit it and perhaps on clear study will be found to reward it  on good evidence let the world understand that here was a remarkable soul born into it who more than others sensible to its influences took intensely into him such tint and shape of feature as the world had to offer there and then fashioning himself eagerly by whatsoever of noble presented itself participating ardently in the worlds battle and suffering deeply in its bewildermentswhose lifepilgrimage accordingly is an emblem unusually significant of the worlds own during those years of his a man of infinite susceptivity who caught everywhere more than others the color of the element he lived in the infection of all that was or appeared honorable beautiful and manful in the tendencies of his timewhose history therefore is beyond others emblematic of that of his time  in sterlings writings and actions were they capable of being well read we consider that there is for all true hearts and especially for young noble seekers and strivers towards what is highest a mirror in which some shadow of themselves and of their immeasurably complex arena will profitably present itself here also is one encompassed and struggling even as they now are this man also had said to himself not in mere catechismwords but with all his instincts and the question thrilled in every nerve of him and pulsed in every drop of his blood what is the chief end of man behold i too would live and work as beseems a denizen of this universe a child of the highest god by what means is a noble life still possible for me here ye heavens and thou earth oh howthe history of this longcontinued prayer and endeavor lasting in various figures for near forty years may now and for some time coming have something to say to men   nay what of men or of the world here visible to myself for some while was a brilliant human presence distinguishable honorable and lovable amid the dim common populations among the million little beautiful once more a beautiful human soul whom i among others recognized and lovingly walked with while the years and the hours were sitting now by his tomb in thoughtful mood the new times bring a new duty for me why write the life of sterling i imagine i had a commission higher than the worlds the dictate of nature
