chapter xxxi   brooke is forgiven                   431     a damaged reputation     i  brooke pauses to reflect   it was a still hot night and the moon hung round and full above the cedars when rancher brooke sat in his comfortless shanty with a whisky bottle at his hand the door stood open and the drowsy fragrance of the coniferous forest stole into the room while when he glanced in that direction he could see hemlock and cedar redwood and balsam tower great black spires against the luminous blueness of the night far above them gleamed the untrodden snow that clothed the great peaks with spotless purity but this was melting fast under the autumn sun and the river that swirled by the shanty sang noisily among the boulders  there are few more beautiful valleys than that one among all the ranges of british columbia but its wild grandeur made little impression upon brooke that night he felt that a crisis in his affairs was at hand and he must face it boldly or go under once for all for it was borne in upon him that he had already drifted perilously far his face however grew a trifle grim and his fingers closed irresolutely on the neck of the bottle for drifting was easy in that country and pleasant so long as one did not remember  even when the great peaks were rolled in tempest cloud the snow fell but lightly among the quatomac pines bright sunlight shone on them for weeks together and it was but seldom a cold blast whipped the still blue lake where the shadows of the cedars that distilled ambrosial essences lay asleep there were deer and blue grouse in the woods salmon in the river and big trout in the lake and the deleterious whisky purveyed at the nearest settlement was not inordinately dear it had however dawned on brooke by degrees that there were many things he could not find at quatomac which men of his upbringing hold necessary  in the meanwhile his sole comrade jimmy who assisted him to loaf the greater part of every day away watched him with a curious little smile jimmy was big looselimbed and slouching but in his own way he was wise and he had seen more than one young englishman of brookes description take the downgrade in that colony  feeling kind of low tonight he said suggestively now id have been quite lively if tom gordons bella had made up to me bellas nice to look at and most as smart with the axe as a good many men i know i guess if you got her you wouldnt have anything to do  brookes bronzed face flushed a trifle as he saw his comrades grin for it was what had passed between him and tom gordons bella at the settlement that afternoon which had thrust before him the question what his life was to be he had also not surmised that jimmy or anybody else beyond themselves had been present at that meeting among the pines bella was certainly pretty and wholly untaught while though he had made no attempts to gain her favor they had not been necessary since the maid had with disconcerting frankness conferred it upon him she had in fact made it evident that she considered him her property and brooke wondered uneasily how far he had tacitly accepted the position his irresponsive coolness had proved no deterrent he could neither be brutal nor continually run away and there were times when he had almost resigned himself to the prospect of spending the rest of his life with her though he fancied he realized what the result of that would be the woman had the waywardness and wildness of the creatures of the forest and almost as little sensibility while he was unpleasantly conscious that he was already sinking fast to her level with a soulless mate swayed by primitive instincts and passions and a little further indulgence in bad whisky it was evident that he might very well sink a good deal further and brooke had once had his ideals and aspirations  jimmy he said slowly im thinking of going away  jimmy shook out his corncob pipe and apparently ruminated well id most have expected it he said the question is where youre going to and what youre going to do you dont get your grub for nothing everywhere and livings cheap here it only costs the cartridges and the deerhides pay the tea and flour besides you put a pile of dollars into this place didnt you  most of six thousand and ive taken about two hundred out of course i was a fool  jimmy nodded with a tranquil concurrence which his comrade might not have been pleased with at another time  bought it on survey without looking at it he said going to make your fortune growing fruit its kind of unfortunate that big peaches and california plums dont grow on rocks  brooke sat moodily silent awhile he had as his comrade had mentioned bought the four hundred acres of virgin soil without examining it which is not such an especially unusual proceeding on the part of newlyarrived young englishmen and partly explains why some landagency companies pay big dividends for twelve months he had toiled with hope strenuously hewing down the great redwoods which cumbered his possessions and expended the rest of his scanty capital in hiring assistance it was only in the second year that the truth dawned on him and he commenced to realize that treble the sum he could lay hands upon would not clear the land and that in all probability it would grow nothing worth marketing then in the meanwhile something had happened which made it easier for him to accept the inevitable and losing hold of hope he had made the most of the present and ignored the future it was sufficient that the forest and the river fed him during most of the year and he could earn a few dollars hewing trails for the government when they did not his aspirations had vanished and he dwelt almost if not quite content in a state of apathetic resignation which is not wholesome for the educated englishman  it was jimmy who broke the silence  what was it you done back there in england i never asked you before he said  brooke smiled somewhat drily for it was not a very unusual question in that country nothing the police could lay hands on me for i only quarrelled with my bread and butter i had plenty of it at one time you see  that means the folks who gave it you said jimmy  exactly it was the evident duty of one of them to leave me his property and i think he would have done it only he insisted on me taking a wife he had fixed upon as suitable along with it there was however the difficulty that i had made my own choice in the meanwhile i believe the old man was right now though i did not think so then and when we had words on the subject i came out to make a home for the other woman here  and you let up after two years of it  i did said brooke with a trace of bitterness the girl however did not wait so long before id been gone half the time she married a richer man  jimmy nodded there are women made that way he said reflectively still you wouldnt have to worry bout bella once you showed her who was to do the bossingwith a nice handy strapshed stick to you good and tight and most scratch the eyes out of any one who said a word against her husband still i figure shes not quite the kind of woman you would have married in the old country  that was very evident and brooke sat silent while the memories of his life in the land he had left crowded upon him he also recoiled from the brutality of the one his comrade had pictured him leading with the maid of the bush though it had seemed less appalling when she stood before him vigorous and comely a few hours ago he had however made no advances to her on that point at least his mind was clear and now he realized clearly what the result of such a match must be yet he knew his own loneliness and the maids pertinacity and once more it was borne in upon him that to stay where he was would mean disaster rising abruptly he flung the bottle out into the night and then while jimmy stared at him with astonishment and indignation laughed curiously as he heard it crash against a stone  thats the commencement of the change he said after this ill pitch every bottle you bring up from the settlement into the river  well said jimmy resignedly i guess i can bring the whisky up inside of me and youd get hurt considerable if you tried slinging me into the river the trouble is however id be seeing panthers all the way up whenever i brought along a little extra and im most scared of panthers when they arent there  brooke laughed again for as he had discovered men take life lightly in that country but just then the soft beat of horse hoofs rose from across the river and a cry came out of the darkness  strangers said jimmy quite a crowd of them with the river coming down as shes doing its a risky ford well have to go across  they went rather more than waistdeep in the snowwater which swirled frothing about them for the ford was perilous with a big black pool close below and found a mounted party waiting them on the other side there was an elderly man who sat very straight in his saddle with his hand on his hip and brooke at least recognized the bearing of one who had commanded cavalry in the old country there was also a younger man dismounted and smoking a cigarette two girls on cayuse ponies and an indian whose appearance suggested inebriation holding the bridles of the baggage mules the men were certainly not ranchers or timberright prospectors but now and then of late a fishing party had passed that way into the wilderness  i understand the ford is not very safe and the indian has contrived to leave our tents behind said the older man if you can take us across and find the ladies at least shelter of any kind for the night it would be a kindness for which i should be glad to make any suitable recompense  jimmy grinned for it was evident that the speaker was an insular englishman and quite unacquainted with the customs of that country wherein no rancher accepts payment for a nights hospitality brooke had however a certain sense of humor and touched his big shapeless hat which is also never done in western canada  they can have it sir he said that is if theyre not very particular take the ladys bridle jimmy keep behind him sir  jimmy did as he was bidden and brooke seized the bridle of the cayuse the other girl rode the halftamed beast however objected to entering the water and edged away from it then rose with forehoofs in the air while brooke smote it on the nostrils with his fist the girl he noticed said nothing and showed no sign of fear though the rest were halfway across before he had an opportunity of doing more than cast a glance at her then as he stood waistdeep in water patting the trembling beast he looked up  i hope youre not afraid he said it will be a trifle deeper presently  he stopped with a curious abruptness as she turned her head and stood still with his hand on the bridle a moment or two gazing at her she sat lithe and slim but very shapely with the skirt of the loose light habit she had gathered in one hand just clear of the sliding foam and revealing the little foot in the stirrup the moon which hung round and full behind her shoulder touched one side of the face beneath the big white hat with silvery light that emphasized the ivory gleam of the firm white neck he could also just catch the sparkle of her eyes in the shadow and her freshness and daintiness came upon him as a revelation it was so long since he had seen a girl of the station she evidently belonged to then she laughed and it seemed to him that her voice was in keeping with her appearance for it reached him through the clamor of the river soft and musical  oh no she said what are we stopping for  brooke who had seldom been at a loss for a neat rejoinder in england felt his face grow hot as he smote the ponys neck  i really dont know i think it was the cayuse stopped he said  the girl smiled one would fancy that the water was a trifle too cold for even a pony of that kind to be anxious to stay in it  they went on with a plunge and a flounder and twice brooke came near being swept off his feet for the pony seemed bent on taking the shortest way to the other bank which was as it happened not quite the safest one still they came through the river and brooke dragged the cayuse up the bank in time to see the rest disappear into the shanty then he boldly held up his hand and felt a curious little thrill run through him as he swung his companion down  it was very good of you to come across for us and i am afraid you must be very wet she said this is really a quite inadequate recompense  then she turned and left him with the pony staring vaguely after her flushed in face with a big piece of minted silver in his hand it was at least a minute before he slipped it into his pocket with a curious little laugh  this is almost too much and i dont know what has come over me there was a time when i would have been quite equal to the occasion he said  then he turned away to the stables where jimmy who came in with an armful of clothing found him rubbing down the cayuse with unusual solicitude in spite of its attempts to kick him  i guess youll have to change he said those things arent decent and you can put the deerskin ones on the old mans a hightoned englishman going camping and fishing and by what she said the younger girls struck on frontiersmen when you get into that jacket youll look the real thing  brooke had no great desire to look like one of the picturesque desperadoes who are somewhat erroneously supposed in england to wander about the pacific slope but as he mended his own clothes with any convenient piece of flour bag he saw that his comrades advice was good  when he entered the shanty jimmy had supper ready but he realized as he had never done since he raised its log walls the comfortless squalor of the room the red dust had blown into it it was littered with discarded clothing lines and traps and broken boots while two candles which flickered in the draughts stuck in whisky bottles furnished uncertain illumination he had made the unsteady table and jimmy had made the chairs but the result was no great credit to either of them while nobody who was not very hungry would have considered the meal his comrade laid out inviting still his guests had evidently no fault to find with it and during it the girl whose pony he had led once or twice glanced covertly at him  she saw a tall man with a bronzed face of not unpleasant english type attired picturesquely in fringed deerskin which had crossed the mountains from the prairie he had grey eyes and his hair was crisped by the sun but while he was she decided distinctly personable and still young there was something in his expression which puzzled her it was neither diffidence nor embarrassment and yet there was a suggestion of constraint about him which his comrade was wholly free from brooke on his part saw a girl with brown eyes and hair who held herself well and had a faint suggestion of imperiousness about her and wondered with an uneasiness he was by no means accustomed to what she thought of him since he felt that the condition of his dwelling must show her the shiftless life he led still he shook off that thought and others that troubled him and played his part as host talking with a purpose only of the canadian bush until when the meal was over jimmy who felt himself being left out turned to the guests  a little whisky would have come in to settle those fried potatoes down he said i would have offered you some but my partner here slung the bottle into the river just before you came  there was a trace of a smile in the face of the greyhaired man but the girl with the brown eyes looked up sharply and once more brooke felt his face grow a trifle hot men do not as a rule fling whisky bottles into rivers without a cogent reason especially in canada where liquor is scarce he was however both astonished and annoyed at himself that he should attach the slightest value to this strangers good opinion  then when the others seconded jimmys suggestion he took a dingy fiddle from its case and although there is little a rancher of that country will not do for the pleasure of a chance guest wondered why he had complied so readily he played frenchcanadian dances as the inhabitants play them and though only some of them may be classed as music became sensible that there was a curious silence of attention  that violin has a beautiful mellow tone said the younger girl whom he had scarcely noticed i am however quite aware that there is a good deal in the bowing  it might have said jimmy who disregarded his comrades glance there was once a man came along here who said it would fetch the most of one thousand dollars still every old canadian lumberman can play those things and you ought to hear him on the one he calls the chopping play it for them and ill open the door so they can see the night and hear the river singing  the military gentleman stared at him and even the girl with the brown eyes who was very reposeful appeared surprised at this flight of fancy which nobody would from his appearance have expected of jimmy  the chopping oh yes of course i understand she said this is the place of all places for it we have never heard it in such surroundings  brooke smiled a little im afraid it is difficult to get moonlight and mystery out of an american steel first string he said one cant keep it from screaming on the shifting  he drew the bow across the strings and save for the fret of the snowfed river which rose and fell in deep undertone there was a curious silence in the room the younger girl watched the player with grave appreciation in her eyes and a little flush crept into her companions cheek perhaps she was thinking of the dollar she had given the man who could play the famous nocturne as she had rarely heard it played before and owned what though she could scarcely believe it to be a genuine cremona was evidently an old italian fiddle of no mean value there was also silence for at least a minute after he had laid down the bow and then brooke held out the violin to the girl who had praised its tone  would you care to try the instrument he said  no said the girl with quiet decisiveness not after that though it is i think a better one than i have ever handled  and i fancy i should explain that she is studying under an eminent teacher who professes himself perfectly satisfied with her progress said the man with the grey hair  brooke said nothing he knew the compliment was sincere enough but he had seen the appreciation in the other girls eyes and that pleased him most then as he put away the fiddle the man turned to him again  i am far from satisfied with our siwash guide he said in fact i am by no means sure that he knows the country and as we propose making for the big lake and camping by it i should prefer to send him back if you could recommend us anybody who would take us there  brooke felt a curious little thrill of anticipation but it was the girl with the brown eyes he glanced at she of course said nothing but though it seemed preposterous brooke fancied that she knew what he was thinking and was not displeased  with your approval i would come myself sir he said there is nothing just now to keep me at the ranch  the other man professed himself pleased and before brooke retired to his couch in the stable the matter was arranged he did not however fall asleep for several hours which was a distinctly unusual thing with him and then the face of the browneyed girl followed him into his dreams its reposefulness had impressed him the more because of the hint of strength and pride behind it and again he saw her sitting fearlessly on the plunging horse in the midst of the river with the moon round and full behind her     ii  brooke takes the trail   the sun had not cleared the dark firs upon the steep hillside though the snow on the peaks across the valley glowed with saffron light when brooke came upon the girl with the brown eyes sitting on a cedar trunk beside the river and she looked up with a smile when he stopped beside her there was nobody else about for the rest of the party had apparently not risen yet and jimmy had set out to catch a trout for breakfast save for the song of the river all the pineshrouded hollow was very still  i was wondering if i might ask what you thought of this country said brooke it is of course the usual question  the girl laughed a little if you really wish to know i think it is the grandest there is on this earth as i believe it will be one of the greatest still my liking for it isnt so astonishing because although i have lived in england i am a canadian  brooke made a little deprecatory gesture its a mistake ive been led into before and im not sure you would consider it a compliment if i told you that i scarcely supposed you belonged to canada it also reminds me of a friend of mine who had spent a few months in spain and took some pains to teach a man who though he was not aware of it had lived fifteen years in cuba castilian still perhaps you will tell me what you thought of england  the girl did not invite him but she drew her skirt a trifle aside and brooke sat down upon the log beside her she looked even daintier and appealed to his fancy more in the searching morning light than she had done when the moon shone down on her which he was not altogether prepared for her eyes were clear and steady in spite of the faint smile in them and there was no uncertainty of coloring on cheek or forehead which had been tinted a delicate warm brown by wind and sun  when you came up i was just contrasting this valley with one i remember visiting in the old country she said it was in the west major hume who is with us now once took me there and we spent an afternoon at a house which i think is older than any we have in canada  in a river valley in the west country said brooke  the girl nodded yes she said ivy with stems thicker than your wrist climbs about the front of it and a lawn mown until it looks like velvet slopes to the sliding water a wall of clipped yews shuts it in and the river slides past it silently without froth or haste as though afraid that any sound it made would jar upon the drowsy quietness of the place there is a big beech wood behind it and one little meadow green as an emerald between that and the river  where the steppingstones stretch across a path comes twisting down through the dimness of the wood and there are black firs upon the ridge above  of course said the girl that is beyond the ash polesbut how could you know  brooke smiled curiously i was once thereever so long ago  his companion seemed a trifle astonished then i wonder if you felt as i did that those shadowy woods and dark yew hedges shut out all that is real and strenuous in life one could fancy that nobody did anything but sit still and dream there  brooke smiled a little though it had not escaped his attention that she seemed to take his comprehension for granted  well he said reflectively there was very little else one could do anything that savored of strenuousness would have been considered distinctly bad form in that valley  a little sardonic twinkle flickered in the girls eyes oh she said i know the distinction between those who work and those who idle is marked in your country it even seems to be considered a desirable thing for a man to fritter his time away so long as he does it gracefully still there is room for all ones activities and the big thoughts that lead to big schemes here how far does your ranch go  to the lake said brooke who understood the purport of the question there are four hundred acres of it and i have i dont mind telling you been here rather more than two years  the girl glanced at the very small gap in the forest and again the man guessed her thoughts  and that is all you have cleared  yes said brooke with a little smile one can lounge very successfully here still even if there was not a tree upon it the soil wouldnt be worth anything and its only in places one can find a foot or two of it when i first came in an enterprising gentleman in the land agency business sold me this wilderness of rock and gravel to feed cattle and grow fruit trees on though i fancy i am not the only confiding stranger who has been treated in the same fashion in this country  for a moment a curious expression which brooke could attach no meaning to crept into his companions face but though there was a faint flush in her cheeks it grew suddenly reposeful again  i gave you a dollar last night she said and stopped a moment i have as i told you lived in england and i recognized by your voice that you came from there but of course i hadnt  brooke smiled at her if you look at it in one light i scarcely think that explanation is gratifying to ones vanity still you have also lived in canada and you ought to know that whoever parts with a dollar in this country even under a misapprehension very rarely gets it back  the girl regarded him gravely a moment with the faint warmth still showing in her suntanned cheeks and then looked away towards the sliding water she said nothing whatever although there was a good deal to be deduced from the mans speech then she rose as major hume came out of the house  they left the ranch that day and for a week brooke led them through dark fir forests and waited on them in their camps he would also have stayed with them longer could he have found a reasonable excuse but as it happened a most exemplary siwash whom he knew appeared and offered his services when they reached the lonely mountaingirt lake then he said farewell to major hume and was plodding down the homeward trail with his packs slung about him when he met the girl coming up from the lake she carried a cluster of the crimson wineberries in her hand and stopped abruptly when she saw him she and her younger companions had been fishing that afternoon and though brooke could not see the latter amidst the serried trunks their voices broke sharply through the stillness of the evening it was significant that both he and the girl stood still without speaking until the voices grew less distinct  then she said quietly so you are going away  yes said brooke a trifle grimly an indian i can recommend came in this afternoon that made it unnecessary for me to stay  you seem in a hurry to go  brooke made a little gesture i fancy i have stayed with major hume quite as long as is good for me the effort it cost me to go away was sufficiently unpleasant already it is you see scarcely likely that i shall ever spend a week like the past one again  there was sympathy in his companions eyes for she had seen his comfortless dwelling and guessed tolerably correctly what manner of life he led it would she realized have been easier for him had he been born a bushman for there was no doubt in her mind that he was one who had been accustomed to luxury in england  you are going back to the ranch she said  for a little while and then i shall take the trail where it will lead me is more than i know but the ranch is as great a failure as its owner and yet a monthor even a weekago i was dangerously content to stay there  the girl fancied she understood him for she had seen broken men who had lost heart in the struggle sink to the indians level and ask no more than the subsistence they could gain with rod and gun that was perhaps enough for an indian but it seemed to her a flinging of his birthright away in the case of a white man her face was quietly grave and brooke felt a little thrill run through him as he looked at her  she stood slender and very shapely with unconscious pride in her pose in front of the great cylindrical trunk of a cedar whose grey bark forced up every line of her whiteclad figure and he realized when he met the big grave eyes that he had pulled himself upon the edge of a precipice a week ago he had let himself drift recklessly during the last two years but it was plain to him now that he would have gone down once for all had he mated with bella  i think you are doing wisely she said quietly there is a chance for every man somewhere in this country  brooke smiled drily i am going to look for mine whether i shall find it i do not know but i am at least glad i have seen you otherwise i might have settled down at the ranch again  what have i to do with that decision and the girl regarded him steadily  it is a trifle difficult to explain still you see your gracious kindliness reminded me of a good deal that once was mine and after the past week i could never go back to the old life at the ranch no doubt there comes to every one who attempts to console himself with them a time when the husks and sty grow nauseating i do not know why i should tell you this and scarcely think i would have done so had there been any probability of our ever meeting again  there was full comprehension in the girls eyes as well as a trace of compassion and she held out a little hand  goodbye she said quietly if they are of any value my good wishes go with you  brooke made her a little deferential inclination as the dainty fingers rested a moment in his hard palm then he swung off his big shapeless hat and turned away but the girl stood still looking after him until the lonely plodding figure faded into the shadows of the pines while it was with a little thrill of sympathy she went back to camp for she realized it was a very great compliment the man had paid her he was it seemed turning his back on his possessions and going away because she had awakened in him the latent sense of responsibility she was however also a little afraid for no one could foresee what the result of his decision would be and she felt that to help in diverting the course of anothers life was no light thing  in the meanwhile brooke held on up the hillside with long swinging strides crashing through barberry thickets and trampling the breasthigh fern until he stopped and made his camp on the edge of the snowscarped slopes when the soft darkness fell his road was rough and in places perilous but there was a relief in vigorous action now the decision was made and the old apathy fell from him as he climbed towards the peaks above it was however several days later when he reached the ranch and came upon jimmy sprawling his ungainly length outside it basking in the sun still the latter took his corncob pipe from his lips and became attentive when he saw his face this he realized was not altogether the same man who had left him a little while ago  get up said brooke almost sharply i want you to listen to me if it suits you to stay here by yourself you can in the meanwhile do what you like which will of course be very little with the ranch in return ill only ask you to take care of the fiddle until i send for it im going away  jimmy nodded for he had expected this thats all right he said i guess ill stay i dont know any other place where one can grub out enough to eat quite so easily wherere you going to  i dont quite know and brooke smiled grimly up and down the provinceanywhere i can pick up a dollar or two daily by working for them  the trouble is that theyre so blamed hard to stick to when youve got them said jimmy reflectively now you dont want dollars here  if i had two thousand of them id stay and make something of the ranch rocky as it is  it couldnt be done with less and i guess youre sensible im quite happy slouching round here but theres a kind of difference between you and me that girl with the big eyes has been putting notions into you  brooke made no disclaimer and jimmy laughed its a little curiousyou dont even know who she is  her name is barbara she is she told me a canadian  canadas quite a big country said jimmy reflectively you could put england into its vest pocket without knowing it was there i guess it will be a long while before you see her again and if you meet her in the cities shes not going to remember you youd find her quite a different kind of young woman there when are you going  at sundown id go now but i want a few hours rest and sleep  jimmy looked at him with sudden concern in his face then ill be good and lonely tonight he said say do you think i could take out the fiddle now and then to keep me company i guess i could play it like a banjo with my fingers  no said brooke drily thats the one thing you cant do  he flung himself down in his strawfilled bunk dressed as he was for he had floundered through tangled forest since the dawn crept into the sky and the shadows of the cedars lay long and black upon the river when he opened his eyes again jimmy was busy at the little stove and in another few minutes the simple meal crudely served but barbaric in its profusion was upon the table neither of the men said very much during it and then jimmy silently helped his comrade to gird his packs about him the sun had gone and the valley was dim and very still when they stood in the doorway  good luck said jimmy youll come back byandby  brooke smiled curiously as he shook hands with him if im ever a rich man i may  then he went out into the deepening shadows and floundering waistdeep through the ford plodded up the climbing trail with his face towards the snow it grew a trifle grim however when he looked back once from a bare hill shoulder and saw a feeble light blink out far down in the hollow jimmy he knew was lying pipe in hand beside the stove and after all the lonely ranch had been a home to him  a man without ambition who could stifle memory might have found the life he led there a pleasant one bountiful nature fed him the hills that walled the valley in shut out strife and care and now he was homeless altogether he had also just six dollars in his pockets and that sum he knew will not go a very long way in western canada  as he gazed the fleecy mist that rolled up from the river blotted out the light and the man felt the deep stillness and loneliness as he had not done since he first came there that sudden eclipse of jimmys light seemed very significant just then for he knew it would never burn again as a beacon for him the last red gleam had also faded off the snow and with a jerk at the pack straps that galled his shoulders he set his lips and swung away into the darkness of the coming night     iii  the narrow way   the big engine was running slowly which did not happen often and brooke who leaned on the planer table was thankful for the respite a belt slid round above him and on either side were turning wheels while he had in front of him a long vista of sliding logs whirring saws and toiling men the air was heavy with gritty dust and a sweet resinous smell while here and there a blaze of sunshine streamed into the great opensided building something had gone wrong with the big engine and its sonorous panting which reverberated across the still blue inlet had slackened a trifle there was not as a result of this power enough to drive all the machines in the mill and brooke was waiting until the engineer should set matters right  it was very hot in the big shed in fact the cedar shingles on the roof were crackling overhead and brookes thin jean garments were soaked with perspiration the dust the planer threw off had also worked its way through them and adhered in smeary patches to his dripping face while his hair and eyebrows might have been rubbed with flour that fine powder was however not the worst for he was also covered with prismatic grains of wood whose sharp angles caused him an intolerable irritation when his garments rasped across his flesh his hands were raw and bleeding there was a cramp in one shoulder and an ache which now and then grew excruciating down all the opposite side of him  the toilers are as a rule at least liberally paid in western canada but a good deal is expected from them and the manager of the mill had installed that planer because it could the makers claimed be run by one live man the workmen however said that if he held to the contract he would very soon be dead and brooke was already worn out with the struggle to keep pace with steam it was a long while since he had toiled much at the ranch and in england he had not toiled at all while as he stood there gasping and hoping that the engineer would not get through his task too soon he remembered that on the two eventful occasions in his life when he had made a commendable decision it had brought him only trouble and strain the way of the virtuous it seemed was hard  he turned languidly when a man who carried an oil can came by and stopped a moment beside him  youre looking kind of played out said the newcomer  its not astonishing said brooke i feel quite that way  then i guess thats a kind of pity the boss will have the belt on the relief shaft in a minute now and he allows hes going to cut every foot as much as usual by the supper hour youll have to shake yourself quite lively how longve you been on to that planer  a month  well said the engineer she broke the last man up in considerably less time than that weak in the chest he was and when we were driving her lively he used to cough up blood he had to let up sudden one day and hes in the hospital now say cant you strike somebody for a softer job  im afraid i cant said brooke drily ill have to go on till im beaten  the engineer made a little gesture of comprehension as he passed on for the attitude the englishman had adopted is not uncommon in the dominion of canada or the country where toil is at least as arduous to the south of it men who demand and not infrequently obtain the full value of their labor are proud of their manhood there and there was an innate resoluteness in brooke which had never been wholly awakened in england  suddenly however the belt above him ran round there was a clash as he slipped in the clutch and a noisy whirring which sank to a deeper tone when he flung a rough redwood board upon the table the whirring millers took hold of it and its splintery edges galled his raw hands as he guided it while thick dust and woody fragments torn off by the trenchant steel whirled about him in a stream until his eyes were blinded and his nostrils filled then the board slid off the table smooth on one side and he knew that he was lagging when the hum of the millers changed to a thin scream they must not at any cost be kept waiting for their food for by inexorable custom so many feet of dressed lumber every day was due from that machine  he flung up another heavy piece reckless of the splinters in his hand made no pause to wipe the rust from his smarting eyes and peering at the spinning cutters blindly thrust upon the end of the board and wondered vaguely whether this was what man was made for or how long flesh and blood could be expected to stand the strain the board went off the table with a crash and it was time for the next while brooke who bent sideways with a distressful crick in his waist once more faced the sawdust stream with lowered head it ceased only for a second or two while he stooped from the table to the lumber that slid by gravitation to his feet and he knew that to let that stream overtake him and pile up would proclaim his incapacity and defeat so long as he was there he must keep pace with it whatever tax it laid upon his jaded body  he did it for an hour flagging all the while for it was a task no man could have successfully undertaken unless he had done such work before and brookes head was aching under a tension which had grown unendurable that afternoon then the screaming millers closed upon a knot in the wood and halfdazed as he was he thrust upon the board savagely instead of easing it there was a crash a big piece of steel flew across the table and the hum of the machine ceased suddenly brooke laughed grimly and sat down gasping he had done his best and now he was not altogether sorry that he was beaten  he was still sitting there when a dusty man in store clothes with a lean intent face came along and glanced at the planer before he looked at him  you let her get ahead of you and tried to make up time by feeding her too hard he said  no said brooke not exactly she got hold of a knot  same thing said the other man youve smashed her anyway and it will cost the company most of three hundred dollars before we get her running again you dont expect me to keep you after that  brooke smiled drily im not quite sure that id like to stay  then well fix it so it will suit everybody ill give you your pay order up to now and youll be glad i ran you out byandby there are no chances sawmilling unless youre owner and its quite likely somebodys got a better use for you  brooke understood this as a compliment and took his order after which he had a spirited altercation with the clerk who desired him to wait for payment until it was six oclock which he would not do then he went back to his little cubicle which with its flimsy partitions one could hear his neighbor snoring through resembled a cell in a hive of bees in the big boardinghouse and slept heavily until he was awakened by the clangor of the halfpast six supper bell he descended and devouring his share of the meal in ten minutes which is about the usual time in that country strolled leisurely into the great general room which had a big stove in the middle and a bar down one side of it he already loathed the comfortless place from the hideous oleographs on the bare wood walls down to the uncleanly sawdust on the floor  he sat down and two men whose acquaintance he had made during his stay there lounged across to him trade was slack in the province then and both wore very threadbare jean there was also a significant moodiness in their gaunt faces which suggested that they had felt the pinch of adversity  you let up before suppertime said one  i did said brooke a trifle grimly i broke up the kenawa planer in the tomlinson mill thats why i came away im not going back again  one of the men laughed softly then it was only the square thing since weve been here that planer has broke up two or three men held out a month didnt you what were you at before that  roadmaking firing at a cannery surrey packing ive a ranch that doesnt pay you see  the other man smiled again so have we half the deadbeats in this country are landholders too two men couldnt get away with many of the big trees on our lot in a lifetime and one has to light out and earn something to put the winter through this month jake and i have made bout twenty dollars between us i guess your troubles want of capitalsame as ours one cant do a great deal with a hundred dollars still youd have had more than that when you came in  i had said brooke drily i put six thousand into the land or rather the landagents bank besides what i spent on clearing a little of it and when ive paid my board and for the clothes i bought ill have about four dollars now  thats how those landcompany folks get rich said one of the men was it a piece of snow mountain he sold you or a bottomless swamp  rock one might have drained a swamp  the men smiled well said the first of them thats not always easy a mans not a steam navvybut the games an old one it was the indian spring folks played it off on you  no it was devine  there was a little silence and then the men appeared reflective  now if any man in that business goes tolerably straight its devine said one of them of course if a green britisher comes along bursting to hand over the bills for any kind of land hell oblige him but id sit down and think a little before i called devine a thief anyway hes quite a big man in the province  the bronze deepened a trifle in brookes face i cant see any particular difference between a swindler and a thief in any case the man robbed me and if i live long enough ill get even with him  thats going to be quite a big contract said one of the men its best to lie low and wait for another fool when youve been taken in besides theres many a worse man in his own line than devine there was one fellow up at jamiesons when the rush was on he could talk the shoes off a muleand he was an englishman whatever any man wanted fruitland mineralland sawing lumber and gold outcrop hed got picked it out on the survey map and sold it him for most a month he rolled the dollars in and then the circus began the folks whod made the deals went up to see their land and most of them found it belonged to another man you see if three of them wanted maple bush thats generally good soil and light to clear and hed only one piece of it he sold the same lot to all of them they went back with clubs but that man knew when to light out and he didnt wait for them  brooke sat silent awhile he knew that the story was not a very unlikely one for while in view of the simplicity of the canadian land tenure legislation there is no reason why any man should be swindled as a matter of fact a good many are he was also irritated that he had allowed himself to indulge in what he realized must have appeared a puerile threat this was of course of no moment in itself but he felt that it showed how he was losing hold of the nice discretion he had at least affected in england still he meant exactly what he had said  during the greater portion of two years he had attempted a hopeless task and then discovering his folly resigned himself and drifted idly perilously near the brink of the long declivity which englishmen of good upbringing not infrequently descend with astonishing swiftness in that country and for that rightly or wrongly he blamed the man who had robbed him then the awakening had come and he saw that while there were many careers open to a man with six thousand dollars or even half of them there was only strenuous physical toil for the man with none he had attempted it but proficiency in even the more brutal forms of labor cannot be attained in a day and he now looked back on a year of hardship and effort which had left an indelible mark on him  it had been a season when there was little industrial enterprise and he had no friends while the dollars he gained were earned for the most part by the strain of overtaxed muscles and bleeding hands he had toiled up to his waist in snowwater at the mines swung the shovel under the lashing deluge driving a government road over a big divide hung from dizzy railroad trestles holding with fingers bruised by the hammer the spikes the craftsmen drove and been taught all there is to learn about exposure and fatigue he had braced himself to bear it though he had lived softly in england but each time he crawled into draughty tent or reeking shanty wet through with aching limbs at night he remembered the man who had robbed him  it was perhaps not altogether astonishing that under such conditions the wrong done him should assume undue proportions and that when a slipping hammer laid his knuckles bare he should charge the smart to devine and long for the reckoning the man who had condemned him to this life of toil had he told himself grown rich by theft and he dwelt upon his injury until the memory of it possessed him it was not however the physical hardship that troubled him most but the thought of the opportunities he had lost for since he had seen the girl with the brown eyes they had assumed their due value devine had not only taken his dollars but had driven him out from the society of those who had been his equals and made him one who could scarcely hope to meet a woman of refinement on friendly terms again coarse fare and a life of brutal toil were all that seemed left to him there were he knew men in that country who had commenced with a very few dollars and acquired a competence but they were not young englishmen brought up as he had been  you are the only man ive ever heard say anything good about any one in the land business and it does not amount to much at that he said devine has been successful so far but even gentlemen of his talents are liable to make a mistake occasionally and if ever he makes a big one it will probably go hardly with him that at least is one consolation  another man who had been standing near the bar sauntered towards them cigar in hand he was dressed in store clothing and his hands were as brooke noticed not those of a workman though they seemed wiry and capable he had penetrating dark eyes and the western business mans lean intent face while brooke would have guessed his age at a little over thirty  i dont mind admitting that i heard a little he said those landagency fellows have a good deal to account for youre not exactly struck on devine  no said brooke drily i have no particular cause to be still that really does not concern everybody  beat him out of six thousand dollars said one of his companions  the stranger laughed a little he has done me out of a good many more but one has to take his chances in this country you are working at the tomlinson mill  no said brooke i was turned out today  got no notion where to strike next  no  the stranger who did not seem at all repulsed by his abruptness looked at him reflectively  i heard they were wanting survey packers up at the johnston lake in the bush he said a government mans starting to run the line through to the big range thursday if you took him this card up he might put you on  brooke took the card and a little tinge of color crept into his face  i appreciate the kindness but still you see you know nothing whatever about me he said  the stranger laughed i wouldnt worry were not particular in this country go up and show him the card if you feel like it ive been in a tight place myself once or twice and well take it as an introduction a good many people know meyou are mr brooke  brooke admitted it and after a few minutes conversation the stranger who informed him that he had come there in the hope of meeting a man who did not seem likely to put in an appearance now moved away  thomas p saxton what is he said brooke to his companions as he glanced at the card  puts through mine and sawmill deals said one of the men id light out for johnston lake right away and if you have the dollars take the cars atlantic express is late tonight waiting the empress boat and if you get off at chumas youll only have bout twelve leagues to walk i figure it will cost you four dollars  brooke decided that it would be advisable to take the risk and when he had settled with his host and a storekeeper found he had about six dollars left when he went out one of the ranchers looked at the other he was the one who had spoken least and a quiet observant man from ontario  im not that sure it was good advice you gave him he said  no said his companion  the other man appeared reflective i was watching saxton and he kind of woke up when brooke let out about devine now it seems to me it wasnt without a reason he put him on to that survey  his companion laughed it doesnt count anyway the governments dollars are certain  well said the ontario man drily if i had to give one of the pair any kind of a hold on me i figure from what ive heard it would be devine instead of saxton     iv  saxton makes an offer   it was raining as hard as it not infrequently does in the mountain province and the deluge lashed the sombre pines that towered above the dripping camp when brooke stood in the entrance of the surveyors tent he was wet to the skin as well as weary for he had walked most of thirty miles that day over a very bad trail and was but indifferently successful in his attempts to hide his anxiety the surveyor also noticed the grimness of his wet face and dallied a moment with the card he held for he had known what fatigue and short commons were in his early days  im sorry i cant take you but ive two more men than ive any particular use for already he said at last i cant give you a place to spread your blankets in tonight either because the freighter didnt bring up all our tents still you might make beasleys hotel and strike saxtons prospectors if you head back over the divide he has a few men up there opening up a silver lead  brooke said nothing and the surveyor turned to his assistant as he moved away its rough on that man and he seems kind of played out he said i cant quite figure either why saxton sent him here when hes putting men on at his mine it seems to me i told him i was only going to take men whod packed for me before  in the meanwhile brooke stood still a few moments in the rain he was aching all over and his wet boots galled him while he was also very hungry and uncertain what to do there was nothing to be gained by pushing on four leagues to beasleys hotel even if he had been capable of doing it which was not the case because he had just then only two or three copper coins worth ten cents in his pocket it was he knew scarcely likely he would be turned out for that reason but he had not yet come down to asking a strangers charity supper which he would have been offered a share of was also over and there was not a ranch about only a dripping wilderness for he had plodded on after the surveyor from the lonely settlement at johnston lake  it was very enviously he watched two men piling fresh branches on a crackling fire darkness was not far away and already a light shone through the wet canvas of the surveyors tent a cheerful hum of voices came out from the others and a man was singing in one of them the survey packers had at least a makeshift shelter for the night food in sufficiency and such warmth as the fires and their damp blankets might supply while he had nowhere to lay his head the smell of the stinging wood smoke was curiously alluring and he felt as he glanced at the black wall of bush which closed in upon the little camp that his hardihood was deserting him and in another minute he would go back and offer his services in return for food then his pride came to the rescue and turning away abruptly he plodded back into the bush where a bitter wind that came down from the snow blew the drips from the great branches into his face  he kept to the trail instinctively though he did not know where he was going or why when one place had as little to commend itself as another he blundered on at all except that he was getting cold until the creeping dark surprised him at a forking of the way he knew that the path he had come by led through a burnt forest and thin willow bush while great cedars shrouded the other which apparently wound up a valley towards the heights above they promised at least a little more shelter than the willows but that he fancied must be the trail that crossed the divide and it led into a desolation of rock and forest he had very little hope of being offered employment at the mine the surveyor had mentioned and stood still for several minutes with the rain beating into his face while though he did not know it then a good deal depended on his decision a little mist rolled out of the valley and it was growing very cold while the dull roar of a snowfed torrent made the silence more impressive  then attracted solely by the sombre clustering of the cedars which promised to keep off at least a little of the rain he turned up the valley with a shiver and finally unrolled his one wet blanket under a big tree there was an angle among its roots which ran along the ground and scooping a hollow in the withered sprays he crawled into it and lay down with his back to the trunk the roar of the river seemed louder now and he could hear a timber wolf howling far off on the hillside he was very cold and hungry but his weariness blunted the sense of physical discomfort though as yet his activity of mind remained and he asked himself what he had gained by leaving the ranch and could find no answer  still even then he would not regret that he had broken away for there was in him an inherent obstinacy and he would have struggled on at the ranch had not the absence of funds precluded it and consideration shown him that it would be merely throwing his toil away life it seemed had very little to offer him but now he had made the decision he would adhere to it though he had arrived at the resolution in cold blood for it was his reason only which had responded to the girls influence and as yet what was spiritual in him remained untouched he would not live as the indians do or sink into a sot there were vague possibilities before him which though this appeared most unlikely might prove themselves facts and the place he had been born to in england might yet be his that was why he would not sell his birthright for a mess of stringy venison and the deleterious whisky sold at the settlement which seemed to him a most unfair price still he went no further even when he thought of the girl which he did with dispassionate admiration  wornout as he was he slept and awakened in the grey dawn almost unfit to rise there was a distressful pain in his hipjoints which those who sleep in the open are acquainted with and at the first few steps he took his face went awry but his physical nature demanded warmth and food and there was only one way of obtaining it before the life went out of him whatever effort it cost him he must reach the mine he set out for it limping while the sharp gravel rolled under his bleeding feet as he floundered up the climbing trail it seemed to lead upwards for ever between endless colonnades of towering trunks and when at last pine and cedar had been left behind there was slippery rock smoothed by sliding snow to be clambered over  still reeling and gasping he held on and it was afternoon and he had eaten nothing for close on thirty hours when a filmy trail of smoke that drifted faintly blue athwart the climbing pines beneath him caught his eye he braced himself for the effort to reach it and went down with loose uneven strides smashing through salsal and barberry when he reached the bush again the fern met above his head there were mazes of fallen trunks to be scrambled through and he tore the soaken jean that clung about him to rags in his haste still he had learned to travel straight in the bush and at last he staggered into sight of the mine  there was a little scar on the hillside an iron shanty a few soaked tents and shelters of bark but the ringing clink of the drills vibrated about them and a most welcome smell of wood smoke came up to him with a murmur of voices brooke heard them faintly and did not stop until a handful of men clustered about him while as he blinked at them one who appeared different from the others pushed his way through the group  you seem considerably used up he said  i am said brooke hoarsely im almost starving  it occurred to him that the mans voice ought to be familiar but it was a few moments before he recognized him as the one who had sent him on the useless journey after the surveyor  then come right along its not quite suppertime but theres food in the camp he said  brooke went with him to the shanty where he fell against a chair and found it difficult to straighten himself when he picked it up saxton so far as he could remember asked no questions but smiled at him reassuringly while he explained somewhat incoherently what had brought him there until a man appeared with a big tray then brooke ate strenuously  some folks have a notion that one can kill himself by getting through too much at once when hes most starved said saxton i never found it work out that way in this country  were you ever almost starved said brooke who felt the life coming back to him with no great show of interest  oh yes said saxton drily twice at least i was three days without food the last time one has to take his chances in the ranges and you dont pick up dollars without trouble anywhere still well talk of that afterwards had enough  brooke said he fancied he had and saxton hammered upon the iron roof of the shanty until a man appeared  give him a pair of blankets ike he can sleep in the leanto he said  brooke went with the man vacantly and in another few minutes found himself lying in dry blankets on a couch of springy twigs he was sensible that it was delightfully warm but he could not remember how he got there and was wondering why the rain no longer lashed his face when sleep came to him  it was next morning when he was awakened by the roar of a blasting charge and lay still with an unusual sense of comfort until the silence that followed it was broken by the clinking of the drills then he rose stiffly and put on his clothes which he found had been dried and was informed by a man who appeared while he was doing it that his breakfast was waiting brooke wondered a little at this for he knew that it was past the usual hour but he made an excellent meal and then being shown into a compartment of the little galvanized iron shanty found saxton sitting at a table the latter now wore long boots and jean and there were pieces of discolored stone strewn about in front of him  he looked up with a little nod as brooke came in feeling quite yourself again he said  yes said brooke thanks to the way your men have treated me this is of course a hospitable country but i may admit that i could scarcely have expected to be so well looked after by one i hadnt the slightest claim upon  and you almost wondered what he did it for  brooke was a trifle astonished for this certainly expressed his thoughts but he was in no way disconcerted and he laughed  i should at least never have ventured to suggest that anything except goodnature influenced you he said  still you felt it well you were considerably used up when you came in and as i sent you to the surveyor who didnt seem to have any use for you i felt myself responsible that appears sufficient  now brooke had mixed with men of a good many different stations and he was observant and as might have been expected by no means diffident  since you ask i scarcely think it does he said  saxton laughed take a cigar thats the kind of talk i like well come to the point right away  brooke lighted a cigar and found it good thanks im willing to listen as long as appears necessary he said  you have a kind of grievance against devine  i have according to my notion of ethics he owes me six thousand dollars and i shall not be quite content until i get them out of him although that may never happen i feel just now that it would please me especially to make him smart as well which i quite realize is unnecessary folly  the canadian nodded and shook the ash from his cigar exactly he said a man with sense keeps his eye on the dollars and leaves out the sentiment its quite apt to get in his way and trip him up well suppose i could give you a chance of getting those dollars back  i should be very much inclined to take it still presumably you do not mean to do it out of pure goodnature  no sir said saxton drily im here to make dollars that has been my object since i struck out for myself at fourteen and ive piled quite a few of them together id have had more only that wherever i plan a nice little venture in mines or land up and down this province i run up against devine thats quite straight isnt it  i fancy it is you are suggesting community of interest still i scarcely realize how a man with empty pockets could be of very much use to you  i have a kind of notion that you could be if it suited you i want a man with grit in him who has had a good education and could if it was necessary mix on equal terms with the folks in the cities  one would fancy there were a good many men of that kind in canada  saxton appeared reflective oh yes he said drily the trouble is that most of them have got something better to do and i cant think of one who has any special reason for wanting to get even with devine  that means the work you have in view would scarcely suit a man who was prosperous or likely to be fastidious  no said saxton simply i dont quite think it would still ive seen enough to show me that you can take the sensible point of view we both want dollars and i cant afford to be particular im not sure you can either  brooke sat silent awhile he could at least appreciate the canadians candor while events had rubbed the sentiment he had once had plenty of out of him and left him a somewhat hard and bitter man the woman he believed in had used him very badly and the first man he trusted in canada had plundered him brooke was unfortunately young when he was called upon to face the double treachery and had generalized too freely from too limited premises he felt that in all society there must be a conflict between the men who had all to gain and those who had anything worth keeping and sentiment it seemed was out of place in that struggle  as you observed i cant afford to be too particular he said still it is quite possible i might not be prepared to go quite so far as you would wish me  the canadian laughed ill take my chances nobody can bring up any very lowdown game against me well are you open to consider my offer  you havent exactly made one yet  then well fix the terms until one of us gives the other notice that he lets up on this agreement you will do just what i tell you pay will be about the usual thing for whatever youre set to do it would be reasonably high if i put you on to anything in the cities  is that likely  ive a notion that we might get you into a place where you could watch devines game for me i want to feel quite sure of it before i take any chances with that kind of man if i struck him for anything worth while you would have a share  brookes face flushed just a trifle and again he sat silent a moment or two then he laughed somewhat curiously  well he said i suppose there are no other means and the man robbed me  saxton smiled if we pull off the deal im figuring on your share might most work up to those six thousand dollars theyre yours  brooke realized that it was a clever man he was dealing with but in his present state of mind the somewhat vague arrangement commended itself to him he was he decided warranted in getting his six thousand dollars back by any means that were open to him more he did not want for he still retained in a slight degree the notions instilled into him in england which had however since he was seldom able to indulge in them not tended to make him happier  there is a point you dont seem to have grasped he said since i am not to be particular cant you conceive that it would not be pleasant for you if devine went one better  saxton laughed ive met quite a few englishmenof your kindalready he said thats why i feel that when youve taken my dollars youre not going to go back on me without giving me warning besides devine would be considerably more likely to fix you up in quite another way now i want an answer is it a deal  it is said brooke who in spite of the fashion in which he had expressed himself during the last few minutes felt a slight warmth in his face though he could not afford to be particular there was one aspect of the arrangement which did not commend itself to him  saxton nodded then as youll want to know a little about mining well put you on now helping the drillers at 250 a day youll get considerably more byandby take this little treatise on the minerals of the province and keep it by you     v  barbara renews an acquaintance   there was an amateur concert for a commendable purpose in the vancouver operahouse which since the inhabitants of the mountain province do not expect any organized body to take over their individual responsibilities was a somewhat unusual event and miss barbara heathcote who had not as yet found it particularly entertaining was leaning back languidly in her chair  there are really one or two things they do a little better in the old country she said  the young man who sat beside her laughed there must be or you never would have admitted it he said still im not sure you would find many folks who would believe you here  one has to be candid occasionally and barbara made a little gesture of weariness there is still another hour of it but i sincerely hope not another cornet solo what comes next we were a little late and nobody provided me with a programme they are inconsistent milly i notice has several  the man opened the paper which a girl barbara glanced at handed him  a violin solo he said i think they mean schumann but its not altogether astonishing that theyve spelt it wrong a man called brooke is put down for it  brooke said barbara a trifle sharply where does he come from do you know him  i cant say i do the man commenced reflectively and stopped a moment when he saw the little smile in the girls brown eyes what were you thinking  i was wondering whether that means he cant be worth knowing  well said the man goodhumoredly there are i believe one or two decent folks in this city i havent had the pleasure of meeting but you were a trifle too previous i dont know him but if hes the man i think he is ive heard about him he came down from the bush lately and somebody put him on to naseby the surveyor nasebys busy just now doing a good deal for the governmentcrown mineral lands i think or something of that kindand he took the man i understand hes quite smart at the bush work and nasebys pleased with him thats about all i can tell you youre scarcely likely to know him  barbara sat silent a space looking about her while the amateur orchestra chased one another through the treacherous mazes of an overture the handsome building was well filled but there were one or two empty places at hand for the man who had sent her there had taken a row of them and sent tickets to his friends as was expected from a citizen of his importance it was in the usual course scarcely likely that she would know a man who had lately been installed in a subordinate place in a surveyors service for her acquaintances were people of position in that province and yet she had a very clear recollection of a certain rancher brooke who played the violin  i once met a man of that name in the bush she said with almost overdone indifference still he is scarcely likely to be the same one  her companion started another topic and neither of them listened to the orchestra though the girl was a trifle irritated at herself for wishing that the overture had been shorter at last when the second violins were not more than a note behind the rest the music stopped and barbara sat very still with eyes fixed on the stage while the usual little stir and rustle of draperies ran round the building then there was silence for a moment and she was sensible of a curious little thrill as a man who held a violin came forward into the blaze of light he wore conventional eveningdress in place of the fringed deerskin she had last seen him in and she decided that it became his somewhat spare symmetrical figure almost as well the years he had spent swinging axe and pounding drill had toughened and suppled it and yet left him free from the coarsening stamp of toil which is however not as a rule a necessary accompaniment of strenuous labor in that country standing still a moment quietly at his ease straightlimbed sinewy with a little smile in his frostbronzed face he was certainly a personable man and for no very apparent reason she was pleased to notice that two of her companions were regarding him with evident approbation  i think one could call him quite goodlooking said the girl beside her he has been in this country a while but i wouldnt call him a canadian not from this side of the rockies anyway  why asked barbara mainly to discover how far her companions thoughts coincided with her own  well said the other girl reflectively it seems to me he takes it too easily if he had been one of us hed have either been grim and serious or worrying with the strings were most desperately in earnest but they do things as though they didnt count in the old country now he has got the a right off without the least fussing as if he couldnt help doing it  the explanation was rather suggestive than definite but barbara was satisfied with it she was usually a reposeful young woman herself and the mans graceful tranquillity which was of a kind not to be met with every day in that country appealed to her then he drew the bow across the strings and she sat very still to listen it was not music that a good many of his audience were accustomed to but scarcely a dress rustled or a programme fluttered until he took the fiddle from his shoulder then while the plaudits rang through the building his eyes met barbaras leaning forward a trifle in her chair she saw the sudden intentness of his face but he gazed at her steadily for a moment without sign of recognition then she smiled graciously for that was what she had expected of him and again felt a faint thrill of content for his eyes were fixed on her when as the tumult of applause increased he made a little inclination  he was not permitted to retire and when he put the fiddle to his shoulder again she knew why he played the nocturne she had heard in the bush it was also she felt in a fashion significant that it had now in place of the roar of a snowfed river the chords of a grand piano for accompaniment though the latter it seemed to her made an indifferent substitute the bronzefaced man in deerskin had fitted the surroundings in which she had seen him and they had been close comrades in the wilderness for a week it could she knew scarcely be the same in the city but she saw that he was at least equally at home there it was only their relative positions that had changed for the guide was the person of importance in the primeval bush and the fact that he had waited without a sign until she smiled showed that he had not failed to recognize it when at last he moved away she turned to the man at her side  will you go down and ask mr brooke to come here she said you can tell him that i would like to speak to him  the young man did not express any of the astonishment he certainly felt but proceeded to do her bidding though it afforded him no particular pleasure for there was a certain imperiousness about barbara heathcote which was not without its effect brooke was putting away his fiddle when he came upon him  i havent the pleasure of your acquaintance mr brooke but it seems you know a friend of mine he said if you are at liberty miss heathcote would like to see you  miss heathcote said brooke for it had happened not unnaturally that he had never heard the girls full name her companions of whom he had not felt warranted in inquiring it had called her barbara in the bush and he had addressed her without prefix  yes said the other who was once more a trifle astonished miss barbara heathcote  he glanced at brooke sharply or he would not have seen the swift content in his face for the latter put a sudden restraint upon himself  of course i will come with you at once he said and a minute or two later took the vacant place at barbaras side  you do not appear very much surprised and yet it was a long way from here i saw you last she said  brooke fancied she meant that it was under somewhat different circumstances and sat looking at her with a little smile she was also he decided even better worth inspection than she had been in the bush for the rich attire became her and the garish electric radiance emphasized the gleam of the white shoulder the dainty laces clung about and of the ivory neck the moonlight had shone upon when first they met  no he said the fact is i have seen you already on several occasions in this city  barbara glanced at him covertly then why did you not claim recognition  isnt the reason obvious  no said barbara reflectively i scarcely think it isunless of course you had no desire to renew the acquaintance  does one usually renew a chance acquaintance made with a packer in the bush  it would depend a good deal on the packer said barbara quietly now this country is  there was a trace of dryness in brookes smile you were going to say a democratic one that of course might to some extent explain the anomaly  no said barbara sharply with a very faint flush of color in her face i was not you ought to know that too explanations are occasionally odious and almost always difficult but both major hume and his daughter invited you to their house if you were ever in england  the major may have felt himself tolerably safe in making that offer said brooke reflectively you see i am naturally acquainted with my fellow britons idiosyncrasies  the girl looked at him with a little sparkle in her eyes i do not know why you are adopting this attitude or assigning one to me she said did we ever attempt to patronize you and if we had done is there any reason why you should take the trouble to resent it  brooke laughed softly i scarcely think i could afford to resent a kindness however it was offered but there is a point you dont quite seem to have grasped how could i be certain you had remembered me  the girl smiled a little your own powers of recollection might have furnished a standard of comparison  brooke looked at her steadily the sharpness of the memory depends upon the effect the object one wishes to recollect produced upon ones mind he said i should of course have known you at once had it been twenty years hence  the girl turned to her programme for now she had induced him to abandon his reticence his candor was almost disconcerting  well she said tell me what you have been doing you have left the ranch  brooke nodded and glanced at the hand he laid on his knee which as the girl saw was still ingrained and hard  roadmaking for one thing he said chopping trees quarrying rock and following other useful occupations of the kind they are one presumes healthy and necessary but i did not find any of them especially remunerative  and now  brookes face as she did not fail to notice hardened suddenly and he felt an unpleasant embarrassment as he met her eyes he had decided that he was fully warranted in taking any steps likely to lead to the recovery of the dollars he had been robbed of but he was sensible that the only ones he had found convenient would scarcely commend themselves to his companion there was also no ignoring the fact that he would very much have preferred her approbation  at present i am surveying though i cannot of course become a surveyor he said the legislature of this country has placed that out of the question  barbara was aware that in canada a man can no more set up as a surveyor without the specified training than he can as a solicitor though she did not think that fact accounted for the constraint in the mans voice and attitude he was not one who readily betrayed what he felt but she was tolerably certain that something in connection with his occupation caused him considerable dissatisfaction  still she said you must have known a little about the profession  yes said brooke a trifle unguardedly of course there is a difference but i had once the management of an estate in england what one might call the more useful branches of mathematics were also a good while ago a favorite study of mine one could find a use for them even in measuring a tree  the girl had a question on her lips but she did not consider it advisable to ask it just then  you would find a knowledge of timber of service in canada she said  not very often you see the only apparent use of the trees on my possessions was to keep me busy two years attempting to destroy them and of late i have chiefly had to do with minerals  with minerals said the girl quickly and then as he volunteered no answer swiftly asked the question she had wished to put before whose was the estate in england  brooke did not look at her and she fancied he was not sorry that the necessity of affecting a show of interest in the music meanwhile made continuous conversation difficult his eyes were then turned upon a performer on the stage  the estateit belonged toa friend of mine he said of course i had no regular training but connection and influence count for everything in the old country  barbara watched him covertly and once more noticed the slight hardening of his lips and the very faint deepening of the bronze in his cheeks it was only just perceptible but though the sun and wind had darkened its tinting brooke had a clear english complexion and the blood showed through his skin his companion remembered the old house in the english valley with its trim gardens and great sweep of velvet lawn where he had admitted that he had once been long ago the statement she had fancied at the time was purposely vague and she wondered now if he had meant that he had lived there for barbara possessed the not unusual feminine capacity for putting two and two together she however naturally showed nothing of this  i suppose it does she said i wonder if you ever feel any faint longing for what you must have left behind you there one learns to do without a good deal in canada  brooke smiled curiously of course that is one reason why i am pleased you sent for me this you see brings it back to me  he glanced suggestively round the big brilliantlylighted building across the rows of citizens in broadcloth and daintilydressed women and then turned and fixed his eyes upon his companions face almost too steadily the girl understood him but she would not admit it  you mean the music she said  no the music to tell the truth is by no means very good it is you who have taken me back to the old country imagination will do a great deal but it needs a fillip and something tangible to build upon  barbara laughed softly  i fancy the c p r and an allan liner would be a much more reliable means of transportation you will presumably take that route some day  i scarcely think it likely they have in the western idiom no use for poor men yonder  still men get rich now and then in this country  the mans face grew momentarily a trifle grim it would apparently be difficult to accomplish it by serving as assistant survey and the means employed by some of them might if they went back to the old life tend to prevent them feeling very comfortable iand he paused for a secondfancy that i shall stay in canada  barbara was a trifle puzzled and said nothing further for a space until when the singer who occupied the stage just then was dismissed the man turned to her  how long is a chance acquaintance warranted in presuming on a favor shown him in this country  barbara smiled at him if i understand you correctly until the other person allows him to perceive that his absence would be supportable in this case just as long as it pleases him now you can tell me about the roadmaking  brooke understood that she wished to hear and when he could accomplish it without attracting too much attention pictured for her benefit his life in the bush he also did it humorously but effectively without any trace of the selfcommiseration she watched for and her fancy dwelt upon the hardships he lightly sketched she knew how the toilers lived and worked in the bush and had seen their reeking shanties and rainswept camps labor is accounted honorable in that land but it is none the less very frequently brutal as well as strenuous and she could fancy how this man who she felt certain had been accustomed to live softly in england must have shrunk from some of his tasks and picture to herself what he felt when he came back at night to herd closepacked with comrades whose thoughts and his must always be far apart that many possibly better men had certainly borne with as hard a lot longer after all made no great difference to the facts she also recognized that there was a vein of pathos in the story as she remembered that he had told her it was scarcely likely he would ever go back to england again that naturally suggested a good deal to her for she held him blameless though she knew it was not the regularity of their conduct at home which sent a good many of his countrymen out to canada  at last he rose between two songs and stood still a moment looking down on her  im afraid i have trespassed on your kindness he said i am going back to the bush with a survey expedition tomorrow and i do not know when i shall be fortunate enough to see you again  barbara smiled a little that she said is for you to decide we are at home every thursday in the afternoonand in your case in the evening  he made her a little inclination and turned away while barbara sat still looking straight in front of her but quite oblivious of the music until she turned with a laugh and the girl who sat next to her glanced round  was the man very amusing she said  no said barbara reflectively i scarcely think he was i gave him permission to call upon us and never told him where we lived  still he would like everybody else in this city know it already  he may said barbara that i suppose is what i felt at the time but now i scarcely think he does  then one would fancy that to meet a young man of his appearance who didnt know all about you would be something quite new said her companion drily  barbara flushed ever so slightly but her companion noticed it she was quite aware that if she was made much of in that city it was in part at least due to the fact that she was the niece of a wellknown man and had considerable possessions     vi  an arduous journey   it was late at night and raining hard when a line of dripping mules stood waiting beneath the pines that crowded in upon the workings of the elktail mine a few lights blinked among the logsheds that clustered round the mouth of the rift in the steep hillside and a warm wind that drove the deluge before it came wailing out of the blackness of the valley beneath them the mine was not a big one but it was believed that it paid thomas p saxton and his friends tolerably well in spite of the heavy cost of transport to the nearest smelter a somewhat varying vein of galena which is silverlead was worked there and saxton had on several occasions declined an offer to buy it made on behalf of a company  on the night in question he stood in the doorway of one of the sheds with brooke for whom the surveyor had no more work just then beside him brooke wore long boots and a big rubber coat on whose dripping surface the light of the lantern saxton held flickered here and there a man was dimly visible beside the mules but beyond them impenetrable darkness closed in  its a wicked kind of night said saxton who brooke fancied nevertheless appeared quite content with it you know what youve got to do  yes said brooke a trifle drily you have given me tolerably complete instructions once or twice already the ore is to be delivered to allonby at the dayspring mine not later than tomorrow night and im to be contented with his verbal acknowledgment the getting it across the river will i fancy be the difficulty especially as im to send half the teamsters back before we reach it  still you have got to send them back said saxton jake and tom will go on and when you have crossed the ford that will be two mules for each of you not one of the other men must come within a mile of the trail forking its part of our bargain that youre to do just what i tell you  brooke laughed a little im not going to grumble very much at leading two mules i have done a good deal harder work quite frequently  youll find it tough enough by the time youre through you must be in at the mine by daylight the day after tomorrow anyway allonby will be sitting up waiting for you  brooke said nothing further but went out into the rain calling to one of the teamsters and the mules were got under way the trail that led to the elktail mine sloped steep as a roof just there and was slippery with rain and mire but the mules went down it as no other loaded beasts could have done feeling their way foot by foot or glissading on all four hoofs for yards together the men made little attempt to guide them for a mule is opinionated by nature and when it cannot find its own way up or down any ascent it is seldom worth while for its driver to endeavor to show it one  when they reached the level or rather the depth of the hollow for of level in the usual sense of the word there is none in that country brooke who was then cumbered with no bridle turned and looked round the lights of the elktail had faded among the pines and there was only black darkness about him here and there he could discern the ghostly outline of a towering trunk a little more solid than the night it rose against and he could hear the men and beasts floundering and splashing in front of him a deep reverberating sound rose out of the obscurity beneath and he knew it to be the roar of a torrent in a deepsunk gully while now and then a diminishing rattle suggested that a hundredweight or so of waterloosened gravel had slipped down into the chasm from the perilous trail  it was a difficult road to travel by daylight and naturally considerably worse at night while brooke had already wondered why saxton had not sent off the ore earlier that however was not his business and shaking the rain from his dripping hat he plodded on it was still two or three hours before daylight when they reached a wider and smoother trail and he sent away three of the men  its a tolerably good road now and saxton wants you at the mine he said  one of the teamsters who were remaining laughed ironically im blamed if i ever heard the dip down to the long ford called a good trail before  well said one of the others what in the name of thunder are you going that way for  brooke who was standing close by fancied that a man who had not spoken kicked his loquacious comrade viciously  tom never does know where hes going its the mule that does the thinking for both of them he said  there was a little hoarse laughter and those who were going back vanished into the deluge while brooke who took a bridle now went on with two men again it was darker than ever for great fir branches met overhead just there but they at least kept off a little of the rain and he groped onward splashing in the mire until the roar of a river throbbed across the forest as the night was wearing through then the leading teamster pulled up his mules  its a nasty ford in daylight and shell be swirling over it waistdeep and more just now he said still weve got to take our chances of getting through  it will be light in two hours said brooke suggestively of course you know better than i do whether we could make the wasted time up  the man laughed curiously i guess we could but theres two concerned bush ranchers just started their chopping over yonder i had a kind of notion the boss would have told you that  it commenced to dawn on brooke that saxton had a reason for not desiring that everybody should know he was sending ore away but he was too wet to concern himself about the question then  i dont think he did he said anyway if we have to go through in the dark theres nothing to be gained by waiting here  they went on down what appeared to be the side of a bottomless gully with the stones and soil slipping away from under them while halfseen trees flitted up out of the obscurity then they reached the bed of a stream and proceeded along it splashing and stumbling amidst the boulders in the meanwhile the roar of the river was growing steadily louder and when they stopped again they could hear the clamor of the invisible flood close in front of them it came out of the rain and darkness hoarse and terrifying but while the wind drove the deluge into his face brooke could see nothing beyond dim dripping trees  well said the leading teamster i have struck a nicer job than this one but it has got to be done tether the spare mule each of you and then get in behind me  brooke had no diffidence about taking the last place in the line though he was in charge of the pack train it was evident that the men knew a good deal more about that ford than he did and he had no particular desire to make himself responsible for a disaster then there was a scrambling and splashing and he found himself suddenly waistdeep in the river he was however tolerably accustomed to a ford and though the mule he led objected strenuously to entering the water it proceeded with that beasts usual sagacity once it was in he endeavored to keep its head a trifle upstream and as close behind his two companions as he could but apart from that he left the beast to the guidance of its own acumen for he knew that it is seldom the sagacious mule takes any risk that can be avoided  twice at least his feet were swept from under him and once he lost his grip on the bridle and simultaneously all sight of his companions and the beast he led then he felt unpleasantly lonely as he stood more than waistdeep in the noisy flood but after a few yards floundering he found the mule again and at last scrambled up breathless and gasping beneath the pines on the farther side  hit it square that time said the teamster im not quite so sure as id like to be we can do it again  they went back through the river for the rest of the mules and were halfway across on the return journey when the leader shouted to them that they should stop the water seemed deeper than it had been on the previous occasion and brooke found it difficult to keep his footing at all as he peered into the darkness the rain had ceased but there was little visible beyond the faint whiteness of sliding froth and a shadowy blur of trees on either shore he could see nothing that might serve any one as guide and the leading teamster was standing still apparently in a state of uncertainty with dim streaks of froth streaming past him  im most afraid were too far downstream he said anyway we cant stay here head the beasts up a little  his voice reached the others brokenly through the roar of the torrent and with a pull at the bridle brooke turned his face upstream he could hear the rest splashing in front of him until his mule lost his footing and he sank suddenly up to the breast then there was a shout and a struggling beast swept down on him with the swing of an eddy brooke went down head under and one of the teamsters appeared to be shouting instructions to him when he came up again he had not the faintest notion of what they were and swung round with the eddy until he was driven violently against a boulder there was a mule close beside him and he contrived to grasp the bridle and found to his astonishment that he could now stand upright without difficulty exactly where the others were or where the opposite side of the river lay he did not at the moment know but the mule appeared to be floundering on with a definite purpose and he went with it until they scrambled up the bank and he found two other men and one beast already there  one of thems gone said the teamster therell be trouble when we go back but i guess it cant be helped anyway theres most a fathom in the deep below the ford and no mule would do much swimming with that load  a fathoms quite enough to cover the bags up so nobodys going to find them said the other man  brooke did not quite understand why since the ore was valuable this fact should afford the teamster the consolation it apparently did but he was not in a mood to consider that point just then and all his attention was occupied when they proceeded again the trail that climbed the rise was wet and steep and seemed to consist largely of boulders into which he blundered with unpleasant frequency it was but little better when they once more plunged into the forest for the way was scarcely two feet wide and wound round and through thickets of thorn and fern which when he brushed against it further saturated him he was wet enough already but the water which remained any time in his clothing got slowly warm it also dipped into splashy hollows and climbed loose gravel banks while once a hoarse shout from the leader which changed to a howl of pain was followed by a stoppage the man had stumbled into a clump of the horrible devils club thorn than which nothing that grows anywhere is more unpleasant when it gets a good hold on human flesh  he was cut loose and his objurgations mingled with the soft splashing from the branches as they blundered on until a faint grey light filtered down and the firs they passed beneath grew into definite form it had also become unpleasantly chilly and a thin clammy mist rose like steam from every hollow then the trees grew thinner as they climbed steadily until at last brooke could see the black hill shoulders rise out of the trails of mist and the leader pulled up his mules  weve done bout enough for one spell and nobodys going to see us here he said get a fire started im emptiern a drum  brooke who knew where to find the resinous knots was glad to help and soon a great fire blazed upon a shelf of rock the mules were tethered and forage given them and the men lay steaming about the blaze until the breakfast of flapjacks canned stuff and green tea was ready it was despatched in ten minutes and rolling his halfdried blanket about him brooke lay down to sleep he had a strip of very damp rock for mattress and a bag of ore for pillow but he had grown accustomed to a hard bed in the bush and had scarcely laid his head down when slumber came to him food and sleep he had discovered were things to be appreciated for it was not always that he was able to obtain very much of either his stay in the canadian cities had been brief and the night he had spent with the browneyed girl at the operahouse had already drifted back into the past  it was raining when he awakened and they once more took the trail while during what was left of the day they plodded among the boulders beside frothing streams crept through shadowy forests and climbed over treacherous slopes of gravel and slippery rock outcrop round the great hill shoulders above everywhere the cold gleam of snow met the eye save when the mists that clung in ragged wisps about the climbing pines rolled together and blotted all the vista out the smell of fir and balsam filled every hollow and the song of the rivers rang through a dead stillness that even to brooke who was accustomed to it was curiously impressive  there was no sign of man anywhere save for the smear of trampled mire or hoofscattered gravel and no sound that was made by any creature of the forest in all the primeval solitude for no very evident reason tracts of that wild country remain a desolation of grand and almost overwhelming beauty and in such places even the bushman speaks softly or plods on faster as though anxious to escape from them in wondering silence the teamsters however appeared by no means displeased at the solitude and brooke was not in a condition to be receptive of more than physical impressions his long boots were full of water his clothes were soaked the sliding gravel had galled his feet and his limbs ached the beasts were also flagging for their loads were heavy and the patter of their hoofs rose with a slower beat through the rain while the teamsters said nothing save when they urged them on  they rested again for an hour and lighted another fire and afterwards found the trail smoother but evening was closing in when scrambling down from a hill shoulder they came upon a winding valley it was filled with dusky cedars and the mist rolled out of it but the teamsters quickened their pace a trifle and smote the lagging beasts then where the trees were thinner brooke saw a faint smear of vapor a little bluer than the mist drawn out across the ragged pines above him and one of his companions laughed  well he said i guess were there at last and if boss allonby isnt on the jump youll be putting away your supper and as much whisky as youve any use for inside an hour  is it a complaint hes often troubled with said brooke  the teamster grinned he has it bout once a fortnightwhen the pack beasts from the settlement come in it lasts two days in the usual way and on the third one every boy about the mine looks out for him  brooke asked no more questions though he hoped that several days had elapsed since the supplies from the settlement had come up and in another few minutes they plodded into sight of the mine the workings appeared to consist of a heap of débris and a big windlass but here and there a crazy log hut stood amidst the pines which crowded in serried ranks upon the narrow strip of clearing the door of the largest shanty stood open and the shadowy figure of a man appeared in it  goodevening boys he said you have brought the ore and saxtons man along  one of the teamsters said they had and turned to brooke with a laugh  youre not going to have any trouble tonight he said hes coming round again and when he feels like it theres nobody can be more hightoned polite     vii  allonbys illusion   the shanty was draughty as well as very damp and the glass of the flickering lamp blackened so that the light was dim it however served to show onehalf of allonbys face in silhouette against the shadow as he sat leaning one elbow on the table with a steaming glass in front of him brooke who was stiff and weary lay in a dilapidated canvas chair beside the crackling fire which filled the very untidy room with aromatic odors it was still apparently raining outside for there was a heavy splashing on the shingled roof above and darkness had closed down on the lonely valley several hours ago but while brookes eyes were heavy allonby showed no sign of drowsiness he sat looking straight in front of him vacantly  you will pass your glass across when you are ready mr brooke he said and the latter noticed his clean english intonation the night is young yet that bottle is by no means the last in the shanty and it is i think six months since i have been favored with any intelligent company i have of course the boys but with due respect to the democratic sentiments of this colony they arethe boys and the fact that they are a good deal more use to the country than i am does not affect the question  brooke smiled a little his host was attired somewhat curiously in a frayed white shirt and black store jacket which was flecked with cigar ash and had evidently seen better days though his other garments were of the prevalent jean and a portion of his foot protruded through one of his deerhide slippers his face was gaunt and haggard but it was just then a trifle flushed and though his voice was still clear and nicely modulated there was a suggestive unsteadiness in his gaze the man was evidently a victim of indulgence but there was a trace of refinement about him and brooke had realized already that he had reached the somewhat pathetic stage when pride sinks to the vanity which prompts its possessor to find a curious solace in the recollection of what he has thrown away  no more he said i have lived long enough in the bush to find out that is the way disaster lies  allonby nodded you are no doubt perfectly right he said i had however gone a little too far when i made the discovery and by that time the result of any further progress had become a matter of indifference to me in any case a man who has played his part with credit among his equals where life has a good deal to offer one and intellect is appreciated must drown recollection now and then when he drags out his days in a lonely exile that can have only one end i am quite aware that it is not particularly good form for me to commiserate myself but it should be evident that there is nobody else here to do it for me  brooke had already found his hosts maudlin moralizings becoming monotonous but he also felt in a halfcontemptuous fashion sorry for the man he was it seemed to him in spite of his proclivities in the restricted sense of the word almost a gentleman  if one may make the inquiry you came from england he said  allonby laughed most men put that question differently in this country they talk straight as they term it and apparently consider brutality to be the soul of candor yes i came from england because something happened which prevented me feeling any great desire to spend any further time there what it was does not of course matter i came out with a sheaf of certificates and several medals to exploit the mineral riches of western canada and found that mineralogical science is not greatly appreciated here  he rose and taking down a battered walnut case shook out a little bundle of greasy papers with a trembling hand then a faint gleam crept into his eyes as he opened a little box in which brooke saw several big round pieces of gold the dulness of the unpolished metal made the inscriptions on them more legible and he knew enough about such matters to realize that no man of mean talent could have won those trophies  they would i fancy have got you a good appointment anywhere he said  as a matter of fact they got me one or two it is however occasionally a little difficult to keep an appointment when obtained  brooke could understand that there were reasons which made that likely in his hosts case but he had by this time had enough of the subject  what are you going to do with the ore i brought you he said  allonbys eyes twinkled enrich what we raise here with it  it is a little difficult to understand what you would gain by that  allonby smiled suggestively i would certainly gain nothing but thomas p saxton seems to fancy the result would be profitable to him  but does the dayspring belong to saxton  allonby emptied his glass at a gulp as much as i do and he believes he has bought me soul and body the price was not a big onea very few dollars every month and enough whisky to keep me here if that failed me i should go away though i do not know where to for i cannot use the axe he is however now quite willing to part with the dayspring which has done little more than pay expenses  a light commenced to dawn on brooke and his face grew a trifle hot that is presumably why he arranged that i should bring the ore down past the few ranches near the trail at night  precisely said allonby you see saxton wants to sell the mine to another manbecause he is a fool now the chief recommendation a mine has to a prospective purchaser is naturally the quality of the ore to be got out of it  but the man who proposed buying it would send an expert to collect samples for assaying  allonbys voice was not quite so clear as it had been but he smiled again it is not quite so difficult for a mine captain who knows his business to contrive that an expert sees no more than is advisable a good deal of discretion is however necessary when you salt a poor mine with highgrade ore it has to be done with knowledge artistically you dont seem quite pleased at being mixed up in such a deal  brooke was a trifle grim in face but he laughed i have no doubt that considering everything it is a trifle absurd of me but im not he said one has to get accustomed to the notion that he is being made use of in connection with an ingenious swindle that however is a matter which rests between saxton and me and we may talk over it when i go back again why did you call him a fool  allonby leaned forward in his chair and his face grew suddenly eager i suppose you couldnt raise eight thousand dollars to buy the mine with  brooke laughed outright i should have some difficulty in raising twenty until the month is up  then you are losing a chance youll never get again in a lifetime and allonby made a little gesture of resignation i would have liked you to have taken it because i think i could make you believe in me that is why i showed you the medals  brooke looked at him curiously for a moment or two it was evident that the man was in earnest for his gaunt face was wholly intent and his fingers were trembling  it is a very long time since i had the expectation of ever calling eight thousand dollars my own and if i had them i should feel very dubious about putting them into any mine and especially this one  allonby leaned forward further and clutched his arm if you have any friends in the old country beg or borrow from them offer them twenty per centanything they ask there is a fortune under your feet of course you do not believe it nobody i ever told it to would even listen seriously  i believe you feel sure of it but that is quite another thing and brooke smiled  allonby rose shakily and leaned upon the table with his fingers trembling  listen a few minutesi was sure of attention without asking for it once he said it was i who found the dayspring not by chance prospecting but by calculations that very few men in the province could make i know what that must appearbut you have seen the medals tracing the dip and curvature of the stratification from the elktail and two prospectors shafts i knew the vein would approach the level here and i put five thousand dollarsevery cent i could scrape togetherinto proving it we struck the vein but while it should have been rich we found it broken displaced and poor there had you see been a disturbance of the strata i borrowed money worked night and day and starved myselfdid everything that would save a dollar from the rapidlymelting pileand at last we struck the vein again and struck it rich  he stopped abruptly and stood staring vacantly in front of him while brooke heard him noisily draw in his breath  you can imagine what that meant he continued after what had happened in england i could never go back a poor man but a good deal is forgiven the one who comes home rich then while i tried to keep my head we came to the fault where the ore vein suddenly ran out it broke off as though cut through with a knife and went down as the men who knew no better said to the centre of the earth now a fault is a very curious thing but one can deduce a good deal when he has studied them and a big snowslide had laid bare an interesting slice of the foundations of this country in the valley opposite it took me a month to construct my theory and that was little when you consider the factors i had to reckon withages of crushing pressure denudation by grinding ice and sliding snow and titanic upheavals thousands of years ago the result was from one point of view contemptible with about four thousand dollars i could strike the vein again  of course you tried to raise them  allonby made a grimace for six long years the men who had lent me money laughed at me and worked the poor ore back along the incline instead of boring somebody has been working itfor about five cents on the dollarever since and when i told them what they were letting slip all of them smiled compassionately i am of coursethough once it was differenta broken man with a brain clouded by whisky only fit to run a playedout mine how could i be expected to find any man a fortune  his brain it was evident was slightly affected by alcohol then but there was no mistaking the genuineness of his bitterness it was too deep to be maudlin or tinged with selfcommiseration now the little hopeless gesture of resignation he made was also very eloquent and while the rain splashed upon the roof brooke sat silent regarding him curiously the dim light and the flickering radiance from the fire were still on one side of his face forcing it up with all its gauntness of outline but the weakness had gone out of it and for once it was strong and almost stern then a little sardonic smile crept into it  a fortune under our feetand nobody will have it it is one of fates grim jests he said i spent a month making a theory and every day of six yearsthat is when i was capable of thinkinghas shown me something to prove that theory right now saxton wants to swindle another man into buying the mine foryou can call it a song  he poured out another glass with a shaking hand and then turned abruptly to his companion put on your rubber coat and come with me he said  brooke would much rather have retired to sleep but the mans earnestness had its effect on him and he rose and went out into the rain with him allonby came near falling down the shaft when they stood at its head but brooke got him into the ore hoist and sent him down after which he descended the running chain he had locked fast hand over hand the level as he had been told was close to the surface and while allonby walked unsteadily in front of him with a blinking candle in his hat they followed it into the face of the hill twice his companion stumbled over a piece of the timbering and the light went out while brooke wondered uneasily if there was another sinking anywhere ahead as he lighted it again he knew a little about mining since he had on one or two occasions earned a few dollars assisting in the driving of an adit  finally allonby stopped and leaned against the dripping rock as he took off his hat and held the candle high above his head then he turned and pointed down the gallery the way they had come  look at it he said thickly until we struck the ore where you see the extra timbering i counted the dollars every yard of it cost me as i would drops of my lifes blood i worked while the men slept and lived like a chinaman there was a fortune within my grasp if those dollars would hold out until i reached itand fortune meant england and i once more the man i had been thenwe came to that  he swung round and pointed with a wide dramatic gesture which brooke fancied he would not have used in his prosperous days to a bare face of rock it was of different nature to the sides of the tunnel and had evidently come down from above brooke understood the strata his companion had been working in had suddenly broken off and gone down only he knew where he sat down on a big fallen fragment and there was silence for a space emphasized by the drip of water in the blackness of the mine brooke was very drowsy but the scene with its loneliness and the haggard face of his companion showing pale and drawn in the candlelight had a curious effect on him and in the meanwhile compelled him to wakefulness  you know where that broken strata has dipped to he said at last  allonby who laughed in a strained fashion sat down abruptly and thrust a bundle of papers upon his companion almost to a fathom if you know anything of geology look at these  brooke who unrolled the papers knew enough to recognize that even if his companion had illusions they were the work of a clever man there was skill and what appeared to be a high regard for minute accuracy in every line of the plans while he fancied the attached calculations would have aroused a mathematicians appreciation he spent several minutes poring over them with growing wonder while allonby held the candle and then looked up at him  they would i think almost satisfy any man but there is a weak point he said  allonby smiled in a curious fashion the one the rest split on i see you understand  you deduce where the ore ought to beby analogy that kind of reasoning is i fancy not greatly favored in this country by practical men they prefer the fact that it is there established by the drill  allonby made a little gesture of impatience they have driven shaft and adit for half a lifetime most of them and they do not know yet that one law of naturethe sequence of cause and effectis immutable i have shown them the causesbut it would cost five thousand dollars to demonstrate the effect well as no one will ever spend them we will go back  he had come out unsteadily but he went back more so still as though a sustaining purpose had been taken from him and as he fell down now and then brooke had some difficulty in conveying him to the foot of the shaft when he had bestowed him in the ore hoist and was about to ascend by the chain allonby laughed  you neednt be particularly careful i shall come down here headforemost one of these nights and nobody will be any the worse off he said i lost my last chance when that vein worked out  then brooke went up into the darkness and with some difficulty hove his companion to the surface they went back to the shanty together and as allonby incontinently fell asleep in his chair brooke retired to the bunk set apart for him still tired as he was it was some little time before he slept for what he had seen had made its impression the shanty was very still save for the snapping of the fire and the brokendown outcast who held the key of a fortune the men of that province were too shrewd to believe in slept uneasily with head hung forward in his chair brooke could see him dimly by the dying light of the fire and felt very far from sure that it was a delusion he labored under  when he awakened next morning allonby was already about and looked at him curiously when he endeavored to reopen the subject  it is not considerate to refer next morning to anything a man with my shortcomings may have said the night before he said i think you should recognize that fact  im sorry said brooke still it occurred to me that you believed very firmly in the truth of it  allonby smiled drily well he said i do what is that to you  nothing said brooke i shall as i think i told you be worth about thirty dollars when the month is out what is the name of the man saxton wishes to sell the mine to  devine said allonby and went out to fling a vitriolic reproof at a miner who was doing something he did not approve of about the windlass while brooke who saw no more of him departed when he had made his breakfast     viii  a bold venture   it was a hot morning shortly after brookes return to the elktail mine and saxton sat in his galvanized shanty with his feet on a chair and a cigar in his hand the door stood open and let a stream of sunlight and balsamic odors of the forest in he wore soilstained jean and seemed very damp for he had just come out of the mine thomas p saxton was what is termed a rustler in that country a man of unlimited assurance and activity troubled by no particular scruples and keen to seize on any chances that might result in the acquisition of even a very few dollars he was also like most of his countrymen eminently adaptable and the fact that he occasionally knew very little about the task he took in hand seldom acted as a deterrent it was characteristic that during the past hour he had been endeavoring to show his foreman how to run a new rockdrilling machine which he had never seen in operation until that time  brooke who had been speaking sat watching him with a faint ironical appreciation the man was delightfully candid at least with him and though he was evidently not averse from sailing perilously near the wind it was done with boldness and ingenuity there was a little twinkle in his keen eyes as he glanced at his companion  well he said one has to take his chances when he has all to gain and very little to let up upon thats the kind of man i am  i believe you told me you had got quite a few dollars together not very long ago said brooke reflectively  the smile became a trifle plainer in saxtons eyes i did but very few of them are mine somehow i get to know everybody worth knowing in the province and now and then folks with dollars to spare for a venture hand them me to put into a deal  on the principle that one has to take his chances in this country  saxton laughed goodhumoredly well he said i never go back upon a partner anyway and when we make a deal the other folks are quite at liberty to keep their eyes on me they know the rules of the game and if they dont always get the value they expected they most usually lie low and sell out to another man instead of blaming me it pays their way better than crying down their bargain still i have started off mills and wildcat mines that turned out well and went on coining dollars for everybody  which was no doubt a cause of satisfaction to you  saxton shook his head no sir he said i felt sorry ever after i hadnt kept them  brooke straightened himself a trifle in his chair for he felt that they were straying from the point  industrial speculations in this province remind me of a game we have in england perhaps you have seen it he said reflectively you bet a shilling or halfacrown that when you lift up a thimble you will find a pea you have seen a man place under it it is not very often that you accomplish it still in that casethere isa pea  and theres nothing but lowgrade ore in the dayspring now nobody ever quite knows what he will find in a mine if he lays out enough dollars looking for it  that said brooke drily is probably correct enough especially if he is ignorant of geology what i take exception to is the sprinkling of the mine with richer ore to induce him to buy it such a proceeding would be called by very unpleasant names in england and im not quite sure it mightnt bring you within the reach of the law here mind what you may think fit to do is naturally no concern of mine but i have tolerably strong objections to taking any further personal part in the scheme  the point is that were playing it off on devine the man who robbed you and has once or twice put his foot on me i was considerably flattened when i crawled from under hes a big man and he puts it down heavy  still i feel its necessary to draw the line at a swindle  saxton made a little whimsical gesture call it the game with the pea and thimble devine has got a notion theres something in the mine and i dont know any reason why i shouldnt humor him hes quite often right you see  it does not affect the point but are you quite sure he isnt right now  you mean that allonby may be  i shouldnt consider it quite out of the question  saxton laughed softly allonbys a whiskyskin and i keep him because hes cheap and its a charity everybody knows that story of his and he only trots it out when he has got a good bottle of old rye into him at most other times hes quite sensible anyway devine doesnt want the mine to keep he has to get a working group with a certain output and assays that look well all round before he floats it off on the english market if he knew i was quietly dumping that ore in im not quite sure it would rile him  brooke sat silent a space he had discovered by this time that it is not advisable to expect any excess of probity in a mining deal and that it is the speculator and not the men who face the perils of the wilderness which are many prospecting who usually takes the profit a handful or two of dollars for them and a big bank balance for the trickster stock manipulator appeared to be the rules of the game still nobody can expect to acquire riches without risk or labor and it seemed no great wrong to him that the men with the dollars should lose a few of them occasionally granting that he did not however feel it warranted him in taking any active part in fleecing them  still if another bag of ore goes into the dayspring you can count me out he said no doubt its a trifle inconsistent but you will understand plainly that i take no further share in selling the mine  saxton shook his head reproachfully those notions of yours are going to get in your way and its unfortunate because we have taken hold of a big thing he said im an irresponsible planter of wildcat mining schemes youre nobody and between us were going to best devine the biggest man in his line in the province and a clever one still thats one reason why the notion gets hold of me when you come in ahead of the little man theres nothing to be got out of him and devines good for quite a pile when we can put the screw on  again brooke was sensible of a certain tempered admiration for his comrades hardihood for it seemed to him that the project he had mooted might very well involve them both in disaster  you expect to accomplish it he said  well said saxton drily i mean to try we cant squeeze him much on the dayspring but we want dollars to fight him with and thats how were going to get a few of them its on the canopus i mean to strike him  the canopus said brooke who knew the mine in question was considered a rich one how could you gain any hold on him over that  on the title by jumping it devine takes too many chances now and then and if one could put his fingers on a little information i have a notion the canopus wouldnt be his i guess you know that unless you do this that and the other after recording your correct frontage on the lead or vein you cant hold a mine on a patent from the crown suppose you have got possession and its found that there was anything wrong with the papers you or your prospectors filed the minerals go back to the crown again and the man whos first to drive his stakes in can relocate them its done now and then  brooke sat silent a space a jumperas the man who relocates the minerals somebody else has found on the ground of incorrect record or noncompliance with the mining enactments is calledis not regarded with any particular favor in that province or indeed elsewhere but his proceedings may be at least perfectly legitimate and there was a certain simplicity and daring of conception in the new scheme that had its effect on brooke  i will do what i can within limits he said  saxton nodded then you will have to get into the mine though i dont quite know how we are going to fix it yet he said anyway weve talked enough for one day already and you have to go down to the settlement to see about getting those new drills up  brooke set out for the settlement and slept at a ranch on the way where he left his horse which had fallen lame for it was a two days journey while it was late in the afternoon when he sat down to rest where the trail crossed a bridge the latter was a somewhat rudimentary log structure put together with the axe and saw alone of a width that would just allow one of the light wagons in use in that country to cross over it and as the bottom of the hollow the river swirled through was level there an ungainly piece of trestle work carried the road up to it there was a long white rapid not far away and the roar of it rang in deep vibrations among the rocks above brooke who had walked a long way found the pulsating sound soothing while the fragrance the dusky cedars distilled had its usual drowsy effect on him and as he watched the glancing water slide by his eyes grew heavy  he did not remember falling asleep but by and by the sombre wall of coniferous forest that shut the hollow in seemed to dwindle to the likeness of a trim yew hedge and the river now slid by smooth and placidly there was also velvet grass beneath his feet in place of wheelrutted gravel and brown fir needles still the scene he gazed upon was known to him though it seemed incomplete until a girl with brown eyes in a long white dress and big white hat appeared at his side she fitted the surroundings wonderfully for her almost stately serenity harmonized with the quietness and order of the still english valley but yet he was puzzled for there was sunlight on the water and he felt that the moon should be shining round and full above her shoulder then when he would have spoken the picture faded and he became suddenly conscious that his pipe had fallen from his hand and that he was dressed in soilstained jean which seemed quite out of keeping with the english lawn that was his first impression but while he wondered vaguely how he came to have a pipe made out of a corncob which cost him about thirty cents at all a rattle of displaced gravel and pounding of hoofs became audible and he recognized that something unusual was going on  he shook himself to attention and looking about him saw a man sitting stiffly erect on the driving seat of a light wagon and endeavoring to urge a pair of unwilling horses up the sloping trestle they were cayuses beasts of native blood and very uncertain temper bred by indians and as usual about halfbroken to the rein they also appeared to have decided objections to crossing the bridge for which any one new to the province would scarcely have felt inclined to blame them the river frothed beneath it the ascent was steep with a twist in it and a small log perhaps a foot through spiked down to the timbers served as sole protection it would evidently not be difficult for a pair of frightened horses to tilt a wheel of the very light vehicle over it  still the structure compared favorably with most of those in the mountains and brooke who knew that it is not always advisable to interfere in a dispute between a bush rancher and his horses sat still until it became evident to him that the man did not belong to that community he was elderly for there was grey in the hair beneath the wide hat while something in the way he held himself and the fit of his clothes which appeared unusually good suggested a connection with the cities it was however evident that he was a determined man for he showed no intention of dismounting and responded to the off horses vicious kicking with a stinging cut of the whip the result of this was a plunge and one wheel struck the foothigh guard with a crash the man plied the whip again and with another plunge and scramble the beasts gained the level of the bridge here they stopped altogether and one attempted to stand upright while brooke sprang to his feet  hadnt you better get down sir or let me lead them across he said  the man tightening both hands upon the reins cast a momentary glance at him and his little grim smile and the firm grip of his long lean fingers supplied a hint of his character  not until i have to he said theyre going to cross this bridge  brooke moved a few paces nearer it was one thing for a rancher accustomed to horses and bridges of that description to take pleasure in such a struggle but quite another in the case of a man from the cities and he had misgivings as to the result of it the latter however showed very little concern though the near horse was now apparently endeavoring to kick the front of the wagon in then brooke sprang suddenly towards them as both backed the wagon against the log he fancied that one wheel was mounting it when he seized the near horses head but after that he had very little opportunity of noticing anything  the beast plunged and came near swinging him off his feet the wagon pole creaked portentously and the whip fell swishing across the other horses back again then there was a hammering of hoofs and a rattle the team bolted incontinently and because the bridge was narrow brooke who lost his hold sprang upon the log that very indifferently guarded it it was however rounded on the top and next moment he found himself standing kneedeep in the river shaken and considerably astonished but by no means hurt a drop of ten feet or so is not very apt to hurt an agile man who alights upon his feet he saw the wagon bounce upon the halfround logs as with the team stretching out in a furious gallop in front of it it crossed the trestle on the opposite side and vanish into the forest and then finding himself very little the worse proceeded to wade back to the bridge he was plodding up the climbing trail beneath the firs when a shout came down and he saw the man had pulled the wagon up when brooke drew level he looked at him with a little dry smile  i guess you and the cayuses came off the worst he said  brooke glanced at the horses they were flecked with lather but quiet enough now and it was evident that the driver had beaten the spirit out of them on the ascent  i fancied the result would have been different a little while ago he said  the stranger laughed i most always get my way he said still i didnt pull the team up to tell you that youre going in to the settlement  brooke said he was and the stranger bade him get up which he did and seized the first opportunity of glancing at his companion there is it had already appeared to him a greater typical likeness between the business men of the pacific slope in which category he placed his companion than is usual in the case of englishmen even when large of frame they seldom put on flesh and the characteristic lean face and spare figure alone supply a hint of restlessness and activity which is emphasized by mobility of features and quick nervous gesture the man who drove the wagon was almost unusually gaunt and while his eyes which were brown and reminded brooke curiously of somebody elses seemed to scintillate with a faint sardonic twinkle there was a suggestion of reticence in his firm thin lips and an unmistakable stamp of command upon him he also held himself well and brooke fancied that he was in his own sphere a man of some importance his first observation was however not exactly what brooke would have expected from an englishman of his apparent station  im much obliged to you he said i dont like to be beaten and its a thing that doesnt happen very often besides when a horse is too much for a man its kind of humiliating theres something that doesnt strike one as quite fitting in the principle of the thing  brooke laughed im not sure its worth while to worry very much over a point of that kind especially when it seems likely to lead to nothing beyond the probability of being pitched into a river  still said the stranger with the little twinkle showing plainer in his eyes in this case it was the other man who fell in  i fancy it quite frequently is said brooke reflectively that is usually the result of meddling  the stranger nodded and quietly inspected him you have been here some time but you are an englishman he said  i am said brooke is there any reason why i should hide the fact  you couldnt do it how long have you been here  four years in all i think  what did you come out for  brooke was accustomed to western brusquerie and there was nothing in his companions manner which made the question offensive  i fancy my motive was not an unusual one to pick up a few dollars  got them yet  i cant say i have  the stranger appeared reflective there are not many folks who would have admitted that he said when a man has been four years in this country he ought to have put a few dollars together what have you been at  ranching most of the time roadmaking sawmilling and a few other occupations of the same kind afterwards  what was wrong with the ranch  persistent questioning is not unusual in that country for what is considered delicacy depends largely upon locality and brooke laughed  almost everything he said it had a good many disadvantages besides its rockiness sterility and an unusually abundant growth of twohundredfeet trees still it was the man who sold it me i found most fault with he was a land agent  one of the little men  no i believe he is considered rather a big onein fact about the biggest in that particular line  the little sardonic gleam showed a trifle more plainly in the strangers eyes he told you the land was nicely cleared ready and would grow anything  no said brooke he however led me to believe that it could be cleared with very little difficulty and that the lumber was worth a good deal i daresay it is if there was any means whatever of getting it to a mill which there isnt he certainly told me there was no reason it shouldnt grow as good fruit as any that comes from oregon while i found the greatest difficulty in getting a little green oat fodder out of it  you went back and tried to cry off your bargain  brooke glanced at his companion and fancied that he was watching him closely i really dont know any reason why i should worry you with my affairs my case isnt at all an unusual one  i dont know of any why you shouldnt go right on  then i never got hold of the man himself it was one of his agents i made the deal with and there was nothing to be obtained from him in fact i could see no probability of getting any redress at all it appears to be considered commendable to take the newlyarrived britisher in  the other man smiled drily well he said some of them most seem to expect it ever think of trying the law against the principal  the law said brooke is apt to prove a very uncertain remedy and i spent my last few dollars convincing myself that the ranch was worthless now one confidence ought to warrant another what has brought you into the bush you do not belong to it  the stranger laughed theres not much bush in this country from kootenay to caribou i havent wandered through i used to live in itquite a long while ago i came up to look at a mine i buy one up occasionally  isnt that a little risky  well said the other with a little smile it depends there are goods like eggs and oranges you dont want to keep  and a good market in england for whatever the colonials have no particular use for  the stranger laughed goodhumoredly did you ever strike any real good salt pork in canada  no said brooke decisively i certainly never did  then where does the best bacon you get in england come from same with cheeseand other things  including mines  well when any of them look like paying its generally your folk who get them know anything about the dayspring  not a great deal brooke said guardedly i have been in the workings and it is for sale  ore worth anything at the smelter  now brooke was perfectly certain that such a man as his companion appeared to be would attach no great importance to any information obtained by chance from a stranger  there is certainly a little good ore in it he said drily  that is about all you mean to tell me  it is about all i know definitely  the stranger smiled curiously well he said im not going to worry you and i guess i know a little more  brooke changed the topic and listened with growing interest and a little astonishment to his companion as they drove on the man seemed acquainted with everything he could mention including the sentiments of the insular english and the economics as well as the history of their country he was even more astonished when as they alighted before the little log hotel at the pineshrouded settlement the host greeted the stranger  youll be mr devine who wrote me about the room and a saddle horse he said  yes said the other man who glanced at brooke with a little whimsical smile you have addressed me quite correctly  brooke said nothing for he realized then something of the nature of the task he and saxton had undertaken while it was painfully evident that he had done very little to further his cause at the first encounter he also found the little gleam in devines eyes almost exasperating and turned to the hotelkeeper to conceal the fact  has the freighter come through he said  no said the man bob who has just come in said hed a big load and we neednt expect him until tomorrow  devine had turned away now and brooke touched the hotelkeepers arm i dont wish that man to know im from the elktail he said  well said the hotelkeeper you know saxtons business best but if i had any share in it and struck a man of that kind looking round for mines id do what was in me to shove the dayspring off on to him     ix  devine makes a suggestion   there was only one hotel which scarcely deserved the title in the settlement and when brooke returned to it an hour after the six oclock supper he found devine sitting on the verandah he had never met the man until that afternoon and had only received one very terse response to the somewhat acrimonious correspondence he had insisted on his agent forwarding him respecting the ranch he had no doubt that the affair had long ago passed out of devines memory though he was still on his part as determined as ever on obtaining restitution he had however no expectation of doing it by persuasion though the man was evidently a very different individual from the one his fancy had depicted and that being so recrimination appeared useless as well as undignified he was therefore while he would have done nothing to avoid him by no means anxious to spend the remainder of the evening in devines company the latter was however already on the verandah and looked up when he entered it  i had almost a fancy you meant to keep out of my way he said  brooke sat down and there was a trace of dryness in his smile  if i had felt inclined to do so you would scarcely expect me to admit it i dont mean because that would not have been complimentary to you he said  devine laughed and handed his cigarcase across take one if you feel like it i quite see your point he said some of you folks from the old country are a trifle tender in the hide but i dont mind telling you that there was a time when i spent an hour or two every day keeping out of other mens way they wanted dollars i couldnt raise you see and now and then i had to spend mornings in the city because i couldnt get into my office on account of them i meant to pay them and i did but there was no way of doing it just then  brookes smile was a trifle curious and might have been construed into implying a doubt of his companions commendable intentions but the latter did not appear to notice it and he took one of the cigars offered him and found it excellent though they were to be adversaries there was nothing to be gained by betraying a puerile bitterness against the man and now he had met him brooke was not quite so sure as he could have wished that he disliked him personally he meant to secure his six thousand dollars if it could be done which appeared distinctly doubtful and sentiment of any kind was he assured himself out of place still he did not altogether relish devines cigar  they were probably persistent men he said  devine glanced at him sharply but brookes face was or at least he hoped so expressionless  well he said tranquilly i contrive to pay my debts as the usual thing but well let that slide what are you at up here in the bush  mining just now said brooke to be more definite acting as handy man about a mine  youd make more rockdrilling feel fond of it  i cant say i do still i have a notion that it is going to lead to the acquisition of a few dollars presently  devine sat silent at a space apparently reflecting and then looked up again  now he said suppose i was to make you an offer would you feel inclined to listen to me  brooke had acquired in england a composure which was frequently useful to him but he was young and started a trifle while once more the blood showed through his unfortunately clear skin  i think i could promise that much at least he said  well said devine i have some use for a man who knows a little about bush ranches and mines and understands the english folks who now and then buy them from me i could afford to pay him a moderate salary  brooke closed one hand a trifle and the bronze deepened in his face the opportunity saxton had been waiting for was now it seemed being thrust upon him and yet he felt that he could not avail himself of it it was clear that he had everything to gain by doing so but there was he realized now a treachery he could not descend to he strove to persuade himself that this was a sentimental weakness for it had become even more apparent of late that with the knowledge he had gained of that country there would be no great difficulty in making his way once he had the dollars he had been robbed of again in his hands and he had had a bitter taste of the life that must be dragged through by the man with none still the fact that his instincts which as occasionally happens to other men would not be controlled by his reason revolted from the part he must play if he made terms with devine remained and he sat very still with forehead wrinkled and one hand clenched until his companion who had never taken his eyes off him spoke again  it doesnt sound good enough he said  brooke shook himself together as a matter of fact i am very doubtful if i shall get quite as good an offer again still i am afraid i cant quite see my way to entertaining it  no said devine i guess you have your reasons  brooke felt that he could scarcely consider the motive which had induced him to answer as he did a reason it was rather an impulse he could not hold in check or the result of a prejudice but he could not explain this and what was under the circumstances a somewhat illogical bitterness against devine took possession of him  when i first came into this province my confiding simplicity cost me a good deal and i almost think i should rather feel myself impelled to warn any of my countrymen i came into contact with against making rash ventures in land and mines than induce them to do so he said  devine smiled drily that is tolerably plain talk anyway still it ought to be clear that a man cant keep on taking folks dollars without giving them reasonable value anywhere no sir as soon as they find out he has only worthless goods to sell they stop dealing with him right away theres another point are they all fools who come out from england to buy mines and ranching land  i have certainly met a few who seemed to be of course i include myself said brooke grimly  well you can take it from me and i ought to know that there are folks back yonder quite as smart at getting one hundred and fifty cents for the dollars worth as any man in canada we neednt however worry about that i made you an offer and you have quite decided that it wouldnt suit you  again brooke sat silent a space he felt in some degree bound to saxton though he had certainly earned every dollar the latter had handed him and it had been agreed that a verbal intimation from either would suffice to terminate the compact between them there was also no reason why he should do anything that would prejudice him if he entered devines service and a very faint hope commenced to dawn on him that there might be a way out of the difficulty devine appeared to be a reasonable man and he determined to at least give him an opportunity  it is probably an unusual course under the circumstances but before i decide i would like to ask a question he said we will suppose that you or one of your agents had sold a man who did not know what he was buying a tract of worthless land and he demanded compensation what would you do  the man would naturally look at the land and use his discretion  well assume that he didnt men who come into this country at a time when everybody is eager to buy now and then most unwisely take a landagents statements for granted even if they surveyed the property offered them they would not very often be able to form any opinion of its value  then said devine drily they take their chances and cant blame the other man  still if the buyer convinced you that your agent knew the land was worth nothing when he sold it him  devine glanced at him sharply that would be a little difficult but ill answer you ive been stuck with a good many bad bargains in my time and i never went back and tried to cry off one of them no sir i took hold and worried the most i could out of them nobody quite knows what a piece of land in this country is or will be worth except that its quite certain every rod of it is going to be some use for something and bring in dollars to the man who holds on to it presently  then you would not make the victim any compensation  no sir not a cent i shouldnt consider him a victim thats quite straight  i scarcely think anybody would consider it ambiguous brooke said drily for he felt his face grow warm and realized that it was not advisable to give the anger that was gaining on him the rein it demands an equal candor and i have given you one of my reasons for deciding that it would not suit me to enter your service i cant help wondering what induced you to make me the offer  devine laughed well he said reflectively so am i i had as i told you a notion that i might have a use for a man of the kind you seem to be but im not quite so sure of it now though i dont know that im especially thin in the skin some of the questions you seem fond of asking might make trouble between you and me for another thing on thinking it over afterwards it struck me that the team might have tilted that wagon off the bridge this afternoon im not sure that they would have done but you came along handy  he rose with a little sardonic smile and went into the hotel leaving brooke sitting on the verandah and staring at the dusky forest vacantly for his thoughts were not exactly pleasant just then he had been offered a chance saxton at least would have eagerly seized upon and it was becoming evident that there was little of the stuff successful conspirators are made of in him he could not ignore the fact that it was a conspiracy they were engaged in for he meant to get his six thousand dollars back and found it especially galling to remember that it was a kindness devine had purposed doing him  he had also misgivings as to what his confederatefor that was he recognized the most fitting term he could apply to saxtonwould have to say about his decision and after all it was evident that he owed him a little once more he fumed at his folly in ever buying the ranch for all his difficulties sprang from that mistake and he felt he could not face the result of it and drag out his days cut off from all that made life bearable a mere wielder of axe and shovel without a struggle even though it left a mark on him which could never be quite effaced  the freighter came in early next morning with the drills and brooke who hired packhorses set off with them but as he drove the loaded beasts out of the clearing he saw devine watching him from the verandah with a little smile he made a salutation and brooke for no apparent reason jerked the leading packhorses bridle somewhat viciously it was a long journey to the mine and there were several difficult ascents upon the way but he reached it safely and found saxton expecting him impatiently they spent an hour or two getting the drills to work and then sat down to a meal in the galvanized shanty  saxton was damp and stained with soil his long boots were miry and one of his hands was bleeding but he laughed a little as he glanced at the heavy doughy bread and untempting canned stuff on the table and round the comfortless room  i guess i dont get my dollars easily he said there are quite a few ways of making them but the one the sensible man has the least use for is with the hammer and drill still im going back to the city and well try another one presently youll stay here about a week and then therell be work for you ive heard of something while you were away  so have i said brooke i met devine and he gave me an opportunity of entering his service  saxton became suddenly eager you took it  no said brooke drily i did not i had one or two reasons for not doing so though i feel it is very probable that you would not appreciate them  saxton stared at him in astonishment and then made a little gesture of resignation well he said i guess i wouldntafter what ive seen of you still cant you understand what kind of chance youve thrown away i might have made most anything out of the pointers you could have picked up and given me  brooke smiled drily i dont think you could he said as a matter of fact i wouldnt have given you any  saxton turned towards him resolutely with his elbows planted on the table and his black eyes intent now he said i want a straight answer are you going back on your bargain  no if i had meant to do that i should naturally have taken devines offer as i have told you a good many times already i am going to get my six thousand dollars out of him that is of course if we can manage it about which i am more than a little doubtful  saxton laughed contemptuously you would never get six dollars out of anybody who wasnt quite willing to let you have them he said a struggling man has no use for the notions you seem proud of  i really cant help having them said brooke with a little smile  saxton shook his head well he said its fortunate youre not going to be left to yourself or somebody would take the clothes off you now ive heard from a friend of mine who has a contract to build the canopus folks a flume it seems they want more water and its devines mine  how is that going to help us  since leeson made that contract he got the offer of another that would pay him better and hes willing to pass it on at devines figure to any one who will take it off his hands now ill find you a man or two and tools and when theyre ready youll start right away for the canopus and build that flume  the difficulty is that i havent the least notion how to build a flume  saxton made a little impatient gesture then i guess you have got to learn and there are plenty of men to be hired in the bush who do you know how to rough down redwood logs and blow out rocks  brooke admitted that he did and saxton nodded  then the things quite easy he said you look at the one theyve got already and make another like it havent you found out yet that a man can do most anything that another one can  well said brooke ill try it but that brings us to the question what else do you expect from me it is very probable that i shall make an unfortunate mistake for both of us if you leave me in the dark i want to understand the position  saxton explained it at length and brooke leaned back in his chair glancing abstractedly through the open door as he listened for his mind took in the details mechanically while his thoughts were otherwise busy he saw the dusky forest he had toiled and lost hope in and then turning his head a trifle the comfortless dingy room and saxtons intent face and eager eyes he was speaking with little nervous gestures vehemently and all the sensibility that the struggle had left in brooke shrank from the sordidness of the compact he had made with him the fact that his confederate apparently considered their purpose perfectly legitimate and even commendable intensified the disgust he felt but once more he told himself that he could not afford to be particular there was it seemed a price to everything and if he was ever to regain his status he must let no more opportunities slip past him  still the memory of the old house in the english valley and a certain silverhaired lady who had long ago paced the velvet lawns that swept about it with her white hand upon his shoulder returned to trouble him she had endeavored to instil the fine sense of honor that guided her own life into him and he remembered her wholesome pride and the stories she had told him of the men who had gone forth from that quiet home before him most of them had served their nation well even those who had hewn down the ancient oaks and mortgaged the wheatland in the reckless georgian days and now when the whitehaired lady slept in the still valley he was about to sell the honor she had held priceless for six thousand dollars in western canada nevertheless he strove to persuade himself that the times had changed and the old codes vanished and sat still listening while saxton stained with soil and water from the mine talked on and gesticulated with a bleeding hand he touched upon frontages oreleads record and patents from the crown and then stopped abruptly and looked hard at brooke  now i think youve got it all he said  yes said brooke whose face had grown a trifle grim i fancy i have i am to find out if i can how far the third drift runs west and when the driving of it began then one of us will stake off a claim on devines holding and endeavor with the support of the other to hold his own in as tough a struggle as was probably ever undertaken by two men in our position you see i have met devine  saxton laughed i guess hes not going to give us very much trouble hell buy us off instead once we make it plain that we have got the whip hand of him your shares six thousand dollars and if you lay them out as i tell you youll go back to england a prosperous man  brooke smiled a trifle drily i hope so he said still i shall have left more than i could buy with a great many dollars behind me in canada  dollars will buy you anything said saxton that is when you have enough of them theyre going to buy me a seat in the provincial legislature by and by then ill let the business slide and start in doing something for the other folks weve got most everything but men here and ill bring out your starving deadbeats from england and make them happylike strathcona  brooke looked hard at him and then leaned back in his chair and laughed when he saw that he was perfectly serious     x  the flume builder   it was a hot afternoon and a long trail of ethereal mist lay motionless athwart the gleaming snow above when brooke stood dripping with perspiration in the shadow of a towering pine the red dust was thick upon him and his coarse blue shirt which was badly torn fell open at the neck as he turned his head and looked down fixedly into the winding valley a lake flashed like a mirror among the trees below save where the slumbering shadows pointed downwards into its crystal depths but the strip of hillside the forest had been hewn back from was scarred and torn with raw gashes and the dull thumping of the stampheads that crushed the goldbearing quartz jarred discordantly through the song of the river mounds of débris fireblackened fir stumps and piles of halfburnt branches cumbered the little clearing round which the towering redwoods uplifted their stately spires and the acrid fumes of smoke and giant powder drifted through their drowsy fragrance  the blotch of mans crude handiwork marred the pristine beauty of the wilderness but it had its significance and pointed to what was to come when the plough had followed the axe and drill and cornfields and orchards should creep up the hillsides where now the solemn pines looked down upon the desecrated valley brooke however was very naturally not concerned with this just then he was engaged in building a flume or wooden conduit to bring down water to the mine and was intently watching two little trails of faint blue smoke with a thin red sparkle in the midst of them which crept up a dark rocks side  he had no interest whatever in the task when he undertook it but a somewhat astonishing and unexpected thing had happened for by degrees the work took hold of him he was not by nature a lounger and was endued with a certain pertinacity which had however only led him into difficulties hitherto or he would probably never have come out to canada thus it came about that when he found the building of the flume taxed all his ingenuity as well as his physical strength he became sensible of a wholly unanticipated pleasure in the necessary effort and had almost forgotten the purpose which brought him there  how long did you cut those fuses to burn he said to jimmy who though by no means fond of physical exertion had come up to assist him from the ranch  the latter glanced at the two trails of smoke which a handful of men snugly ensconced behind convenient trees were also watching  i guessed it at four minutes he said theyre bout halfway through now still i cant see nothing of the third one  no said brooke nor can i that looselyspun kind snuffs out occasionally quite sure theyre not more than halfway through  no said jimmy reflectively id give them most two minutes yet hallo what in the name of thunder are you going to do  it was not an unnatural question because when those creeping trains of sparks reached the detonators the rock would be reft asunder by giant powder and a shower of ponderous fragments and flying débris hurled across the valley while brooke who swung round abruptly bounded down the slope  jimmy stared at him in wonder and then set off without reflection in chase of him he was not addicted to hurrying himself when it was not necessary but he ran well that day with the vague intention of dragging back his comrade whose senses he fancied had suddenly deserted him the men behind the trees were evidently under the same impression for confused cries went up  go back stop right there catch him jimmy trip him up  jimmy did his best but he was slouching and loose of limb while brooke was light of foot and young he was also running his hardest with grim face and set lips straight for the rock and was scrambling across the débris beneath it which rolled down at every step when jimmy reached up and caught his leg he said nothing but when brooke slid backwards grabbed his jacket which tore up the back and there was a shout from the men behind the trees two of whom came running towards the pair  pull him down no let go of him and tear the fuses out  nobody saw exactly what took place next and neither brooke nor jimmy afterwards remembered but in another moment the latter sat gasping among the débris while his comrade clambered up the slope alone it also happened though everybody was too intent to notice this that a girl with brown eyes and a big white hat who had been strolling through the shadow of the pines on the ridge above stopped abruptly just then she could see the trail of sparks creep across the stone and understood the position which the shouts of the miners would have made plain to her if she had not she could not see the mans face though she realized that he was in imminent peril and felt her heart throb painfully then in common with the rest of those who watched him she had a second astonishment for he did not pull out the burning fuses but crawled past them and bent over something with a lighted match in his hand  brooke in the meanwhile set his lips as the match went out and struck another while a heavy silence followed the shouts the men who grasped his purpose now realized that interference would come too late and those who had started from them went back to the trees there only remained brooke clinging with one hand to a cranny of the rock while he held the match whose diminutive flame showed pale in the blaze of sunlight and jimmy rising apparently halfdazed from among the débris the girl in the white hat afterwards recalled that picture and could see the two lonely men blurred figures in the shadows and clustering pines when that happened she also felt a curious little thrill which was halfhorror and halfappreciation  then the third fuse sparkled and brooke sprang down grasped jimmys shoulder and drove him before him there was a fresh shouting and now every one could see two men running for their lives for the shelter of the pines it seemed a very long while before they reached them and all the time three blue trails of smoke and sparkling lines of fire were creeping with remorseless certainty up the slope of stone the girl upon the ridge above closed her hands tightly to check a scream and bronzed men who had braved a good many perils in their time set their lips or murmured incoherently  in the meanwhile the two men were running well with drawn faces staring eyes and the perspiration dripping from them and there was a hoarse murmur of relief when at last they flung themselves into the shadow of the pines it was followed by a stunning detonation and a blaze of yellow flame while the hillside trembled when the smoke rolled down flying fragments of rock came out of it there was a roar of falling stones a crashing in the forest where great boughs snapped and the lake boiled as though torn up by cannon shot then a curious silence followed intensified by an occasional splash and rattle as a stone which had travelled farther than the rest came down and the girl in the white hat retired hastily as the fumes of giant powder which produce dizziness and nausea drifted up the hillside  brooke sat down on a felled log jimmy leaned against a tree and while the men clustered round them they looked at one another and gasped heavily  i figured youd be blown into very little pieces less than a minute ago said one of those who stood by what did you do it for anyway  brooke blinked at the questioner third fuse snuffed out he said it would have spoiled the shot i cut it to match the others and lighted it  this was comprehensible for to rend a piece of rock effectively it is occasionally necessary to apply the riving force at several places at the same time  still you could have pulled the other fuses out and put new ones back it would have been considerably less risky said another man  brooke laughed breathlessly it certainly would but i never thought of that he said  then jimmy broke in what made me sit down like i did he said  it was probably the same thing that tore my jacket halfway up the back  well said jimmy theres a big lump there didnt use to be on the side of my head too and it was the concernedest hardest kind of rock i sat down upon next time you try to blow yourself up im not going after you  brooke glanced at him quietly with a curious look in his eyes  what made you come at all he said  jim appeared to reflect ive done quite a lot of foolish things beforeand i dont quite know  brooke only smiled but a little flush crept into jimmys face for men do not express their sentiments dramatically in that country that is unless they are connected with mineral speculations or the selling of land  of course he said i fancy i shall remember it  they turned away together to inspect the result of the shot and one of the miners who looked after them nodded approval when that man takes hold of anything he puts it through most every time he said theres good hard sand in him  in the meanwhile jimmy glanced at his comrade apparently with an entire absence of interest out of halfclosed eyes  i guess you were too busy to see a friend of yours a little while ago he said  i expect i was said brooke anyway nobody im acquainted with is likely to be met with in this part of the province unless it was saxton  no said jimmy it wasnt him saxton doesnt go trailing round in a big white hat and a fourdecker skirt with a long tail to it  brooke turned a trifle sharply and glanced at him you mean miss heathcote  yes said jimmy reflectively if its the one that was barbara last time i guess i do you have been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch she was up yonder ten minutes ago  he pointed to a forestcovered ridge above the mine but brooke looking up with all his eyes saw nothing but the serried ranks of climbing pines as it happened however the girl who stood amidst their shadows saw him and smiled she had noticed jimmys pointing hand and fancied she knew what his companion was looking for  then you are certainly mistaken he said there is nowhere she could be staying at within several leagues of the canopus  theres the englishmans old ranch house devine bought its quite a good one  brooke started a little and jimmy who was much quicker of wit than some folks believed noticed it  she certainly couldnt be staying there its quite out of the question he said with an assurance that was chiefly intended to convince himself  well said jimmy who appeared to ruminate i guess you know best still i cant think of any other place unless shes living in a cave  brooke said nothing further but signed to the men who were waiting and proceeded to roll the shattered rock out of the course of his flume he felt it was certain that jimmy was mistaken for the only other conclusion appeared preposterous and he could not persuade himself to consider it still he thought of the girl with the brown eyes often while he swung axe and hammer during the rest of the afternoon and when he strolled up the hillside after the six oclock supper he was thinking of her still he climbed until the raw gap of the workings was lost among the pines and then lay down  the evening was still and cool for the chill of the snow made itself felt once the sunlight faded from the valley now and then a sound came up faintly from the mine but that was not often and a great quietness reigned among the pines which towered above him two hundred feet to their topmost sprays in serried ranks they were old long before the white man first entered that wild mountain land while as he lay there in the scented dimness among their widegirthed trunks all that concerned the canopus and its pounding stampheads slipped away from him he was worn out in body but his mind was clear and free and lying still unlighted pipe in hand he gave his fancy the rein and forgetting devine and the flume dreamed of what had once been his and might if he could make his purpose good be his again  the sordid details of the struggle he had embarked upon faded from his memory for the cold silence of the mountains seemed to banish them it gave him courage and tranquillity and for the time at least nothing seemed unattainable while through all his wandering fancies moved a vision of a girl in a long white dress who looked down upon him fearlessly from a plunging ponys back that was the recollection he cherished most though he had also seen her with diamonds gleaming in her dusky hair in the vancouver operahouse  then he started and a little thrill ran through him as he wondered whether it was a trick his eyes had played him or he saw her in the flesh she stood close beside him with a grey cedar trunk behind her in a long trailing dress but the white hat was in her hand now and the little shapely head bared to the cooling touch of the dew still she had materialized so silently out of the shadows that he almost felt afraid to move lest she should melt into them again and he lay very still watching her until she glanced at him then he sprang awkwardly to his feet with a little smile  i would scarcely venture to tell you what i thought you were but it is in one respect consoling to find you real he said  why said the girl  because you are not likely to vanish again you must remember that i first saw you clothed in white samite with the moon behind your shoulder in the river  the girl laughed i wonder if you know what white samite is  i dont said brooke reflectively i never did but it seems to go with water lapping on the rocks and mystery still youarematerial fortunately  very said barbara besides i certainly did not bring you a sword  brooke appeared to consider one can never be quite certain of anythingespecially in british columbia but how did you come here  the girl favored him with a comprehensive glance which brooke felt took in his wellworn jean coarse blue shirt badlyrent jacket and shapeless hat  i was about to ask you the same thing it was in vancouver i saw you last she said  i came here on a very wicked packhorseone that kicked and on two occasions came very near falling down a gorge with me i am now building a flume for the canopus mineif you know what that is  barbara laughed i fancy i know rather more about flumes than you did a little while ago at least i have reason to believe so from what a mining foreman told me this afternoon he however expressed unqualified approval as well as a little astonishment at the progress you had made you see i happened to observe what took place before the shot was fired a few hours ago  then you witnessed an entirely unwarranted piece of folly  a curious little gleam crept into barbaras eyes but she smiled you could have cut those fuses and relighted them afterwards but since you did not remember it i dont think that counts what made you take the risk  well said brooke reflectively after worrying over the probable line of cleavage of that troublesome rock it seemed to me that if i wished to split it i must explode three charges of giant powder in certain places simultaneously now if you examine what you might call the texture of a rock though of course a really crystalline body  barbara made a little gesture of impatience that is not in the least what i meanas i fancy you are quite aware  then said brooke with a faint twinkle in his eyes im afraid i dont quite understand the moral causes of the proceeding myself though i have heard my comrade describe one quality which may have had something to do with it as mulishness it was of course reprehensible of me to be led away by it especially as when i took the contract i really didnt care if the flume was never built  and now you mean to finish it if it ruins you  no said brooke i really dont think i do in fact i hope to make a good many dollars out of it directly or indirectly  he had spoken without reflection and was sensible of a most unpleasant embarrassment when the girl glanced at him sharply which she did not fail to notice  building flumes is evidently more profitable than i thought it was she said still you will no doubt make most of those dollarsindirectly  brooke decided that it was advisable to change the subject i have he said answeredyourquestion  then i will do the same i came here because one can see the sunset on the snow from this ridge most prosaically on my feet  but from where and brookes voice was almost sharp  from the old ranch house in the valley of course  brooke made an effort to retain his serenity but his face grew a trifle grim and he looked at the girl curiously with his lips tight set then he made a little gesture  but that is where devine lives when he comes here its preposterous he said  barbara felt astonished though she was very reposeful i really dont see why it should be mrs devine is there we have to entertain a good deal in the city and are glad to get away to the mountains for quietness occasionally  but what connection can you possibly have with mrs devine  i am said barbara quietly merely her sister i have always lived with her  brooke positively gasped and you never told me  why should i you never asked me and i fancied everybody knew  brooke stood silent a moment with the fingers of one hand closed and the blood in his face then he turned as the girl moved and they went back along the little rough rail together  of course i can think of no reason he said quietly still the news astonished me  barbara glanced away from him there was only one way in which she could account for his evident concern at what she had told him and the deduction she made was not altogether unpleasant to her though as it happened it was not the correct one the man was as he had told her without friends or dollars but she knew that men with his capacities do not always remain poor in that country and there were qualities which had gained her appreciation in him while it had not dawned on her that there might also be others which could only meet with her disapprobation  if you had called at the address i gave you in vancouver you would have known exactly who i was but there is now nothing to prevent you coming to the ranch she said  brooke glanced down somewhat grimly at his hard scarred hands and his clothes and a faint flush crept into the girls face  have i to remind you again that you are not in the english valley she said mr devine at least is rather proud of the fact that he once earned his living with the shovel and the drill  i am not sure that the one you imagine is my only reason for feeling a trifle diffident about presenting myself at mr devines house said brooke very slowly  barbara looked at him with a little imperious smile i did not ask you for any at all i merely suggested that if you wished to come we should be pleased to see you at the ranch  brooke made her a little inclination and said nothing until when another whiteclad figure appeared among the pines the girl turned to him  that is mrs devine she said shall i present you  brooke stopped abruptly with as the girl noticed once more a very curious expression in his face he meant to use whatever means were available against devine but he could not profit by a womans kindness to creep into his adversarys house  no he said almost harshly not tonight it would be a pleasureanother time  barbara looked at him with big grave eyes and the faintest suggestion of color in her cheek very well she said i need not detain you  brooke swung round and as mrs devine strolled towards them retired almost precipitately into the shadow of the pines while when he stopped again with a curious little laugh he was distinctly flushed in face     xi  an embarrassing position   the wooden conduit which sprang across a gorge just there on a slender trestle was full to the brim and brooke who leaned on his long hammer shaft watched the crystal water swirl by with a satisfaction which was distinctly new to him while the roar it made as it plunged down into the valley from the end of the uncompleted flume came throbbing across the pines though it was a very crude piece of engineering that trestle had cost him hours of anxious thought and days of strenuous labor and now standing above it very wet and somewhat ragged with hands as hard as a navvys he surveyed it with a pride which was scarcely warranted by its appearance it was however the creation of his hands and brain and evidently capable of doing its work effectively  then he smiled somewhat curiously as he remembered with what purpose he had taken over the contract to build the flume from its original holder and turning abruptly away walked along it until he stopped where the torrent that fed it swirled round a pool the latter had rapidly lowered its level since the big sluice was opened and he stood looking at it intently while a project which involved a fresh struggle with hard rock and forest dawned upon him he had gained his first practically useful triumph over savage nature and it had filled him with a desire he had never supposed himself capable of for a renewal of the conflict a little sparkle came into his eyes and he stood with head flung back a trifle and his corded arms uncovered to the elbow busy with rough calculations and once more oblivious of the fact that he was only there to play his part in a conspiracy until a man with grey in his hair came out of the shadow of the pines  i came up along the flume and shes wasting very little water he said not a trickle from the trestle it would most carry a wagon you must have spent quite a pile of dollars over it  brooke smiled a trifle drily for that was a point he had overlooked until the cost had been sharply impressed upon him  im afraid i did mr devine he said still i couldnt see how to get the work done more cheaply without taking the risk of the flume settling a little by and by that would of course have started it leaking what do you think of it  devine smiled as he noticed his eagerness it seems to me that risk would have been mine he said ive seen neater work but not very much that looked like lasting longer who gave you the plan of it  nobody said brooke with a trace of the pride he could not quite repress i worried it out myself you see i once or twice gave the carpenters a hand at stiffening the railroad trestles  devine nodded and flashed a keen glance at him as he said what are you looking at that pool for  brooke stood silent a moment or two well he said diffidently it occurred to me that when there was frost on the high peaks you might have some difficulty in getting enough water to feed the flume you can see how the pool has run down already now with a hundred tons or so of rock and débris and a log framing one could contrive a very workable dam it would ensure you a full supply and equalize the pressure  you feel equal to putting the thing through  i would at least very much like to try  devine regarded him thoughtfully then you can let me have your notions  brooke unfolded his crude scheme and the other man watched him keenly until he said if that meets with your approbation i could start two of my men getting out the logs almost immediately  devine smiled has it struck you that there is a point you have forgotten  it is quite possible there are a good many  you cant think of one thats important in particular  no said brooke reflectively not just now  a little sardonic twinkle crept into devines eyes well he said before i took hold of any contract of that kind i would like to know just how much i was going to make on it and what it would cost me  brooke looked at him and laughed of course he said still i never thought of it until this moment  its quite clear you werent raised in canada said devine you can worry out the thing during the afternoon and bring along any rough plan youd like to show me to the ranch this evening thats fixed then theres another thing has anybody tried to stop you getting out lumber  no said brooke i met two men who appeared to be timberright prospectors more than once but they made no difficulty  devine who seemed a trifle astonished looked at him curiously before he turned away then he said drily you are more fortunate than i am  brooke went back to his work and supper had been cleared away in his double tent when he completed his simple toilet which had commenced with a plunge into a whirling pool of the snowfed river preparatory to his visit to the ranch jimmy who had assisted in it stood surveying him complacently  now he said with a nod of approbation i guess youll do when ive run a few stitches up the back of you stand quite still while i get the tent needle  brooke glanced at the implement he produced somewhat dubiously for it was of considerable thickness and several inches long  i suppose he said resignedly you havent got a smaller one  jimmy shook his head i guess i wouldnt trust it if i had he said i want to fix that darn up good and strong so it will do you credit there are two women at the ranch and its quite likely theyll come in and talk to you  brooke made no further protest but he smiled somewhat curiously as jimmy stitched away his work was not remarkable for neatness and brooke remembered that the two women at the ranch were fresh from the cities where men do not mend their clothes with pieces of tents or cotton flour bags then he decided that after all it did not matter what they thought of him one would probably set him down as a rude bush chopper and the other whose good opinion he would have valued under different circumstances was a kinswoman of his adversary sooner or later she would know him for what he was and then it was clear she would only have contempt for him that she of all women should be mrs devines sister was he reflected with a sense of impotent anger one of the grim jests that fate seemed to delight in playing  now said jimmy breaking off his thread at last i guess you might go most anywhere if you stand with your face to the folks who talk to you and dont sit down too suddenly be cautious how you get up again if you hear those stitches tearing through  brooke went out and discovered that jimmy had no doubt as a precautionary measure sewn several of his garments together as he walked through the shadowy bush towards the ranch devine to whom the scheme suggested had commended itself was as it happened already waiting him in a big log walled room he sat by the open window which looked across blue lake and climbing pines towards the great white ramparts of unmelting snow that shut the valley in the rest of the room was dim and now the sun had gone sweet resinous odors and an exhilarating coolness that stirred the blood like wine came in two women sat back in the shadow and devine moved a little in his chair as he answered one of them  i know very little about the man but i never saw more thorough work than he has put in on the flume he said thats most enough guarantee for him but there are one or two points about him i cant quite worry out the meaning of for one thing the timberrighters havent stopped him chopping  mrs devine looked thoughtful for she was acquainted with the less pleasant aspect of mineowning but barbara broke in  it is a little difficult to understand what use timberrights would be to anybody here she said they could hardly get their lumber out and there are very few people to sell it to if they put up a mill  i expect they mean to sell it me said devine a trifle grimly  but you always cut what you wanted without asking anybody  i did still it seems scarcely likely that im going to do it again if anyone has located timberrightswhich hed get for most nothing on a patent from the crownhe has never worried about them until the canopus began to pay of course one has to put in timber as he takes out the ore and it seems to have struck somebody that the men who started it on the canopus had burnt off all the young firs they ought to have kept thats why he bought those timberrights up  still there are thousands of them nobody can ever use and you must have timber said barbara  precisely said devine that man figures that when i get it hes going to screw a big share of the profits in this mine out of me  a portentous sparkle crept into barbaras eyes while mrs devine who knew her husband best watched him with a little smile  but that is infamous extortion said the girl  devine laughed well he said its not going to be good business for the man who puts up the game but i dont quite see why he didnt strike brooke for a few dollars as well men of his kind are like ostriches they take in most anything  he might have said more but brooke appeared in the doorway just then and stood still with so barbara fancied a faint trace of disconcertion when he saw the women until devine turned to him  come right in he said barbara tells me she has met you but you havent seen mrs devine mr brooke who is building the new flume for me katty  there was no avoiding the introduction nor could brooke escape with an inclination as he wished to do for the lady held out her hand to him she was older and more matronly than barbara but otherwise very like her and she had the same gracious serenity still brooke felt his cheeks burn beneath the bronze on them as he shook hands with her it was one thing to wrest his dollars back from devine but while he cherished that purpose quite another to be graciously welcomed to his house  we are very pleased to see any of barbaras friends she said you apparently hadnt an opportunity of calling upon us in vancouver  brooke glanced at barbara who was not exactly pleased with her sister just then and met his gaze a trifle coldly still he was sensible of a curious satisfaction for it was evident that the girl who had been his comrade in the bush had not altogether forgotten him in the city  i left the day after miss heathcote was kind enough to give me permission he said  he felt that his response might have been amplified but he was chiefly conscious of a desire to avoid any further civilities then and because he was quite aware that barbara was watching him quietly it was a relief when devine turned to him  well get down to business he said you brought a plan of the dam along  he led the way to the little table at the window and while mrs devine went on with her sewing and barbara took up a book again brooke unrolled the plan he had made with some difficulty then the men discussed it until devine said you can start in when it pleases you and my clerk will hand you the dollars as soon as you are through how long do you figure it will take you  three or four months said brooke and looking up saw that the girls eyes were fixed on him she turned them away next moment but he felt that she had heard him and they would be companions that long  well said devine its quite likely we will be up here part at least of the time now youll have to put on more men and i havent forgotten what you admitted the day i drove you in to the settlement youll want a good many dollars to pay them  if you will give me a written contract i dare say i can borrow them from a bank agent or mortgage broker on the strength of it  oh yes said devine drily its quite likely you can but he would charge you a percentage thats going to make a big hole in the profit  im afraid i havent any other means of getting the money  well said devine i rather think you have in fact ill lend it you as the work goes on  brooke felt distinctly uncomfortable and sat silent a moment for this was the last thing he had desired or expected  i have really no claim on you sir he said at length in this province payment is very seldom made until the work is done and quite often not until a long while afterwards  devine smiled drily i guess that is my business now is there any special reason you shouldnt borrow those dollars from me  brooke felt that there was a very good one but it was one he could not well make plain to devine he was troubled by an unpleasant sense of meanness already and felt that it would be almost insufferable to have a kindness thrust upon him by his companion he was though he would not look at her also sensible that barbara heathcote was watching him covertly and decided that what he and devine had said had been perfectly audible in the silent room  i would at least prefer to grapple with the financial difficulty in my own way sir he said  devine made a little gesture of indifference then if you should want a few dollars at any time you know where to come for them now i guess were through with the business and you can talk to mrs devinewho has been thereabout the old country  brooke did so and after the first few minutes which were distinctly unpleasant to him managed to forget the purpose which had brought him to the ranch his hostess was quietly kind and evidently a lady who had appreciated and was pleased to talk about what she had seen in england which was as it happened a good deal brooke also knew how to listen and now and then a curious little smile crept into his eyes as she dilated on scenes and functions which were very familiar to him it was evident that she never for a moment supposed that the man who sat listening to her somewhat stiffly from reasons connected with jimmys repairs to his clothes could have taken a part in them but he was once or twice almost embarrassed when barbara who seemed to take his comprehension for granted broke in  in the meanwhile a miner came for devine who went out with him and by and by mrs devine making her household duties an excuse also left the room then barbara smiled a little as she turned to brooke  i wonder she said quietly why you were so unwilling to meet my sister there is really no reason why anybody should be afraid of her  brooke was glad that the dimness which was creeping across the valley had deepened the shadow in the room for he was not anxious that the girl should see his face just then  you assume that i was unwilling he said  it was evident though i am not quite sure that mrs devine noticed it  brooke saw that an answer was expected from him well he said mrs devine is a lady of station and i am you see merely the builder of one of her husbands flumes one naturally does not care to presume and it takes some little time to get accustomed to the fact that these little distinctions are not remembered in this country  barbara laughed one could get accustomed to a good deal in three or four years i scarcely think that was your reason  why said brooke  well said the girl reflectively the fact is that we do recognize the distinctions you allude to though not to the same extent that you do but it takes rather longer to acquire certain mannerisms and modes of expressing oneself than it does to learn the use of the axe and drill to be more candid any one can put on a flumebuilders clothes  i fancy you are jumping at conclusions there are hotel waiters in the old country who speak much better english than i do  it is possible i am however not quite sure that they would make good flumebuilders still we will let that pass as well as one or two vague admissions you have previously made me why wouldnt you take the dollars you needed when mr devine was perfectly willing to lend them to you  it really isnt usual to make a stranger an advance of that kind said brooke reflectively besides i might spend the dollars recklessly and then break away and leave the work unfinished some day everybody is subject to occasional fits of restlessness here  barbara laughed pshaw she said you had a much better reason than that now i think we were what might be called good comrades in the bush  again brooke felt a little thrill of pleasure the girl sat where the dim light that still came in through the open window fell upon her and she was very alluring with the faint smile which was nevertheless curiously expressive in her eyes  yes he said almost grimly i had a better reason i cannot tell you what it was but it may become apparent presently  barbara asked no more questions and while she sat silent mrs devine came in with a little dainty silver set on a tray maids of any kind and even chinese houseboys are scarce in that country especially in the bush and brooke realized that it must have been with her own hands she had prepared the quite unusual meal supper is served at six or seven oclock through most of canada probably the stove was burning and her task was but a light one but once more brooke was sensible of a most unpleasant embarrassment when she smiled at him  barbara and i got used to taking a cup of coffee in the evening when we were in england she said talking of the old country reminded me of it will you pour it out barbara  barbara did so and brookes fingers closed more tightly than was necessary on the cup she handed to him while the cracker he forced himself to eat came near choking him this was absurd sentimentality he told himself but for all that he dared scarcely meet the eyes of the lady who had he realized prepared that meal out of compliment to him it was a relief when it was over and he was able to take his leave but as it happened he forgot the plan he had laid down and barbara who noticed it overtook him in the loghall devine had not come back yet  we shall be here for some little timein fact until mr devine has seen the new adit driven she said  brooke understood that this was tantamount to a general invitation and smiled as she noticed somewhat wryly  i am afraid i shall scarcely venture to come back again he said mrs devine is very kind but still you seeit really wouldnt be fitting  then he turned and vanished into the darkness outside and barbara went back to the lighted room with a curious look in her eyes     xii  brooke is carried away   the flume was finished and the dam already progressing well when one morning devine came out somewhat grim in face from the new adit he was driving at the canopus the captain of the mine also came with him and stood still evidently in a state of perplexity when devine looked at him  well said the latter brusquely what are we going to do wilkins  the captain blinked at the forest with eyes not yet accustomed to the change of light as though in search of inspiration which apparently did not come  theres plenty timber yonder he said  there is said devine drily still as we cant touch a log of it it isnt much use to us there is no doubt about the validity of the patent that fellow holds it under either and it covers everything right back to the cañon he doesnt seem disposed to make any terms with me  wilkins appeared to reflect hanging off for a bigger figure but there are points im not quite clear about mackinders not quite the man to play that gamei guess i know him well and if it had been left to him once he saw there were dollars in the thing hed have jumped right on to them and lit out for the cities to raise cain with them now i kind of wonder if theres a bigger man behind him  thats my end of the business said devine with a little grim smile ill take care of it there are men in the cities who would find any deadbeat dollars if he wanted them for a fling at me the question iswhat about the mine you feel reasonably sure were going to strike ore that will pay for the crushing at the end of that adit  wilkins glanced round at the forest and then lowered his voice a trifle though it was some distance off and there was nobody else about  we have got to sirand its there if its anywhere he said you have seen the yield on the lower workings going down until its just about worth while to keep the stamps going and though none of the boys seem to notice anything there are signs that are tolerably clear to me that the pay dirts running right out still i guess the chances of striking it again rich on the different level are good enough for me to put most every dollar i have by me in on a share of the crushings i cant say any more than that  no said devine drily anyway im going on with the adit but about the timber  well we will want no end of props and thats a fact its quite a big contract to hold up the side of a mountain when youre working through soft stuff and crumbly rock and the splitlogs weve been worrying along with arent going to be much use to us we want round props grown the size were going to use with the strength the tree was meant to have in them  devine looked thoughtful then ill have to get you them say nothing to the boys and see nobody who doesnt belong to the gang you have sent there puts his foot in any part of the mine it is of course specially necessary to keep the result of the crushings quiet im not telling you this without a reason  wilkins went back into the adit and devine proceeded to flounder round the boundaries of the englishmans abandoned ranch which he had bought up for a few hundred dollars chiefly because of the house on it it consisted for the most part of a miry swamp which the few prospectors who had once or twice spent the night with him said had broken the heart of the englishman after a strenuous attempt to drain it while the rest was rock outcrop on which even the hardy conifers would not grow devine who wet himself to the knees during his peregrination had a survey plan with him but he could see no means of extending his rights beyond the crumbling splitrail fence and inside the latter there were no trees that appeared adapted for mining purposes willows straggled over the wetter places and little halfrotten pines stood tottering here and there in a tangled chaos a man could scarcely force his way through but when he had wasted an hour or two and was muddy all over it became evident that he was scarcely likely to come upon a foot of timber that would be of any use to him he had of course been told this but he had on other occasions showed the men who pointed out insuperable difficulties to him that they were mistaken  devine however was as that fact would indicate not the man to be readily turned aside he wanted mine props and meant to obtain them and though his face grew a trifle grimmer he climbed the hillside to where brooke was busy kneedeep in water at the dam he signed to him and then taking out his cigarcase sat down on a log and looked at the younger man  take one he said  brooke lighted a cigar and sat down with the water draining from him well have another tier of logs bolted on to the framing by tomorrow night he said  devine glanced at the dam indifferently you take kindly to this kind of thing he said  brooke smiled a little for he had of late been almost astonished at his growing interest in his work of scientific engineering he knew nothing though he remembered that several relatives of his had made their mark at it but every man who lives any time in the bush of the pacific slope of necessity acquires some skill with axe and crosscut saw besides a working acquaintance with the principles of construction wooden houses bridges dams must be built and now and then a wagon road underpinned with redwood logs along the side of a precipice he had done his share of such work but he had it seemed of late become endued with a boldness of conception and clearness of insight into the best means of overcoming the difficulties to be faced which had now and then astonished those who assisted him  i really think i do though i dont know why i should he said i never undertook anything of the description in england  then i guess it must be in the family any of your folks doing well back there as mechanics  brooke smiled somewhat drily as a matter of fact a near kinsman of his had gained distinction in the royal engineers and anothers name was famous in connection with irrigation works in egypt he did not however feel it in any way incumbent on him to explain this to devine  i could not exactly say they are he said anyway isnt it a little outside the question  well said devine drily i dont quite know whats born in a man will come out somehow whether its good for him or not now i was thinking over another piece of work you might feel inclined to put through for me  brooke became suddenly intent and devine noticed the little gleam in his eyes as he said if you can give me any particulars  come along said devine a trifle grimly and ill show you them then if you still feel willing to go into the thing we can worry out my notion  brooke rose and followed him along the hillside which was seamed with rock outcrop and thinly covered with brushwood while the roar of water grew louder in his ears when they had made a mile or so devine stopped and looked about him  it wouldnt cost too much to clear a groundsled trail from here to the mine he said a team of mules could haul a good many props in over it in a day  but where are you going to get them from said brooke  devine smiled curiously come along a little further and ill show you  again brooke went with him wondering a little for he knew that a cañon would cut off all further progress presently until devine stopped once more where the hillside fell sheer away beneath them  now he said quietly i guess were there you can see plenty young firs that would make mining props yonder  brooke certainly could the hillside in front of him rose steep as a roof to the ridge where the tufts of ragged pines were silhouetted in sombre outline against the gleaming snow behind streaked with drifting mist they rolled upwards in serried ranks and there was apparently timber enough for half the mines in the province the difficulty however was the reaching it for between him and it a greenstained torrent thundered through a tremendous gap whose walls were worn smooth and polished for four hundred feet or so above that awful chasm rose bare and slippery slopes of rock on which there was foothold for neither man nor beast and only a stunted pine clung here and there in the crannies what the total depth was he did not know but he recoiled instinctively from the contemplation of it and would have drawn back a yard or two only that devine stood still looking down into the gap with his usual grim smile  still it was a minute or two before he was sensible of more than a vague awe and a physical shrinking from that tremendous display of natures forces and then by degrees his brain commenced to record the details of the scene he saw the snowfed river diminished by distance to a narrow green riband swirling round the pools and frothing with a curious livid whiteness over reef and boulder far down in the dimness the roar it made came up in long pulsations of sound which were flung back by the climbing pines that seemed to tremble in unison with it the rocks were hollowed a trifle at their bases and arched above the river it was as a picture aweinspiring and sublime but from a practical point of view an apparently insurmountable barrier between the owner of the canopus mine and the timber he desired devine however knew better for he was a man who had grappled with a good many apparently insuperable difficulties and brooke became sensible that he expected an expression of opinion from him  the timber is certainly there but i quite fail to see how it could be of the least use to anybody situated where we are he said that cañon is i should fancy one of the deepest in the province  devine nodded but the little smile was still in his eyes and he pointed to the one where by crawling down the gully a torrent had fretted out an agile man might reach a jutting crag a couple of hundred feet below  the point is that it isnt very wide he said it wouldnt take a great many fathoms of steel rope to reach across it  brooke realized that because the crag projected a little this was correct but as yet the suggestion conveyed no particular meaning to him  no he said still it isnt very evident what use that would be  devine laughed now if you had told me you knew anything about engineering you would have given yourself away have you never heard of an aerial tramway its quite simplea steel rope set up tight a winch for hauling and a trolley with that working and a skidslide up the gully one could send over the props we want without much difficulty it would be cheaper than buying off the timberrighters  brooke gasped as the daring simplicity of the scheme dawned on him if one had nerve enough to undertake it the thing was perfectly feasible and he turned to devine with a glow in his eyes  it could be done he said still do you know anybody who would be willing to stretch that rope across  devine looked at him steadily noticing the slight dilation of his nostrils and the intentness of his face  well he said drily i was going to ask you  the blood surged into brookes forehead and for the time he forgot his six thousand dollars and that the man who made the suggestion had plundered him of them he had during the course of his english education shown signs of a certain originality and daring of thought which had slightly astonished those who taught him and then had lounged three or four years away in the quiet valley where originality of any kind was not looked upon with favor the men and women he had been brought into contact with in london were also for the most part those who regarded everything from the accepted point of view and his engagement to the girl his friends regarded with disapproval had though he did not suspect this at the time been in part at least a protest against the doctrine that no man of his station must do anything that was not outwardly befitting and convenient to it  the revolt had brought him disaster as it usually does but it had also thrust upon him the necessity of thinking for himself though even during his two years struggle on the worthless ranch he had not realized what qualities he was endued with for it was not until he met barbara heathcote by the river that they were wholly stirred into activity then ambition selfconfidence and lust of conflict with men and nature asserted themselves for it was in point of fact a sword she had brought him still he was as yet a trifle inconsequent and precipitate in his activities for at times the purpose which had sent him to the canopus mine faded into insignificance and he became oblivious to everything beyond the pleasure he found in the grapple with natural difficulties he was engaged in those who had known brooke in england would have had little difficulty in recognizing him morally or physically as he stood brawny and sinewy in ragged jean high above the thundering river  then ill undertake it he said with a little vibration in his voice  devine looked hard at him again feel sure you can do it youll want good nerves  i think i can said brooke with a quietness the other man appreciated  then you can go down to the mineral developments new shaft where they have one of those tramways working and see how they swing their ore across the valley ill give you a line to the manager start when youre ready  devine said nothing further as they turned back towards the mine but brooke felt that the bargain was already made his companion was not the man to haggle over nonessentials but one who knew what he wanted and usually went straight to the point brooke left him presently and turning off where the flume climbed to the dam came upon jimmy tranquilly leaning upon his shovel while he watched the two or three men who toiled waistdeep in water  i was kind of wondering whether she wouldnt be stiffer with another log or two in that framing he said in explanation  of course said brooke drily its more restful than shovelling still thats my affair and youll have to rustle more and wonder less im going to leave you in charge here  jimmy grinned then i guess the way that dam will grow will astonish you when you come back again wherere you going to  brooke told him and jimmy contemplated the forest reflectively  well he said nobody who saw you at the ranch would ever have figured you had snap enough to put a contract of that kind through still you have me behind you  a good way as a rule said brooke drily especially when there is anything one can get very wet at to be done still i shouldnt wonder if you were quite correct i scarcely think i ever suspected i had it in myself  jimmy still ruminated a man is like a mine you see the indications on the top but you cant be sure whether theres gold at the bottom or dirt that wont pay for washing until you set the drills going or put in the giant powder and shake everything up still i cant quite figure how anything of that kind could have happened to you  brooke flashed a quick glance at him but jimmys eyes were vacant and he was apparently watching a mink slip in and out among the roots of a cedar  there is a good deal of gravel waiting down there and only two men to heave it out he said  oh yes said jimmy tranquilly still its a good while until its dark and i was thinking now if you had the dollars you threw away over that ranch and me for a partner youd make quite a smart contractor while theyre wanting flumes and bridges everywhere its a game one can pile up dollars at  brookes face flushed a trifle and he slowly closed one hand  confound the six thousand dollars and you for reminding me of them he said get on with your shovelling     xiii  the old love   next morning brooke set out for the mineral development syndicates new shaft which lay a long days ride nearer the railroad through the bush and was well received by the manager  stay just as long as it pleases you and look at everything you want though youll have to excuse me going round with you today he said theres a party of the directors city friends coming up and its quite likely theyll keep me busy  brooke was perfectly content to go round himself and he had acquired a good deal of information about the working of aerial tramways when he sat on the hillside watching a rattling trolley swing across the tree tops beneath him on a curving rope of steel a foreman leaned on a sawnoff cedar close by and glanced at brooke with a little ironical grin when a hum of voices broke out behind them  you hear them i guess the boss is enjoying himself he said  brooke turned his head and listened and a woman said but how do those little specks of gold get into the rock it really looks so solid  thats nothing said the foreman she quite expects him to know how the earth was made still the other ones the worst youll hear her starting in again once she gets her breath its not information shes wanting but to hear herself talk  the prediction was evidently warranted for another voice broke in what makes those little trucks run down the rope gravity of course i might have known that how clever of you to think of it you havent anything like that at those works youre a director of shafton  brooke started a little for though the speaker was invisible her voice was curiously familiar it was also evidently an englishman who answered the last remark and brooke who decided that his ears must have deceived him nevertheless became intent he felt that the mere fancy should have awakened a host of memories but he was only sensible of a wholly dispassionate curiosity when the voice was raised again though it was at least very like one to which he had frequently listened in times past then there was a patter of approaching steps and he rose to his feet as the strangers and the mine manager came down the slope there were several men one of whom was palpably an englishman and two women one of the latter stopped abruptly with a little exclamation  harfordis it really you she said  brooke quietly swung off his wide hat which he remembered without embarrassment was considerably battered and while most of the others turned and gazed at him stood still a moment looking at her he did not appreciate being made the central figure in a dramatic incident but it was evident that the woman rather relished the situation several years had certainly elapsed since she had tearfully bidden him farewell with protestations of unwavering constancy but he realized with faint astonishment that he felt no emotion whatever not even a trace of anger  yes he said i really think it is  the woman made a little theatrical gesture which might have meant anything and in that moment the few illusions brooke still retained concerning her vanished she seemed very little older than when he parted from her and at least as comely but her shallow artificiality was very evident to him now her astonishment had he felt been exaggerated with a view to making the most of the situation and even the little tremble in her voice appeared no more than an artistic affectation the same impression was conveyed by her dress which struck him as too ornate and in no way adapted to the country  then she turned swiftly to the man who stood beside her looking on with a little faintly ironical smile he was a personable man but his lips were thin and there was a suggestion of halfcontemptuous weariness in his face  this is harford brooke shafton of course you have heard of him she said with a coquettish smile which it occurred to brooke was not under the circumstances especially appropriate harford i dont think you ever met my husband  brooke stood still and the other man nodded with an air of languid indifference glad to see you im sure he said met quite a number of englishmen in this country  then he turned towards the other woman as though he had done all that could be reasonably expected of him and when the manager of the mine led the way down into the valley brooke found himself walking with the woman who had flung him over a few paces behind the rest of the party he did not know exactly how this came about but he was certain that he at least had neither desired nor in any way contrived it  they went down into the hollow between colonnades of towering trunks crossed a crystal stream and climbed a steep ascent towards the clashing stampheads but the woman appeared in difficulties and gasped a little until brooke held out his arm he had already decided that her little highheeled shoes were distinctly out of place in that country and wondered at the same time what kind barbara heathcote wore for she at least moved with lithe gracefulness through the bush he was however sensible of nothing in particular when his companion looked up at him as she leaned upon his arm  i was wondering how long it would be before you offered to help me you used to be anxious to do it once she said  brooke smiled a little that was quite a long time ago i scarcely supposed you needed help and one does not care to risk a repulse  could you have expected one from me  there was an archness in the glance she cast him which brooke was not especially gratified to see and it struck him that the eyes which he had once considered softest blue were in reality tinged with a hazy grey but he smiled again as he parried the question one he said never quite knows what to expect from a lady  his companion made no immediate answer but by and by she once more glanced up at him  i am really not used to climbing if shafton is and i am not going any further just now she said  a newlyfelled cedar lay conveniently near the trail but its widegirthed trunk stood high above the underbrush and brooke dragged up a big hewnoff branch to make a footstool before his companion sat down on it the branch was heavy and she watched his efforts approvingly  canada has made you another man now i do not think shafton could have done that in a day she said of course he would never have tried even to please me  brooke who was by no means certain what she wished him to understand from this leaned against a cedar looking down at her gravely this was the woman who had embittered several years of his life and for whom he had flung a good deal away and now he was most clearly sensible of his folly had he met her in a drawingroom or even the vancouver operahouse it might not have been quite so apparent to him but she seemed an anachronism in that strip of primeval wilderness nature was dominant there and the dull pounding of the stampheads which came faintly through the silence among the great trunks that had grown slowly during centuries suggested mans recognition of the curse and privilege that was laid upon him in eden graceful idleness was not esteemed in that country where bread was won by strenuous toil and the stillness and dimness of those great forest aisles emphasized the womans artificial superficiality voice and gesture befrizzled strawcolored hair which he had once called golden constricted waist and figure which was suggestively wooden in its curves enforced the same impression until the man who realized that she had after all probably made at least as good a use of life as he had turned his eyes away  you really couldnt expect him to he said with a little laugh he has never had to do anything of that kind for a living as i have  he held up his hands and noticed her little shiver as she saw the scarred knuckles hard ingrained flesh and broken nails  oh she said how cruel whatever have you been doing  brooke glanced at his fingers reflectively on the contrary i suppose i ought to feel proud of them though i scarcely think i am building flumes and dams though that will hardly convey any very clear impression to you it implies swinging the axe and shovel most of every day and working up to the waist in water occasionally  but you were always so particular in england  i could naturally afford to be it cost me nothing when i was living on another mans bounty  the woman made a little gesture and you gave up everything for me  brooke laughed softly for it seemed to him that a little candor was advisable as a matter of fact i am not quite sure that i did my native wrongheadedness may have had its share in influencing me anyway that was all done withseveral years ago  you will not be bitter harford and she cast him a glance of appeal which might have awakened a trace of tenderness in the man had it sprung from any depth of feeling can anything of that kind ever be quite done with  brooke commenced to feel a trifle uneasy well he said reflectively i certainly think it ought to be  to his relief his companion smiled and apparently decided to change the subject you never even sent me a message it really wasnt kind  it appeared considerably more becoming to let myself sink into oblivion besides i could scarcely be expected to feel certain that you would care to hear from me  the woman glanced at him reflectively i have often thought about you of course i was dreadfully sorry when i had to give you up but i really couldnt do anything else and it was all for the best  of course said brooke with a trace of dryness and smiled when she glanced at him sharply i naturally mean in your case  you are only involving yourself harford you never used to be so unfeeling  i was endorsing your own statement and it is at least considerably easier to believe that all is for the best when one is prosperous you have a wealthy husband and helen who wrote me once testified that he indulged you inshe said every caprice  yes said his companion thoughtfully shafton is certainly not poor and he is almost everything any one could expect him to be as husbands go i think he is eminently satisfactory  one would fancy that an indulgent and wealthy husband of distinguished appearance would go a tolerably long way  again the woman appeared to reflect prosperity is apt to kill romance she said one is never quite content you know and i feel now and then that shafton scarcely understands me that is a complaint people appear to find ludicrous of course though i really dont see why they should do so shafton is conventional and precise you know exactly what he is going to do and that it will be right but one has longings now and then for something original and intense  brooke regarded her with a little dry smile one as he had discovered cannot have everything and as she had sold herself for wealth and station it appeared a trifle unreasonable to repine because she could not enjoy a romantic passion at the same time it was in fact very likely that had anything of the kind been thrust upon her she would not have known what to do with it it also occurred to him that there were depths in her husbands nature which she had never sounded and he remembered the look of cynical weariness in the mans face lucy coulson was one who trifled with emotions as a pastime but brooke had no wish to be made the subject of another experiment in simulated tenderness even if that was meant which under the circumstances scarcely seemed likely  well he said no doubt most people long for a good deal more than they ever get but your friends must have reached the stamps by now and they will be wondering what has become of you  i scarcely think they will the men seem to consider it a waste of time to talk to anybody who doesnt know all about ranches and mines and shafton has miss goldie to attend to she has attached herself to him like a limpet but she is of course a canadian and i really dont mind  almost involuntarily brooke contrasted her with a canadian who had spent a week in the woods with him barbara heathcote had never appeared out of place in the wilderness for she was wholly natural and had moved amidst those scenes of wild grandeur as though in harmony with them with the stillness of that lonely land in her steady eyes there was no superficial sentimentality in her for her thoughts and emotions were deep as the still blue lakes and he could not fancy her disturbing their serenity for the purpose of whiling an idle day away then his face hardened for it was becoming unpleasantly evident that she could not much longer even regard him with friendliness and there was nothing to be gained by letting his fancy run away with him  you are not the man i used to talk nonsense with harford said his companion who had in the meanwhile been watching him this country has made you quiet and a little grim why dont you go back again  i am afraid they have too many men with no ostensible income in england  still you could make it up with the old man  brookes face was decidedly grim i scarcely think i could rather more was said by both of us than could be very well rubbed off ones memory besides i think you know what kind of man he is  lucy coulson leaned forward a trifle and there was a trace of genuine feeling in her voice harford she said he frets about youand he is getting very old of course he would never show anybody what he felt but i could guess because he was once not long ago almost rude to me that could only have been on your account you know it hurts me a little though one could scarcely take exception to anything he saidbut you know the quiet precision of his manner if it wasnt quite so perfect it would be pedantic now one feels its a relic of the days of the hoops and patches ever so long ago  what did he say asked brooke a trifle impatiently  nothing that had any particular meaning by itself but for all that he conveyed an impression and i think if you were to go back  emptyhanded said brooke there are circumstances under which the desire for reconciliation with a wealthy relative is liable to misconception if i had prospered it would have been easier  lucy coulson looked at him thoughtfully perhaps i did use you rather badly and it might be possible for me to do you a trifling kindness now shall i talk to the old man when i go home again i see him often  brooke shook his head i shall never go back a poor man he said what are you doing here  everybody travels nowadays and shafton is never happy unless he is going somewhere we started for japan and decided to see the rockies and look at the british columbian mines that is of course shafton did he has money in some of them and is interested in the colonies i have to sit on platforms and listen while he abuses the government for neglecting them in fact i dont know when i shall be able to get him out of the country now of course i never expected to meet you hereand almost wonder if there is any reason beyond the one you mentioned that has kept you here so long  she glanced at him in a curious fashion and made the most of her eyes which he had once considered remarkably expressive ones  i cant quite think of any other beyond the fact that i have a few dollars at stake he said  there is nothing else  no said brooke a trifle too decisively what could there be  his companion smiled well she said i fancied there might have been a canadian they are not all very good style but some of them are almost pretty andwhen one has been a good while away  the man flushed a trifle at the faint contempt in her tone i scarcely think there is one of them who would spare a thought for me i should not be considered especially eligible even in this country  and you have a good memory  brooke felt slightly disconcerted for it was not the first delicate suggestion she had made i dont know that it is of any benefit to me you see i really havent anything very pleasant to remember  lucy coulson sighed harford she said dropping her voice a trifle you must try not to blame me if one of us had been richeri at least cant help remembering  brooke looked at her steadily exactly where she wished to lead him he did not know but she had flung away her power to lead him anywhere long ago perhaps she was influenced by vanity for there was no genuine passion or tenderness in her but brooke was a wellfavored man and she had her caprices and drifted easily  i really dont think you should he said your husband mightnt like it and it is quite a long while ago you know  a little pink flush crept into the womans cheek and she rose leisurely perhaps he will be wondering where i am after all she said you must come and make friends with him we may be staying for some time yet at the c p r hotel vancouver  brooke went with her and spent some little time talking to her husband who made a favorable impression upon him while when he took his leave of them the woman let her hand remain in his a moment longer than there was any apparent necessity for  you must come down and see usit really isnt very far and we have so much to talk about she said  brooke said nothing but he felt that he had had a warning as he swung off his big shapeless hat and turned away     xiv  brooke has visitors   the afternoon was hot and the roar of the river in the depths below emphasized the drowsy stillness of the hillside and climbing bush when brooke stood on the little jutting crag above the cañon two hundred feet above him rose a wall of fissured rock but a gully down which the white thread of a torrent frothed split through that grim battlement and already a winding strip of somewhat perilous pathway had been cut out of and pinned against the side of the chasm men with hammers and shovels were busy upon it and the ringing of the drills broke sharply through the deep pulsations of the flood while several more were clustered round the foot of an iron column which rose from the verge of the crag where the rock fell in one tremendous sweep to the dim green river  close beside it and overhung by the rock wall stood brookes double tent for absorbed as he had become in the struggle with the natural difficulties that must be faced and surmounted at every step he lived by his work and when he had risen that morning the sun had not touched the dim white ramparts beyond the climbing pines he was just then however not watching his workmen but looking up the gorge and a little thrill of pleasure ran through him when two figures in light draperies appeared at the head of it then he went up at a pace which jimmy who grinned as he watched him wondered at and stopped a trifle breathless beside the two women who awaited him above  i was almost afraid you would not come he said you are sure you would care to go down now you have done so  mrs devine gazed down into the tremendous depths with something that suggested a shiver but barbara laughed of course she said those men go up and down with big loads every day dont they  they have to and that naturally makes a difference said brooke with a little smile  then we can go down because we wish to which is in the case of most people even a better reason  mrs devine appeared a trifle uncertain and her face expressed rather resignation than any special desire to make the descent but she permitted brooke to assist her down the zigzag trail while barbara followed with light fearless tread once they entered the gully they could not however see the cañon which in the elder ladys case at least made the climb considerably easier and they reached the tent without misadventure the door was triced up to form an outer shelter and barbara was a trifle astonished when brooke signed them to enter  she had seen how he lived at the ranch and the squalid discomfort of the log room had not been without its significance to her but there was a difference now nothing stood out of place in that partition of the big double tent and from the spruce twigs which lay a soft springy carpet on the floor to the little nickelled clock above her head all she saw betokened taste and order even the neat folding chairs and table shone spotlessly and there was no chip or flaw upon the crockery laid out upon the latter there had it seemed been a change of which all this was but the outward sign in the man who stood smiling beside her  tea at four oclock is another english custom you may have become addicted to and you have had a climb he said still im afraid i cant guarantee it jimmy does the cooking  jimmy as it happened came in with a teapot in his hand just then well he said i guess im considerably smarter at it than my boss you neednt be bashful either ive a kettle that holds most of a gallon outside there on the fire and heres two big tins of fixings we sent for to vancouver  mrs devine smiled but brookes face was a trifle grim as he glanced at his retainer and barbara did not look at either of them just then it was of course after all only a little thing but she was nevertheless gratified that he could think of these trifles in the midst of his activities she however took the white metal teapot which was burnished brilliantly from jimmy who in spite of brookes warning glances still hung about the tent contemplating her with evident approbation as she passed the cups  i guess she does it considerably smarter than tom gordons bella would have done he said with a wicked grin bella had no use for teapots either shed have given it you out of the kettle  the glance brooke rewarded him with was almost venomous for he had seen the swift inquiry which had flashed into them fade as suddenly out of barbaras eyes she could not well admit the least desire to know who tom gordons bella was though she would not have been unwilling to be enlightened jimmy however beamed upon mrs devine who had taken up her cup  i hope you like it no smoke on that he said when you use the green tea a smack of the resin goes well as flavoring especially if its brewed in a coaloil tin now theres tea they make right where they sell it in vancouver but what youve got is different i guess its grown in china or it ought to be for the boss he sent me down and says he  isnt it about time you made a start at getting that boulder out said brooke drily  jimmy retired unwillingly and brooke glanced deprecatingly at his guests we have been comrades for several years he said  of course said mrs devine with a little smile still i really dont think you need be so anxious to hide the fact that you have taken some pains to provide these little dainties for us it would have been apparent in any case we know how men live in the bush  brooke made no disclaimer though a faint trace of color deepened the bronze in his face for he remembered the six thousand dollars and winced under her graciousness then they discussed other matters until at last barbara laid aside her cup  we came to see the cañon and how you mean to put the rope across she said  she glanced at her sister but mrs devine resolutely shook her head i have seen quite as much of the cañon as i have any wish to do she said besides it was not exactly an easy matter getting down here and i expect it will be considerably worse getting up you can go with mr brooke my dear  they left her in the tent and five minutes later brooke led the girl to a seat on a dizzy ledge from which the rock fell away in one awful smooth wall  now he said quietly you can look about you  barbara who had been too occupied in picking her way to notice very much as yet drew in her breath as she gazed down into the tremendous chasm the sunshine lay warm upon the pineclad slopes above but no ray of brightness streamed down into that depth of shadow and its eerie dimness was thickened by the mist which drifted filmily above the rivers turmoil out of it a deep vibratory roar came up diminished by the distance in long pulsations that died far up among the pines in sinking waves of sound  oh she said with a little gasp its tremendous  a trifle overwhelming said brooke reflectively and yet it gets hold of one there is a difference between it and the english valley you once mentioned  barbara turned to him with a little gleam in her eyes  of course she said one is glad there is since it is typical of both countries you couldnt tame this river and set it gliding smoothly between mossy steppingstones  no said brooke i scarcely think one would wish to if he could one feels it wouldnt be fitting  and yet we shall put the power thats in it into harness by and by  without taming it  barbara nodded yes she said if you had ever stood in a canadian power house as i have done once or twice you would understand you can hear the big dynamos humming in one low deep note while the little blue sparks flicker about the shafts they stand for controlled energy but the whole place rocks with the whirring of the turbines and the thunder of the water plunging down the shoots the river that drives them does it exulting in its strength you couldnt fancy it lapping among the lily leaves in sunlit pools it hasnt time  to have no time for artistic effect is typical of this country then said brooke  barbara smiled yes she said i really think it is we shall come to that later but this you see isnt art but something greater its nature untrammelled and primeval force  then you who personify reposefulness admire force  barbara held her hand up when it accomplishes anything i do but listen she said that sound isnt the discord of purposeless haste theres a rhythm in it its ordered and stately harmony  brooke sat still watching the little gleam in her brown eyes until she turned again to him  you are going to put that rope across she said  i am at least going to try there will however be difficulties  barbara smiled a little there generally are still i think you will get over them she looked down again at the tremendous gap and then met his eyes in a fashion that sent a thrill through him it would be worth while  i almost think it would still it is largely a question of dollars and i have spent a good many with no great result already  my brotherinlaw will not see you beaten he would throw in as much as the mine was worth before he yielded a point to the timberrighters  brooke noticed the little hardness in her voice and the sparkle in her eyes if he did you would evidently sympathize with him  of course though it wasnt exactly in that sense i meant it would be worth while one would naturally sympathize with anybody who was made the subject of that kind of extortion if there is anything detestable it is a conspiracy  still said brooke reflectively it is in one sense a perfectly legitimate transaction  would you consider yourself warranted in scheming to extort money from any one  brooke did not look at her it would of course dependupon for example any right i might consider i had to the money we will suppose that somebody had robbed me  then one who has been robbed may steal  brooke made a little deprecatory gesture while the blood crept to his face im afraid i have never given any questions of this kind much consideration we were discussing the country  barbara laughed of course i ought to have remembered you are so horribly afraid of betraying your sentiments in england that you would almost prefer folks to believe you hadnt any i am however going to venture on dangerous ground again i think the country is having an effect on you you have changed considerably since i met you at the ranch  it is possible and brooke met her gaze with a little smile in his eyes still i am not quite sure it was altogether the fault of the country  barbara looked down at the cañon isnt that a little ambiguous  well said brooke reflectively it is at least rather a stretching of the simile but i saw you first clothed in white samite mystic wonderful in the midst of a frothing riverand i am not quite sure that you were right when you said it was not a sword you brought me  barbara flashed a swift keen glance at him though she smiled then beware in what quarrel you draw itif i did one would expect such a gift to be used with honor it could however be legitimately employed against timberrighters claimjumpers and all schemers and extortioners of that kind  she stopped a moment and looked at him steadily now do you know that i am glad you left the ranch  why  what you are doing now is worth while you would consider that priggishness in england but its the truth  you mean helping your brotherinlaw to get ahead of the timberrighters  no said barbara that is not what i mean though if it is any consolation to you it meets with my approbation too  then what i was doing before was not worth while  that said barbara with a trace of dryness is a question you can answer best though i saw no especial evidence of activity of any kind the question iscan you do nothing better still this province needs big bridges and daringlybuilt roads  im afraid not and brooke smiled a trifle wryly it costs a good many dollars to build a big bridge and it is apparently very difficult for any man to acquire them so long as he works with his own hands  still isnt it worth the effortnot exactly for the dollars  brooke looked at her gravely with a slight hardening of his lips  i think it would be in my case he said the difficulty is that i should run a heavy risk if the effort was ever made now however i had perhaps better show you how far we have got with the tramway  there was as it happened not very much to show and before half an hour had passed barbara and mrs devine climbed the steep ascent while brooke returned to redeem the hour spent with them by strenuous toil it was also late that night before he flung aside the sheet of crude drawings and calculations he was making and leaned back wearily in his chair his limbs were aching and so were his eyes and he sat still awhile with them halfclosed in a state of dreamy languor he had dropped a tin shade over the lamp and the tent was shadowy outside the narrow strip of radiance there was no sound from the workmens bark and canvas shanty and the pulsating roar of the cañon broke sharply through an impressive stillness until at last there was a faint rattle of gravel outside that suggested the approach of a cautious foot and brooke straightened himself suddenly as a man came into the tent his face was invisible until he sat down within the range of light and then brooke started a little  saxton he said  saxton laughed and flung down his big hat precisely he said there are camps in the province i wouldnt have cared to come into like this it wouldnt be healthy for me but in this case it seemed advisable to get here without anybody seeing me left my horse two hours ago at tomlinsons ranch  it was something special brought you so far on foot  yes said saxton i guess it was i came along to see what in the name of thunder you were doing here so long  i was building devine a dam and i am now stretching a rope across the cañon to bring his mine props over  saxton straightened himself and stared at him with blank astonishment in his face  i want to understand he said you are putting him a rope across to bring props over with  yes said brooke is there anything very extraordinary in that  saxton laughed harshly under the circumstances i guess there is do you know whos stopping him cutting all the props he wants right behind the mine  no said brooke drily devine doesnt either which i fancy is probably as well for the man the one who holds the rights is i understand only the dummy  then ill tell you right now its me  brooke started visibly and then laid a firm restraint upon himself i warned you against leaving me in the dark  saxton slammed his hand down on the table well he said who would have figured on your taking up that contract what in the name of thunder do you want to build his slingway for  brooke sat thoughtfully silent for a moment or two to tell the truth im not quite sure i know the thing you see got hold of me  you dont know and saxton laughed again unpleasantly its no great wonder they were glad to send you out here from the old country the last thing i counted on was that my partner would spoil my game youll have to stop it right away  brooke closed his eyes a trifle and looked at him no he said that is precisely what cant be done  there was no anger in his voice and he made no particular display of resolution but saxton seemed to realize that this decision was definite he sat fuming for a space and then made a little emphatic gesture which expressed complete bewilderment as well as desperation still even then he was quick enough of wit to make no futile protest for there are occasions when the quiet inertia of the insular englishman who has made up his mind is more than a match for the nervous impatience of the westerner  well he said again as though it was the only thing that occurred to him what did you do it for  brooke smiled quietly as i told you not long ago i really dont know  then i guess theres nobody could size you up and put you in the grade you belong to you wouldnt take devines dollars when he wanted to hire you and now youre building flumes and dams for him i cant see any difference theres no sense in it  im afraid there is really very little myself its rather like splitting hairs isnt it still there is at least what one might call a distinction you see i took over another mans contract and what im doing now doesnt make it necessary for devine to favor me with his confidence  saxton shook his head in a fashion that suggested he considered his comrades case hopeless and its just his confidence we want he said you dont seem able to get hold of the fact that you cant make very many dollars and keep your hightoned notions at the same time the things out of the question now i once heard a lecture on the new england states long ago and pieces of it stuck to me there were two or three of the hard old puritans made their little pile cutting frenchmens and spaniards throats in the gulf of mexico and built meetinghouses when they came home and settled down still they had sense enough to see that what was the correct thing among the quakers and baptists of new england was quite out of place on the caribbean sea  brooke felt that there was truth in this but he meant at least to cling to the distinction even though he disregarded the difference and saxton seemed to realize it  well he said resignedly we may do something with that prop sling when we jump the claim how are you getting on about the mine  in point of fact im not getting on at all each time i try to saunter into the workings i am civilly turned out again devine it seems will not even let the few men who work on top in  saxton appeared to reflect now i wonder why he said hes too smart to do anything without a reason and hes not afraid of you or hed never have had you round the place still youll have to get hold of the facts we want before we can do anything and im not quite sure what use ill make of those timberrights in the meanwhile they cost me quite a few dollars and it may be a while yet before anybody takes them from me building that slingway isnt quite what i expected from devine after buying up forests to oblige him  well i will do what i can but i wish devine would give me those dollars back of his own accord im almost commencing to like the man  saxton shook his head you cant afford to consider a point of that kind when its against your business he said anyway if you can give me a blanket or two ill get some sleep now i have to be on the trail again by sunup  brooke gave him his own sprucetwig couch and made him breakfast in the chilly dawn on a kerosene stove and then was sensible of a curious relief as his confederate vanished into the filmy mists which drifted down the gorge     xv  saxton gains his point   brooke was very wet and physically weary which in part accounted for his dejected state of mind when he led his jaded horse up the last few rods of climbing trail that crossed the big divide it had just ceased raining and the slippery rock ran water while a cold wind which set him shivering shook a doleful wailing out of the scattered pines one of them had fallen and stopping beside it he looped the bridle round a broken branch and sat down to rest and think for the difficulties of the way had occupied his attention during a long days journey and since he expected to meet saxton in another hour he had food for reflection  it was not a cheerful prospect he looked down upon and that evening the desolation of the surroundings reacted upon him the gleaming snow was smothered now in banks of dingy mist and below him there rolled away a dreary waste of pines whose ragged spires rose out of the drifting vapors rent and twisted by the ceaseless winds it was in words he had not infrequently heard applied to it a hard country he must spend his years of exile in and of late nothing had gone well with him  since he had last seen saxton he had lived in a state of tension waiting for the time when circumstances should render the carrying out of their purpose feasible and yet clinging to a faint hope that he might by some unknown means still be relieved of the necessity of persisting in a course that was becoming more odious every day the dam was almost completed but it was with dismay he had counted the cost of it and twice the steel rope had torn up stays and columns and hurled them into the cañon while he would he knew be fortunate if he secured a profit of a couple of hundred dollars as the result of several months of perilous labor prosperity it was very evident was not to be achieved in that fashion he had also seen very little of barbara heathcote for some time and she had been to him as a mental stimulant of which he felt the loss while now his prospects seemed as dreary as the dripping waste he stared across with heavy eyes all this as it happened bore directly upon his errand for it once more brought home the fact that a man without dollars could expect very little in that country while there was it seemed only one way of obtaining them open to him it was true that he shrank from availing himself of it but that did not after all greatly affect the case and he endeavored to review the situation dispassionately  he had decided that he was warranted in recovering the six thousand dollars by any means available and it was evidently folly to take into account the anger and contempt of a girl who could of course be nothing to him her station placed that out of the question since it would so far as he could see be a very long time indeed before he could secure even the most modest competence and he felt that there was a still greater distinction between them morally but in spite of this he realized that the girls approbation was the one thing he clung to he could scarcely nerve himself to fling it away and yet it seemed in the light of reason a very indifferent requital for a life of struggle and poverty she had he told himself merely taken a passing interest in him and once she met a man of her own station fortunate enough to gain her regard was scarcely likely even to remember him  then he rose with a little hardening of his lips and flinging himself wearily into the saddle strove to shake off his thoughts as the jaded horse floundered down into the valley they were both too weary to attempt to pick their way and went down sliding and slipping with the gravel rattling away from under them until they reached the thicker timber and smashed recklessly through thickets of giant fern and salmon berry now and then a drooping branch struck brooke as he passed but he scarcely noticed it and rode on swaying in his saddle while great drops of moisture splashed upon his grim wet face it was sunrise when he had ridden out from the canopus mine with his horses head turned towards the settlement and dark was closing down when at last he dropped aching all over from the saddle at the door of saxtons shanty at the elktail mine the latter who opened it smiled at him somewhat drily and was by no means effusive in his greeting  i wasnt quite sure the message i sent you from vancouver would fetch you though i made it tolerably straight he said  you certainly did said brooke in fact i dont know that you could have made it more unlikely to bring me here still what put the fancy that i might disregard it into your head  saxton looked at him curiously well he said with an air of reflection you seemed to be quite at home in several senses and making the most of it there there are folks who would consider that girl with the big eyes pretty  brooke who was entering the shanty swung round sharply i think we can leave miss heathcote out its a little difficult to understand how you came to know what i was doing at the canopus you were in vancouver  saxton appeared almost disconcerted for a moment but he laughed well he said i figured on what was most likely when i heard miss heathcote was still there  he saw that he had made another mistake and wondered whether brooke who had as it happened done so had noticed it while the fact that the latters face was now expressionless roused him to a little display of vindictiveness  i heard something about her in vancouver anyway which its quite likely she didnt mention to you it was that shes mighty good friends with one of the pacific squadron officers she has a good many dollars of her own and theyre mostly folks who make a splash in their own country  brooke afterwards decided that this must have been an inspiration but just then he felt that saxton was watching him and showed no sign of interest  if she did i dont remember it though i should consider the thing quite probable he said still as miss heathcotes fancies dont concern us wouldnt it be more to the purpose if you got me a little to eat  saxton summoned his cook and nothing more was said until brooke had finished his meal then his host looked at him as they sat beside the crackling stove  isnt it bout time you made a move at the canopus he said so far as you have gone you have only spoiled my hand you didnt go there to build devine flumes and dams  in point of fact i rather think i did the difficulty however is that i am still unable to get into the mine i have invented several excuses which did not work already nobody except the men who get the ore is even allowed to look at the workings  a little gleam crept into saxtons eyes now it seems to me that devine has struck it rich or he wouldnt be so concerned particular its quite plain that he doesnt want everybody to know what hes getting out of the canopus its only a mine thats paying folks think of jumping  has it struck you that he might wish to sell it and be taking precautions for exactly the opposite reason  saxton made a little gesture of approval though he shook his head you show you have a little sense now and then but theres nothing in that view he said is a man going to lay out dollars on dams and wirerope slings when he knows that none of them will be any use to him  i think he might that is if he wanted investors who could be induced to take it off his hands to hear of it  the point is that he has only to put the canopus into the market and theyd pile down the dollars now  still it is presumably our business and not devines you purposed to talk about  saxton nodded then well start in he said you cant get into the mine and it has struck me that if you could your eyes wouldnt be as good as a compass and a measuringchain well that brings us to the next move when devine left vancouver a week ago he took up a tin case he keeps the plans and patents of the canopus in with him you neednt worry about how im sure of this but i am those papers will tell us all we want to know  i have no doubt they would still i dont see that we are any nearer getting over the difficulty devine is scarcely likely to show them me  youll have to lay your hands upon the case its in the ranch  brookes face flushed and for a moment his lips set tight while he closed one hand as he looked at his confederate then he spoke on impulse ill be hanged if i do  saxton who had perhaps expected the outbreak regarded him with a little sardonic smile  now he said quietly youll listen to me and put aside those notions of yours for a while ive had about enough of them already devine robbed youonceand he has taken dollars out of my pocket a good many times while i cant see any great difference between glancing at another mans papers and crawling into his mine were not going to take the canopus from him anywayit would be too big a dealbut we have got to find out enough to put the screw on him you dont owe him anything for youre building those flumes and dams cheaper than he would get it done by anybody else  brooke sat silent a space with the blood still in his cheeks and one hand closed he was sensible of a curious disgust and yet it was evident that his confederate was right there was after all no great difference between the scheme suggested and what he had already been willing to do and yet he was sensible that it was not that fact which chiefly influenced him for saxton had done wisely when he hinted at barbara heathcotes supposititious fondness for the naval officer brooke had already endeavored to contemplate the likelihood of something of this kind happening with equanimity and there was nothing incredible about the story the men of the pacific squadron were frequently in victoria and steamers crossed to vancouver every day but now probability had changed to what appeared to be certainty he was sensible almost of dismay at the same time the restraint which had counted most with him was suddenly removed and he turned to saxton with a little decisive gesture he certainly owed devine nothing and his confederate had when he needed it badly shown him what he fancied was in part at least genuine kindness  well he said i will do what i can  then said saxton drily you had better do it soon devine goes across to the sumas valley where hes selling land every now and then and i have reason for believing hes expected there not later than next week i guess hes not likely to take that case with him its quite a big one youll get hold of it and find out what we want to know as soon as hes gone  the question ishow am i to manage it you wouldnt expect me to pick the lock of his safe presumably  saxton who appeared reflective quite failed to notice the irony of the inquiry well he said if i figured i could do it i guess i wouldnt let that stand in my way still im not sure that he has any and its even chances he keeps the case under some books or truck of that kind in the room he has fixed up as office at the ranch you see the dollars for the men come straight up from vancouver every payday  brooke straightened himself in his chair with a little shake of his shoulders now he said well talk of something else this isnt particularly pleasant i had of course realized before i came out that one might find it necessary to follow an occupation he had no particular taste for in the dominion of canada which is it seems the home of the adaptable man who can accustom himself to anything but i really never expected that i should consider it an admissible thing to steal my employers papers that however is not the question give me a cigar and tell me how you purpose stimulating the progress of this great province when you get into the legislature  saxton did so at length and it was perfectly evident that he saw no incongruity between what he purposed to do when in the legislature and the means he adopted of getting there for he sketched out reforms and improvements with optimistic ability once or twice a sardonic smile crept into brookes eyes for there was no mistaking the fact that the man was serious and then his attention wandered and he ruminated on the position saxton appeared curiously well informed as to devines movements but though brooke could find no answer to the question how he had obtained the information it did not after all seem to be of any great importance and he once more found himself listening to his comrade languidly saxton was then declaiming against official corruption and incapacity  we want to make a clean sweep and put the best and squarest men into office this country has no use for any other kind he said  that said brooke drily is no doubt why you are going in anyway i fancy it is getting late and i have a long ride before me tomorrow  saxton smiled goodhumoredly well he said i can go just as straight as any man when ive made my little pile most folks find it a good deal easier then  it seemed to brooke who had not found adversity especially conducive to uprightness that there was perhaps a certain truth in his comrades notion but he felt no great inclination to consider the question and in another ten minutes was sinking into sleep he also started before sunrise next morning and was walking stiffly up the climbing trail to the canopus mine with the bridle of the jaded horse in his hand when he came upon barbara heathcote amidst the pines she apparently noticed his weariness and the mire upon the horse  the trail must have been very bad she said  it certainly was said brooke who because it did not appear advisable that any one should suspect he was riding to the elktail mine had taken the trail to the settlement when he set out when there has been heavy rain it usually is the trailchoppers should have laid down logs in the saverne swamp  but what took you that way said the girl it must have been a tremendous round  brooke realized that he had been indiscreet for nobody who wished to reach the settlement was likely to cross that swamp  as a matter of fact it is he said as you see the horse is almost played out  barbara glanced at him as he fancied rather curiously but she changed the subject i have a friend from vancouver who heard you play at the concert here and we had hoped you might be persuaded to bring your violin across to the ranch tonight katty asked jimmy to tell you that we expected you that is if you were not too tired  brooke felt the blood creep into his face he longed to go but he had a sense of fitness and he felt that although such scruples were a trifle out of place in his case he could not after the arrangement he had made with saxton betray the girls confidence by visiting the ranch again as a respected guest no excuse but the one she had suggested however presented itself and it seemed to him advisable to make use of it with uncompromising candidness her friendliness hurt him and since it presumably sprang from a mistaken good opinion it would be a slight relief to show her that he was deficient even in courtesy  im almost afraid i am he said  barbara heathcote had a good deal of selfrestraint but there was a trace of astonishment in her face and for a moment a suspicious sparkle in her eyes  then we will of course excuse you she said you will i hope not think it very inconsiderate of me to stop you now  brooke said nothing but tugged at the bridle viciously and trudged forward into the gloom of the pines while barbara who would not admit that she had come there in the hope of meeting him turned homewards thoughtfully as it happened she also met the freightpacker who brought their supplies up on the way  where is saverne swamp behind the range isnt it she said  yes miss said the freighter pointing across the pines back yonder  then if i wished to ride into the settlement i could scarcely go round that way  the man laughed no he said i guess you couldnt not unless you started the night before and then youd have to climb right across the big divide nobody heading for the settlement would take that trail  he went on with his loaded beasts and barbara stood still looking down upon the forest with a little pink tinge in her cheeks and a curious expression in her eyes remembering the trace of disconcertion he had shown she very much wished to know where brooke had really been     xvi  barbaras responsibility   darkness had closed down outside and the lamp was lighted in devines office which occupied a projection of the wooden ranch behind it stood the kitchen and a short corridor which gave access to both led back from its inner door to the main building another door opened directly on to the clearing and a grove of willows past which the trail led crept close up to it so that any one standing among them could see into the room there was however little probability of that happening for nobody lived in that stretch of forest except the miners whose shanty stood almost a mile away devine sat opposite the captain of the mine across the little table and he had let his cigar go out while his face was a trifle grim  the last cleanup was not particularly encouraging tom he said  wilkins nodded and there was a trace of concern in his face which was seamed and rugged for he was one of the oldtime prospectors who trusting solely to their practical acquaintance with the rocks had played a leading part in the development of the mineral resources of that province  the trouble is that the next ones going to be worse he said the paydirts getting scarcer as we cut further in and i have a notion that the boys are beginning to notice it now and then though theres not a man in the crowd who would make his grub prospecting theyre roadmakers most of them  devine glanced at the little leatherbound book he held in which was entered the net yield of gold from the ore the stamps crushed down and noted the steady decrease  its quite plain to me that the vein is working out he said it remains to be seen whether well strike better rock with the adit on the different level i dont notice very many signs of that yet  wilkins shook his head i guess i havent seen any for a week and were spending quite a pile of dollars trying to hold the hillside up the signs were all on top he said there are ranges where you can strike it just as sure and easy as falling off a log but i guess something long ago shook these mountains up and mixed up all the rock theres only one man figures he knows how it was done and he wont talk about it when hes sensible  allonby of the dayspring said devine now the last time we worried about the thing you told me you considered our chances good enough to put your savings in would you feel like doing it today i want the information not the dollars you know its generally wisest to be straight with me  no sir said wilkins drily i wouldnt  devine sat thoughtfully silent for a minute or two and the captain who lighted his cigar again wondered what was in his mind he felt tolerably certain there was as usual a good deal and that something would result from it presently  you went through the dayspring devine said at length  i did so far as i can figure its a mine that will make its living and nothing worth while more bout two or three cents on the dollar  allonby thinks more of it  a little incredulous smile crept into the captains eyes when he has got most of a bottle of rye whisky into him allonbys a skin  well said devine im going over to talk to him and i neednt keep you any longer in the meanwhile you will remember that only you and i have got to know what the canopus is really doing  the captains smile was very expressive as he went out but when the door closed behind him devine sat still with wrinkled forehead and thoughtful eyes while half an hour slipped by he was however not addicted to purposeless reflections and the results of his cogitations as a rule became apparent in due time he cheerfully took risks or chances as he called them which the average english business man would have shrunk from for the leaders of the pacific slopes activities have no time for caution life is too short they tell one to make sure of everything and it is in point of fact not particularly long in case of most of them for there is a significant scarcity of old men like the rest he staked his dollars boldly and when he lost them which happened now and then accepted it as what was to be expected and usually recouped himself on another deal  that was why he had bought the canopus under somewhat peculiar circumstances and extended the workings without concerning himself greatly as to whether every stipulation of the crown mining regulations had been complied with until the mine proved profitable when it had appeared advisable not to court inquiry which might result in the claim being jumped by applying for corrected records it also explained the fact that although he had no safe at the ranch he had brought up all the plans and papers relating to it from his vancouver office and kept them merely covered by certain dusty books nobody who might feel an illegitimate interest in them would he argued expect to find them there  while he sat there the inner door opened softly and barbara who came in noiselessly laid a hand upon his shoulder devine had not as it happened heard her but it was significant that he did not start at all and only turned his head a trifle more quickly than usual then he looked up at her quietly  are you never astonished or put out she said you didnt expect me  devine smiled a little well he said i dont think i often am the last time i remember a cinnamon bear ran me up a tree what brought you anyway  its getting late and barbara sat down you have been here two hours already now of course you show very little sign of it but i cant help a fancy that you have been worrying over something the last day or two i suppose one could scarcely expect you to take me into your confidence  the things not big enough to worry over but i have been thinking some we have struck no gold in the adit and now when were waiting for the props the englishman has dropped the rope into the cañon that little contract is going to cost him considerable  barbara wondered whether he had any particular reason for watching her or if she only fancied that his gaze was a trifle more observant than usual  still i think he will get a rope across she said  oh yes said devine indifferently theres grit in him a curious kind of man wouldnt take a good offer to work for me and yet he jumped right at those contracts hes going to find it hard to make them pay his grocery bill i guess he hasnt told you anything  no said barbara a trifle hastily for once more she felt the keen eyes scan her face of course not why should he  devine smiled if you dont know any reason you neednt ask me you cant make a britisher talk anyway unless he wants to  he made a little gesture as though to indicate that the subject was not worth discussing and then taking up a bundle of documents turned to her again  you see those papers bab theyre plans and crown patents for the mine im going away tomorrow and cant take them along so ill put them under that pile of old books yonder now if i was to tell katty to make sure the doors were fast shed get worrying but you have better nerves and ill ask you to see that nobody gets in here until i come back again nobodys likely to want to but ill put a screw in the window and give you the key  barbara laughed i shall not be afraid are the papers valuable  no said devine with a trace of dryness not exactly in fact im not quite sure they would be worth anything to anybody in a month or two still the man who got hold of them in the meanwhile might fancy he could make trouble for me  how said barbara you said they mightnt be much use to anybody  devine smiled a little but it was evident that he had considerable confidence in the discretion of his wifes sister  i cant explain part of it he said when i took hold of the canopus it didnt seem likely to pay me for my trouble and i didnt worry about the patents or how far they covered what i was doing now if you drive beyond the frontage youve made your claim on it constitutes another mine which isnt covered by your record and belongs to the crown its open to any jumper who comes along besides unless you do a good many things exactly as the law lays down your patent maynt hold good and any one who knows the regulations can rerecord the claim  that means you or the previous owner neglected one or two formalities and an unscrupulous person who found it out from those papers could take the canopus or part of it away from you  devine smiled grimly yes he said that is he might try  i understand said barbara still there are no strangers here and i dont think you have a man who would attempt anything of that kind about the mine  or at the cañon  barbara was sensible of a curious little thrill of anger for brooke was at the cañon but she looked at him steadily  no she said i am quite sure that is the last thing one would expect from anybody at the cañon but if we stay here katty will be wondering what has become of me  devine rose and followed her out of the room and in another halfhour the ranch was in darkness he rode away early next morning and the big empty livingroom seemed lonely to the two women who sat by the window when night drew in again the evening was very still and clear and the chill of the snow was in the motionless air no sound but the distant roar of the river broke the silence and when the white line of snow grew dimmer high up in the dusky blue and the pines across the clearing faded to a blur of shadow mrs devine shivered a little  i suppose quietness is good for one if only because it isnt very nice but it gets a trifle depressing now and then she said why didnt you ask mr brooke to come across  you may have noticed that he never comes when my brotherinlaw is not here and then he brings drawings or estimates of some kind with him  mrs devine appeared reflective grant has not been away for almost two weeks now and it is quite that time since we have seen mr brooke she said didnt we ask him to come when you had minnie here  you did said barbara with a faint flush which the shadows hid he asked me to excuse him  because grant was away  no said barbara drily that at least was not the reason he gave me he said he wastoo tired  mrs devine laughed for she had noticed the hardness in her sisters voice  it really must have been exasperating he should have thought of a better excuse she said you have only to hold up a finger at vancouver and they all flock round eager to do a good deal more than you wish them to while this flumebuilder doesnt seem to understand what is implied by a royal invitation no doubt you will find a way of making him realize his contumacy  i am almost afraid i shall not have the opportunity  and you cant very well attempt to make one especially as i remember now that grant told me he was very hard at work at the cañon it would be even worse to be told he was too busy since that implies that one has something better to do  barbara had a spice of temper as her sister naturally knew but she smiled at this for she was unwilling to admit even to herself and much less to anybody else that she felt the slightest irritation at the fact that brooke had shown no eagerness to avail himself of the invitation she had given him still she was on this score very far from feeling pleased with him  i dare say he has she said  then he is at least not doing it very successfully the ropei forgot how much grant said it costfell into the cañon  i am not very sure there are many men who would have attempted to put a rope across at all said barbara and did not realize for a moment that she had to some extent betrayed herself she might though she did not admit it feel displeased with the flumebuilder herself but that was no reason why she should permit another person to disparage his capabilities all of which her sister was probably acquainted with  well she said indifferently we hope he will be successful the man pleases me but i would very much like to know what grant thinks about him  then why dont you ask him  mrs devine shook her head grant never tells anybody his opinions until hes tolerably sure hes right and i fancy he is a little undecided about mr brooke as yet she said still its getting shivery and this silence is a trifle eerie im going to bed  she lighted a lamp but when she went out barbara made her way to her room without one there was nobody else beyond wilkins wife in the ranch and she had retired some time ago the rambling wooden building was not dark but dusky with black depths of shadow in the corners of the rooms for the dim crepuscular light would at that season linger almost until the dawn to some natures it would also have been more suggestive of hidden dangers than impenetrable obscurity but barbara passed up the rickety stairway and down an echoing passage fearlessly and then sat down by the open window of her room looking out into the night a halfmoon was now slowly lifting itself above the faintlygleaming snow and she could see the pines roll away in sombre battalions into the drifting mists below their sleepgiving fragrance reached her through the dewcooled air but she scarcely noticed it as she lay with her low basketchair drawn close up to the windowsill  it was the flumebuilder her thoughts hovered round and she endeavored fruitlessly to define the attraction he had for her or as she preferred to consider it the reason for the interest she felt in him she admitted that this existed and wondered vaguely how much of it was due to vanity resulting from a recognition of the fact that it was she who had roused him from a state of too acquiescent lethargy what she had seen at the quatomac ranch had had its significance for her and she had realized the hopelessness of the life he was leading there even if she had not done so he had told her more or less plainly that it was she who had given him new aspirations and reawakened his sense of responsibility that perhaps accounted for a good deal since she was endued with the compassionate maternal instinct which when it finds no natural outlet prompts many women to encourage and on opportunity shelter the beaten down and fallen  it was however evident that the flumebuilder did not exactly come under that category indeed of late his daring and pertinacity had won her admiration as well as sympathy and that led her to the question what his aspirations pointed to she would not consider it for the fashion in which she had once or twice felt his eyes dwell upon her face was in that connection almost unpleasantly suggestive then she wondered why the fact that he had not long ago excused himself from spending an evening in her company at the ranch should have hurt her as she now almost admitted that it did it was she decided not exactly due to pique or wounded vanity for though very human in many respects she at least considered herself too strong for either that however brought her no nearer any answer which commended itself to her  the man was less brilliant than several she had met she could not even be sure that there were not grave defects in his character and he was in the meanwhile a mere flumebuilder yet he was different from those other men though since the difference was by no means altogether in his favor it was almost irritating that her thoughts should dwell upon him to the exclusion of the rest there was presumably a reason for this but she made a little impatient movement and resolutely put aside the subject as one suggested itself it was she decided altogether untenable and in fact preposterous  still she felt far from sleepy and sat still shivering a little now and then while the moon rose higher above the snow until its faint light drove back the shadows from the swamp the clustering pines shook off their duskiness and grew into definite tracery an owl that hooted eerily flitted by on soundless wing and she felt the silence become suddenly almost overwhelming there was no wind that she could feel but she could hear the little willow leaves stirring it seemed beneath the cooling dew for the sound had scarcely strength enough to make a tangible impression upon her senses it however appeared to grow a trifle louder and she found herself listening with strained attention when it ceased awhile until it rose again a trifle more clearly she glanced at the cedars above the clearing but they stood sombre and motionless in silent ranks and she leaned forward in her chair with heart beating more rapidly than usual as she wondered what made those leaves move they were certainly rustling now while the ranch was very silent and the rest of the clearing altogether still  then a shadow detached itself from the rest and its contour did not suggest that of a slender tree it increased in length and remembering devines papers she rose with a little gasp her sister as he had pointed out had delicate nerves mrs wilkins was dull of hearing and as the mens shanty stood almost a mile away it was evident that she must depend upon her own resources she stood still quivering a little for almost a minute and then with difficulty repressed a cry when the dim figure of a man appeared in the clearing two minutes later she slipped softly into the room where katty devine lay asleep and opened a cupboard set apart for her husbands use while when she flitted across the stream of radiance that shone in through the window she held an object that gleamed with a metallic lustre clenched in one hand     xvii  brooke attempts burglary   the halfmoon barbara watched from her window floated slowly above the serrated tops of the dusky pines when brooke groped his way through their shadow across a strip of the englishmans swamp the ranch which he was making for rose darkly before him with the willows clustering close up to that side of it and he stopped and stood listening when he reached them the night was very still so still indeed that the deep silence vaguely troubled him high above the climbing forests great ramparts of nevermelting snow gleamed against the blue and standing there hot breathless and a trifle muddy he felt their impressive white serenity until he started at a faint rattle in the house it ceased suddenly but it had set his heart throbbing unpleasantly fast though he was sensible of a little annoyance with himself because this was the case  there was nothing he need fear and he was indeed not quite sure that the prospect of facing a physical peril would have been altogether unpleasant then devine was away the women were doubtless asleep and it was the fact that he was about to creep like a thief into a house where he had been hospitably welcomed which occasioned his uneasiness it was true that he only meant to acquire information which would enable him to recover the dollars he had been defrauded of but the reflection brought him no more consolation than it had done on other occasions when he had been sensible of the same disgust and humiliation  he was however at the same time sensible of a faint relief for the position had been growing almost intolerable of late and though he shrank from the revelation it seemed preferable that barbara heathcote should see him in the true light at last this it was evident must happen ultimately and now it would at least dispense with the hateful necessity of continuing the deception he had also though that appeared of much less importance then met with further difficulties at the cañon and he realized almost with content that devine would in all probability pay him nothing for the uncompleted work he did not wish to feel that he owed devine anything  in the meanwhile a little bent branch from which the bruised leaves drooped limply caught his eye for he had trained his powers of observation following the deer at the ranch and moving a trifle he noticed one that was broken it was evident that somebody had recently forced his way through the thicket towards the house and he wondered vacantly why anyone should have done so when a good trail led round the copse the question would probably not have occupied his attention at any other time but just then he was glad to seize upon anything that might serve to distract his thoughts from the purpose he had on hand  he could not however stay there considering it and following the bend of the willows he came to the door of the ranch kitchen behind which the office stood and once more he stopped to listen there was nothing audible but the distant roar of the cañon and though nobody could see him he felt his face grow hot as he laid one hand upon the door and inserted the point of a little steel bar in the crevice devines office was isolated from the rest of the ranch but brooke felt that if anybody heard the sound he expected to make he would not be especially sorry he would not abandon his project but he could have borne anything that made it impracticable with equanimity  the door however somewhat to his astonishment swung open at a touch and he crept in noiselessly with an even greater sense of degradation the inmates of the ranch were it seemed wholly unsuspecting and he whom they had treated with gracious kindliness was about to take a shameful advantage of their confidence still he crossed the kitchen carrying the little bar and did not stop until he reached the office door this stood ajar but he stood still a moment in place of going in longing most illogically for any interruption the ranch seemed horribly and unnaturally still for he could not hear the sound of the river now until there was a low rustle that set him quivering somebody it appeared was moving about the room in front of him then a board creaked sharply and with every nerve strung up he drew the door a trifle open  a faint stream of radiance shone in through the window but it fell upon the wall opposite and the rest of the room was wrapped in shadow in which he could just discern a dim figure that moved stealthily it was evidently a man who could have come there with no commendable purpose and as he recognized this a somewhat curious thing happened for brookes lips set tight and he clenched the steel bar in a fit of venomous anger it did not occur to him that his own object was after all very much the same as the strangers and creeping forward noiselessly with eyes fixed on the dusky figure he saw it stoop and apparently move a book that stood on what seemed to be a box that movement enabled him to gain another yard and then he stopped again bracing himself for the grapple while the dim object straightened itself and turned towards the light  brooke could hear nothing but the throbbing of his heart and for a moment his eyes grew hazy but that passed and he saw the man hold up an object that was very like a tin case he moved again nearer the light and brooke sprang forward with the bar swung aloft quick as he was the stranger was equally alert and stepped forward instead of back while next moment brooke looked into the dully glinting muzzle of a pistol  stop right where you are a voice said  brooke did as he was bidden instinctively had there been any unevenness in the voice he might have risked a rush but the grim quietness of the order was curiously impressive and for a second or two the men stood tense and motionless looking at one another with hands clenched and lips hard set brooke recognized the intruder as a man who wheeled the ore between the mine and stamps and remembered that he had not been there very long  what do you want here he said for the silence was getting intolerable  the man smiled grimly though he did not move the pistol and his eyes were unpleasantly steady  i was going to ask you the same thing but it dont count he said theres a door yonder and you have bout ten seconds to get out of it if youre here any longer youre going to take tolerably steep chances of getting hurt  brooke realized that the warning was probably warranted but he stood still stiffening his grasp on the bar for to vacate the position was the last thing he contemplated barbara heathcote was in the ranch and he did not remember that she had also two companions then nor did he know exactly what he meant to do that is while the stranger eyed him with the same unpleasant steadiness for it was evident that a very slight contraction of his forefinger would effectually prevent him doing anything then while they stood watching each other breathlessly for a second or two a door handle rattled and brooke heard a rustle of draperies  look behind you said the stranger sharply  brooke too strung up to recognize the risk of the proceeding swung round almost before he heard him and then gasped with consternation for barbara stood in the entrance holding up a light she was however not quite defenseless as brooke realized when he saw the gleaming pistol in her hand next moment his folly and the fact that the stranger had also seen it became evident for there was a hasty patter of feet and when brooke turned again he had almost gained the other door of the room barbara who had moved forward in the meanwhile however now stood between him and it and turning half round he raised the pistol menacingly then with hand clenched hard upon the bar brooke sprang  there was a flash and a detonation the acrid smoke drove into his eyes and he fell with a crash against the door which was flung to in front of him he had as he afterwards discovered struck it with his head and shoulder but just then he was only sensible of an unpleasant dizziness and a stinging pain in his left arm then he leaned somewhat heavily against the door and he and the girl looked at each other through the filmy wisps of smoke that drifted athwart the light while a rapid patter of footsteps grew less distinct barbara was somewhat white in face and her lips were quivering  are you hurt she said and her voice sounded curiously strained  no said brooke with a little hollow laugh not seriously anyway the fellow flung the door to in my face and the blow must have partly dazed me that reminds me that im wasting time where is he now  barbara made a little forceful gesture halfway across the clearing i expect you cannot go after him look at your arm  brooke turned his head slowly for the dizziness he was sensible of did not seem to be abating and saw a thin red trickle drip from the sleeve of his jean jacket which the moonlight fell upon  i scarcely think its worth troubling about the arm will bend all right he said still perhaps you wouldnt mind very much if i took this thing off  he seized the edge of the jacket and then while his face went awry let his hand drop again  it might perhaps be better to cut the sleeve he said could you run this knife down the seam the jean is very thin  the girls hand shook a little as she opened the knife he passed her and just then a cry came down faintly from one of the rooms above barbara swung round swiftly and moved into the corridor  nothing very dreadful has happened and i am coming back in a minute or two but whatever you do dont come down she said authoritatively and brooke heard a door swing to above  then she came towards him quietly and laid a hand on his shoulder  keep still and i will not be long katty is apt to lose her head she said  her fingers still quivered a little but she was deft in spite of it and when the slit sleeve fell away brooke sat down on the table with a little smile  very sorry to trouble you he said i dont know much about these things but the artery evidently isnt cut and i dont think the bone is touched that means there cant be very much harm done would you mind tying my handkerchief tightly round it where ive laid my finger  barbara who did so afterwards sat down in the nearest chair for she felt a trifle breathless as well as somewhat limp and there was an embarrassing silence while for no very apparent reason they now avoided looking at one another a little filmy smoke still drifted about the room and a short steel bar a tin case and a litter of papers lay between them on the floor there were red splashes on one or two of the latter  the man must have dropped them said barbara quietly though her voice was still not quite her usual one he of course brought the bar to open the door with  brooke did not answer the last remark  i fancy he dropped them when he flung the door in my face he said  of course said barbara he had his hands full  the point did not seem of the least importance to her but she was shaken and felt that the silence which was growing significant would be insupportable then a thought struck her and she looked up suddenly at the man  but now i remember you had the bar she said  yes said brooke very simply though his face was grim i certainly had  the girl had turned a little so that the light shone upon her and he saw the faint bewilderment in her eyes it however vanished in a moment or two but brooke decided that if he guessed her thoughts correctly he had done wisely in admitting the possession of the bar  of course you hadnt a pistol and it was no doubt the only thing you could find she said im afraid i did not even remember to thank you but to tell the truth i was too badly frightened to think of anything  brooke nodded comprehendingly but barbara noticed that the blood was in his cheeks and he smiled in a very curious fashion  i scarcely think i deserve any thanks he said  barbara made a little gesture pshaw she said you are not always so conventional and both i and grant devine owe you a great deal the man must have been a claimjumper and meant to steal those papers they arethe plans and patents of the canopus  she stopped a moment and then seeing brooke had noticed the momentary pause continued with a little forced laugh and a flush in her cheeks that was native canadian caution asserting itself i am ashamed of it but you must remember i was rather badly startled a little while ago there is no reason why i should not tellyouthis or show you the documents  brooke made a little grimace as though she had hurt him physically  i think there is he said  the girl stared at him a moment and then he saw only sympathy in her eyes  im afraid my wits have left me or i would not have kept you talking while you are in pain your arm hurts she said  no said brooke drily the arm is i feel almost sure very little the worse hadnt you better pick the papers up you will excuse me stooping to help you i scarcely think it would be advisable just now  barbara knelt down and gathered the scattered documents up while the man noticed the curious flush in her face when one of them left a red smear on her little white fingers rising she held them up to him half open as they had fallen and looked at him steadily  will you put them straight while i find the band they were slipped through she said  brooke fancied he understood her she had a generous spirit and having in a moment of confusion when she was scarcely capable of thinking concisely suggested a doubt of him was making amends in the one fashion that suggested itself then she turned away and her back was towards him as she moved slowly towards the door when a plan of the canopus mine fell open in his hand the light was close beside him but he closed his eyes for a moment and there was a rustle as the papers slipped from his fingers while when the girl turned towards him his face was awry and he looked at her with a little grim smile  i am afraid they are scattered again he said it was very clumsy of me but i find it hurts me to use my left hand  barbara thrust the papers into the case i am sorry i didnt think of that she said even if you dont appreciate my thanks you will have to put up with my brotherinlaws and he is a man who remembers it might have cost him a good deal if anybody who could not be trusted had seen those papersand now no more of them take that canvas chair and dont move again until i tell you  brooke made no answer and barbara went out into the corridor  will you dress as quickly as you can katty and come down she said i dont know where you keep the decanters and i want to give mr brooke who is hurt a little a glass of wine  brooke protested but barbara laughed as she said it will really be a kindness to katty who is now i feel quite sure lying in a state of terror with everything she dare reach out to get hold of rolled about her head  it was three or four minutes later when mrs devine appeared and barbara turned towards her speaking very quietly  there is nothing to be gained by getting nervous now she said a man came in to steal grants papers about the mine and mr brooke who saw him crept in after him though he had only a little bar and the man had a pistol i fancy grant is considerably indebted to him and we must at least keep him here until one of the boys brings up the settlement doctor  brooke rose to his feet but barbara moved swiftly to the door and turned the key in it  no she said decisively you are not going away when you are scarcely fit to walk katty you havent brought the wine yet  brooke sat down again and making no answer looked away from her for though he would greatly have preferred it he scarcely felt capable of reaching his tent then there was silence for several minutes until mrs devine came back with the wine  you are going to stay here until your arm is seen to my husband would not be pleased if we did not do everything we could for you she said     xviii  brooke makes a decision   it was the second morning after the attempt upon the papers and brooke lay in a basket chair on the little verandah at the ranch in spite of the settlement doctors ministrations his arm was a good deal more painful than he had expected it to be his head ached and he felt unpleasantly lethargic and limp it however seemed to him that this wound was not sufficiently serious to account for this and he wondered vaguely whether it resulted from too strenuous physical exertion coupled with the increasing mental strain he had borne of late that question was however of no great importance for he had a more urgent one to grapple with and in the meanwhile it was pleasant to lie there and listen languidly while barbara talked to him  the sunshine lay bright upon the climbing pines which filled the listless air with resinous odors but there was restful shadow on the verandah and wherever the eye wandered an entrancing vista of gleaming snow brooke had however seen a good deal of snow and floundered through it waistdeep already and it was the girl who sat close at hand looking it seemed to him refreshingly cool and dainty in her loose white dress his gaze most often rested on her quiet graciousness had also a soothing effect upon the man who had risen unrefreshed after a night of mental conflict which had continued through the few brief snatches of fevered sleep brooke felt the need of moral stimulant as well as physical rest for the struggle he had desisted from for the time was not over yet  he was tenacious of purpose but it had cost him an effort to adhere to the terms of his compact with saxton and it was with a thrill of intense disgust he realized how far it had led him when he came upon the thief for there was no ignoring the fact that it would be very difficult to make any great distinction between them it had also become evident that he could not continue to play the part saxton had allotted him and yet if he threw it over he stood to lose everything his companion who was at once a reproach to him and an incentive to a continuance in the career of deception impersonated her society and his few visits to the ranch had shown him the due value of the refinement and congenial environment which no man without dollars could hope to enjoy and reawakened an appreciation of the little amenities and decencies of life which had become scarcely more than a memory to him with the six thousand dollars in his hands he might once more attain them but it was now evident that the memory of how he had accomplished it would tend to mar any satisfaction he could expect to derive from this he could in the meanwhile neither nerve himself to bear the thought of the girls scorn when she realized what his purpose had been nor bid her farewell and go back to the aimless life of poverty one thing alone was certain devines papers were safe from him  he lay silent almost too long watching her with a vague longing in his gaze for her head was partly turned from him he could see her face in profile which accentuated its clean chiselling while her pose displayed the firm white neck and fine lines of the figure the thin white dress flowed away from he had also guessed enough of her character to realize that it was not to any approach to physical perfection she owed most of her attractiveness for it seemed to him that she brought with her an atmosphere of refinement and tranquillity which nothing that was sordid or ignoble could breathe in perhaps she felt his eyes upon her for she turned at last and glanced at him  i have been thinkingabout that night she said  you really shouldnt said brooke who felt suddenly uneasy it isnt worth while  barbara smiled that is a point upon which opinions may differ but i understand your attitude you see i have been in england and you apparently believe it the correct thing to hide your light under a bushel there  no said brooke drily at least not all of us in fact we are not averse from graciously permitting other folks and now and then the press to proclaim our good deeds for us i dont know that the more primitive fashion of doing it ones self isnt quite as tasteful  barbara shook her head there are she said several kinds of affectation and i am not to be put off now you are quite aware that you did my brotherinlaw a signal service and contrived to get me out of a very unpleasant and i fancy a slightly perilous situation  the color deepened a little in brookes face and once more he was sensible of the humiliation that had troubled him on previous occasions as he remembered that it was by no means to do devine a service he had crept into the ranch it was a most unpleasant feeling and he had signally failed to accustom himself to it  i really dont think there was very much risk he said besides you had a pistol  barbara laughed softly i never fired off a pistol in my life and i almost fancy there was nothing in the one in question  didnt you notice whether there were any cartridges in the chamber  no said barbara im not sure i know which the chamber is but i pressed something i supposed to be the trigger and it only made a click  brooke glanced at her a trifle sharply you meant to fire at the man  im afraid i did was it very dreadful he was there with an unlawful purpose and i saw his eyes grow wicked and his hand tighten just as you sprang at him still i was almost glad when the pistol did not go off  she seemed to have some difficulty in repressing a shiver at the recollection and brooke sat silent for a moment or two with his heart throbbing a good deal faster than usual he could guess what that effort had cost his companion and that it was his peril which had nerved her to overcome her natural shrinking from taking life perhaps barbara noticed the effect her explanation had on him and desired to lessen it for she said it really was unpleasant but i remembered that you had come there to ensure the safety of my brotherinlaws property and one is permitted to shoot at a thief in this country  brooke who could not help it made a little abrupt movement and felt his face grow hot as he wondered what she would think of him if she knew the purpose that had brought him there the fact that she seemed quite willing to believe that one was warranted in firing at a thief had also its sting  of course he said i am however inclined to think you saved my life the man probably saw your hand go up and that made him a trifle too precipitate still perhaps he only wanted to look at your brotherinlaws papers and had no intention of stealing anything  barbara who appeared glad to change the subject smiled  admitting that i cant see any great difference she said the man who runs a personal risk to secure a wallet with dollar bills in it that belongs to somebody else naturally does not expect commendation or usually get it but it seems to me a good deal meaner thing to steal a claim by cunning trickery for instance one has a certain admiration for the train robbers across the frontier for two or three roadagentsand there are not often moreto hold up and rob a train demands at least a good deal of courage but to plunder a man by prying into his secrets is only contemptible dont you think so  brooke winced beneath her gaze  well he said slowly i suppose it is still you see there may be excuses even for such a person  excuses surelyyoudo not feel capable of inventing any for a claimjumper  brooke felt that in his case there were at least one or two but he had sufficient reasons for not making them clear to the girl  well he said i wonder if you could make any for a trainrobber  barbara appeared reflective we will admit that the dishonesty is the same in both cases though that is not quite the point the men who hold a train up however take a serious personal risk and stake their lives upon their quickness and nerve they have nobody to fall back upon and must face the results if the courage of any of the passengers is equal to theirs daring of that kind commands a certain respect the claimjumper on the contrary must necessarily proceed by stealth and of course rarely ventures on an attempt until he makes sure that the law will support him because the man he means to rob has neglected some trivial requirement  then it is admissible to steal so long as you do it openly and take a personal risk still i believe i have heard of claimjumpers being shot though i am not quite sure that it happened in canada  barbara laughed they probably deserved it it is not admissible to steal under any circumstances but the safer and more subtle forms of theft are especially repellent now i think i have made out my case for the trainrobber but i cannot see why you should constitute yourself an advocate for the claimjumper  brooke contrived to force a smile it is he said often a little difficult to make sure of ones motives but we can at least take it for granted that the man who robs a train is the nobler rascal  barbara who appeared thoughtful sat silent awhile it was fortunate you arrived when you did that night she said meditatively still as you could not well have known the man meant to make the attempt or have expected to find anybody still awake at the ranch it seems an almost astonishing coincidence  though he surmised that no notion of what had brought him there had entered his companions mind brooke felt hot to the forehead now for he was unpleasantly sensible that the girl was watching him an explanation that might have served also suggested itself to him but he felt that he could not add to his offences  it certainly was he said languidly i have however heard of coincidences that were more astonishing still  barbara nodded no doubt she said we will let it go at that as you may have noticed we are now and then almost indecently candid in this country but i agree with my brotherinlaw who says that nobody could make an englishman talk unless he wanted to  silence is reputed to be golden said brooke reflectively and i really think there are cases when it is at least there was one i figured in when some two or three minutes unchecked speech cost me more dollars than i have made ever since it happened in england and i merely favored another man with my frank opinion of him after a thing of that kind one is apt to be guarded  i think you should cultivate a sense of proportion can one make up for a single mistake in one direction by erring continually in the opposite one still that is not a question we need go into now you expect to get the rope across the cañon very shortly  yes said brooke whose expression changed suddenly i do  and then  brooke who felt the girls eyes upon him and understood what she meant made a little gesture i dont know i shall probably take the trail again it does not matter greatly where it may lead me  there was a curious little vibration he could not quite repress in his voice and both he and his companion were under the circumstances silent a trifle too long for there are times when silence is very expressive then it was barbara who spoke though she felt that what she said was not especially appropriate  you will be sorry to go  brooke looked at her steadily with his lips set and though she did not see this his fingers quivering a little for he realized at last what it would cost him to leave her for a moment a hot flood of passion and longing threatened to sweep him away but he held it in check and barbara only noticed the grimness of his face  what answer could i make the conventional one demanded scarcely fits the case he said and his laugh rang hollow  but the dam will not be finished said barbara who realized that she had made an unfortunate start  again brooke sat silent it seemed folly to abandon his purpose and he wondered whether he would have sufficient strength of will to go away it was also folly to stay and sink further under the girls influence when the revelation he shrank from would if he persisted in his attempt to recover his dollars become inevitable still once he left the canopus he must go back to a life of hardship and labor and in spite of the humiliation and fear of the future he often felt the present was very pleasant on the other hand there was only scarcity exposure to rain and frost and bitter hopeless toil he sat very still with one hand closed not daring to look at his companion until she spoke again  you say you do not know where the trail may lead you and you do not seem to care one would fancy that was wrong she said  why  barbara turned a little and looked at him with a faint sparkle in her eyes in this province the trail the resolute man takes usually leads to success we want bridges and railroad trestles forests cleared and the valleys lined with roads you can build them  brooke shook his head though her confidence in him as well as her optimism had its due effect  i wish i was a little more sure he said the difficulty as i think i once pointed out is that one needs dollars to make a fair start with  they are at least not indispensable as the history of most of the men who have done anything worth while in the province shows isnt there a certain satisfaction in starting with everything against one  afterwards perhaps that is if one struggles through there is however one learns by experience really very little satisfaction at the time especially if one scarcely gets beyond the start at all  barbara smiled a little though she looked at him steadily you she said will i think go a long way in fact if it was a sword i gave you i should expect it of you  brooke came very near losing his head just then though he realized that after all the words implied little more than a belief in his capabilities and for a few insensate moments he almost decided to stay at the canopus and make the most of his opportunities saxton he reflected might put sufficient pressure upon devine to extort the six thousand dollars from him without the necessity for his part becoming apparent at all with that sum in his hands there was he felt very little he could not attain and then he shook off the deluding fancy for it once more became apparent that the deed which gave saxton the hold he wished for upon devine would even if she never heard of it stand as barrier between barbara heathcote and him  one feels inclined to wonder now and then whether success does not occasionally at least cost the man who achieves it more than it is worth he said the actual record of the leaders one is expected to look up to might in that connection provide one with a fund of somewhat astonishing information  barbara made a little gesture of impatience is the poor man the only one who can be honest  one would at least feel inclined to fancy that the man who is unduly honest runs a serious risk of remaining poor  i think that is an argument i have very little sympathy with said barbara it is you see so easy for the incapable to impeach the successful mans honesty i might even go a little further and admit that it is an attitude i scarcely expected from you  brooke smiled somewhat bitterly you will however remember that i have made no attempt to persuade you of my own integrity  just then as it happened mrs devine came into the verandah with a packet in her hand  these are the papers the man tried to steal she said since you insist upon going back to the cañon today i wonder if you would take care of them  brooke gasped and felt the veins swell on his forehead as he looked at her you wish me to take them away  of course my nerves are really horribly unsettled and i was sent to the mountains for quietness how could any one expect me to get it when i couldnt even sleep for fear of that man or some one else coming back for these documents  they are i think of considerable importance to your husband said brooke  that is precisely why i would like to feel that they were safe in your tent nobody would expect you to have them there  brooke turned his head a little so that he could see barbaras face  i appreciate your confidence he said and the girl noticed that his voice was a trifle hoarse still i must point out that i am almost a stranger to mr devine and you  barbara smiled a little but there was something that set the mans heart beating in her eyes  i am not sure that everybody would be so willing to make the most of the fact but i feel quite sure my sisters confidence is warranted she said that of course does not sound very nice but you have made it necessary  brooke who glanced curiously at the single seal laid down the packet and mrs devine smiled i feel ever so much easier now that is off my mind she said still i shall expect you to sleep with the papers under your pillow  she went out and left him and barbara alone again but brooke knew that the struggle was over and the question decided once for all the girls trust in him had not only made those papers inviolable so far as he was concerned but had rendered a breach with saxton unavoidable he knew now that he could never do what the latter had expected from him  you appeared almost unwilling to take the responsibility said the girl  brooke smiled curiously i really think that was the case he said in fact your confidence almost hurt me one feels the obligation of proving it warrantedin every respectyou see that is partly why i shall go away the day we swing the first load of props across the cañon  barbara felt a trace of disconcertion but my brotherinlaw may ask you to do something else for him  i scarcely think that is likely said brooke with a little dry smile  barbara said nothing further and when she left him brooke was once more sensible of a curious relief it would he knew cost him a strenuous effort to go away but he would at least be freed from the horrible necessity of duping the girl who it seemed believed in him when jimmy arrived that evening to accompany him back to his tent at the cañon and expressed his satisfaction at the fact that he did not appear very much the worse he smiled a trifle drily  that he said is a little astonishing i am i think warranted in believing myself six thousand dollars worse off than when i went away  jimmy stared at him incredulously  well he said i never figured you had that many and i dont quite see how you could have let them get away from you here something you didnt expect has happened  brooke appeared reflective im not quite sure whether i expected it or not but i almost hope i did he said     xix  brookes bargain   there was a portentous quietness in the little wooden town which did not exactly please mr faraday slocum the somewhat discredited local agent of grant devine as he ascended the steep street from the grocery store the pines closed in upon it but their sombre spires were growing dim and the white mists clung about them for dusk was creeping up the valley the latter fact brought slocum a sense of satisfaction and at the same time a growing uneasiness he had as it happened signally failed to collect a certain sum from the storekeeper who had expressed his opinion of him and his doings with vitriolic candor and it was partly as the result of this that very little escaped his notice as he proceeded with an ostentatious leisureliness towards his dwelling  a straggling row of stores and houses log and frame and galvanized iron jumbled all together in unsightly confusion stretched away before him towards the gap in the forest where the railroad track came in but it was the little groups of men who hung about them which occupied his quiet attention he saluted them with somewhat forced goodhumor as he went by but there was no great cordiality in their responses and some of them stared at him in uncompromising silence there was he felt a certain tension in the atmosphere and it was not without a purpose he stopped in front of the wooden hotel where a little crowd had collected upon the verandah  its kind of sultry tonight boys he said  nobody responded for a moment or two and then there was an unpleasant laugh as somebody said youve hit it i guess it is  slocum remembered that most of those loungers had been glad to greet him and even hand him their spare dollars not long ago but there was a decided difference now he was a capable business man who could make the most of an opportunity and the inhabitants of the little wooden town had shown themselves disposed to regard certain trifling obliquities leniently while they or their friends made satisfactory profits on the deals in ranching land and building lots he recommended that however was while the boom lasted but when the bottom had as they expressed it dropped out and a good many of them found themselves saddled with unmarketable possessions they commenced to be troubled with grave doubts concerning the rectitude of his conduct slocum was naturally quite aware of this but he was a man of nerve and quietly walked up the verandah steps  its that hot i must have a drink boys whos coming in with me he said genially  a few months ago a good many of them would have been willing to profit by the invitation but that night nobody moved and slocum laughed softly  well he said im not going to worry you this is evidently a temperance meeting  he passed into the empty bar alone and a man who leaned upon the counter in his shirt sleeves shook his head as he glanced towards the verandah  theyre not in a good humor tonight it looks very much as if someone has been talking to them he said  slocum smiled a little though he had already noticed this and taken precautions the barkeeper never suspected  i guess theyll simmer down who has been talking to them he said  the two ranchers you sold the hemlock range to there was another man whod bought a piece of natural prairie and it cost him most of five dollars before he got through telling them what he thought of you now i dont know what their notion is but id light out for a little if i was you  slocum appeared to reflect well he said i may go tomorrow  id go tonight said the barkeeper significantly i guess it would be wiser  slocum who did not consider it necessary to tell him that he quite agreed with this went out and a few minutes later stopped outside his house which was the last one in the town a big rudelypainted sign nailed across the front of it recommended any one who desired to buy or sell land and mineral properties or had mortgages to arrange to come in and confer with the agent of grant devine he glanced back up the street and was relieved to notice that there was nobody loitering about that part of it then he looked at the forest the trail led into which was shadowy and still and slipping round the building went in through the back of it a woman stood waiting him in a dimlylighted room which was littered with feminine clothing besides two big valises and an array of bulky packages she was expensively dressed but her face was anxious and he noticed that her fingers were quivering  youre quite ready sue he said  the woman pointed to the packages with a little dramatic gesture oh yes she said im ready though ill have to leave most two hundred dollars worth of clothes behind me ive no use for taking in plain sewing while you think over what youve brought me to in the penitentiary  slocum smiled drily if you hadnt wanted quite so many dry goods im not sure it would have come to this but we neednt worry about that just now tom will have the horses round in bout five minutes you dont figure on taking all that truck along with you  i do said the woman ive got to have something to put on when we get to oregon  well said slocum grimly ill be quite glad to get out with a whole hide and i guess it couldnt be done if we started with a packhorse train or a wagon i hadnt quite fixed to light out until i got the message that devine who didnt seem quite pleased with the last accounts was coming in  could you have stood the boys off  i might have done said slocum reflectively still i couldnt stand off devine its dollars hes coming for and ive got bout half the accounts call for here  youre going to leave him them  slocum laughed no he said i guess theyll come in handy in oregon im going to leave him the boys to reckon with theyll be here with clubs soon after the cars come in and well be a league away down the trail by then  a patter of horse hoofs outside cut short the colloquy though there was a brief altercation when the woman once more insisted on taking all the packages with her slocum terminated it by bundling her out of the door and when she tearfully consented to mount a kicking pony swung himself to the saddle still for several minutes his heart was in his mouth as he picked his way through the blacker shadows on the skirt of the beaten trail until a man rose suddenly out of them  hallo he said wherere you going  slocum leaning sideways gave his wifes pony a cut with the switch he held and then laughed as he turned to the man  i guess thats my business but im going out of town  quite sure said the other who made a sudden clutch at his bridle  he did not reach it for slocum was ready with hand and heel and the switch came down upon the outstretched arm then there was a plunge and a rapid beat of hoofs and slocum swinging half round in his saddle swept off his hat to the gasping man  i guess i am he said youll tell the boys im sorry i couldnt wait for them  then he struck his wifes horse again let him go he said well have three or four of them after us in about ten minutes  the woman said nothing but braced herself to ride and while the beat of hoofs grew fainter among the silent pines the man on foot ran gasping up the climbing trail there was bustle and consternation when he reached the wooden town and while two or three men who had good horses hastily saddled them the rest collected in clusters which coalesced and presently a body of silent men proceeded towards the slocum dwelling as they stopped in front of it the hoot of a whistle came ringing across the pines and there was an increasing roar as a train came up the valley that however did not so they fancied concern them and they commenced a parley with the local constable who came hurrying after them his duties consisted chiefly in the raising and peddling of fruit and he had been recommended for the post by popular acclaim as the most tolerant man in the settlement but he was it seemed not without a certain sense of responsibility  what dyou figure on doing with those clubs boys he said  seasoning them said somebody mines quite soft and green now whyre you not taking the trail after slocum the province allows you for a horse and hake guffys has three good legs on him anyway  the constable waved his hand deprecatingly he fell down and hurt one of them hauling green stuff to the depôt i guess id have to shove him most of the way  there was a little laughter which had however a trace of grimness in it and one of the men grasped the constables shoulder  hadnt you better go round and run jean frenchys hogs out of your citron patch he said  for a moment the constable appeared about to go and then his face expanded into a genial grin  thats not good enough boys he said im not quite so fresh that the cows would eat me whatve you come round here for anyway  the man who had spoken made a little gesture of resignation well he said if you have got to know we are going in to see if slocum has left any of the dollars he beat us out of behind him  no said the constable stoutly nobodys going in there without a warrant unless its me  there was a little murmur the man was elderly and a trifle infirm which was partly why it had been decided that he was most likely to find a use for the provincial pay but he turned upon the threshold and faced the crowd resolutely had he been younger it is very probable that he would have been hustled away but a western mob is usually to some extent at least chivalrous and there was another murmur of protest  go home said one man theyre not your dollars anyway  boys and the old man swung an arm aloft im here and im going to make considerable trouble for the man who lays a hand on me this is a lawabiding country and slocum wasnt fool enough to leave anything he could carry off  we dont want to hurt you said one of the assembly but were going in  there was a growl of approbation and the men were closing in upon the door when a stranger pushed his way through the midst of them and then swung round and stood facing them beside the constable he held himself commandingly and though nobody appeared to recognize him for darkness was closing down the meaning of his attitude was plain and the crowd gave back a little  go home boys he said ill most certainly have the law of any man who puts his foot inside this door  there was a little ironical laughter and the crowd once more closed in half the men of the settlement were present there and a good many of them had bought land from or trusted their spare dollars to slocum  who are you anyway said one  the stranger laughed the man who owns the building my names devine  it was a bold announcement for those who heard him were not in the best of humors then or disposed to concern themselves with the question how far the principal was acquainted with or responsible for the doings of his agent  the boss thief said somebody get hold of him and bring him along to the hotel then if thorkell cant lock him up well consider what well do with him  no said another man hell keep for a little without going bad and were here to see if slocum left anything behind him break that door in  it was a critical moment for there was a hoarse murmur of approbation and the crowd surged closer about the pair at any sign of weakness it would perhaps have gone hardly with them but the elderly constable stood very still and quiet with empty hands while devine fumbled inside his jacket then he swung one foot forward and his right arm rose until his hand which was clenched on a dusky object was level with his shoulder  boys he said drily somebodys going to get hurt in another minute this is my office and i cant do with any of you inside it tonight  then if you hand our dollars out it would suit us most as well said the spokesman  devine appeared to laugh softly i guess there are very few of them there anybody who can prove a claim on me will get satisfaction but hell have to wait neither the place nor i will run away and youll find me right here when you come along tomorrow  are you going to give every man back the dollars slocum got from him  it was evident that the question met with the approbation of the crowd and a less resolute man might have temporized but devine laughed openly now  no he said drily thats just what im not going to do a man takes his chances when he makes a deal in land and cant expect to cry off his bargain when they go against him still if any one will bring me proof that slocum swindled him ill see what i can do but i guess it will be very little if some of you destroy the books and papers he recorded the deals in youll have to wait until tomorrow while i worry through them  his resolution had its due effect and the fact that no man could reach the threshold until he and the constable had been pulled down counted for a good deal too the men also wanted no more than they considered themselves entitled to and shrank from what if it was to prove successful must evidently be a murderous assault upon two elderly men  i guess theres sense in that said one of them its going to be quite easy to make sure he dont get out of the settlement  im for letting him have until tomorrow anyway said another still the papers arent there wheres john collier he picked up some books and truck slocum slung away when he met him on the trail  ive got them right here and another man stepped forward i was coming in from the ranch when i heard two horses pounding down the trail and jumped clear into the fern the man who went past me tried to sling a package into the gully but i guess he got kind of rattled when i shouted and dropped the thing he didnt seem to want to stop and when he went on at a gallop i groped round and picked the package up  devine lowered the pistol and turned quietly to the crowd there are just two courses open to you boys and youre going to make mighty little but trouble for yourselves by taking one of them this is my office and so long as i can hold you off nobodys coming in until hes asked i feel quite equal to stopping two or three now if youll let me have those books and go home quietly ill have straightened slocums affairs out by tomorrow and be ready to see what can be done for you  the men were evidently wavering and there was a brief consultation after which the leader turned to devine  weve no use for making any trouble that can be helped and well go home he said you can have those books and a committee will come round to see what youve fixed up after breakfast tomorrow  devine nodded tranquilly i guess youre wise he said good night boys  they went away and left him to go in with the constable who came out in a few minutes with a contented grin which suggested that devine had signified his appreciation of his efforts liberally the latter however sat down dusty and worn with an arduous journey to undertake a nights hard work he had left the canopus before sunrise and spent most of the day in the saddle but nobody would have suspected him of weariness as he sat grim and intent of face before a table littered with papers he had just imposed his will upon an angry crowd and the tension of the past few minutes would have shaken many a younger man but he showed no sign of feeling it and as the hours slipped by only rose at intervals to stretch his aching limbs and brush the cigar ash from his dustsmeared clothes this was one of the hard men who in building up their own fortunes had also laid the foundations of the future prosperity of a great province and a little fatigue did not count with him  the settlement was very still and the lamplight paling as the chilly dawn crept in when at last he opened a book that recorded slocums dealings several years back there were several folded slips on which he had jotted down certain data inside it and devine smiled somewhat drily as he came upon one entry  24th 6000 dollars from harford brooke in purchase of 400 acres bush land quatomac valley ref 22 slip b  devine turned up 22 b and read mem about 150 acres 200foot pines with gravel subsoil and very little mould on top of it rest of it rock oregon man bid 1000 dollars on the 2nd but asked for resurvey and cried off 12th gave custer four days option at 950 20th asked the british sucker 6500 and clinched the deal at 6000  devine closed the book and sat thoughtfully still for a minute or two the epithet his agent had applied to brooke carried with it the stigma of puerile folly in that country and devine had usually very little sympathy with the men it could be fittingly attached to still he felt that nobody could very appropriately term his contractor a sucker now and he had just discovered that he had been systematically plundered himself several points which had given him food for reflection also became suddenly plain and he lighted another cigar before he fell to work again he had however in the meanwhile decided what course to adopt with brooke when he went back to the canopus mine     xx  the bridging of the caÑon   it was a week or two after he undertook the investigation of slocums affairs and once more the light was failing when devine stood at the head of the gully above the cañon his wife and barbara were with him and they were about to descend when a cluster of moving figures appeared among the pines on the opposite hillside so far as devine could make out they were rolling down two or three small trunks of firs  the river was veiled in white mist now but the sound of its turmoil came up hoarsely out of the growing obscurity and there was sufficient light above to show the rope which spanned the awful chasm it swept downwards in a flattened curve slender and ethereal at that distance as a film of gossamer and lost itself in the gloom of the rocks across the cañon barbara however fancied she realized what it had cost the flumebuilder to place it there and as he glanced at it a somewhat curious look crept into devines eyes he knew that slender thread of steel had only been flung across the hollow at the risk of life and limb and under a heavy nervous strain  if we are going down hadnt we better start said mrs devine if it gets quite dark before we come up i shall certainly have to stay there until tomorrow in fact im quite willing to let you and barbara go without me now  devine smiled im not sure well go at all it seems to me brooke means to give the thing a private trial before he asks me to come over and see it work and thats why he waited until it was almost dark can you make him out barbara  barbara had as a matter of fact already done so but she realized that her sisters eyes were upon her and for no very apparent reason preferred not to admit it  it is getting a little shadowy among the pines and katty used to tell me she had sharper eyes than mine she said  mrs devine laughed still she said reflectively i scarcely think i have seen mr brooke quite so often as you have  devine glanced at them both a trifle sharply but there was nothing in their faces that gave him a clue to their thoughts well he said im a good deal older than either of you but i can make him out myself now as usual he seems to be doing most of the work  nobody said anything further and the moving figures stopped where the rope ran into the shadows of the rocks while it was a few minutes later when a long dusky object swung out on it it slid somewhat slowly down the incline and then stopped where the slight curve led upward and remained dangling high above the hidden river a shout came faintly through the roar of water in the gulf below and the dark mass oscillated violently but otherwise remained immovable  what are they doing shouldnt it have run all the way across asked mrs devine  devine nodded i guess theyre most pulling their arms off trying to haul the thing across he said it should have come itself but the sheave the trolley runs on must have jammed or they havent pulled all the kinks and snarls out of the rope its quite a big log theyve loaded her with  the suspended trunk still oscillated and a faint clinking came up with a hoarse murmur of voices from the hollow then there was silence and devine who pointed to a fallen cedar took out his cigarcase  well stay right here and see the thing out he said i guess the boys have quite enough to worry them just now  barbara surmised that most of the anxiety would fall on brooke and wondered why she should feel as eager as she did to see the fir trunk safely swung across the economical handling of mining props was naturally not a subject she had any particular interest in though she realized that the success of his venture was of some importance to the man who had stretched the rope across the cañon there was no ostensible reason why it should affect her and yet she was sensible of a curious nervous impatience  in the meanwhile it was growing darker and she could not quite see what the dim figures across the river were doing they did not in fact appear to be doing anything in particular beyond standing in a group while the rope no longer oscillated a thin white mist commenced to drift out of the hollow in filmy wisps and in a curious fashion suggested the vast depth of it the silence the roar of the river broke through grew more intense as the chill of the distant snow descended and the stately pines seemed to grow older and greater of girth they dwarfed the tiny clustering figures into insignificance and as iron columns and the raw gashes in the side of the gully faded into the gathering night it seemed to barbara that here in her primeval fastnesses nature ignored mans puny handiwork  then it was with a little thrill of anticipation she saw there was a movement among the dusky figures at last but it cost her an effort to sit still when one of them appeared to move out on the rope for she felt she knew who it must be devine rose sharply and flung his cigar away while his wife seemed to shiver apprehensively  one of them is coming across isnt it horribly dangerous she said  devine nodded it depends a good deal on what he means to do but if he figures on clearing the jammed trolley there is a risk especially to a man who has only one sound hand he said theyve slung him under the spare one its most probably brooke  mrs devine glanced at barbara and fancied that the rigidity of her attitude was a trifle significant the girl however said nothing for her lips were pressed together and she felt a shiver run through her as she watched the dusky figure sliding down the curving rope the rope itself was no longer visible but the dangling shape that moved across the horrible gulf was forced up by the whiteness of the drifting mists below she held her breath when it stopped and swung perilously beside the pine trunk which oscillated too and then clenched her fingers viciously as it rose and apparently clutched at something overhead then she became sensible of the distressful beating of her heart and that the tension was growing unendurable dark pines and hillside seemed to have faded now and the dim objects outlined against the sliding mists dominated her attention still though they were invisible to her the space between the hoary pines tremendous rock wall and nevermelting snow formed a fitting arena for that conflict between daring humanity and unsubdued nature  barbara never knew how long she sat there with set lips and straining eyes but the time seemed interminable until at last she gasped when devine who had been standing as motionless as the pines behind him moved abruptly  i guess he has done it he said that man has hard sand in him  the dusky trunk slid onward the dangling figure followed it and a hoarse cry that had a note of exultation in it as well as relief came up when they vanished into the gloom beneath the dark rocks side  theyve got him but i guess thats not all they mean said devine whatever was wrong with it he has fixed the thing theyve beaten the cañon the slings working  then barbara rising stood very straight with a curious feeling that she had a personal part in those mens triumph it did not even seem to matter when she felt that mrs devine was looking at her  why dont you shout said the latter significantly  barbara laughed but there was a little vibration in her voice her sister had not often noticed there  if i thought any one could hear me i certainly would she said  they stayed where they were a few minutes until once more a faint creaking and rattling came out of the mist and an object that was scarcely distinguishable swung across the chasm another followed until barbara had counted three of them and devine laughed drily as they turned away  its most of eight miles round by the cañon foot where one can get across by the big redwood log but i guess theyd have taken the trail if brooke hadnt given them a lead he said its not easy to understand any one but thats a curious kind of man  is mr brooke more peculiar than the rest of you asked barbara  devine seemed to smile though she could not see him very well  well he said drily thats rather more than i know but i have a notion that his difficulty is he isnt quite sure what he would be at now the man who does one thing at one time and all with the same purpose is the one who generally gets there first  and brooke does not do that  it kind of seems to me he is being pulled hard two ways at once just now said devine with a curious little laugh  barbara asked no more questions and said very little to her sister as they walked home through the pines she could not blot out the picture which for a few intense minutes she had gazed upon though it had been exasperatingly blurred and she felt considering what it stood for ineffective in itselfa dim halfseen figure dwarfed to insignificance swinging across a background of filmy mist there had been nothing at that distance to suggest the intensity of the effort which was the expression of an unyielding will but she had by some subtle sympathy grasped it allthe daring that recognized the peril and disregarded it and the thrill of the triumph the wholesome satisfaction born of the struggle with the primitive forces of the universe which man was meant to wage this it seemed to her was a nobler one than the strife of the cities where wealth was less often created than torn or fleeced from ones fellows for needy humanity flowed in to build her homes and prosper by sturdy toil at every fresh rolling back of the gates of the wilderness the miner and the axeman led the way but the big plough oxen and plodding packhorse train followed hard along the trails they made behind in long procession jaded with many sorrows came the outcasts from crowded eastern lands but there was room and to spare for all of them in the new canaan  that the man who had bridged the cañon would admit any feelings of the kind was she knew not to be expected men of his description she had discovered very seldom do and she could rather fancy him coming fresh from such a struggle to discuss the climate or the flavor of a cigar yet he had once told her that she had brought him a sword and as she had certainly shivered at his peril she could without asking herself troublesome questions now participate in the victory he had won still she seemed to feel that one could not draw any very apt comparison between him and the stainless hero of the arthurian legend belted with excalibur for brooke was she fancied in the phraseology of the country not that kind of man that however appeared of less importance since she had discovered that perfection is apt to pall on one  she had she decided permitted this train of thought to carry her sufficiently far when a man appeared suddenly in the shadowy trail it was evident that he did not see them at first and barbara fancied he was a trifle disconcerted and halfdisposed to slip back into the undergrowth when he did he however passed them hastily and devine swung round and looked after him  that wasnt one of brookes men he said  no said barbara i dont think it was you didnt recognize him katty  mrs devine laughed if you didnt i scarcely fancy there was anything to be gained by asking me  barbara was not quite pleased with her sister but she noticed that devine was standing still  was there anything remarkable about the man she said  devine laughed i didnt see his face but if hes the man i took him for nobody would have expected to meet him here  then he turned and they proceeded towards the ranch while barbara who recollected devines speech at the cañon also remembered her sister had said she would like to know what her husband really thought of brooke this had not been very comprehensible to barbara who had experienced no great trouble in forming what she believed to be an accurate opinion concerning the flumebuilder it was her feelings towards him that presented the difficulty  in the meanwhile brooke had flung himself down in a foldingchair in his tent he was soaked with perspiration his hard hands still quivered a little from the nervous strain and his bronzed face was a trifle more colorless than usual but he was for the time being sensible of a quiet exultation he had done a difficult and dangerous thing and the flush of success had swept away all his anxieties he however found it a trifle difficult to sit still and was carefully selecting a cigar in an attempt to compose himself when a man came in and took the chair opposite him then his face grew a trifle hard and all sense of satisfaction was suddenly reft away from him  i scarcely expected you quite so soon saxton he said here are cigars youll find some drinkables in the box yonder  saxton opened the box he pointed to and then looked at him with a grin as he took out a bottle  ive no great use for california wine bourbon whiskys good enough for me he said whove you been entertaining not devine anyway  isnt the question a little outside the mark if you want it theres water with ice in it here its from the tail of the glacier  saxton laughed then it would take a man most an hour and a half to bring a pail of it its quite easy to tell where you came from well im here but on the other occasions it was i who sent for you  there is however a difference on this one though i wouldnt like you to think that was the reason the fact is ive been busy  well said saxton well get down to the business one still howd you get your arm in a sling  are you sure you dont know  quite and saxtons sincerity was evident how should i  i had fancied you knew all about it by this time and felt a little astonished that you didnt come over but i see i was mistaken i tried to get hold of devines papers as i promised you and came upon another man attempting the same thing during the difference of opinion that followed he shot me  saxton rose and kicking his chair aside condemned himself several times as he moved up and down the tent  to be quite straight i put another man on to it as you didnt seem to be making much of a show he said still what in the name of thunder did he want to shoot you for when he knew you were standing in with me  i cant say the difficulty was that i was not as well informed as he seems to have been it would have paid you better to be frank with me hasnt the man come back to you  no and saxtons face grew a trifle vicious he hasntconcern him you see what that brings us to i felt sure of that man but its plain he meant to find out what i wanted and then if he couldnt make use of it himself sell it me there are three of us after the same thing now  brooke shook his head no he said drily i dont think there are you and the other man make two while i scarcely fancy either of you will get hold of the papers because i gave them back to devine and he has sent them to vancouver  you had them and saxton gasped  i certainly had said brooke they were put up in a very flimsy packet which mrs devine handed me i did not however look at one of them  saxton who seemed about to sit down crossed the tent and stared at him  well he said may i be shot if i ever struck another man quite like you what in the name of thunder made you let devine have them back for  i really dont think you would appreciate my motives especially as im not quite sure i understand them myself anyway i did it and that of course implies that there can be no further understanding between you and me i dont mean to question the morality of what we purposed doing but to be quite frank ive had enough of it  saxton who appeared to restrain himself with an effort sat down and lighted a cigar  no doubt i could worry along most as well without you but theres a question to be answered he said drily do you mean to give me away  its not one i appreciate and it seems to me a trifle unnecessary you can reassure yourself on that point  saxton took a drink of whisky well he said meditatively i guess i can trust you and im not going to worry about letting you off the deal you have too many fancies to be of much use to anybody theres just another thing and it has to be said its business i have on hand and lifes too short for any man to waste time he could pile up dollars in trying to get even with a partner who has gone back on him in fact ive a kind of liking for youbut youll most certainly get hurt if you put yourself in my way its a friendly warning  brooke laughed i will endeavor to keep out of it so far as i can  saxton nodded and then looked at him reflectively  miss heathcotes kind of pretty he said  i suggested once already that we should get on better if you left miss heathcote out  you did still when ive anything to say it is scarcely a hint of that kind thats going to stop me i guess you know she has quite a pile of dollars  brookes face flushed i dont and it does not concern me in the least  she has anyway devines wife brought him a pile and i heard one sister had the same as the other now you ought to feel obliged to me  brooke straightened himself a trifle in his chair i dont wish to be unpleasant but you have gone quite as far as is advisable cant you see the thing you are suggesting is quite out of the question  saxton surveyed him critically well he said reflectively i have seen betterlooking menquite a few of them and youre blame hard to get on with but there are women who dont expect too much  brookes face was growing flushed but he realized that nothing short of physical violence was likely to restrain his visitor and he laughed  you will of course believe what pleases you he said are you going to stay here tonight  no said saxton when im through with this whisky im going right back to tomlinsons ranch i wouldnt like devine to run up against me and he nearly did it on the trail a little while ago  brooke looked up sharply he recognized you  no said saxton drily he didnt it wouldnt have suited me when i come to clinch with devine i want to be sure i have the whiphand of him still it wouldnt have been a case of pistols out and getting behind a tree its quite a long while since i had any and though you dont seem to think so in england nobody has any use for a circus of that kind now i dont know that the way they had in 49 wasnt better than trying to get ahead of the other man quietly  brooke made a little gesture of resignation saxton he realized had sufficient discretion not to persist in a useless attempt to hold him to his compact but he was addicted to moralizing and brooke who lighted another cigar listened as patiently as he could while he discoursed upon the anxieties of the enterprising business man     xxi  devines offer   evening had come round again when brooke called at the ranch in response to a brief note from devine and found the latter sitting cigar in hand at his office table  take a cigar if you feel like it mr brooke we have got to have a talk he said  brooke did as he suggested and when he sat down devine passed a strip of paper across to him  theres your cheque for the tramway ill ask you for a receipt he said make up an account of what the dam has cost you tomorrow and well try to arrange the thing sos to suit both of us  brooke appeared a trifle astonished it is by no means finished sir  well said devine drily im not quite sure it ever will be the mine no longer belongs to me its part of the dayspring consolidated mineral properties ive been working the thing up quietly for quite a while now and ive a cable from london that the deals put through  brooke remembering what he had heard from saxton looked hard at him you have sold it out to english company promoters  not exactly im taking so many thousand dollars down and a controlling share of the stock im also the boss director with full power to run operations as appears advisable at the mines how does the deal strike you  since you ask for my opinion i fancy i should have preferred a good many dollars and very little stock  devine glanced at him with a curious smile  you believe allonbys a crank  other people do on my part im not quite sure of it still it seems to me that the men who spend their money to prove him right will run a tolerably heavy risk especially as so far at least there appears to be no ore thats worth reduction in the mine so far as it has been opened up  how do you know what is in the dayspring and devine looked at him steadily  brooke made a little gesture i dont think that points important he said you no doubt had a purpose in telling me as much as you have done  devine did not answer for a moment or two and brooke was sensible of a slight bewilderment as he watched him this was he knew a hard shrewd man and yet he had apparently permitted saxton to beguile him into buying a mine in which nobody but a man whose faculties had been destroyed by alcohol believed he was also it seemed willing to risk a moderate competence in another one which was liable to be jumped at any moment the thing was almost incomprehensible  then devine made a sign that he desired attention when i told you this i had a purpose he said we are going to spend a pile of dollars on the dayspring and my part of the business lies in the city wilkins stays right at the canopus and while allonby goes along with the mine its too big a contract to reform him that brings me to the point i want a man to take charge at the dayspring under him and though you were not exactly civil when i made you an offer once before we might make it worth your while  brooke gasped and felt his face becoming warm  i have very little practical experience of mining sir he said  devine nodded tranquilly allonby has enough for two but he lets up and loses his grip when the whisky comes along he said still i guess you have got something thats worth rather more to me you couldnt help having it it was born in you  brooke sat silent for a space with an unpleasant realization of the fact that devines keen eyes were watching him he had come there with the intention of severing his connection with the man and now that astonishing offer had been made him in the very room he had not long ago crept into with the purpose of plundering him every detail of what had happened on that eventful night came back to him and he remembered with a sickening sense of degradation how he had leaned upon the table where devine was sitting then and permitted the startled girl to force her thanks on him then he raised his head as devine turning a little looked at him with disconcerting steadiness  you have more reasons than the one you gave me for not taking hold he said  suddenly brooke made up his mind he was sick of the career of deception and had already meant to put an end to it while he now seized upon the opportunity of placing a continuance in it out of the question  i have and cant help fancying that one of them is a tolerably good one he said you see you really know very little about me  go on said devine drily im generally quite willing to back my opinion of a mine or man besides i have picked up one or two pointers about you  still said brooke very slowly while his face grew set you dont know why i came here to build that flume for you  then he gasped with astonishment for devine laughed  well he said drily i guess i do  brooke who lost command of himself rose abruptly and stood looking down on him with one quivering hand clenched on the edge of the table  you know i meant to jump the claim he said  i had a notion that you meant to try  then there was a curious silence and the two men remained motionless looking at one another for a space the younger one leaning somewhat heavily upon the table with the crimson showing through the bronze in his face the elder one watching him with a little grim smile there was also a suggestion of sardonic amusement in it at which the other winced as he would scarcely have done had devine struck him  and you let me stay on he said at length  i did it was plain you couldnt hurt me and there was a kind of humor in the thing i had just to put my hand down and squelch you when i felt like it  brooke recognized that he had deserved this but he had never felt the same utter sense of insignificance that he did just then his companion evidently did not even consider it worth while to be angry with him and he wondered vacantly at his folly in even fancying that he or saxton could prove a match for such a man  then devine made a little gesture hadnt you better sit down were not quite through yet  brooke did as he suggested  still he said  devine smiled again you dont quite understand well ill try to make it plain you make about the poorest kind of claimjumper i ever ran up against and ive handled quite a few in my time its not your fault you havent it in you if you had youd have stayed right with it and not let the dambuilding get hold of you so that you scarcely remembered what you came here for you couldnt help that either  to be turned inside out in this fashion was almost too disconcerting to be exasperating and brooke sat stupidly silent for a moment or two  after all we need not go into that he said i suppose what i meant to do requires no defence in this country but while i am by no means proud of it i should never have undertaken it had you not sold me a worthless ranch i purposed doing nothing more than getting my six thousand dollars back  you figure that would have contented the man behind you  brooke was once more startled for devines penetration appeared almost uncanny but he remembered that he at least owed a little to his confederate  you think there was another man he said  devine laughed i guess im sure you dont know enough to fix up a thing of this kind who is he  that said brooke drily is rather more than i feel at liberty to tell you i have however broken with him once for all  devine made a little gesture which implied that the point was of no great importance well he said i guess ive no great cause to be afraid of him if he was content to have you for a partner the question isare you going to take my offer  you are asking me seriously  i am it seems to me i sized you up correctly quite a while ago and you have had about enough claimjumping now i dont know that i blame you and anyway if you had very little sense it showed you had some grit as the mining laws stand its a legitimate occupation and you tell me you only figured on getting your dollars back well if you want them you can work for them at a reasonable salary  brooke was once more astonished sentiment it appeared counted for as little with devine as it had done with saxton and with both of them business was simply and solely a question of dollars  then you disclaim all responsibility for your agents doings he said  no said devine drily if slocum had swindled you it would have been different but you made a foolish deal and you have got to stand up to it nobody was going to stop you surveying that land before you bought it or getting a man who knew its value to do it for you im offering you the option of working for those six thousand dollars do you take it  brooke scarcely considered the money was no longer the chief inducement for as devine had expressed it the work had got hold of him and he was sensible of a growing belief in his capabilities while he now fancied he saw his opportunity  yes he said simply  devine nodded then well go into the thing right now he said youll start for the dayspring soon as you can tomorrow  an hour had passed before they had arranged everything and it seemed to one of them that it was under the circumstances a somewhat astonishing compact they made what the other thought about it did not appear but he was one who was seldom very much mistaken in his estimate of the character of his fellowmen then as it happened brooke came upon barbara in the logwalled hall as he was leaving the ranch and stood still a moment irresolute whether devine would tell her or his wife what had passed between them he did not know but it appeared very probable and just then he almost shrank from meeting her it did not however occur to him to ask himself how she happened to be there  so you are not going out on the trail that leads to nowhere in particular after all she said  brooke showed his astonishment you knew what devine meant to offer me  of course and barbara smiled i dont even mind admitting that i think he did wisely  now i wonder why  barbara laughed softly dont you think the question is a little difficult or do you expect me to present you with a catalogue of your virtues  im afraid the latter is out of the question you would want at least several items  and you imply that i should have a difficulty in finding them  brooke had spoken lightly partly because the interview with devine had put a strain on him and he dare scarcely trust himself just then but a tide of feeling swept him away and his face grew suddenly grim the girl was very alluring and her little smile showed plainly that she had reposed her confidence in him  yes he said a trifle hoarsely you would have the greatest difficulty in finding one and i am almost glad that i am going away tomorrow such a man as i am is scarcely fit to speak to you  barbara was though she did not show it distinctly startled she had never heard the man speak in that fashion and his set face and vibrant voice were new to her indeed she had now and then wondered whether he ever really let himself go still she looked at him quietly and noticing the swollen veins on his forehead and the glow in his eyes decided it would not be advisable to admit that she attached much importance to what he had said he was she fancied fit for any rashness just then  i suppose we all of us have moods of selfdepreciation occasionally she said still one would not have fancied that you were unduly morbid and one part of that little speech was a trifle inexplicable  brooke laughed curiously but the girl noticed that one of his lean hard hands was closed as he looked down on her  there are times when one has to be ones self and civilities dont seem to count he said i am glad that i am going away because if i stayed here i should lose the last shred of my selfrespect as a matter of fact i have very little left but that little is valuable if only because it was you who gave it me  still one would signally fail to see how you could lose it here  brooke stood still looking at her with signs of struggle and she could almost fancy passion in his set face and then made a little gesture which seemed to imply that he had borne enough  you will probably understand it all by and by he said i can only ask you not to think too hardly of me when that happens  then as one making a strenuous effort he turned abruptly away and barbara who let him go went back to the room where her sister sat very thoughtfully  brooke in the meanwhile swung savagely along the trail beneath the shadowy pines for he recognized with a painful distinctness that barbara heathcotes view of his conduct was by no means likely to coincide with devines and he could picture her disgust and anger when the revelation came while it was only now when he would in all probability never meet her on the same terms again he realized the intensity of his longing for the girl he had also he felt succeeded in making himself ridiculous by a display of sentimentality that must have been incomprehensible to her and though that appeared of no great importance relatively it naturally did not tend to console him when he reached his tent jimmy stared at him  i guess you look kind of raised he said wheres your hat  brooke laughed hoarsely i believe i must have left it at the ranch still thats not so very astonishing because even if i didnt do it altogether i came very near losing my head  jimmy again surveyed him with a grin devine he said suggestively has been giving you whisky and it mixed you up a little thats what comes of drinking tea  brooke made no answer though a swift flush rose to his face as he remembered his halfcoherent speeches at the ranch and the astonishment in the girls eyes for it seemed probable that the explanation that had occurred to jimmy had also suggested itself to her then he smiled grimly as he decided that it did not greatly matter after all since she could not think more hardly of him than she would do when the truth came out presently     xxii  the unexpected happens   it was already late at night but the mounted mail carrier had not reached the dayspring mine and allonby who was impatiently waiting news of certain supplies and plant had insisted on brooke sitting up with him it was also raining hard and in spite of the glowing stove the shanty reeked with damp while there was a steady splashing upon the iron roof above now and then a trickle descended from a defective joint in it and formed a rivulet upon the earthen floor or fizzled into a puff of steam upon the corroded iron pipe which stretched across the room the latter was strewn with soilstained clothing and wet kneeboots with the red mire of the mine still clinging about them  brooke lay drowsily in a canvas chair while allonby sat at the uncleanly table with a litter of burnt matches and tobacco ash as well as a steaming glass in front of him his eyes were bleared and watery and there were curious little patches of color in his haggard face while the gorged blue veins showed upon his forehead he had been discoursing in a maudlin fashion which brooke who had endeavored to make the best of his company during the last three months found singularly exasperating but he moved abruptly when a stream from the roof suddenly descended upon his grizzled head  that he said is one of the trifles a man with a sense of proportion and a contemplative temperament makes light of the curse of this effete age is its ceaseless striving after luxury  brooke laughed softly as he watched the water run down the moralizers nose it is he said at least not often attainable in this country  which is precisely why men grow rich in the colonies now here are you and i who at one time in our lives required four or five courses for dinner not only subsisting but thriving upon grindstone bread flapjacks molasses and the contents of certain cans from chicago which one cannot even be certain are what they are averred to be though the colonist consumes them with the faith that asks no questions  i fancy you are in one respect taking a good deal for granted brooke said drily  allonby made a deprecatory gesture being although you might occasionally find a difficulty in crediting it one myself i am seldom mistaken about the points of a man who has moved in good society though i may admit that it was the ruin of me had i been brought up in this country onethird of my income would have sufficed me and i should have made provision for my grey hairs with the rest while i fed like a canadian out of vessels of enamel and the useful wood pulp as it was i wasted my substance and unfortunately that of other men who had undue confidence in me in london clubs with the result that i am now what is sometimes termed a waster in the land of promise  it is not very difficult to get through a good deal of ones substance in a certain fashion even in canada and brooke glanced reflectively at the array of empty bottles  that point of view although a popular one is illusory which can be demonstrated by mathematics a man it is evident cannot drink more than a certain quantity of whisky his physical capacity precludes it while even in my bad weeks the cost of it could not well exceed some eight dollars excluding that item one could live contentedly here at an outlay of one dollar daily if he did not unfortunately possess a memory  it seemed to brooke that this latter observation might be true if one had at least any hope for the future allonbys day was nearly done and he had only the past to return and trouble him but brooke felt just then that in spite of his pride in the profession which had been rather forced upon him than adopted he had very little to look forward to since he had by his own folly made the one thing he longed for above all others unattainable he had been three months at the dayspring and had heard nothing from barbara she must he fancied have discovered the part he had played by this time and would blot him out of her memory while now when it seemed conceivable that he might make his mark in canada all that this implied had become valueless to him wealth and celebrity might perhaps be attainable but there would be nobody to share them with for he realized that barbara heathcote did not possess the easy toleration on certain points which appeared to characterize saxton and devine in the meanwhile allonby did not seem pleased with his silence  you are he said a trifle quickly by no means an entertaining companion for a man who is at times too sensible of the irony of his position and appear to be without either comprehension or sympathy here am i who was accustomed to fare sumptuously in london clubs living on the husks and other metaphorical et ceteras and endeavoringfor that is all it amounts toto console myself with profitless reflections i am of course in the elegant simile of the country a tank or whiskyskin but i am still a man who found a fortune and stripped himself of everything but whisky to develop it  brooke laughed to conceal his impatience then you are as sure as ever about the silver we have got a good way down without finding very much sign of it  allonby rose with a little flush in his watery eyes and leaned somewhat unsteadily upon the table  it is the one thing i believe in the rest and i once had my fancies and theories like other men are shadows and chimeras now only the silver is realand there all i made in canada is sunk in this mine which no longer belongs to me and when i make the great discovery not a dollar will fall to my share  then it is a little difficult to understand what you are so anxious to find the silver for  allonby swayed a trifle on his feet but the gleam in his eyes grew brighter you he said are as i pointed out curiously deficient in comprehension but you never won a case of medals that were coveted by the keenest brains among all those who hoped to enter your profession of what use are dollars to a whiskytank who will in all probability be found mangled at the bottom of the shaft one day still when i made the calculations we are now working on there was no man in the province with a knowledge equal to mine and i ask no more than to prove them right  brooke sat silent because he could think of nothing appropriate to say he had asked the question lightly and had got his answer it made the attitude of this brokendown wreck of humanity plain to him and he vaguely realized the pathos underlying it possessed by the one fancy the man had lost or flung away all that life might have offered him while he clung to the apparently worthless mine not it seemed for the dollars that success might bring him but from pride in his professional skill and the faculties which had long deserted him that as he said was his one point of faith and he lived only to vindicate it  then allonby lurched unsteadily to the door and held his hand up as he opened it  listen he said is that the mail carrier i must know when well get those drills and the giant powder before i sleep the sinking goes on slowly and life is very uncertain when one drinks whisky as i do  brooke listened and for a time heard only the splash from the pine boughs and the patter of the rain while allonbys frail figure cut against the white mists that slid past the doorway then a faint measured thudding came up the valley and he remembered afterwards that he felt a curious sense of anticipation the sound swelled into the beat of horse hoofs floundering and slipping on the wet gravel and brooke smiled at his eagerness for though he had he fancied cut himself off from all that concerned his past in england he had never been quite able to await the approach of a mail carrier with complete indifference and he felt the suggestiveness of the drumming of the weary horses feet there had been a time when he had listened with beating heart while it drew nearer down the shadowy trail and once more a little thrill ran through him  then there was a clatter of hoofs on wet rock and a shout as a man pulled his jaded beast up in the darkness outside while a dripping packet was flung into the room brooke could see nobody but a voice said thats your lot i guess i cant stop got to make truscotts before i sleep and the beasts gone lame  the rattle of hoofs commenced again and brooke sat idly watching allonby who was tearing open the packet with shaky fingers  the tools and powder are coming up he said hallo excuse my inadvertence brooke this ones apparently for you  brooke caught the big blue envelope tossed across to him and when he had taken out several precisely folded papers and glanced at the sheet of stiff legal writing sat still staring vacantly straight in front of him the uncleanly shanty faded from before his eyes and he was not even conscious that allonby who had laid down his own correspondence was watching him until the latter broke the silence  i know that style of envelope but it is presumably too long since you left england for it to contain any unpleasant reference to a debt he said has somebody been leaving you a fortune  brooke smiled in a curious listless fashion no he said not a fortune still i suppose one could almost consider it a competence  then you appear singularly free from the satisfaction one would naturally expect from a man who had just received any news of that description said allonby drily  brookes face grew suddenly grim if it had come a little earlier it might have been of much more use to me  allonby had apparently sufficient sense left in him to recognize that any further observations he might feel inclined to make were scarcely likely to be appreciated just then and once more brooke sat motionless with the letter in his hand and the inclosures that had slipped from his fingers strewn about the floor he had been left with what any one with simple tastes would have considered a moderate competence at least in canada by the man he had quarrelled with and he gathered from the lawyers letter that if he wished it there would be no difficulty in at once realizing the property it naturally amounted to considerably more than the six thousand dollars he had sold his selfrespect for and at the moment he was only sensible of a bitter regret that the news had not come to hand a little earlier  if that had happened he would never have made the attempt upon the papers and might have broken with saxton without the necessity for any explanation with devine he had no doubt that the latter had acquainted his wife and barbara which meant that he would be branded for ever as rather worse than a thief in her eyes the money which would have saved him and might have bought him happiness was he felt almost useless to him now  in the meanwhile allonby had turned to his own correspondence and the shanty was very still save for the patter of the rain outside and the doleful wailing of the pines brooke gazed at the letter he held with vacant eyes but though he scarcely seemed to notice his surroundings he could long afterwards recall them clearlythe litter of soilstained garments and mining boots the crackling stove the rain that flashed through the stream of light outside the open door and allonbys haggard face and wasted figure  then it occurred to him that there was a discrepancy between the time when the will was made and that on which the news of it had been sent to him and as he stooped to pick up the papers from the floor he came upon a blackedged envelope he recognized the writing and hastily opening it found it was from an english kinsman  you will be sorry to hear that austin dangerfield has succumbed at last he read he was perhaps a little hard upon you at one time but clara and i felt that he was right in his objections to lucy all along and no doubt you realized it when she married shafton coulson however that may be the old man mentioned you frequently a little before the end and seemed to feel the fact that he had driven you away which was no doubt what induced him to leave you most of his personal property baron and rodway will have sent you a schedule and as one of the executors i would say that we had some difficulty in finding where to address you until we heard from coulson that lucy had met you there is one point i feel i should refer to as you will notice part of the estate is represented by stock in a canadian mine austin whose mental grip was getting a trifle slack latterly appears to have been led rather too much by shafton coulson in the stock operations he was fond of dabbling in and i fancy it was by the latters advice he made the purchase there is very little demand for the shares on the market here but you will perhaps be able to form an accurate opinion concerning their value  brooke laid down the letter and took up the lawyers schedule then he laughed curiously as he realized that a considerable proportion of his legacy was represented by shares in the dayspring consols one of the mines he knew was liable to be jumped at any moment and the other was worthless unless the opinion of his halfcrazy companion could be taken seriously there were one or two more small gashes in the hillside concerning which the miners he had questioned appeared distinctly dubious  allonby turned at the sound one would scarcely have fancied from that laugh that you were feeling very much more pleased than you were when you hadnt gone into the affair he said  then it was a tolerably accurate reflection of my state of mind said brooke this legacy which came along two or three months after the time when it would have been of vital importance to me consists in part of shares in this very mine that is naturally about the last thing i would have desired or expected and results from one of the curious conjunctions of circumstances which i suppose come about now and then when the thing one has longed for does come along it is generally at a time when the wish for it has gone  commiseration would be a little unnecessary said allonby with unusual quietness the competence you mention will certainly prove a fortune before you are very much older  i dont feel by any means as sure of it as you seem to be still under the circumstances it doesnt greatly matter  allonby with some difficulty straightened himself i am he said not without a certain dignity which almost astonished brooke a wornout wastrel and a whiskytank but ill live to show the men who look down on me with contemptuous pity what i was once capable of that is all i am holding on to life for it is naturally not a very pleasant one to a man with a memory  for a moment he stood almost erect and then collapsed suddenly into his chair devine has a brain of another and very much lower order though it is of a kind that is apt to prove more useful to its possessor and in his own sphere there are very few men to equal him if i do not fall down the shaft in the meanwhile we will certainly show this province what we can do together and now i believe it is advisable for me to go to bed while i feel to some extent capable of reaching it my head is at least as clear as usual but my legs are unruly     xxiii  brookes confession   the pacific express had just come in and the c p r wharf at vancouver was thronged with a hurrying crowd when barbara heathcote and her sister stood leaning upon the rails of the s s islander beneath them the big locomotive which had hauled the dusty cars over the wild selkirk passes was crawling slowly down the wharf with bell tolling dolefully and while a feathery steam roared aloft above the tiers of white deckhouses a stream of passengers flowed up the gangway barbara who was crossing to victoria watched them languidly until an elaboratelydressed woman ascended leaning upon the arm of a man whose fastidious neatness of attire and air of indifference to the confusion about him proclaimed him an englishman she made a very slight inclination when the woman smiled at her  it is fortunate she cant very well get at us here she said glancing at the pile of baggage which cut them off from the rest of the deck three or four hours of mrs coulsons conversation would be a good deal more than i could appreciate  you need scarcely be afraid of it in the meanwhile said mrs devine it is a trifle difficult to hear ones self speak  for which her husband is no doubt thankful until i met them once or twice i wondered why that man wore an habitually tired expression of course there are englishmen who consider it becoming but one feels that in his case his looks are quite in keeping with his sensations  mrs devine laughed you dont like the woman  no said barbara reflectively i really dont know why i shouldnt but i dont she certainly poses too much and the last time i had the pleasure of listening to her at the wheelers house she patronized me and the country too graciously the country can get along without her commendation  i wonder if she asked you anything about brooke  no said barbara a trifle sharply where could she have met him  in england she seemed to know he was at the dayspring and managed i fancy intentionally to leave me with the impression that they were especial friends in the old country i wonder if she knows he will be on board today  mr brooke is crossing with us said barbara with an indifference her sister had some doubts about  grant seemed to expect him he is going to buy american mining machinery or something of the kind in victoria i believe it was he grant left us to meet  barbara said nothing though she was sensible of a curious little thrill she had not seen brooke since the evening he had behaved in what was an apparently inexplicable fashion at the ranch and had heard very little about him she however watched the wharf intently until she saw devine accost a man with a bronzed face who was quietly threading his way through the hurrying groups and her heart beat a trifle faster than usual as they moved together towards the steamer then almost unconsciously she turned to see if the woman they had been discussing was also watching for him but she had by this time disappeared barbara for no very apparent reason felt a trifle pleased at this  in the meanwhile devine was talking rapidly to brooke  here is a letter for you that came in with yesterdays mail he said struck anything more encouraging at the mine since you wrote me  no said brooke im afraid we havent still allonby seems as sure as ever and is most anxious to get the new plant in  devine appeared thoughtful youll have to knock off the big boring machine anyway the mines just swallowing dollars and well have to go a trifle slower until some more come in english directors didnt seem quite pleased last mail somebody in their papers has been slating the dayspring properties and theres a good deal of stock they couldnt work off in fact they seemed inclined to kick at my last draft and well want two or three more thousand dollars before the month is up  brooke would have liked to ask several questions but between the clanging of the locomotive bell and the roar of steam conversation was difficult and when they stopped a moment at the foot of the gangway devines voice only reached him in broken snatches  got to keep your hand downspin every dollar out im writing straight about another draft use the wires the moment you strike anything that would give the stock a lift  if youre going i guess its bout time you got aboard said a seaman who stood ready to launch the gangway in and brooke making a sign of comprehension to devine went up with a run  then the ropes were cast off and he sat down to open his letter under the deckhouse as with a sonorous blast of her whistle the big white steamer swung out from the wharf it was from the english kinsman who had previously written him and confirmed what devine had said  im sorry you are holding so much of the canadian mining stock he read you are perhaps better posted about the mine than i am but though the shares were largely underwritten i understand the promoters found it difficult to place a proportion of the rest and my broker told me that several holders would be quite willing to get out at well under par already  it was not exactly good news from any point of view and brooke was pondering over it somewhat moodily when he heard a voice he recognized and looking up saw a woman with pale blue eyes smiling at him  lucy he said with evident astonishment but no great show of pleasure  you looked so occupied that i was really afraid to disturb you said the woman shafton is talking canadian politics with somebody and i wonder if you are too busy to find a chair for me  brooke got one and his companion who was the woman barbara had alluded to as mrs coulson sat down and said nothing for a while as she gazed back across the blue inlet with evident appreciation this was in one respect not astonishing though so far as brooke could remember she had never been remarkably fond of scenery for the new stone city that rose with its towering telegraph poles roof beyond roof up the hillside gleaming landlocked waterway and engirdling pines with the white blink of ethereal snow high above them all made a very fair picture that afternoon  this she said at last would really be a beautiful country if everything wasnt quite so crude  it is certainly not exactly adapted to landscapegardening said brooke a twothousand foot precipice and a hundredleague forest is a trifle big still im not sure its inhabitants would appreciate such praise  lucy coulson laughed they are like it in one respecti dont mean in sizeand delightfully touchy on the subject now there was a girl i met not long ago who appeared quite displeased with me when i said that with a little improving one might compare it to switzerland i told her i scarcely felt warranted in dragging paradise in if only because of some of its characteristic customs i think her name was devane or something equally unusual though it might have been her married sisters perhaps its canadian  she fancied a trace of indignation crept into the mans bronzed face but it vanished swiftly  one could scarcely call miss heathcote crude he said  lucy coulson did not inquire whether he was acquainted with the lady in question but made a mental note of the fact  it of course depends upon ones standard of comparison she said no doubt she comes up to the one adopted in this country still though the latter is certainly pretty what is keepingyouin it now  then you have heard of my good fortune  of course shafton and i were delighted your executors wrote for your address to me  brooke started visibly as he recognized that she must in that case have learned the news a month before he did for a good deal had happened in the meanwhile  then it is a little curious that you did not mention it in the note you sent inviting me to meet you at the glacier lake he said  lucy coulson lifted her eyes to his a moment and then glanced aside while there was a significant softness in her voice as she said the news seemed so good that i wanted to be the one who told it you  again brooke felt a disconcerting sense of embarrassment and because he had no wish that she should recognize this looked at her steadily  it apparently became of less importance when i did not come he said with a trace of dryness there is a reliable postal service in this country do you remember exactly what day you went to the lake on  mrs coulson laughed and made a little halfpetulant gesture i fancied you did not deserve to hear it when you could not contrive to come forty miles to see me still i think i can remember the day shafton had to be in vancouver on the wednesday  she told him in another moment and brooke was sensible of a sudden thrill of anger that was for the most part a futile protest against the fact that his destiny should lie at the mercy of a vain womans idle fancy for had he known on the day she mentioned he would never have made the attempt upon devines papers barbara heathcote he decided doubtless knew by this time what had brought him to the ranch on the eventful night and even if she did not the imposition he had been guilty of then remained as a barrier between him and her after permitting her to give him credit for courage and a desire to watch over her safety he dare not tell her he had come as a thief still he recognized that it was after all illogical to blame his companion for his own folly  harford she said gently are you very vexed with me  brooke smiled in a somewhat strained fashion no he said i scarcely think i am and i have at least no right to be i dont know whether you will consider it a sufficient excuse but i was very busy on the day in question i was you see under the unfortunate necessity of earning my living  i think there was a time when you would not have let that stand in the way but men are seldom very constant are they  brooke made no attempt to controvert the assertion it seemed distinctly wiser to ignore it since his companion apparently did not remember that she had now a husband who could hardly be expected to appreciate any unwavering devotion offered her which was a fact that had its importance in brookes eyes at least then she turned towards him with disconcerting suddenness  why dont you go home now you have enough to live with a little economy as you were meant to do she said this country is no place for you  brooke who did not remember that she previously endeavored to lead up to the question started for it was one which he had not infrequently asked himself of late and the answer that the opportunity of proving his capabilities as a dambuilder and mining engineer had its attractions was he knew not quite sufficient in itself then as it happened barbara heathcote and mrs devine who appeared in the companion came towards them along the deck and lucy coulson noticed the glow in his eyes that was followed by a sudden hardening of his face perhaps she guessed a little or it was done out of wantonness for she laid her whitegloved hand upon his arm and leaned forward a trifle  harford she said looking up at him once upon a time you gave me your whole confidence  brooke hoped his face was expressionless for he was most unpleasantly sensible of that almost caressing touch upon his arm as well as of the fact that his attitude or at least that of his companion was distinctly liable to misconception by any one aware that she was another mans wife he had no longer any tenderness for her and she had in any case married shafton coulson who so far as he had heard made her a very patient as well as considerate husband  that was several years ago he said  lucy coulson laughed and though it is probable that she had seen them approach turned with a little start that seemed unnecessarily apparent as barbara and mrs devine came up while brooke hoped his face did not suggest what he was thinking as a matter of fact it was distinctly flushed which barbara naturally noticed she would have passed but that mrs coulson stopped her with a gesture  so glad to see you she said cant you stay a little and talk to us one is out of the breeze under the deckhouse here harford there are two unoccupied chairs yonder  brooke wished she would not persist in addressing him as harford but he brought the chairs and mrs devine who had her own reasons for falling in with the suggestion sat down barbara had no resource but to take the place beside her and lucy coulson smiled at both of them  i believe mrs devine mentioned that you had met mr brooke she said to the girl he is of course a very old friend of mine  she contrived to give the words a significance which brooke winced at but he sat watching barbara covertly while the others talked or rather listened while lucy coulson did barbara scarcely glanced at him but he fancied that devine had not told her yet or she would not have joined a group which included him at all the position was not exactly a pleasant one but he could think of no excuse for going away and listened vacantly lucy coulson as it happened was discoursing upon canada which when she did not desire to please a canadian was a favorite topic of hers barbara however on this occasion only watched her with a little reposeful smile and so half an hour slipped by while with mastheads swinging lazily athwart the blue the whitepainted steamer rolled along past rocky islets shrouded in dusky pines across a shining sea above which white lines of snow gleamed ethereally  mrs coulson however had no eyes to spare for any of it for when they were not fixed upon the girl she was watching brooke  some of the men we met in the mountains were delightfully inconsequent she said at length there was one called saxton at a mine who spent a good deal of one afternoon telling us about the reforms that ought to be made in the administration of this province and which i fancy he intended to effect it was of course not a subject i was greatly interested in but the man was so much in earnest that one had to listen to him and shafton told me afterwards that he was where business was concerned evidently a great rascal shafton you know enjoys listening quietly and afterwards turning people inside out for inspection still perhaps it was a little unwise to single the man out individually there is always a risk of somebody who hears you being a friend of the person when you do that kind of thingand now i remember he mentioned mr brooke  brooke noticed that barbara cast a swift glance at him and wondered with sudden anger if lucy coulson had not already done him harm enough then barbara turned towards the latter  saxton she said quietly is an utterly unprincipled man i really do not think we have many like him in this country you probably mistook his reference to mr brooke  mrs coulson laughed of course i may have done though i almost think he said harford was a partner of his perhaps however he had a purpose in telling us that for he had been trying to sell shafton some land companys shares though if it hadnt been true he would scarcely have ventured to mention it  there was a sudden silence and brooke who felt barbaras eyes upon him heard the splash of water along the steamers plates and the throbbing of the screw he also saw that mrs devine was rather more intent than usual and that lucy coulson was wondering at the effect of what she had said he could he fancied acquit her of any ill intent but that was no great consolation for he could not controvert her assertion and he felt that now she had mentioned the condemning fact his one faint chance was to let barbara have the explanation from his own lips instead of asking it from devine still he could scarcely do so when the rest were there and lucy coulson at least showed no intention of leaving him and the girl alone it was in fact almost an hour later when her husband crossed the deck and she rose  shafton has nobody to talk to and one has to remember their duty now and then she said  then as the steamer swung round a nest of reefs that rose out of a white swirl of tide the sea breeze swept that side of the deckhouse and mrs devine departed for another wrap or shawl lifting her head barbara looked at the man steadily  was that womans story true she said  brooke made a little gesture which implied that he attempted no defence  it was he said  a faint spark crept into barbaras eyes and a tinge of color into her cheek you know what you are admitting  i am afraid i do  barbara heathcote had a temper and though she usually held it in check it swept her away just then  then though we only discovered it afterwards you knew that saxton was scheming against my brotherinlaw and bought up the timberrights to extort money from him  again brooke made a little gesture and the girl who seemed stirred as he had scarcely believed her capable of being straightened herself rigidly  and yet you crept into his house and permitted usit is very hard to say itto make friends with you had you no sense of fitness cant you even speak  brooke was too confused and the girl too furious for either of them to realize the significance of her anger since the fact that she had merely permitted him to meet her as an acquaintance at the ranch scarcely seemed to warrant that almost passionate outbreak  im afraid there is nothing i can plead in extenuation except that grant devines agent swindled me he said  barbara laughed scornfully and you felt that would warrant you playing the part you did was it a spys part only or were you to be a traitor too  then brooke who lost his head did what was at the moment at least a most unwise thing  i expect i deserve all you can say or think of me he said still i cant help a fancy that you are not quite free from responsibility  i said barbara incredulously  brooke nodded yes he said desperately you heard me correctly under the circumstances it isnt exactly complimentary or particularly easy to explain still you see you showed me that the content with my surroundings i was sinking into was dangerous when you came to the quatomac ranch and afterwards the more i saw of you the more i realized what the six thousand dollars i hoped to secure from devine would give me a chance of attaining  he broke off abruptly as though afraid to venture further and barbara watched him a moment breathless with anger with lips set there was nobody on that part of the deck just then and the steady pounding of the engines broke through what the man felt to be an especially disconcerting silence then she laughed in a fashion that stung him like a whip  and you fancied there were girls in this country with anything worth offering who would be content with such a man as you are she said one has however to bear with a good deal that is said about canada and perhaps you would have been able to keep the deception that gained the appreciation of one of them up you are proficient at that kind of thing  i am quite aware that the excuse is a very poor one  the girl felt that whether it was dignified or not the relief speech afforded was imperative  havent you even the wit to urge the one creditable thing you did  brooke contrived to meet her eyes you mean when i came into the ranch one night you dont know that was merely a part of the rest  the blood rushed to barbaras face the man was your confederate and you fell out over the bootyor perhaps you heard me coming and arranged the little scene for my benefit  no said brooke with a harsh laugh in that case the climax of it would have been unnecessarily realistic you may remember that he shot me still since you may as well know the worst of me it happened that we both came there with the same purpose which is somewhat naturally accounted for by the fact that your brotherinlaw was away that night  and you allowed me to sympathize with you for your injury and to fancy  barbara broke off abruptly for it appeared inadvisable under the circumstances to let him know what motive she had accredited him with  my brotherinlaw is naturally not aware of this she said  i at least considered it necessary to acquaint him with most of it before i went to the dayspring no doubt you will find it difficult to credit that but if it appears worth while you can of course confirm it you would evidently have been less tolerant than he has shown himself  barbara stood up and brooke became sensible of intense relief as he saw mrs devine was approaching with a bundle of wraps  i would sooner have sacrificed the mine than continue to have any dealings with you she said  then she turned away and left him sitting somewhat limply in his chair and staring vacantly at the sea he saw no more of her during the rest of the voyage but when two hours later the steamer reached victoria he went straight to the cable companys office and sent his kinsman in england a message which somewhat astonished him  buy dayspring on my account as far as funds will go it read     xxiv  allonby strikes silver   winter had closed in early with arctic severity and the pines were swathed in white and gleaming with the frost when brooke stood one morning beside the crackling stove in the shanty he and allonby occupied at the dayspring mine a very small piece of rancid pork was frizzling in the fryingpan and he was busy whipping up two handfuls of flour with water to make flapjacks of he could readily have consumed twice as much alone for it was twelve hours since his insufficient six oclock supper but he realized that it was advisable to curb his appetite supplies had run very low and the lonely passes over which the trail to civilization led were blocked with snow while it was a matter of uncertainty when the freighter and his packhorse train could force his way in  when the flour was ready he stirred the stove to a brisker glow and crossing the room flung open the outer door it was still an hour or two before sunrise and the big stars scintillated with an intensity of frosty radiance though the deep indigo of the cloudless vault was paling in color and the pines were growing into definite form here and there a sombre spire or ragged branch rose harshly from the rest but for the most part they were smeared with white and his eyes were dazzled by the endless vista of dimlygleaming snow towering peak and serrated rampart rose hard and sharp against a background of coldest blue there was no sound for the glaciers slushy feet that fed the streams had hardened into adamant and a deathlike silence pervaded the frozen wilderness  brooke felt the cold strike through him with the keenness of steel and was about to cross the space between the shanty and the mens log shelter when a dusky figure beating its arms across its chest came out of the latter  are the rest of the boys stirring yet he said  the man laughed and his voice rang with a curious distinctness through the nipping air  i guess weve had the stove lit most an hour ago he said theyve no use for being frozen and thats whats going to happen to some of us unless we can make truscotts before its dark say hadnt you better change your mind and come along with us  brooke made a little sign of negation though it would have pleased him to fall in with the suggestion work is seldom continued through the winter at the remoter mines and he had most unwillingly decided to pay off the men owing to the difficulty of transporting provisions and supplies there was however a faint probability of somebody attempting to jump the unoccupied claim and he had of late become infected by allonbys impatience while he felt that he could not sit idle in the cities until the thaw came round again still he was quite aware that he ran no slight risk by remaining  im not sure that it wouldnt be wiser but ive got to stay he said anyway allonby wouldnt come  the other man dropped his voice a little that dont count if youll stand in well take him along on the jumper sled the old tanks most played out and its only the whisky thats keeping the life in him hell go out on the long trail sudden when theres no more of it and its going to be quite a long while before the freighter gets a load over the big divide  brooke knew that this was very likely but he shook his head im half afraid it would kill him to leave the mine he said its the hope of striking silver thats holding him together as much as the whisky  well said the man who laughed softly ive been mining and prospecting most of twenty years and its my opinion that except the little youre getting on the upper level theres not a dollars worth of silver here now i guess harry will have breakfast ready  he moved away and when brooke went back into the shanty allonby came out of an inner room shivering his face showed grey in the lamplight and he looked unusually haggard and frail  its bitter cold and i seem to feel it more than i did last year he said we will however be beyond the necessity of putting up with any more unpleasantness of the kind long before another one is over i shall probably feel adrift thenit will be difficult in my case to pick up the thread of the old life again  if you stay here im not sure youll have an opportunity of doing it at all said brooke its a risk a stronger man than you are might shrink from  still i intend to take it we have gone into this before if i leave dayspring before i find the silver i leave it dead  brooke made a little gesture of resignation well he said i have done all i could and now if you will pour that flour into the pan well have breakfast  both men were silent during the frugal meal for they knew what they had to look forward to and the cold silence of the lonely land already weighed upon their spirits long weeks of solitude must be dragged through before the men who were going south that morning came back again while there might very well be interludes of scarcity and hunger is singularly hard to bear with the temperature at forty degrees below allonby only trifled with his food and smiled drily when at last he thrust his plate aside  dollars are not to be picked up easily anywhere and you and i are going to find out the full value of them before the thaw begins again he said we shall no doubt also discover how thoroughly nauseated one can become with his companions company i have heard of men wintering in the mountains who tried to kill one another  brooke laughed its scarcely likely we will go quite as far as that though i certainly remember two men in the quatomac valley who flung everything in the range at each other periodically one was inordinately fond of green stuff and his partner usually started the circus by telling him to take his clothes off and go out like nebuchadnezzar they refitted with woodpulp ware when the proceedings became expensive  just then there was a knock upon the door which swung open and a cluster of shadowy figures with their breath floating like steam about them appeared outside it one of them flung a deerhide bag into the room  we figured we neednt trail quite so much grub along and i guess youll want it a voice said neither of you changed your minds bout lighting out of this  i dont like to take it from you boys said brooke who recognized the rough kindliness which had prompted the men to strip themselves of the greater portion of their provisions you cant have more than enough for one days march left  i guess a man never hits the trail so hard as when he knows he has to somebody said it will keep us on the rustle till we fetch truscotts well youre not coming  for just a moment brooke felt his resolution wavering and under different circumstances he might have taken allonby by force and gone with them but by a somewhat involved train of reasoning he felt that it was incumbent upon him to stay on at the mine because barbara heathcote had once trusted him it had been tolerably evident from her attitude when he had last seen her that she had very little confidence in him now but that did not seem to affect the question and most men are a trifle illogical at times  no he said with somewhat forced indifference still i dont mind admitting that i wish we were  the man laughed then i guess well pull out well think of you two now and then when were lying round beside the stove in vancouver  brooke said nothing further there was a tramp of feet and the shadowy figures melted into the dimness beneath the pines then the last footfall died away and the silence of the mountains suddenly seemed to grow overwhelming brooke turned to allonby who smiled  you will he said feel it considerably worse before the next three months are over and probably be willing to admit that there is some excuse for my shortcomings in one direction i have i may mention put in a good many winters here  brooke swung round abruptly im going to work in the mine its fortunate that one man can just manage that new boring machine  he left allonby in the shanty and toiled throughout that day and several dreary weeks during most of which the pines roared beneath the icy gales and blinding snow swirled down the valley what he did was of very slight effect but it kept him from thinking which he felt was a necessity and he only desisted at length from physical incapacity for further labor the snow it was evident had choked the passes so that no laden beast could make the hazardous journey over them for the anxiouslyexpected freighter did not arrive and there was an increasing scarcity of provisions as the days dragged by while brooke discovered that a handful of mouldy floor and a few inches of rancid pork daily is not sufficient to keep a mans full strength in him then when an arctic frost followed the snow allonby fell sick and one bitter evening when an icy wind came wailing down the valley it dawned upon his comrade that his condition was becoming precarious saying nothing he busied himself about the stove and smiled reassuringly when allonby turned to him  are we to hold a festival tonight since you seem to be cooking what should keep us for a week said the latter  i almost fancy it would keep one of us for several days which since you do not seem especially capable of getting anything ready for yourself is what it is intended to do said brooke i shall probably be that time in making the settlement and getting back again  what are you going there for  to bring out the doctor  allonby raised his head and looked at him curiously are you sure that with six or eight feet of snow on the divide you could ever get there  well said brooke cheerfully i believe i could and if i dont you will be very little worse off than you were before you see the provisions will not last two of us more than a few days longer and you can take it that i will do all i can to get through the snow since you are not the only man who is anxious to find the silver your health is a matter of importance to everybody just now  allonby smiled curiously we will consider that the reason and it is a tolerably good one or i would not let you go still i fancy you have another and it is appreciated there is however something more to be said you will find my working plans in the case yonder should anything unexpected happen before you come back life you know is always a trifle uncertain  that said brooke decisively is morbid nonsense you will be down the mine again in a week after the doctor comes  well said allonby with a curious quietness i should at least very much like to find the silver  brooke changed the subject somewhat abruptly and it was an hour later when he shook hands with his comrade and went out into the bitter night with two blankets strapped upon his shoulders their parting was not demonstrative though they realized that the grim spectre with the scythe would stalk close behind each of them until they met again and brooke turning on the threshold saw allonby following him with comprehending eyes then he suddenly pulled the door to shutting out the lamplight and the alluring red glow of the stove and swung forward kneedeep in dusty snow into the gloom of the pines the silence of the great white land was overwhelming and the frost struck through him  it was late on the third night when he floundered into a little sleeping settlement and leaned gasping against the door of the doctors house before he endeavored to rouse its occupant the latter stared at him almost aghast when he opened it lamp in hand and brooke reeled grey in the face with weariness and sheeted white with frozen snow into the light  steady he said slipping his arm through brookes come in here now keep back from the stove ill get you something that will fix you up in a minute you came in from the dayspringover the divide i heard the freighter telling the boys it couldnt be done  brooke laughed harshly well he said you see me here and if thats not sufficient youre going to prove the range can be crossed yourself tomorrow  the doctor was new to that country and he was very young or he would in all probability not been there at all but when he heard brookes story he nodded tranquilly im afraid i havent done any mountaineering but i had the longdistance snowshoe craze rather bad back in montreal he said youre not going to give me very much of a lead over the passes anyway unless you sleep the next twelve hours  brooke as it happened slept for six and then set out with the young doctor in blinding snow he had forty to fifty pounds upon his back now and once they left the sheltering timber it cost them four strenuous hours to make a thousand feet part of that night they lay awake shivering in the pungent fir smoke in a hollow of the rocks and started again aching in every limb long before the lingering dawn while the next day passed like a very unpleasant dream with the young doctor the snow had ceased and lay without cohesion dusty and dry as flour waistdeep where the bitter winds had whirled it in wreaths while the glare of the white peaks became intolerable under the cloudless sun  for hours they crawled through juniper scrub or stunted wisps of pines where the trunks the winds had reaped lay piled upon each other in tangled confusion with the sifting snow blown in to conceal the pitfalls between by afternoon the doctor was flagging visibly and white peaks and climbing timber reeled formlessly before his dazzled eyes as he struggled onward the rest of that day then when the pitiless blue above them grew deeper in tint until the stars shone in depths of indigo and the ranges fading from silver put on dim shades of blueness that enhanced their spotless purity they stopped again and made shift to boil the battered kettle in a gully down which there moaned a little breeze that seared every patch of unprotected skin the doctor collapsed behind a boulder and lay there limply while brooke fed the fire  im most afraid youll have to fix supper yourself tonight he said just now i dont quite know how im going to start tomorrow though it will naturally have to be done  brooke glanced round at the grim ramparts of ice and snow that cut sharp against the indigo night as it was there was no softness in that scheme of color lighted by the frosty scintillations of the stars and a shiver ran through his stiffened limbs  yes he said nobody not hardened to it could expect to stand more than another day in the open up here  he got the meal ready but very little was said during it and for a few hours afterwards the doctor lay coughing in the smoke of the fire while his gumboots softened and grew hard again as he drew his feet which pained him intolerably between whiles a trifle further from the crackling brands he staggered when at last brooke finding that shaking was unavailing dragged him upright  breakfasts almost ready and we have got to make the mine by tonight he said  the doctor could never remember how they accomplished it but his lips were split and crusted with coagulated blood while there seemed to be no heat left in him when brooke stopped on a ridge of the hillside as dusk was closing in  the mine is close below us in fact we should have seen it from where we are he said  worn out as he was the doctor noticed the grimness of his tone the nearer the better he said i dont quite know how i got here but you scarcely seem at ease  i was wondering why allonby who does not like the dark has not lighted up yet brooke said drily we will probably find out in a few more minutes  then he went reeling down the descending trail and did not stop again until he stood amidst the piles of débris and pine stumps with the shanty looming dimly in front of him across the little clearing it seemed very dark and still and the doctor who came up gasping stopped abruptly when his comrades shout died away the silence that closed in again seemed curiously eerie  he must have heard you at that distance he said  yes said brooke a trifle hoarsely if he didnt theres only one thing that could have accounted for it  then they went on again slowly until brooke flung the door of the shanty open there was no fire in the stove and the place was very cold while the darkness seemed oppressive  strike a matchas soon as you can get it done said the doctor  brooke broke several as he tore them off the block with halffrozen fingers for the canadian sulphur matches are not usually put up in boxes and then a pale blue luminescence crept across the room when he held one aloft it sputtered out leaving a pungent odor and thick darkness closed in again but for a moment brooke felt a curious relief  hes not here he said  the doctor understood the satisfaction in his voice for his eyes had also turned straight towards the rough wooden bunk and he had not expected to find it empty  the man must have been fit to walk where has he gone he said  brooke fancied he knew and groping round the room found and lighted a lantern its radiance showed that his face was grim again  if you can manage to drag yourself as far as the mine i think it would be advisable he said it seems to me significant that the stove is quite cold one would fancy there had been no fire in it for several hours now  the doctor went with him and somehow contrived to descend the shaft brooke leaned out from the ladder swinging his lantern when they neared the bottom and his shout rang hollowly among the rocks there was no answer and even the doctor who had never seen allonby felt the silence that followed it  if the man was as ill as you fancied how could he have got down he said  i dont know said brooke still i think we shall come upon him not very far away  they went down a little further into the darkness and then the prediction was warranted for brooke swung off his hat and the doctor dropped on one knee when allonbys white face appeared in the moving light he lay very still with one arm under him and when a few seconds had slipped by the doctor looked up and meeting brookes eyes nodded  yes he said it must have happened at least twelve hours ago how i cant tell exactly cardiac affection i fancy anyway not a fall there is something in his hand and a bundle of papers beside him  brooke glanced away from the dead man and noticed the stain of giant powder on the rock and shattered fragments that had not been where they lay when he had last descended then he turned again and took the piece of stone the doctor had with some difficulty dislodged from the cold fingers  its heavy said the latter  yes said brooke quietly a considerable percentage of it is either lead or silver you are no doubt right in your diagnosis so far as it goes im inclined to fancy i know what brought on the cardiac affection  the doctor who said nothing handed him the papers and brooke who opened them vacantly started a little when he saw the jagged line which in drawings of the kind usually indicates a break was now traced across the ore vein in the plan there was also a scrap of paper with his name scrawled across it and he read when you have got your dollars back four or five times over sell out your stock  he scarcely realized its significance just then and moving the lantern a little looked down on allonbys face again it was very white and quiet and the signs of indulgence had faded from it while brooke was sensible of a curious thrill of compassion  i wonder if the thing we long for most invariably comes when it is no use to us he said well we will go back to the shanty  there was nothing more that any man could do for allonby until the morrow and the darkness once more closed in on him while the flickering light grew fainter up the shaft     xxv  barbara is merciless   it was about eight oclock in the evening when brooke stopped a moment as he entered the verandah of devines house which stood girt about by sombre pines on a low rise divided by a waste of blackened stumps and branches from the outskirts of vancouver city beneath him rose the clustering roofs and big electric lights and a little lower still a broad track of silver radiance athwart which a great ship rode with every spar silhouetted black as ebony streaked the inlet though the frost was arctic in the ranges he had left a few days ago it was almost warm down there and he felt that he would have preferred to linger on the verandah or even go back to his hotel for the front of the wooden house was brilliantly lighted and he could hear the chords of a piano  it was evident that mrs devine was entertaining and standing there draped from neck to ankles in an old fur coat he felt that he with his frostnipped face and hard scarred hands would be distinctly out of place amidst an assembly of prosperous citizens while he was by no means certain how mrs devine or barbara would receive him often as he had thought of the latter since he made his confession he felt scarcely equal to meeting her just then still it was necessary that he should see devine who was away at the neighboring city of new westminster when brooke called at his office soon after the pacific express arrived that afternoon but had left word that he would be at home in the evening and would expect him and flinging his cigar away he moved towards the door  a chinese house boy took his coat from him in the hall and as he stood under the big lamp it happened that barbara came out of an adjacent door with two companions brooke felt his heart throb though he did not move and the girl who turned her head a moment in his direction crossed the hall and vanished through another door then he smiled very grimly for though she made no sign of being aware of his presence he felt that she had seen him this was no more than he had expected but it hurt nevertheless in the meanwhile the house boy had also vanished and it was a minute or two later when mrs devine appeared but brooke could not then or afterwards decide whether she had heard the truth concerning him for though this seemed very probable he knew that barbara could be reticent and surmised that devine did not tell his wife everything in any case she did not shake hands with him  my husband who has just come home is waiting for you in his smokingroom she said it is the second door down the corridor  brooke fancied that she could have been a trifle more cordial but the fact that she sent nobody to show him the way at least was readily accounted for in a country where servants of any kind are remarkably scarce it also happened that while he proceeded along the corridor one of barbaras companions turned to her  did you see the man in the hall as we passed through she said i didnt seem to recognize him  barbara was not aware that her face hardened a trifle but her companion noticed that it did she had certainly seen the man and had felt his eyes upon her while it also occurred to her that he looked worn and haggard and she had almost been stirred to compassion he had made no claim to recognition but his face had not been quite expressionless and she had seen the wistfulness in it there was in fact a certain forlornness about his attitude which had its effect on her and it was perhaps because of this she had suddenly hardened herself against him  he is a mr brookefrom the mine she said  brooke said her companion the man from the dayspring i should like to talk to him  barbara made a little gesture the meaning of which was not especially plain she had read the sensational account of the journey brooke and the doctor had made through the ranges which had by some means been supplied the press it made it plain to her that the man was doing and enduring a good deal and she was not disposed to be unduly severe upon a repentant offender even though she fancied that nothing he could do would ever reinstate him in the place he once held in her estimation the difficulty however was that she could not be sure he was contrite at all or had not sent that story to the press himself with a purpose though she realized that the last course was a trifle unlikely in his case  since grant devine will probably bring him in you may get your wish she said indifferently  devine in the meanwhile was gravely turning over several pieces of broken rock which brooke had handed him  yes he said thats most certainly galena and carrying good metal by the weight of it how much of its lead and how much silver i naturally dont know yet but anyway it ought to leave a good margin on the smelting you havent proved the vein  no said brooke i fancy we are only on the edge of it but it would have cost me two or three weeks work to break out enough of rock to form any very clear opinion alone and i was scarcely up to it it occurred to me that i had better come down and get the necessary men though im not sure we can contrive to feed them or induce them to come  devine nodded you must have had the toughest kind of time he said well well bid double wages and you can offer that freight contractor his own figure to bring provisions in  he stopped abruptly with a glance at brookes haggard face i guess you can hold out another month or two  of course said brooke quietly  its worth while allonby was quite dead when you got back to him  yes i and the doctor buried him we used giant powder  devine laid down his cigar it was a little rough on allonby for it was his notion that the ore was there and now when it seems weve struck it its not going to be any use to him i guess that man put a good deal more than dollars into the mine  brooke who had lived with allonby knew that this was true but devine made a little abrupt gesture which seemed to imply that after all that aspect of the question did not greatly concern them  ill send you every man we can raise he said ive got quite a big credit through from london and we can cut expenses by letting up a little on the canopus  but you expected a good deal from that mine  no said devine drily i cant say i did its quite a while since we got a good clean up out of it  brooke sat silent apparently regarding his cigar for a moment or two are you sure its wise to tell me so much he said there are men in this city who would make good use of any information i might furnish them with  devine smiled in a curious fashion well he said reflectively i guess it is youve had about enough of playing saxtons game and though i dont know that everybody would do it im going to trust you  thank you said brooke quietly  devine who took up his cigar again made a little movement with his hand well let that slide now when i got the specimen and your note which the doctor sent on i figured id increase my holding and cabled a buying order to london but i had to pay more for the stock than i expected it appears that a man called cruttenden had been quietly taking any that was put on the market up  brooke knew that his trustee had as directed been buying the dayspring shares but he desired to ascertain how far devines confidence in him went  that didnt suggest anything to you he said  no said devine drily it didntand ive answered your question once besides the man who snapped up every thing that was offered hadnt waited until you struck the ore still id very much like to know what he was buying that stock for  brooke did not tell him indeed he was not exactly sure what had induced him to cable cruttenden to buy he had acted on impulse with barbaras scornful words ringing in his ears and a vague feeling that to share the risks of the man he had plotted against would be some small solace to him for he had not at the time the slightest notion that the hasty act of selfimposed penance was to prove remarkably profitable  i scarcely think it is worth while worrying over that point he said there are folks in our country with more money than sense or a good many foreign mines would never be floated and it is just as likely that the man did not exactly know why he was doing it himself  devine laughed well he said well go along now and see what the rest are doing  brooke would considerably sooner have gone back to his hotel but devine persisted and he was one who usually carried out his purpose brooke was accordingly presented to a good many people whom he had never seen before and did not find remarkably entertaining though he fancied that most of them appeared a trifle interested when they heard his name the reason for this did not however become apparent until he stopped close by a girl who looked up at him she was young but evidently by no means diffident  you are brooke of the dayspring are you not she said making room for him beside her  i certainly come from that mine said brooke and the girl turned to one of her companions  you wouldnt believe he was the man she said  brooke was not altogether unaccustomed to the directness of the west but he felt a trifle embarrassed when two pairs of eyes were fixed upon him in what seemed to be an appreciative scrutiny  one would almost fancy that you had heard of me he said  the girl laughed well she said most of the folks in this province who read newspapers have there was a column about you and your sick partner and the doctor you carried him across the range when he was too played out to walk didnt you  no said brooke a trifle astonished i certainly did not he was a good deal too heavy as a matter of fact and i was not very fit to drag myself but when did this quite unwarranted narrative come out and what shape did it take  they told him as nearly as they could remember and added running comments and questions both at once  you had almost nothing to eat for a week when you started across the range to bring the doctor out that must have been horridand what did it feel like said one  brooke shook his head i really dont know he said i should recommend you to try it  and then the poor man was dead when you got therei most cried over him there was a good deal about it it must have been creepy coming upon him lying in the dark  brooke who understood a little about western journalism waited until they stopped for the thing was becoming comprehensible to him  now he said i know how the story got out i didnt think the doctor would be guilty of anything of that kind but no doubt he told the little schoolmaster at the settlement who is a friend of his and i believe addicted to misusing ink still you see the thing is evidently inaccurate do i look as if i could do without anything to eat for a week  one of the girls again favored him with a scrutinizing glance well she said with a little twinkle in her eyes you certainly look as though square meals were scarce at the dayspring  brooke laughed and then glancing round saw barbara approaching he fancied that she could not well have avoided seeing him unless she wished to but she passed so close that her skirt almost touched him and then stopped apparently smiling down on a matronly lady a few yards away brooke felt his face grow warm and was glad that his companions questions covered his confusion  whod you get to do the funeral there wouldnt be any kind of clergyman up there  no said brooke grimly we had to manage it ourselvesthat is the doctor did im afraid it wasnt very ceremoniousand it was snowing hard at the time  he sat silent a moment while a little shiver ran through him as he remembered the bitter blast that had whirled the white flakes about the two lonely men and shaken a mournful wailing from the thrashing pines  how dreadful said one of his companions the story only mentioned the big glacier and the forest lying black all round  brooke fancied he understood the narrators reticence for there were details the doctor was not likely to be communicative about  the big glacier was at least three miles away and nobody could have seen it from where we stood he said evasively  just then and somewhat to his relief mrs devine came up to him there are two or three people here who heard you play at the concert and i have been asked to try to persuade you to do so again she said clarice marvin would be delighted to lend you her violin  seeing that it was expected of him brooke agreed and there was a brief discussion during the choosing of the music in which two or three young women took part then it was discovered that the piano part of the piece fixed upon was unusually difficult and the girl who had offered brooke the violin said you must ask barbara mrs devine  barbara being summoned made excuses when she heard what was required of her until the lady violinist looked at her in wonder  now she said you know you can play it if you want to you went right through it with me only a week ago  a faint tinge of color crept into barbaras cheek but saying nothing further she took her place at the piano and brooke bent down towards her when he asked for the note  it really doesnt commit you to anything he said still i can obviate the difficulty by breaking a string  barbara met his questioning gaze with a little cold smile  it is scarcely worth while she said  then she commenced the prelude and there was silence in the big room when the violin joined in nor were those who listened satisfied with one sonata and barbara had finished the second before she once more remembered whom she was playing for then there was a faint sparkle in her eyes as she looked up at him  it is unfortunate that you did not choose music as a career she said  brooke laughed though his face was a trifle grim  the inference is tolerably plain he said i really think i should have been more successful than i was at claimjumping  barbara turned away from the piano and brooke who laid down the violin took the vacant place beside her  still im almost afraid its out of the question now he said looking down at his scarred hands the kind of thing i have been doing the past few years spoils ones wrist you no doubt noticed how slow i was in part of the shifting  the girl noticed the leanness of his hands and the broken nails and then glanced covertly at his face it was gaunt and hollow and she was sensible that there was a suggestion of weariness in his pose which had so far as she could remember not been there before again a little thrill of compassion ran through her and she felt perhaps illogically as she had done during the sonata that no man could be wholly bad who played the violin as he did still the last thing she intended doing was admitting it  why did you stay at the dayspring through the winter she asked abruptly  well said brooke reflectively i really dont know no doubt it was an unwarranted fancy but i think i felt that after what i had purposed at the canopus i was doing a little per contra that is something that might count in balancing the score against me though of course im far from certain that it could be balanced at all you see it was a little lonely up there especially after allonby died as well as a trifle cold  barbara would have smiled at any other time for she knew what the ranges were in winter but as it was her face was expressionless and her voice unusually even  i think i understand she said it was probably the same idea that once led your knights and barons to set out on pilgrimages with peas in their shoes though it is not recorded that they did the more sensible thing by restoring their plundered neighbors possessions  brooke laughed still my stay at the dayspring served a purpose for although somebody else would no doubt have done so eventually i found the galena and i didnt go quite so far as the gentlemen you mention after all no doubt it is very reprehensible to steal a mine or in fact anything but i dont know that charitable people would consider that feeling tempted to do so was quite the same thing  barbara started a little and there was a distinct trace of color in her face  i never quite grasped that point before she said you certainly stopped short of  the actual theft said brooke i dont however mind admitting that the thing never occurred to me until this moment but i can give you my word whatever it may be worth that i never glanced at the papers after you handed them to me  there was a trace of wonder in barbaras face though she was quite aware that it could not be flattering to any man to show unnecessary astonishment when informed that he had after all some slight sense of honor  then i really think i did you a wrong but we are i fancy neither of us very good at ethics she said languidly though she was now sensible of a curious relief the man had it seemed at least not abused her confidence altogether for while there was no evident reason why she should do so she believed his assertion that he had not glanced at the papers  hairsplitting said brooke reflectively is an art very few people really excel in and i find the splitting of rocks and pines a good deal easier and more profitable you were of course in spite of your last admission quite warranted in not seeing me twice tonight  i think i was and barbara looked at him steadily you see i believed in you in fact you made me and it was that i found so difficult to forgive you  it was a very comprehensive admission and brooke whose heart throbbed as he heard it sat silent awhile  then he said very slowly it would be useless to expect that anything i could do would ever induce you to once more have any confidence in me  barbaras eyes were still upon him though they were not quite so steady as usual  yes she said quietly i am afraid it is  brooke made her a little inclination well he said i scarcely think anybody acquainted with the circumstances would blame you for that decision and now i fancy mrs devine is waiting for you     xxvi  the jumping of the canopus   the snow was soft at last and honeycombed by the splashes from the pines which once more scattered their resinous odors on a little warm breeze when shyanne tom came plodding down the trail to the canopus he was a rockdriller of no great proficiency which was why captain wilkins had sent him on an errand to a ranch and was then retracing his steps leisurely it was still a long way to the mine but he was in no great haste to reach it because he found it pleasanter to slouch through the bush than swing the hammer and the time he spent on the journey would be credited to him he had turned out of the trail to relight his pipe in the shelter of a big cedar which kept off the wind when he became sensible of a beat of horse hoofs close behind him he would have heard it earlier but that the roar of a river which had lately burst its icy chains came throbbing across the trees  shyanne was shredding his tobacco plug with a great knife but he turned sharply round because he could not think of any one likely to be riding down that trail which only led to the canopus just then as it happened he stood in the shadow and it is difficult to make out a man who does not move amidst the great greytinted trunks especially if he is dressed in stained and faded jean but the sunlight was on the trail and shyanne was struck by the attitude of one of the horsemen who appeared among the trees there were five or six of them and the beasts were heavily loaded with provisions and blankets as well as axes and mining tools the last man however led a horse which carried nothing at all and the leader who had just pulled his beast up was holding up his hand it was evident to shyanne that they had seen his tracks in the snow but as that was a peaceful country he failed to understand why it should have brought the party to a standstill he however stayed where he was watching the leader who stooped in his saddle  it cant be more than a few minutes since that fellow went along and his tracks break off right here he said i guess theres a side trail somewhere though the bush seems kind of thick  a blame rancher looking for a deer said another man anyway if hed heard us hed have stopped to talk  the leader shyanne fancied appeared reflective well he said i cant quite figure where he could have come from tomlinsons ranch is quite a way back and theres not another house of any kind until you strike the mine still i guess we neednt worry so long as he hasnt seen us  he shook his bridle and while one or two of the men turning in their saddles looked about them the horses plodded on but shyanne stood still for at least five minutes he was not especially remarkable for intelligence but it was evident to him that the men had a sufficient reason for desiring that nobody should see them then he put his pipe away and proceeded circumspectly up the trail with the print of the horse hoofs leading on before him until they turned off abruptly into the bush the meaning of this was incomprehensible since it was not the season when timberright or mineral prospectors started on their journeys and shyanne decided that it might be advisable to go on and inform wilkins of what he had seen still he made no great progress for the snow was soft and after all the canopus did not belong to him  about the time he reached it brooke who had come up there on some business with wilkins was lounging cigar in hand on the verandah at the ranch the night was for the season still and almost warm and a halfmoon hung low above the dripping pines while he found the silence and the sweet resinous odors soothing for he had been toiling feverishly at the dayspring of late why he stayed there when there was no longer any reason he should not go back to england and barbara had told him that his offences were too grievous to be forgiven he did not exactly know still the work had taken hold of him and he felt that while she was in the country he could not go away he was wondering disconsolately whether time would soften her indignation or if she would always be merciless when wilkins came into the verandah he was an elderly and somewhat deliberate man but brooke fancied he was anxious just then  its kind of fortunate youre here tonight weve got to have a talk he said  brooke gave him a cigar and leaned against the balustrade when he slowly lighted it  you cant let me have the men i asked for he said  wilkins made a little gesture all you want thats not the point now you just let me have a minute or two  ten had passed before he had related what shyanne had told him and then brooke who saw the hand of saxton in this quietly lighted another cigar  well he said what do you make of it theyre scarcely likely to be timberrighters  they might be claimjumpers  still nobody could jump a claim whose title was good  wilkins appeared a trifle uneasy though it was too dark for brooke to see him well but he apparently made up his mind to speak  the fact is our title isnt quite as good as it might be that is theres a point or two anybody who knew all about it could make trouble on he said and then turned a trifle impatiently to brooke you take it blame quietly i had kind of figured that would astonish you  brooke laughed i had surmised as much already well suppose the men shyanne saw intend to jump the claim how will they set about it  theyll wait until they figure every ones asleeptwelve oclock most likely since that would make it easy to get their record in the same day though its most of an eight hours ride to the office of the crown recorder then theyll drive their stakes in quietly and while the rest sit down tight on the peggedoff claim one of them will ride out all hes worth to get the record made after that theyll start in to bluff the dollars out of devine  he stopped somewhat abruptly and brooke fancied that he had something still upon his mind but he had discovered already that it was generally useless to attempt the extraction of any information wilkins had not quite decided to impart  then what are we going to do he said  turn out the boys and hold the jumpers off as long as we can while somebody from our crowd rides out to put a new record in when a claims bad in law anybody can stake it and the crown will register him as owner until they can straighten out the thing  then what do you expect from me  wilkins answer was prompt and decisive well have a horse ready youll ride for the company  brooke turned from him abruptly and looked down the valley he would have preferred to avoid an actual conflict with saxton for several reasons but he could not remain neutral and must choose between devine and him he had also broken off his compact and while he wished the jumpers had been acting for another man there was apparently only the one course open to him it was also conceivable that if he could make a valid new record it would count for a little in his favor with barbara  i certainly seem the most suitable person and you can get the horse ready he said still is there any reason i shouldnt make sure of the thing by starting right away  wilkins thought there was well he said ive only shyannes tale to go upon and supposing those men arent claimjumpers after all what do we gain by sending you to make a new record on the claim  nothing beyond letting everybody know that your patents bad and raising trouble with the crown people over it while i scarcely fancy devine would thank me for doing that unnecessarily it would be wiser to wait and make certain of what they mean to do  youve hit it said wilkins ill go along and talk to the boys  he disappeared into the darkness and brooke who was feeling chilly now went back to the stove while it was two hours later when he took his place behind one of the sawnoff firs which dotted the hillside above what had been one of the most profitable headings of the mine the halfmoon was higher now and the pale radiance showed the sixfoot stumps that straggled up the steep slope in rows until the bush closed in on them again there was no longer any snow upon the firs and they towered against the blueness of the night in black and solemn spires the bush was also very quiet as was the strip of clearing and there was nothing to show that a handful of men were waiting there with a sense of grim anticipation  half an hour slipped by and there was no sound from the forest but the soft rustling of the fir twigs under a little breeze while brooke who found the waiting particularly unpleasant and was annoyed to feel his fingers were quivering a little with the tension grew chilly it would he felt be a relief when the jumpers came but another ten minutes dragged by and there was still no sign of them the breeze had grown a trifle colder and the firs were whispering eerily while he could now hear the men moving uneasily then he started when the howl of a wolf came out of the bush and leaning forward grasped wilkins arm  i suppose they will come he said  the mine captain made a sign to a man who crouched behind a neighboring tree  quite sure you were awake when you saw those men shyanne he said harrup hadnt been giving you any of the hard cider  shyanne chuckled audibly not moren a jugful anyway and i dont see things on the hardest cider they make in ontario no sir those men were there and ive a notion theres one of them yonder now  the shadows of the firs were black upon the clearing but a dark patch was projected suddenly beyond the rest and a voice came faintly through the whispering of the trees  stand by it said theyre coming along  then brooke set his lips as a human figure carrying what seemed to be an axe materialized out of the gloom another appeared behind it and then a third while when a fourth became visible wilkins rose suddenly  now what in the name of thunder are you wanting here he said  the foremost man jumped as shyanne asserted afterwards like a shot deer but the rest who had apparently steadier nerves came on at a run and a man behind them shouted dont worry bout anything but get your stakes in ill do the talking  then while brooke slipped away wilkins stepped out into the moonlight with a marlin rifle gleaming dully in his hand stop right where you are he said wheres the man who wants to talk  the men stopped and stood glancing about them irresolutely there were six in all but rather more than that number of shadowy objects had appeared unexpectedly among the sawnoff stumps while they waited saxton stepped forward  well he said you see me  oh yes said wilkins drily and i guess ive seen many a squarer man what do you want crawling round our claim anyway  its not yours your patents bad and were going to relocate it for you havent you got those stakes ready boys  bring them along said wilkins im waiting  he stood stiff and resolute with the rifle at his hip and the moonlight on his face which was very grim and once more the claimjumpers glanced at their leader dubiously they were aware that although the regulations respecting mineral claims might not have been complied with there are conditions under which a man is warranted in holding on to his property wilkins also appeared quite decided on doing it  then saxtons voice rose sharply hallo he said what the  wilkins swung round and saw three or four more shadowy figures enter the clearing from the opposite side and they also apparently carried stakes and axes  figured youd get in ahead of us saxton said one of them  saxton evidently lost his temper well he said i guess im going to do it you slinking skunk if it cant be fixed any other way ill strike you for shooting brooke  wilkins laughed any more of you coming along its a kind of pity you didnt get here a little earlier  they knew what he meant in another moment when the sound of a horse ridden hard through slushy snow rose from the shadows of the pines wilkins made a little ironical gesture  i guess youll never get rich claimjumping boys he said  then saxtons voice rose again the games not finished well play you for it yet he said wheres that horse get your stakes in  he vanished in another minute but his followers remained and there was for a time a very lively scuffle about the stakes brooke had already hammered in they were torn up and replaced several times before the affray was over and then two men who furnished a very vague account of the fashion in which they had received their injuries were with difficulty conveyed to the vancouver hospital in spite of a popular illusion pistols are not in general use in that country but it is not insuperably difficult to disable an opponent effectively with an axe or shovel  in the meanwhile three men who realized that under the circumstances a good deal would depend upon who was first to reach it were riding hard by different ways towards the recorders office and brooke having no great confidence in the horse wilkins had supplied him with had taken what was at once the worst and shortest route that is not a nice country to ride through in daylight even when there is no snow upon the ground and there were times when he held his breath as the horse plunged down the side of a gulley with the halfmelted snow and gravel sliding away beneath its hoofs they also smashed and floundered through withered fern and crackling thickets of salsal and salmon berry and during one perilous hour brooke dragged the beast by the bridle up slopes of wet and slippery rock from which the winds had swept the snow away  still it was long since he had felt in the same high spirits and when they reached more even ground the rush through the cold night air brought him a curious elation he felt he was at least doing what might count in his favor against the past and apart from that there was satisfaction to be derived from the reckless ride itself he had however only a blurred recollection of most of it flitting forest peaks that glittered coldly the glint of moonlight on still frozen lakes and the frequent splashings through icy fords until when the stars had faded and the firs rose black and hard against the dawn they reeled down to the bank of a larger river from which the white mists were streaming it swirled by thick with floating ice and the horse strenuously objected to enter the water at all twice it reared at the stabbing of the spurs and then bounded with arching back but brooke was used to that trick and contrived to keep his saddle until he and the beast slid down the bank together and there was a splash and flounder as they reached the water  it was most of it freshlymelted ice and when he slipped from the saddle which he promptly found it necessary to do the cold took his breath away and he clung by the stirrup leather gasping and halfdazed while the beast proceeded unguided for a minute or two then as they swung round in a white eddy his perceptions came back to him and he realized that there was no longer any need for swimming when he drove against a boulder whose head just showed above the swirling foam he got on his feet somehow and was never quite sure whether he led the beast through the rest of the passage or held on by the bridle but at last they staggered up the opposite bank where a man he could not see very well in the dim light sat looking down on him from the saddle brooke moved a pace nearer and then recognized him as the one who had shot him at devines ranch  saxton has taken the high trail and hell cross by the bridge but i guess were quite a while ahead of him he said now do you know any reason why we shouldnt pool the thing  brooke stared at him divided between indignation and appreciation of his assurance  yes he said drily several and one of them is quite sufficient by itself  figure it out said the other i tell you saxton cant make our time over the high trail though its a better road now that one of us will get there first is a sure thing but its quite as certain it cant be both and id be content with half of what you bluff out of devine thats reasonable  brooke felt his face grow a trifle hot though he recognized that it was not astonishing the man should credit him with the purpose he had certainly been impelled by at their last meeting  i cant make a deal with you on any terms he said ride on or pull your horse out of the trail  i guess that wouldnt suit me said the other man and when brooke had his foot in the stirrup suddenly swung up his hand  then there was a flash and a detonation and the horse plunged the flash was repeated and while brooke strove to clear his foot of the stirrup the beast staggered and fell back on him it however rolled and struggled and for his foot was free now he contrived to drag himself away  when he was next sensible of anything he could hear a very faint thud of hoofs far up the climbing trail and after lying still for several minutes ventured to move circumspectly he felt very sore but all his limbs appeared to be in their usual places and rising shakily he found somewhat to his astonishment that he could walk the horse was evidently dead but there was he remembered a ranch not very far away and a certain probability of the other man still breaking one of his own limbs or his horses legs for the trail was rather worse than trails usually are in that country brooke accordingly decided to hobble on to the ranch and somehow accomplished it though the man who opened the door to him looked very dubious when he asked him for a horse  the only beast ive got isnt worth much but you dont look up to taking him in over the lake trail he said  he however parted with the horse and hove brooke into the saddle while the latter groaned as he rode away one arm and one leg were stiff and aching and at every jolt his back hurt him excruciatingly but a few hours later he rode spattered with mire and slushy snow into a little wooden town and had afterwards a fancy that somebody offered to lift him down he was not sure how he got out of the saddle but a man he recognized took the horse and he proceeded limping stiffly with his wet clothes sticking to his skin to the crown mining office the recorder who appeared to be a young englishman looked hard at him when he came in and then pointed to a chair  you may as well sit down if my surmises are correct there is no great need for haste he said  brookes face which was a trifle grey grew suddenly set  some one else has already recorded a new claim on the canopus he said  yes said the recorder in fact two of them and the last man was good enough to inform me that there was another of you coming along  then you cant give a record  no said the other man with a little smile im not sure that any of you will get one in the meanwhile that is not until we have obtained a few particulars from mr devine  i have come on behalf of him  that said the recorder is under the circumstances no great recommendation in fact there are several points your employer will be asked to clear up before we go any further with the matter  brooke who asked no more questions contrived to make his way to the hotel and flung himself down to rest when he had ascertained when the pacific express came in important as it was that he should see devine he was however very uncertain whether he would be able to get up again     xxvii  the last round   the whistle screamed hoarsely as the long train swung out from the shadow of the pines and brooke raised himself stiffly in his seat in a big dusty car a sawmill veiled in smoke and steam swept by and while the roar of wheels sank to a lower pitch he caught the gleam of the blue inlet vancouver city is built above ahead then as the clustering roofs which seamed the hillside ridge on ridge with a maze of poles and wires cutting against the background of stately pines grew plainer he straightened his back with an effort it was aching distressfully and he felt dizzy as well as stiff while he commenced to wonder whether his strength would hold out until he had seen devine and finished his business in the city  then the cars lurched a little there was a doleful tolling of a bell and when the long dusty train rolled slowly into the depôt he dropped shakily from a vestibule platform the rough planking did not seem quite steady and he struck his feet against the metals when he crossed the track but he managed to reach devines office and found that he was out he would however be back in another hour his clerk said and it occurred to brooke that he could in the meanwhile consult a doctor the latter asked him a few questions and then sat looking at him thoughtfully for a moment or two  its not quite clear to me how the horse came to fall on you you were dismounted at the time he said still after all thats not quite the question  brooke smiled a little no he said i scarcely think it is  well said the doctor drily whichever way you managed it the snow was either very soft or something else took the weight of the beast off you but i dont think you need worry greatly about that fall lie down for a day or two and rub some of the stuff i give you on the bruises now suppose you tell me what youve been doing for the last few months  brooke did so concisely and the doctor nodded pretty much as i figured he said you want to stop it right away go down the sound on a steamboat or across to victoria for two or three weeks and do nothing  im afraid thats out of the question  the doctor made a little gesture then if you go on taking it out of yourself therell be trouble especially if you worry go slow and eat and sleep all you can for a month anyway  brooke thanked him and went back to devines office thoughtfully he felt that the advice was good though there were difficulties in the way of his acting upon it he had already realized that the strain of the last few months the insufficient food and feverish work were telling upon him but he had made up his mind to hold out until the work at the dayspring was in full swing and the value of the ore lead had been made clear beyond all doubt then there would be time to rest and consider the position  devine was in when he reached the office and looked hard at him but he said very little while brooke told his story nor did he appear by any means astonished or concerned  well he said reflectively its quite likely that well have the pleasure of seeing mr saxton tomorrow hell hang off until then and when he comes ill be ready to talk to him in the meanwhile youre coming home with me  brooke hoped that he did not show the embarrassment he certainly felt for much as he longed to see her it was after their last meeting difficult to believe that barbara would appreciate his company and he scarcely felt in a mood for another taste of her displeasure  i had decided on going out on the atlantic express this evening he said there is a good deal to do at the dayspring and i could scarcely expect mrs devine to be troubled with me besides you see i came right away  he glanced significantly at his clothes but devine who rose laid a hand on his shoulder  youre coming along he said i may want you tomorrow  brooke who felt too languid to make another protest went with him and when they reached the house on the hillside devine led him into a room which looked down on the inlet  sit down he said pointing to a big lounge chair ill send somebody to look after you and unless you look a good deal better than you do now youll stay right here tomorrow in the meanwhile youll excuse me there are one or two folks i have to see in the city  he went out and brooke who let his head which ached a good deal sink back upon the soft upholstery wondered vacantly what mrs devine would think when she saw him there he still wore the garments he was accustomed to at the mine and though they were dry now and at least comparatively clean he felt that long boots and soilstained jean were a trifle out of place in that dainty room that however did not seem to matter he was drowsy and a trifle dizzy while the room was warm and it was with a little start he heard the doorhandle rattle a few minutes later then while he endeavored to straighten himself barbara came in  i feel that i ought to offer you my excuses for being here though i am not sure that i could help it he said grant devine is of a somewhat determined disposition and he insisted on bringing me  barbara did not notice him wince as with pain when he turned to her for she was not at that moment looking at him  then why should you make any it is his house she said  this was not very promising for brooke felt it suggested that although the girl was willing to defer to devines wishes they did not necessarily coincide with hers  it is he said still i seem to have acquired the sense of fitness you once mentioned and i feel i should not have come one is however not always quite so wise as he ought to be and i was feeling a trifle worn out when your brotherinlaw invited me that probably accounted for my want of firmness  barbara glanced at him sharply and noticed the gauntness of his face and the spareness of his frame which had become accentuated since she had last seen him it also stirred her to compassion which was probably why she endeavored as she had done before to harden her heart against him  no doubt you spent last night in the saddle and the trails would be bad she said i believe they are getting some tea ready and in the meanwhile how are you progressing at the mine  brooke realized that she had heard nothing about his ride or the jumping of the canopus and determined that she should receive no enlightenment from him this may have been due to wounded pride but it afterwards stood him in good stead nor would he show that her chilly graciousness which went just as far as the occasion demanded and no further hurt him and he accordingly roused himself with an effort to talk about the mine the girl had usually appeared interested in the subject and it was at least a comparatively safe one  she on her part noticed the weariness in his eyes and found it necessary to remind herself of his offences for the story he told was not without its effect on her it was though he omitted most of his own doings a somewhat graphic one and she realized a little of the struggle he and the handful of men devine had been able to send him had made halffed amidst the snow still for no very apparent reason his composure and the way he kept himself in the background irritated her  one would wonder why you put up with so much hardship wasnt it a little inconsequent she said  brookes gaunt face flushed well he said one is under the painful necessity of earning a living  still could it not be done a little more easily  i dont know that it is under any circumstances a remarkably simple thing but that is not quite the question and since you seem to insist ill answer you candidly in my case it was almost astonishingly inconsequentthat is as i expect you mean about the last thing any one would naturally have expected from me still i felt that after what i had done i had a good deal to pull up you see though that is a motive with which as i noticed when i mentioned it once before you apparently can scarcely credit me  barbara smiled it was your own actions that made it difficult  i admitted on another occasion that i am not exactly proud of them but there was some slight excuse there usually is you see  of course said barbara you need not be diffident in your case there were the dollars of which my brotherinlaw plundered you  brooke looked at her with a little glint in his eyes you he said slowly can be very merciless  well said barbara who met his gaze with quiet composure i might have been less so had i not expected quite so much from you after all it does not greatly matterand here is the tea  i think it matters a good deal but perhaps we neednt go into that said brooke who took the cup she handed him you have poured out tea for me on several occasions now but still each one recalls the first time you did it at the quatomac ranch  the same thing had happened to barbara but she laughed it presumably made no difference to the tea and yours runs some risk of getting cold  brooke appeared to be holding his cup with quite unnecessary firmness and she fancied his color was a trifle paler than it had been but he smiled  i really do not remember that it tasted any the worse he said perhaps you can remember how the sound of the river came in through the open door that night and the light flickered in the draughts it showed up your face in profile and i can still picture jimmy sitting by the stove with his mouth wide open watching you he had evidently never seen anything of the kind before  barbara noticed the manner in which he pulled himself up and realized that the sentence had deviated from its natural conclusion it was though he had certainly been guilty of obtaining what she was pleased to consider her esteem by a course of disgraceful imposition gratifying that he should be able to recall that evening that however was not to be admitted  i remember that the two candles were stuck in whisky bottles she said you removed them somewhat suddenly when you came in  brooke smiled but his face was a trifle grey in patches now and the cup was shaking visibly i really shouldnt have done he said still you see i was a trifle flurried that night and like jimmy in one respect in that i had never  you at least had been handed tea by a lady before said barbara severely  i had but the incomplete explanation still holds good well it was no doubt unwise of me to take those candlesticks away since to disguise ones habits for a strangers benefit naturally implies a deficiency of becoming pride and it could in any case only have made the thing more palpable to you  ones habits said barbara who would not admit comprehension  brooke nodded men he said do not as a rule buy whisky bottles to make candlesticks of and there were as i believe you noticed a good many more of them already on the floor still you see your good opinionwasimportant to me and i was willing to cheat you into bestowing it on me even then it mattersit really does mattera good deal  then there was a crash and brookes cup struck the leg of the chair while his plate rolled across the floor and barbaras dress was splashed with tea the man sat gripping the chair arm hard and blinking at her while his face grew grey but when she rose he apparently recovered himself with an effort  very sorry he said slowly quite absurd of me still i have had a good deal to doand very little sleeplately  barbara was wholly compassionate now sit still she said quietly i will bring you a glass of wine  no said brooke a trifle unevenly i must have kept you here half an hour already and i am afraid i have spoiled your dress into the bargain that ought to be enough if you dont mind i think i will go and lie down  he straightened himself resolutely and barbara who called the houseboy stood still with a warm tinge in her face when he went out of the room the man was evidently worn out and ill and yet he had endeavored to hide the fact to save her concern while she had found a most unbecoming pleasure in flagellating him he had met her very slightlyveiled reproaches with a composure which she surmised had not cost him a little even when his strength was melting away from him then she flushed a still ruddier color as she remembered that in any case dissimulation was a strong point of his for she felt distinctly angry with herself for recollecting it  she had engagements that evening and did not see him while he had apparently recovered during the night for when she came down to breakfast mrs devine told her that he had already gone out with her husband in point of fact an eighthours sleep had done a good deal for brooke who lunched or rather dined with devine in the city and then went with him to his office to wait until the pacific express came in  the trains up to schedule time i sent to ask them at the depôt said devine i guess well have mr saxton here in another ten minutes  the prediction was warranted for he had about half smoked the cigar he lighted when saxton was shown in the latter was dressed tastefully in city clothes and wore a flower in his buttonhole he also smiled as he glanced at brooke  it was quite a good game you put up and you got away five minutes before i did he said still three men are a little too many to jump a claim when im one of them  brookes face grew a trifle grim for he saw saxtons meaning but devine regarded the latter with a faint sardonic smile  sit down and take a cigar he said i guess you came here to talk to me and mr brooke never meant to jump the claim  no and saxton assumed an appearance of incredulity very well now i quite figured that he did  you can fix it with him afterwards said devine it seems to me that were both here on business  then well get down to it i have put in a record on the canopus mine i guess you know your patents not quite straight on a point or two  youre quite sure of that  the crown people seem to be now i cant draw back my claim without throwing the mine open to anybody but im willing to hold on and trade my rights to you when ive got my improvements in of course youd have to make it worth while but im not going to be unreasonable  devine laughed a little there was once a jumper who figured hed found the points you mentioned out he wanted eight thousand dollars would you be content with that  no said saxton drily im going to strike you for more  there was silence for a moment or two and brooke leaned forward a little as he watched his companions saxton was a trifle flushed in face and his dark eyes had an exultant gleam in them while the thin nervous fingers of one hand were closed upon the edge of the table his expression suggested that he was completely satisfied with himself and the strength of his position for it apparently only remained for him to exact whatever terms he pleased devines attitude was however not quite what one would have expected for he did not look in the least like a man who felt himself at his adversarys mercy he sat smiling a little and trifling with his cigar  well he said reflectively i guess the man i mentioned was sorry he asked quite as much as he did what is your figure  ill wait your bid  devine sat still for several moments with the little sardonic smile growing plainer in his eyes and brooke who felt the tension fancied that saxton was becoming uneasy there was a curious silence in the room through which the whirr of an elevator jarred harshly  one dollar he said  saxton gasped bluff he said thats not going to count with me you want a full hand to carry it through and the one youre holding isnt strong enough now ill put down my cards  one dollar said devine drily  saxton stood up abruptly and gazed at him in astonishment with quivering fingers and tightening lips i tell you your patents no good  i know it is  again there was silence and brooke saw that saxton was holding himself in with difficulty  still you want to keep your mine he said  you can have it for what i asked you and if you can clear the cost of working its more than i can do the canopus was played out quite a while ago  even brooke was startled and saxton sat down with all his customary assurance gone out of him his mouth opened loosely he seemed to grow suddenly limp and his cigar shook visibly in his nerveless fingers  now he said and stopped while a quiver of futile anger seemed to run through him thats the last thing i expected whatd you put up that wire sling for i cant figure out your game  devine laughed its quite easy you have just about sense enough to worry anybody or you wouldnt have dumped that ore into the dayspring and worked off one of the richest mines in the province on to me well when i saw you meant to strike me on the canopus i just let you get to work because it suited me i figured it would keep you busy while i took out timberrights and bought up land round the dayspring nobody believed in allonby and i got what i wanted at quite a reasonable figure im holding the mine and everything worth while now theres nothing left for you and i guess it would be wiser to get hold of a man of your own weight next time  saxtons face was colorless but he put a restraint upon himself as he turned to brooke  you knew just what this man meant to do  oh yes said devine drily he told me quite a while ago youre going havent you any use for that dollar  saxton said nothing whatever but the door slammed behind him and brooke who in spite of devines protests went back to the dayspring that evening never saw him again     xxviii  brooke does not come back   devine went home a little earlier than usual after saxton left him and dusk was not far away when he sat recounting the affair in his wifes drawingroom she listened with keen appreciation and then looked up at him  but where is brooke she said  devine smiled i guess hes buying mining tools you cant keep that man out of a hardware store he said i wanted to bring him back but he was feeling better and made up his mind to go out on the atlantic express he asked me to make his excuses as he had fixed to meet an american machinery agent and wasnt quite sure he could get round  perhaps it is just as well said mrs devine who appeared reflective do you think you are wise in encouraging that man to come here grant  i wouldnt exactly call it that i brought him he didnt want to come  you are of course quite sure and mrs devines smile implied that she at least was a trifle incredulous hasnt it struck you that barbara  so far as ive noticed lately barbara didnt seem in any way pleased with him  mrs devine made a little impatient gesture that she said is exactly what i dont like its a significant sign barbara wouldnt have been angry with himif it was not worth while  you said nothing when he came to the ranch while we were at the mine  the man was pleasant company and there was it seemed to me very little risk of a superior workman attracting barbaras fancy  devine laughed i guess i was of no great account when you married me  pshaw said mrs devine anyway you hadnt plotted to steal a mine from the people i belonged to  devines eyes twinkled it showed his grit and most anything is considered square in a mining deal besides there were the six thousand dollars slocum took out of him  i am quite aware that such transactions are evidently not subject to the ordinary code but seriously if you would be content with harford brooke as my brotherinlaw it is considerably more than i would be we dont even know why he left the old country  well said devine drily i guess i have a notion ive been finding out a good deal about him but get on with your objections  barbara has a good many dollars  so has brooke you neednt worry about that point  mrs devines astonishment was very apparent then whatever is he working at the mine forand why didnt you tell me before  i guess its because that kind of thing pleases him and anyway its only since last mail came in i knew  youre quite sure now  ill tell you what i heard there was a man who bought up our stock in england when nobody else seemed to have any use for it the directors wanted to know a little about him and they found it was a trust account he was taking up the stock for another man who had been left quite a few dollars and that man was called harford brooke the executor it seems told somebody that the man he was buying for was here now its not likely there are two of them in this part of canada  the door as it happened was not closed and mrs devine was too intent to hear it swing open a little further the dollars she said are by no means the most important consideration but still  she stopped abruptly at a sound and then turned round with a little gasp for barbara stood just inside the room then there was a disconcerting silence for a moment or two until the girl glanced at devine  yes she said quietly i heard when did mr brooke buy that stock  devine understood the question and once more the twinkle crept into his eyes  well he said it was quite a while before they found the silver i dont know what he did it for now i guess ive been here longer than i meant to stay youll excuse me katty  he seemed in haste to get away and when the door closed behind him the two who were left looked at one another curiously mrs devine was evidently embarrassed  i suppose she said drily you dont know why brooke bought those shares either  i think i do said barbara with unusual quietness though the color was very visible in her cheeks he had a reason  she stopped abruptly and there was once more an awkward silence until she made a little impulsive gesture  oh she said sharply now i feel horribly mean he stayed there through the winter when they had scarcely anything to eat and bought that stock when nobody else would have it or believed in the dayspring then he risked his life to save the canopus and when he came down worn out and ill i had only hard words for him  well said mrs devine drily the sensation is probably good for you you dont seem to remember that he also tried to jump the mine  barbara turned towards her with a little sparkle in her eyes have youneverdone anything that was wrong  mrs devine naturally saw the point of this but while she considered her answer barbara who had a good deal to think of and scarcely felt equal to any further conversation just then abruptly turned away glancing at her watch she went straight to a room from the window of which she could see the road to the depôt for she knew the atlantic express would shortly start and she had not been told that brooke was not coming back exactly what she meant to say to him she did not know but she felt she could not let him go without at least a slight expression of her appreciation of what he had done she knew that he would value it and that it would go far to blot out the memory of past unkindness he had certainly meant to jump the canopus and deceived her shamefully which was far harder to forgive for the realization of the fact that she had bestowed rather more than friendliness upon a man who was unworthy of it had its sting but she scarcely remembered that now he had it appeared since then sacrificed his fortune and broken down his strength and that considering the purpose which she fancied had impelled him went a long way to condone his offences  he however did not appear on the road as she had expected and she grew a trifle anxious when the tolling of a bell came up from the depôt by the wharf as the big locomotive backed the long cars in it was also significant that she did not notice that the room which had no stove in it was very cold then looking down she saw men with valises pass across an opening between the roofs and express wagons lurching along the uneven road the train would start very soon and there was at least one admission she must make but the minutes were slipping by and still brooke did not come the man it almost appeared was content to go away without seeing her though she felt compelled to admit that in view of what had passed at their last meeting this was not altogether astonishing still the fact that he could do so hurt her and she waited in a state of painful tension a very few minutes would suffice for him to climb the hill and even if there was no opportunity for an explanation which now appeared very probable a smile or even a glance might go a long way to set matters right  the few minutes however slipped by as the rest had done until at last the locomotive bell slowly clanged again and the hoot of a whistle came up the hillside and was flung back by the pines then a puff of white smoke rolled up from the wharf and barbara turned away from the window with the crimson in her face as the cars swept through an opening between the clustering roofs the train had gone and the man would not know how far she had relented towards him she could settle to nothing during the rest of the evening and scarcely slept that night though she naturally did not mention the fact when she and mrs devine met at breakfast next morning instead she took out a letter she had received a week earlier  its from hetty hume and the english mail goes out today she said she suggests that i should come over and spend a few months with her i really think we did what we could for her when she was here with the major  mrs devine took the letter i fancy she wants you to go she said she mentions that she has asked you several times already  barbara appeared reflective so she has she said in fact i think ill go the change will do me good  well said mrs devine i suppose you can afford it but if you indulge in many changes of that kind youre not going to have very much of a dowry  do you think i need one  mrs devine laughed as she glanced at her but her face grew thoughtful again perhaps in your case it wouldnt be necessary and though it is a very long way i fancy that you might do worse than go to england and stay there while hetty is willing to keep you  a little flush crept into barbaras cheek but she said quietly i think ill start on saturday  she did so and it came about one night while the big train she travelled by swept across the rolling levels of the assiniboian prairie that brooke sat in his shanty at the dayspring with jimmy who had just come down from the range standing in front of him the freighter had still now and then a difficulty in bringing them provisions in and whenever jimmy found the persistent plying of drill and hammer pall upon him he would go out and look out for a deer though it was not always that he came back with one on this occasion he brought a somewhat alarming tale instead  a big snowslide must have come along since i was up on that slope before and gouged out quite a cañon for itself he said anyway if it wasnt a snowslide it was a cloudburst or a waterspout they happen around when folks dont want them now and then  come to the point said brooke im sufficiently acquainted with the meteorological perversities of the country  slinging names at them isnt much use ive tried it and any one raised here could give you points at the thing now before i came to quatomac i was staying up at the tillicum ranch and id just taken a new twelvedollar pair of gumboots off one night when there was a waterspout up the valley that washed me and jardine out of the house we sailed along until we struck a convenient pine and sat in it most of the night while the flood went down then i hadnt any gumboots and jardine couldnt find his house  i believe you told me you went down the river on a door on the last occasion brooke said wearily still it doesnt greatly matter what has all this to do with the hollow the snowslide made in the range  well said jimmy i guess you know the way the big rock outcrop runs across the foot of the valley now before the snowslide or the waterspout came along the melting snow went down into the next hollow and the one where the outcrop is got just enough to keep the outlet of the creek that comes through it open  i do will it be an hour or more before you make it clear how that concerns anybody  no sir im getting right there the snows melting tolerably fast and the drainage from the big peak isnt going the way it used to now the foot of the valleys quite a nicesized lake and the stream has washed most of the brokeup pines the snow brought down into the outlet gully i guess you have seen a bad lumber jam  brooke had and he started as he recognized the significance of what was happening for once a drifting log strikes fast in a narrow passage the stream is very apt to pile up and wedge fast those that come behind into a tolerably efficient substitute for a dam while when log still follows log the result is usually an inextricable confusion of interlocked timber  when the jam up broke wed have the water and the wreckage down on the mine he said  all there is of it said jimmy it would cost quite a pile of dollars to dry the workings out  brooke strode to the door and flung it open but there was black darkness outside and a persistent patter of thick warm rain then he swung round with an objurgation and jimmy grinned  i guess its no use you couldnt see a pine ten foot off and there isnt a man in the country who would go down that gully with a lantern in his hand he said go off to sleep youll see quite as much as you want to anyway tomorrow  brooke stood still and listened a moment or two while the hoarse roar of a river which he knew was swirling in fierce flood among the boulders far down in the hollow came up in deep reverberations across the pines it was a significant hint of what was likely to happen when the pentup water poured down upon the mine still there was nothing he could do in that thick darkness  sleep he said when almost every dollar i haveand a good deal more than thatis sunk in the mine  well said jimmy reflectively in your place if i could make sure of the dollars id take my chances on the rest now and then im quite thankful i havent any it saves a mighty lot of worry  he swung out of the shanty and brooke who flung himself down on his couch of spruce twigs endeavored to sleep though he had no great expectation of succeeding as it happened he lay tossing or holding himself still by an effort the long night through for he had set his whole mind on the prosperity of the dayspring a good deal of his small fortune was also sunk in it though that was not of the greatest moment to him he had a vague hope that when the mine was through his efforts pouring out highgrade ore he might reinstate himself in barbaras estimation in that case at least she might believe in his contrition for he felt that where protests were evidently useless deeds might avail then the dollars in question would be valuable to him  it was two hours before the dawn and still apparently raining hard when he rose and lighted the stove he felt a trifle dizzy and very shivery as he did it but the frugal breakfast put a little warmth into him and he went out into the thick haze of falling water and up the hillside walking somewhat wearily and with considerably more effort than he had found it necessary to make a few months ago     xxix  a final effort   a dim grey light was creeping through the rain when brooke stopped on a ridge of hillside that broke off from the parent range above the mine the pines were slowly growing into shape though as yet they showed as mere spires of blackness in the sliding haze and there was a faint glimmer in the hollow beneath him while the sound of running water drowned the splashing of the rain the snow upon the lower slopes had mostly melted now though that on the great hill shoulders would swell the frothing rivers for months to come and sinking ankledeep in quaggy mould he went down through the dripping undergrowth until he stopped again on the verge of what had become in the last few days a muddy lake  the wreckage of the higher forests was strewn upon it but brooke noticed that it drifted steadily in one direction and floundering along the waters edge he reached a narrow gully which had served as outlet for the stream through the ridge that hemmed in the valley the passage was however now choked by a mass of groaning timber which was apparently growing every hour and it already seemed scarcely possible to cut through that pile of wreckage by any means at his command once the pentup water which seemed rising rapidly burst the jam it would come down in an overwhelming torrent upon the mine and he sat down on a fallen redwood to consider how the difficulty could be grappled with  he however found it no easy matter to keep his mind upon the question at all his head was aching he felt unpleasantly limp as well as wet and cold and the distressful stiffness of his back suggested that he had by no means recovered from the effects of his fall the long months of strenuous physical toil the scanty and when the freighter could not get in often wholly insufficient food and exposure to bitter frost and snow had left their mark on him while now worn out in mind and body as he was he realized that a last grim effort was demanded from him how it was to be made he did not know and he was sitting still shivering with the rain running from him when jimmy and another man from the mine appeared it was almost light now and the miner glanced at the gathering water with evident concern  i guess something has got to be done he said  brooke lifted himself shakily to his feet and blinked in a curious heavy fashion at the man  it has and if youll bring the boys up well make a start he said now i dont know that we could cut that jam and if we did it would only turn the lake loose on the mine what i purpose is to break a new cut through the rise where its thinnest and run enough water off to ease the pressure then we might if it appeared advisable get at the jam in the meanwhile every man i can spare from here will start in cutting out a tenfoot trench at the mine that would take away a good deal of any water that did come down  ive been at this kind of work most all my life and thats bout how i would fix it said the other man  well said brooke theres just another point once you get started youll go right on and therell be very little sleep for any one until its done but well credit you with half extra on every hours time in the paybill  the man laughed and waved his hand you neednt worry bout that i guess the boys will see you through he said  he disappeared into the rain and the struggle commenced when he came back with the men there were but a handful of them in all and their task appeared almost beyond accomplishment even to those born in a country where man and nature unsubdued come to the closest grapple and human daring and endurance must make head against the tremendous forces that unloose the rivers and slowly grind the ranges down it is a continuous struggle primitive and elemental in which brute strength and the animal courage that plies axe and drill with wornout muscle and bleeding hands plays at least an equal part with ingenuity for man has arrayed against him sun and frost roaring water crushing ice and sliding snow and those who fall in it lie thick by towering trestle bridge and along each railroad track worn out aching in every limb and with heavy eyes brooke braced himself to bear his part in it  for three days they toiled with pick and shovel and clinking drill and the roar of the blasting charges shook the wet hillside but while the trenches deepened slowly the water rose by night the big fires snapped and sputtered and the feeble lanterns blinked through the rain while wild figures stained with mire and dripping water moved amidst the smoke and those who dragged themselves out of the workings lay down on the wet ground for a brief hours sleep brooke however so far as he could afterwards remember did not close his eyes at all and where his dripping figure appeared the shovels swung more rapidly and the ringing of the drills grew a trifle louder the pace was however too fierce to last and though even the men who work for another toil strenuously in that land it was evident to him that while their task was less than halfdone they could not sustain it long  baffled in one direction he had also changed his plans for the ridge was singularly hard to cut through even with giant powder and he had withdrawn most of the men from it and sent them to the trench which would he hoped afford a passage to at least part of the water that must eventually come down upon the mine it was late on the third night when it became evident that this would very shortly happen and he sat wet through and very weary in his tent on the hillside when jimmy and another man came in  waters riz another foot since sundown and i guess theres lakes of it ready to come down yonder said the miner who stretched out a wet hand and pointed towards the dripping canvas above him though brooke surmised that he intended to indicate the range so far as i could make out theres quite a forest of smashedup logs sailing along to pile up in the jam  brooke lifted a wet grey face and blinked at him with halfclosed eyes  then im afraid there are only two courses open to us he said we can wait until the jam breaks up when therell be water enough to fill the dayspring up and wash the plant above ground right down into the cañon or we must try to cut it now  and turn the lake loose on us with the trench bout half big enough to take it away said jimmy  yes said brooke grimly you have a sixfoot dam thrown up im not sure it will stand but its a good deal less likely to do it when the lake is twice as big  jimmy looked at the other man who nodded the boss is right he said you cant stop to look for the nicest way out when youre in a blame tight place no sir youve got to take the quickest one when do you figure on starting on the jam mr brooke  now  the man appeared astonished and shook his head it cant be done in the dark he said i guess nobody could find the king log thats keying up the jam and though the boys arent nervous im not sure youd get one of them to crawl down that gulley and over the live logs until its light they couldnt see to do anything with the axe anyway  brooke smiled drily since they will not be asked to do it that does not count i purposed trying giantpowder and going myself that is unless jimmy feels anxious to come along with me  i dont said jimmy with decision in his tone if it was anybody else watching him would be quite good enough for me still as it isnt i guess ill have to see you through  thanks said brooke you can let them know what to expect at the mine cropper ill want you to put the detonators on the fuses with me jimmy  the other man went out and the two who were left proceeded to nip down the fulminating caps on the strips of snaky fuse after which they carefully embedded them in sundry plastic rolls which looked very like big candles made of yellow wax these they packed in an iron case and then carrying an axe and a big auger went out of the tent the rest of the men left at the ridge were waiting them for every one understood the perilous nature of the attempt though as two men were sufficient for the work there was nothing that they could do and they proceeded in a body through the dripping undergrowth towards the gully here a big fire of resinous wood was lighted and when at last the smoky glare flickered upon the wet rocks in the hollow brooke who stripped to shirt and trousers flung himself over the edge  he dropped upon a little ledge and made another yard or two down a cranny then a bold leap landed him on a second ledge and the groaning trunks were close beneath him when he dropped again the glare of the fire scarcely reached him now and jimmy who alighted close by him looked up longingly at the flickering light above  it wasnt easy getting down and id feel better if i knew just how we were going back he said i guess its not quite wise either to bang that can about on the rocks  this was incontrovertible for while giant powder which is dynamite is with due precaution comparatively safe to handle and cannot be exploded without a detonator so those who make it claim it is still addicted to going off with disastrous results on very small provocation brooke who had the case containing it slung round his back was however looking down on the logs that stirred and heaved beneath him with the water spouting up through the interstices between he could see them when the fire grew brighter  the king should not be far away from the look of the jam he said if we cant cut it we may jar it loose giant powder strikes down let me have the axe  jimmy glanced at him and shook his head for brookes face showed drawn and grey in the flickering light  ill do any chopping thats wanted and be glad when i get you out of this he said  he dropped upon the timber and the gap he splashed into closed up suddenly as he whipped out his leg then with brooke behind him he crawled over the grinding logs and by and by drove the point of the auger into one that seemed to run downwards through the midst of them it was a good many feet in girth and brooke gasped heavily when he also laid hold of the auger crutch the hole they made was charged with one of the yellow rolls and moving to a second log they bored another while the mass shook and trembled under them and twice a great spout of water fell splashing upon them the logs were apparently endued with vitality for they moved under and over their fellows and ground upon them with the pulsations of the stream that brought down fresh accessions and found a fresh channel that promptly closed again the jam might resist the pressure for another week or break up at any moment and whirl down the gully in chaotic ruin still with the rain beating down upon them the pair toiled on until several sticks of explosive had been embedded when brooke rose very stiffly and straightened himself as he took a little case out of his pocket  i dont know that weve got the king but the general shakeup ought to loosen it he said light your fuse jimmy and then get up ill come in a moment or two when im ready  jimmy looked up and saw a cluster of dark figures outlined against the glow of the fire for the men had crowded to the edge of the gully  stand by to give us a lift up boys he said  then he turned away and was rather longer than he liked persuading a damp match to ignite the fuse however sparkled readily and groping his way across the logs he clutched a ledge of rock it was wet and slippery and he slid back from it hurting one arm while when he regained the narrow shelf a voice was raised warningly above  let her go it said jimmys fuse will be on to the powder before youre through  jimmy turned and dimly saw his comrade still apparently stooping over one of the logs  have i got to come back and bring you he shouted  brooke stood up and a faint sparkling broke out at his feet go on he said its burning now  jimmy said nothing further those fuses were short and he was anxious to be clear of the gully still even though he decided to sacrifice the axe it was not an easy matter to ascend the almost precipitous slope of slippery rock and as he climbed higher the glare of the fire in his eyes confused him he had however almost reached the top when there was a crash and a rattle of stones below him and he twisted himself partly round while a hoarse shout rang out  get hold of him cried one of the men oh jump for it hell be over the ledge  for a moment jimmy had a glimpse of a wet white face and a hand apparently clinging to a cranny and then the flicker of firelight sank and left him in black darkness he did not understand exactly what had taken place but it was unpleasantly evident that the fuses would soon reach the powder while his comrade whom he could no longer see was apparently unable to ascend the gully  cant you get him shouted somebody  jump down put the fuses out said another man  jimmy was fortunately one of the slow men who usually keep their heads and while he glanced down at the twinkling fuses in the dark pit beneath him he swung up a warning hand  light right out of that boys it cant be done he said hold on partner let me know where you areim coming along  a faint shout answered him and jimmy made his way downwards until he could discern a dusky blur which he surmised was brooke close beneath him taking a firm hold with one hand he leaned down and clutched at it and then with every muscle strained strove to drag his comrade up jimmy was a strong man but brooke it seemed was able to do very little to help him and jimmys fingers commenced to slacken under the tension then brooke who made a convulsive flounder lost the grip he had and the arm jimmy clung to was torn away from him a dull sound that was unpleasantly suggestive rose from a ledge below and there was silence that was more so after it  then while jimmy leaned down blinking into the darkness and ignoring the risk he ran a yellow flash leapt out below and there was a stunning detonation it was followed almost in the same moment by another and the solid rock seemed to heave a shiver while the hollow was filled with overwhelming sound and a nauseating vapor giantpowder strikes chiefly downwards which was especially fortunate for two men just then but the rock was swept by flying fragments of shattered trunks and jimmy cowered against it halfdazed then another sound rose out of the acrid haze as the rent trunks crushed beneath the pressure and there was an appalling grinding and smashing of timber it was succeeded by a furious roar of water  a minute had probably slipped by when once more a man who showed faintly black against the firelight leaned over the edge of the gully and his voice reached jimmy brokenly  hallo are either of you alive he cried  jimmy roused himself with an effort well he said hoarsely i guess i am i dont quite know whether brooke is  then im coming down said the other man we have got to get him out of the stink if theres anything left of him  jimmy grasped the necessity for this since the fumes of giantpowder are in confined spaces usually sufficient to prostrate a strong man and several of his comrades apparently came down instead of one bringing lanterns and blazing brands with them there was a slippery ledge a little lower down the gully and while the nauseating vapor eddied about them and the shattered wreckage went thundering past below they made their way along it until they came on brooke  he was lying partly up on the ledge with his feet in the swirling torrent and his shirt rent open there was a big red smear on it his lips were bloodless and one arm was doubled limply under him jimmy stooped and shook him gently but brooke made no sign and his head sank forward until his face was hidden then jimmy who slipped his hand inside the torn shirt withdrew it smeared and warm with a little shiver  hes bleeding quite hard and that shows theres life in him we have got to get him out of this right now he said  none of them quite remembered how they did it for few men unaccustomed to the ranges would have cared to ascend that gully unencumbered by daylight but it was accomplished and when a litter of fir branches had been hastily lashed together they plodded behind it in silence down the hillside if anything could be done and they were very uncertain on that point it could only be done in the shanty  as they floundered down the trail a man met them with the news that very little of the water had got into the mine but that did not appear of much importance to any one just then after all the dayspring belonged to an english company and it was brooke who lay in the litter oblivious of everything they had worked for     xxx  the other chance   the blink of sunlight was pleasantly warm where barbara sat with hetty hume on a seat set back among the laurels which just there cut off the shrewd wind from the english lawn a black cloud sailed slowly over the green hilltop behind the old grey house and the closecropped grass was sparkling still with the sprinkle of bitter rain but the scent of the pale narcissus drifted up from the borders and the sticky buds of a big chestnut were opening overhead barbara glanced across the sweep of lawn towards the line of willows that swung their tasseled boughs above the palely flashing river they were apparently dusted with silver and ochre and here and there a flush of green chequered the ridge of thorn along the winding road that led the eye upwards to the cleancut edge of the moor it was however a regular even line cropped to one unvarying level save for the breaks where the neat gates were hung the road was smooth and wide with a red board beside the wisp of firs above to warn all it might concern of the gradient while the square fields with the polled trees in the trim hedgerows all conveyed the same impression this was decorous wellordered england where nature was broken to mans dominion centuries ago as she glanced at it her companion laughed  the prospect from here is i believe generally admitted to be attractive though i have not noticed any of my other friends spend much time in admiring it she said still perhaps it is different in your case you havent anything quite like it in canada  no said barbara anyway not between quatomac and the big glacier you remember that ride  of course said hetty hume i found it a little overwhelming that is the peaks and glaciers i also remember the rancher the one who played the violin i suppose you never came across him again  i met him once or twice at a big concertand on other occasions  barbaras smile was indifferent but she was silent for the next minute or two she had now spent several weeks in england and had found the smooth wellregulated life there pleasant after the restless activity of the one she had led in western canada where everybody toiled feverishly she felt the contrast every day and now the sight of that softlysliding river whose low murmur came up soothingly across the lawn recalled the one that frothed and foamed amidst the quatomac pines and the roar that rose from the misty cañon that very naturally also brought back the face of the flumebuilder and she wondered vaguely whether he was still at the dayspring and what he was doing then until her companion turned to her again  we will really have to decide about the cruttendens dance tonight she said it will be the last frivolity of the season in this vicinity  i havent met mrs cruttenden have i said barbara indifferently  you did when you were here before dont you remember the old house you were so pleased with lower down the valley in any case she remembers you and made a point of my bringing you cruttenden has a relative in your country though i never heard much about the man  barbara remembered the old building very well and it suddenly flashed upon her that brooke had on one occasion displayed a curious acquaintance with it everything that afternoon seemed to force him upon her recollection  you would like to go she said  i at least feel i ought to we are of course quite newcomers here in fact we had only bought larchwood just before you last came over and it was mrs cruttenden who first took us up one may live a very long while in places of this kind without being admitted within the pale you see and even the rank of major isnt a very great warranty especially if it has been gained in foreign service instead of aldershot  miss hume stopped as her father came slowly down the pathway with a greyhaired lady whose dress proclaimed her a widow and the latters voice reached the girls clearly her face was so barbara noticed very expressive as she turned to her companion  i think you know what i really came for she said i feel i owe you a very great deal  major hume made a little deprecatory gesture i have he said at least seen the papers and was very glad to notice that reggie has got his step he certainly deserved it very plucky thing especially with only a handful of a raw native levy to back him frontal attack in daylightand the niggers behind the stockade seem to have served their old guns astonishingly well  still if it had not been for your forbearance he would never have had the opportunity of doing it said the lady i shall always remember that you were the only one who made any excuse for him and he told me his colonel was very bitter against him  the pair passed the girls apparently without noticing them and barbara did not hear major humes answer but when he came back alone a few minutes later he stopped in front of them  you were here when we went by he said  yes said hetty we heard you quite distinctly too and that suggests a question what was it reggie ferris did  major hume smiled drily stormed a big rebel stockade with only a few halfdrilled natives to help him if you havent read it already i can give you a paper with an account of the affair  that said hetty is as you are aware not what i wished to ask what was it he did before he left the line regiment it was presumably something not especially creditableand i always had an idea that he owed it to you that the result was not a good deal more unpleasant  the major appeared a trifle embarrassed i scarcely think it would do you very much good to know he said the thing wasnt a nice one but there was good stuff in the lad who it was evident to me at least had been considerably more of a fool than a rogue and all i did was to persuade the colonel who meant to break him to give him another chance it seems i was wise reggie ferris has had his lesson and has from all accounts retrieved his credit in the colonial service  if i remember correctly you once made a bad mistake in being equally considerate to another man said hetty reflectively  i certainly did but you will find by the time you are as old as i am that taking it all round it is better to be merciful  the major said hetty with a glance at barbara is a confirmed optimistand he has been in india  major hume smiled well he said the mistakes one makes from that cause hurt one less afterwards than the ones that result from believing in nobody now there was that young woman who was engaged to reggie  he has applied the suggestive epithet to her ever since she gave him up said hetty still i really dont think anybody could have expected very much more from her  no said the major grimly in my opinion she went further than there was any particular necessity for her to do she knew the mans shortcomings when she was engaged to himand she should have stuck to him you dont condemn any one for a single slip in your country miss heathcote  barbara made no answer for this it seemed was just what she had done but hetty who had been watching her laughed  you couldnt expect her to admit that their standard in canada is lower than ours she said  the major appeared disconcerted that is not exactly what i mean they have a little more charity yonder and in some respects a good deal more sense from one or two cases i am acquainted with they are in fact usually willing to give the man who trips another chance instead of falling upon him mercilessly before he can get up  still you havent told us yet what reggie ferris did  major hume laughed as he turned away i am he said quite aware of it  he left them and hetty smiled as she said the major has not infrequently been imposed upon but nothing will disabuse him of his cheerful belief in human nature and i must admit that he is quite as often right as more censorious people there was lily harland who gave reggie ferris up which of course was probably only what he could have expected under the circumstances but reggie it appears is wiping out the past and i have reasons for surmising that she has been sorry ever since nobody but my father and his mother ever hear from him now and if that hurts lily she has only herself to blame she had her opportunity of showing what faith she had in the man and cant expect to get another just because she would like it  she wondered why the warm color had crept into her companions face but barbara said nothing and vacantly watched the road that wound up through the meadows out of the valley until a moving object appeared where it crossed the crest of the hill in the meanwhile her thoughts were busy for the majors suggestive little story had not been without its effect on her and the case of reggie ferris was it seemed remarkably similar to that of a certain canadian flumebuilder the english soldier and grant devine had both been charitable but she and the girl who was sorry ever since had shown themselves merciless and there was in that connection a curious significance in the fact that reggie ferris who was now brilliantly blotting out the past wrote nobody but his mother and the man who had given him what the latter termed another chance barbara remembered the afternoon when she waited at the window and brooke who she fancied could have done so had he wished had not come up from the depôt she could not ignore the fact that this had since occasioned her a vague uneasiness  in the meanwhile the moving object had been growing larger and when it reappeared lower down the road resolved itself into a gardener who had been despatched to the nearest village on a bicycle  we will wait until tom brings in the letters said hetty  it was a few minutes later when the man came up the path and handed her a packet among the letters she spread out there was one for barbara whose face grew suddenly intent as she opened it it was from mrs devine and the thin paper crackled under her tightening fingers as she read  i have been alone since i last wrote you as grant had to go up to the dayspring suddenly and has not come back there was i understand a big flood in the valley above the mine and brooke it seems was very seriously hurt when endeavoring to protect the workings i dont understand exactly how it happened though i surmise from grants letters that he did a very daring thing he is now in the vancouver hospital for although grant wished him brought here the surgeon considered him far too ill to move his injuries i understand are not very serious in themselves but it appears that the man was badly worn out and run down when he sustained them and his condition i am sorry to say is just now very precarious  the rest of the letter concerned the doings of barbaras friends in vancouver but the girl read no more of it and sat still a trifle white in the face with her hands trembling until hetty turned to her  you dont look well she said i hope nothing has happened to your sister or mr devine  no said barbara quietly though there was a faint tremor in her voice they are apparently in as good health as usual  im glad to hear it said hetty with an air of relief there is of course nobody else or i should have known it though you really seem a trifle paler than you generally do shall we go in and look through these patterns i have been writing up about some dress material and theyve sent cuttings still i dont suppose you will want anything new for mrs cruttendens  no said barbara in a voice that was almost too even now and not in keeping with the tension in her face in fact im not going at all  hetty glanced at her sharply and then made a little gesture of comprehension  very well she said whenever you feel it would be any consolation you can tell me but in the meanwhile i have no doubt that you can get on without my company  she moved away and barbara who was glad to be alone sat still for she wished to set her thoughts in order this was apparently the climax all that had passed that afternoon had led up to but she was just then chiefly conscious of an overwhelming distress that precluded any systematic consideration of its causes the man whom she had roused from his lethargy at the quatomac ranch was now she gathered dying in the vancouver hospital but not before he had blotted out his offences by slow endurance and unwearying effort in the face of flood and frost she would have admitted this to him willingly now but the opportunity was it seemed not to be afforded her and the bitter words with which she had lashed him could never be withdrawn she who had shown no mercy and would not afford him what major hume had termed another chance must it seemed long for it in vain herself  by degrees however her innate resolution rose against that decision and she remembered that it was not in point of time at least a very long journey to british columbia there was nothing to prevent her setting out when it pleased her and then it occurred to her that the difficulties would be plentiful at the other end what explanation would she make to her sister or the man ifand the doubt was horriblehe was indeed still capable of receiving it he had never in direct speech offered her his love and she had not even the excuse of the girl who had given reggie ferris up for throwing herself at his feet she was not even sure that she could have done it in that case for her pride was strong and once more she felt the hopelessness of the irrevocable she had shown herself hard and unforgiving and now she realized that the man she lovedand it was borne in upon her that in spite of his offences she loved him wellwas as far beyond her reach as though he had already slipped away from her into the other world at whose shadowy portals he lay in the vancouver hospital  there had been a time indeed the occasion had twice presented itself when she could have relented gracefully but she could no longer hope that it would ever happen again and it only remained for her to face the result of her folly and bear herself befittingly it would she realized cost her a bitter effort but the effort must be made and she rose with a tense white face and turned towards the house hetty as it happened met her in the hall and looked at her curiously  there are as you may remember two or three people coming in to dinner she said i have no doubt i could think out some excuse if you would sooner not come down  why do you think that would please me said barbara quietly  well said hetty a trifle drily i fancied you would sooner have stayed away your appearance rather suggested it  barbara smiled in a listless fashion im afraid i cant help that she said your friends however will presumably not be here for an hour or two yet  hetty made no further suggestions and barbara moved on slowly towards the stairway she came of a stock that had grappled with frost and flood in the wild ranges of the mountain province and courage and steadfastness were born in her but she knew there was peril in the slightest concession to her gentler nature she might make just then what she bore in the meanwhile she told nobody but when the sonorous notes of a gong rolled through the building she came down the great stairway only a trifle colder in face than usual and immaculately dressed     xxxi  brooke is forgiven   it was a pleasant morning and brooke lay luxuriating in the sunlight by an open window of the vancouver hospital his face was blanched and haggard and his clothes hung loosely about his limbs but there was a brightness in his eyes and he was sensible that at last his strength was coming back to him opposite him sat devine who had just come in and was watching him with evident approbation  you will be fit to be moved out in a day or two and i want to see you in mrs devines hands he said we have a room fixed ready and i came round to ask when the doctor would let you go  brooke slowly shook his head you are both very kind but im going back to the old country he said still i dont know whether i shall stay there yet  devine appeared a trifle disconcerted we had counted on you taking hold again at the dayspring he said wilkins is getting an old man and i dont know of any one who could handle that mine as you have done quite sure theres nothing i could do that would keep you  brooke lay silent a moment or two he was loth to leave the mine but during his slow recovery at the hospital a curious longing to see the old country once more had come upon him he could go back now and if it pleased him pick up the threads of the old life he had left behind though he was by no means sure this would afford him the satisfaction he had once anticipated the ambition to prove his capabilities in canada had in the meanwhile at least deserted him since his last meeting with barbara and he had heard from mrs devine that it would probably be several months before she returned to vancouver he realized that it was she who had kept him there and now she had gone and the mine was as devine had informed him exceeding all expectations there was no longer any great inducement to stay in canada he had seen enough of the country and of late a restless desire to get away from it had been growing stronger with every day of his recovery it might he felt be easier to shake off the memory of his folly in another land  no he said slowly i dont think there is i feel i must go back for a while at least  well said devine who seemed to recognize that protests would be useless its quite a long journey i guess you can afford it  brooke felt the keen eyes fixed on him with an almost disconcerting steadiness but he contrived to smile  yes he said if i dont do it too extravagantly i fancy i can  then theres another point said devine with a faint twinkle in his eyes you might want to do something yonder that would bring the dollars in now i could give you a few lines that would be useful in case you wanted an engagement with one of your waterworks contractors or any one of that kind  i scarcely think it will be necessary said brooke with a little smile  well said devine i have a notion that its not going to be very long before we see you back again you have got used to us and youre going to find the folks yonder slow i can think of quite a few men who saved up one or two of them for a very long while to go home to the old country and in about a month theyd had enough of it the country was very much as they left itbut they had altered  he stopped a moment with a little chuckle before he continued now there was sandy campbell who ran the stamps at the canopus for me he never spent a dollar when he could help it and when hed quite a pile of them he told me he was just sickening for a sight of glasgow well i let him go and that day six weeks sandy came round to the mine again the old country was badly played out he said but for another month that was all he would tell me and then the facts came out sandys friends had met him at the donaldson wharf and started a circus over the whisky somebody broke the furniture and sandy doubled up a policeman who he figured had insulted him so they had him up for doing it before whatever they call a magistrate in that country sandys remarks were printed in a glasgow paper and he showed it me  forty shillings its an iniquity he said is this how ye treat a man who has come six thousand miles to see his native land i will not find ye a surety im away back by the first allan boat to a country where they appreciate me  brooke laughed still i dont quite see how sandys case applies to me  i guess it does one piece of it anyway sandy knew where he was appreciated and we have room for a good many men of your kind in this country thats about all i need say when you feel like it come right back to me  he went out a few minutes later and brooke lay still thoughtfully with his old ambitions reawakening there was he surmised a good deal of truth in devines observations and work in the mountain province that he could do still he felt that even to make his mark there would be no great gain to him now barbara could not forgive him but she was in england and he might at least see her whether that would be wise he did not know and scarcely fancied so but the faint probability had its attractions and he would go and stay thereuntil he had recovered his usual vigor at least  it was however a little while before the doctors would permit him to risk the journey and several months had passed when he stood with a kinsman and his wife on the lawn outside an old house in an english valley the air was still and warm and a full moon was rising above the beeches on the hillside its pale light touched the river that slid smoothly between the mossy steppingstones and the shadows of clipped yew and drooping willow lay black upon the grass there was a faint smell of flowers that linger in the fall and here and there a withered leaf was softly sailing down but that night it reminded brooke of the resinous odors of the western pines and the drowsy song of the river of the thunder of the torrent that swirled by quatomac his heart was also beating a trifle more rapidly than usual and for that reason he was more than usually quiet  i suppose your friends will come he said indifferently  mrs cruttenden who stood close by him laughed to the minute major hume is punctuality itself i fancy he will be a little astonished tonight  i shall be pleased to meet him again he was to bring miss hume  of course said mrs cruttenden with a keen glance at him and miss heathcote whom you asked about no doubt she will be a trifle astonished too you do not seem quite so sure that the meeting with her will afford you any pleasure  brooke smiled a trifle grimly the most important question is whether she will be pleased to see me i dont mind admitting it is one that is causing me considerable anxiety  wouldnt her attitude on the last occasion serve as guide  brooke felt his face grow warm under her watchful eyes but he laughed  i would like to believe that it did not he said miss heathcote did not appear by any means pleased with me still you see you sometimes change your minds  yes said mrs cruttenden reflectively especially when the person who has offended us has been very ill it is in fact the people one likes the most one is most inclined to feel angry with now and then but there are circumstances under which one feels sorry for past severities  brooke started for this appeared astonishingly apposite in view of the fact that he had as she had once or twice reminded him told her unnecessarily little about his canadian affairs the difficulty however was that he could not be sure she was correct  you naturally know what you would do but after all that scarcely goes quite as far as one would like he said  mrs cruttenden laughed softly still i fancy the rest are very like me in one respect in fact it might be wise of you to take that for granted  just then three figures appeared upon the path that came down to the steppingstones across the river and brookes eyes were eager as he watched them they were as yet in the shadow but he felt that he would have recognized one of them anywhere and under any circumstances then he strode forward precipitately and a minute later sprang aside on to an outlying stone as a greyhaired man who glanced at him sharply turned with hand held out to one of his companions brooke moved a little nearer the one who came last and then stood bareheaded while the girl stopped suddenly and looked at him he could catch the gleam of the brown eyes under the big hat and for the moon was above the beeches now part of her face and neck gleamed like ivory in the silvery light she stood quite still with the flashing water sliding past her feet etherealized it seemed to him by her surroundings and a complement of the harmonies of the night  you she said  brooke laughed softly and swept his hand vaguely round as though to indicate the shining river and dusky trees  yes he said you remember how i met you at quatomac who else could it be  nobody said barbara with a tinge of color in her face at least any one else would have been distinctly out of place  brooke tightened his grasp on the hand she had laid in his for which there was some excuse since the stone she stood upon was round and smooth and it was a long step to the next one  you knew i was here he said  yes said barbara quietly  brooke felt his heart throbbing painfully and you could have framed an excuse for staying away  the girl glanced at him covertly as he stood very straight looking down on her with lips that had set suddenly and tension in his face the moonlight shone into it and it was she noticed quieter and a little grimmer than it had been while his sinewy frame still showed spare to gauntness in the thin conventional dress this had its significance to her  of course she said still it did not seem necessary i had no reason for wishing to stay away  brooke fancied that there was a good deal in this admission and his voice had a little exultant thrill in it  that impliesever so much he said hold fast that stone is treacherous and one can get wet in this river though it is not the quatomac absurd to suggest that isnt it are not abana and pharpar better than all the waters of israel  barbara also laughed do you wish the major to come back for me she said it is really a little difficult to stand still upon a narrow piece of mossy stone  they went across and major hume stared at brooke in astonishment when cruttenden presented him  by all thats wonderful our canadian guide he said  presumably so said cruttenden still though my wife appears to understand the allusion its more than i do anyway he is my kinsman harford brooke and the owner of high wycombe  brooke smiled as he shook hands with the major but he was sensible that barbara flashed a swift glance at him and as they moved towards the house hetty broke in  you must know mr cruttenden that your kinsman met barbara beside a river once before and on that occasion too they did not come out of it until some little time after we did she said  that said cruttenden appears to imply that they wereinthe water  i really think that one of them was said hetty barbara had a pony but mr brooke had not and his appearance certainly suggested that he had been bathing in fact he was so bedraggled that barbara gave him a dollar she had i must explain already spent a few months in this country  brooke was a trifle astonished and noticed a sudden warmth in barbaras face  if i remember correctly you had gone into the ranch miss hume he said severely  no said hetty you may have fancied so but i hadnt i was the only chaperon barbara had you see i hope she didnt tell you not to lavish the dollar on whisky no doubt you spent it wisely on tobacco  brooke made no answer and his smile was somewhat forced but he went with the others into the house and it was an hour or two later when he and barbara again stood by the riverside alone neither of them quite knew how it came about but they were there with the black shadows of the beeches behind them and the flashing water at their feet brooke glanced slowly round him and then turned to the girl  it reminds one of that other riverbut there is a difference he said the beeches make poor substitutes for your towering pines and you no longer wear the white samite  and said barbara where is the sword  brooke looked down on her gravely and shook his head i am not fit to wear it and yet i dare not give it back to you stained as it is he said what am i to do  keep it said barbara softly you have wiped the stain out and it is bright again  brooke laid a hand that quivered a little on her shoulder barbara he said i am not vainer than most men and i know what i have done but unless what once seemed beyond all hoping for was about to come to me you and i would not have met again beside the river it simply couldnt happen you can forget all that has gone before and once more try to believe in me  i think said barbara quietly there is a good deal that you must never remember too i realized thatand she stopped with a little shiverwhen you were lying in the vancouver hospital  and you knew i loved you though in those days i dare not tell you so i have done so i think from the night i first saw you and yet there is so much to make you shrink from me  no said barbara very softly there is nothing whatever nowand if perfection had been indispensable you would never have thought of me  brooke laid his other hand on her shoulder and standing so while every nerve in him thrilled still held her a little apart so that the silvery light shone into her flushed face for a moment she met his gaze and her eyes were shining  do you know that absurd as it may sound i seemed to know that night at quatomac that i should hold you in my arms again one day he said of course the thing seemed out of the question an insensate dream and still i could never quite let go my hold of the alluring fancy  and if the dream had never been fulfilled  brooke laughed curiously you would still have ridden beside me through many a long night march with the moon shining round and full behind your shoulder and i should have felt the white dress brush me softly where the trail was dark  then i should have been always young to you you would never have seen me grow faded and the grey creep into my hair  brooke drew her towards him and held her close my dear you will be always beautiful to me we will grow old together and the one who must cross the last dark river first will at least start out on the shadowy trail holding the others hand  it was an hour later when barbara with the mans arm still about her glanced across the velvet lawn to the old grey house beneath the dusky slope of wooded hill the moonlight silvered its weathered front and the deep tranquillity of the sheltered valley made itself felt  yes said brooke it is yours and mine  barbara made a little gesture that was eloquent of appreciation it is very beautiful a place one could dream ones life away in we have nothing like it in canada you would care to stay here always  any place would be delightful with you  the girl laughed softly but her voice had a tender thrill in it and then she turned towards the west  it is very beautifuland full of rest she said still i scarcely think it would suit you to sit down in idleness and all that can be done for this rich country has been done years ago  i wonder said brooke who guessed her thoughts if you would be quite so sure when you had seen our towns  still one would need to be very wise to take hold thereand i do not think you care for politics  no said brooke with a faint dry smile besides remembering saxton i should feel a becoming diffidence about wishing to serve my nation in that fashion there are men enough who are anxious to do it already and i would be happier grappling with the rocks and pines in western canada  then said barbara if it pleases you we will go back to the great unfinished land where the dreams of such men as you are come true   the end     illustration  the spotter  illustration  a story of the
