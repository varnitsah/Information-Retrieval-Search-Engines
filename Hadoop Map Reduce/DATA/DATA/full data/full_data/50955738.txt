the diamond of kali      xxv the day we celebrate     i  the last of the troubadours   inexorably sam galloway saddled his pony he was going away from the rancho altito at the end of a threemonths visit it is not to be expected that a guest should put up with wheat coffee and biscuits yellowstreaked with saleratus for longer than that nick napoleon the big negro man cook had never been able to make good biscuits once before when nick was cooking at the willow ranch sam had been forced to fly from his cuisine after only a sixweeks sojourn  on sams face was an expression of sorrow deepened with regret and slightly tempered by the patient forgiveness of a connoisseur who cannot be understood but very firmly and inexorably he buckled his saddlecinches looped his stakerope and hung it to his saddlehorn tied his slicker and coat on the cantle and looped his quirt on his right wrist the merrydews householders of the rancho altito men women children and servants vassals visitors employés dogs and casual callers were grouped in the gallery of the ranch house all with faces set to the tune of melancholy and grief for as the coming of sam galloway to any ranch camp or cabin between the rivers frio or bravo del norte aroused joy so his departure caused mourning and distress  and then during absolute silence except for the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle on top of his slicker and coat the guitar was in a green duck bag and if you catch the significance of it it explains sam  sam galloway was the last of the troubadours of course you know about the troubadours the encyclopædia says they flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries what they flourished doesnt seem clearyou may be pretty sure it wasnt a sword maybe it was a fiddlebow or a forkful of spaghetti or a ladys scarf anyhow sam galloway was one of em  sam put on a martyred expression as he mounted his pony but the expression on his face was hilarious compared with the one on his ponys you see a pony gets to know his rider mighty well and it is not unlikely that cow ponies in pastures and at hitching racks had often guyed sams pony for being ridden by a guitar player instead of by a rollicking cussing allwool cowboy no man is a hero to his saddlehorse and even an escalator in a department store might be excused for tripping up a troubadour  oh i know im one and so are you you remember the stories you memorize and the card tricks you study and that little piece on the pianohow does it gotitumtetumtitumthose little arabian ten minute entertainments that you furnish when you go up to call on your rich aunt jane you should know that omnæ personæ in tres partes divisæ sunt namely barons troubadours and workers barons have no inclination to read such folderol as this and workers have no time so i know you must be a troubadour and that you will understand sam galloway whether we sing act dance write lecture or paint we are only troubadours so let us make the worst of it  the pony with the dante alighieri face guided by the pressure of sams knees bore that wandering minstrel sixteen miles southeastward nature was in her most benignant mood league after league of delicate sweet flowerets made fragrant the gently undulating prairie the east wind tempered the spring warmth woolwhite clouds flying in from the mexican gulf hindered the direct rays of the april sun sam sang songs as he rode under his ponys bridle he had tucked some sprigs of chaparral to keep away the deer flies thus crowned the longfaced quadruped looked more dantesque than before and judging by his countenance seemed to think of beatrice  straight as topography permitted sam rode to the sheep ranch of old man ellison a visit to a sheep ranch seemed to him desirable just then there had been too many people too much noise argument competition confusion at rancho altito he had never conferred upon old man ellison the favour of sojourning at his ranch but he knew he would be welcome the troubadour is his own passport everywhere the workers in the castle let down the drawbridge to him and the baron sets him at his left hand at table in the banquet hall there ladies smile upon him and applaud his songs and stories while the workers bring boars heads and flagons if the baron nods once or twice in his carved oaken chair he does not do it maliciously  old man ellison welcomed the troubadour flatteringly he had often heard praises of sam galloway from other ranchmen who had been complimented by his visits but had never aspired to such an honour for his own humble barony i say barony because old man ellison was the last of the barons of course mr bulwerlytton lived too early to know him or he wouldnt have conferred that sobriquet upon warwick in life it is the duty and the function of the baron to provide work for the workers and lodging and shelter for the troubadours  old man ellison was a shrunken old man with a short yellowwhite beard and a face lined and seamed by pastandgone smiles his ranch was a little tworoom box house in a grove of hackberry trees in the lonesomest part of the sheep country his household consisted of a kiowa indian man cook four hounds a pet sheep and a halftamed coyote chained to a fencepost he owned 3000 sheep which he ran on two sections of leased land and many thousands of acres neither leased nor owned three or four times a year some one who spoke his language would ride up to his gate and exchange a few bald ideas with him those were redletter days to old man ellison then in what illuminated embossed and gorgeously decorated capitals must have been written the day on which a troubadoura troubadour who according to the encyclopædia should have flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuriesdrew rein at the gates of his baronial castle  old man ellisons smiles came back and filled his wrinkles when he saw sam he hurried out of the house in his shuffling limping way to greet him  hello mr ellison called sam cheerfully thought id drop over and see you a while notice youve had fine rains on your range they ought to make good grazing for your spring lambs  well well well said old man ellison im mighty glad to see you sam i never thought youd take the trouble to ride over to as outoftheway an old ranch as this but youre mighty welcome light ive got a sack of new oats in the kitchenshall i bring out a feed for your hoss  oats for him said sam derisively no siree hes as fat as a pig now on grass he dont get rode enough to keep him in condition ill just turn him in the horse pasture with a drag rope on if you dont mind  i am positive that never during the eleventh and thirteenth centuries did baron troubadour and worker amalgamate as harmoniously as their parallels did that evening at old man ellisons sheep ranch the kiowas biscuits were light and tasty and his coffee strong ineradicable hospitality and appreciation glowed on old man ellisons weathertanned face as for the troubadour he said to himself that he had stumbled upon pleasant places indeed a wellcooked abundant meal a host whom his lightest attempt to entertain seemed to delight far beyond the merits of the exertion and the reposeful atmosphere that his sensitive soul at that time craved united to confer upon him a satisfaction and luxurious ease that he had seldom found on his tours of the ranches  after the delectable supper sam untied the green duck bag and took out his guitar not by way of payment mind youneither sam galloway nor any other of the true troubadours are lineal descendants of the late tommy tucker you have read of tommy tucker in the works of the esteemed but often obscure mother goose tommy tucker sang for his supper no true troubadour would do that he would have his supper and then sing for arts sake  sam galloways repertoire comprised about fifty funny stories and between thirty and forty songs he by no means stopped there he could talk through twenty cigarettes on any topic that you brought up and he never sat up when he could lie down and never stood when he could sit i am strongly disposed to linger with him for i am drawing a portrait as well as a blunt pencil and a tattered thesaurus will allow  i wish you could have seen him he was small and tough and inactive beyond the power of imagination to conceive he wore an ultramarineblue woollen shirt laced down the front with a pearlgray exaggerated sort of shoestring indestructible brown duck clothes inevitable highheeled boots with mexican spurs and a mexican straw sombrero  that evening sam and old man ellison dragged their chairs out under the hackberry trees they lighted cigarettes and the troubadour gaily touched his guitar many of the songs he sang were the weird melancholy minorkeyed canciones that he had learned from the mexican sheep herders and vaqueros one in particular charmed and soothed the soul of the lonely baron it was a favourite song of the sheep herders beginning huile huile palomita which being translated means fly fly little dove sam sang it for old man ellison many times that evening  the troubadour stayed on at the old mans ranch there was peace and quiet and appreciation there such as he had not found in the noisy camps of the cattle kings no audience in the world could have crowned the work of poet musician or artist with more worshipful and unflagging approval than that bestowed upon his efforts by old man ellison no visit by a royal personage to a humble woodchopper or peasant could have been received with more flattering thankfulness and joy  on a cool canvascovered cot in the shade of the hackberry trees sam galloway passed the greater part of his time there he rolled his brown paper cigarettes read such tedious literature as the ranch afforded and added to his repertoire of improvisations that he played so expertly on his guitar to him as a slave ministering to a great lord the kiowa brought cool water from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter and food when he called for it the prairie zephyrs fanned him mildly mockingbirds at morn and eve competed with but scarce equalled the sweet melodies of his lyre a perfumed stillness seemed to fill all his world while old man ellison was pottering among his flocks of sheep on his mileanhour pony and while the kiowa took his siesta in the burning sunshine at the end of the kitchen sam would lie on his cot thinking what a happy world he lived in and how kind it is to the ones whose mission in life it is to give entertainment and pleasure here he had food and lodging as good as he had ever longed for absolute immunity from care or exertion or strife an endless welcome and a host whose delight at the sixteenth repetition of a song or a story was as keen as at its initial giving was there ever a troubadour of old who struck upon as royal a castle in his wanderings while he lay thus meditating upon his blessings little brown cottontails would shyly frolic through the yard a covey of whitetopknotted blue quail would run past in single file twenty yards away a paisano bird out hunting for tarantulas would hop upon the fence and salute him with sweeping flourishes of its long tail in the eightyacre horse pasture the pony with the dantesque face grew fat and almost smiling the troubadour was at the end of his wanderings  old man ellison was his own vaciero that means that he supplied his sheep camps with wood water and rations by his own labours instead of hiring a vaciero on small ranches it is often done  one morning he started for the camp of incarnación felipe de la cruz y monte piedras one of his sheep herders with the weeks usual rations of brown beans coffee meal and sugar two miles away on the trail from old fort ewing he met face to face a terrible being called king james mounted on a fiery prancing kentuckybred horse  king jamess real name was james king but people reversed it because it seemed to fit him better and also because it seemed to please his majesty king james was the biggest cattleman between the alamo plaza in san antone and bill hoppers saloon in brownsville also he was the loudest and most offensive bully and braggart and bad man in southwest texas and he always made good whenever he bragged and the more noise he made the more dangerous he was in the story papers it is always the quiet mildmannered man with light blue eyes and a low voice who turns out to be really dangerous but in real life and in this story such is not the case give me my choice between assaulting a large loudmouthed roughhouser and an inoffensive stranger with blue eyes sitting quietly in a corner and you will see something doing in the corner every time  king james as i intended to say earlier was a fierce twohundredpound sunburned blond man as pink as an october strawberry and with two horizontal slits under shaggy red eyebrows for eyes on that day he wore a flannel shirt that was tancoloured with the exception of certain large areas which were darkened by transudations due to the summer sun there seemed to be other clothing and garnishings about him such as brown duck trousers stuffed into immense boots and red handkerchiefs and revolvers and a shotgun laid across his saddle and a leather belt with millions of cartridges shining in itbut your mind skidded off such accessories what held your gaze was just the two little horizontal slits that he used for eyes  this was the man that old man ellison met on the trail and when you count up in the barons favour that he was sixtyfive and weighed ninetyeight pounds and had heard of king jamess record and that he the baron had a hankering for the vita simplex and had no gun with him and wouldnt have used it if he had you cant censure him if i tell you that the smiles with which the troubadour had filled his wrinkles went out of them and left them plain wrinkles again but he was not the kind of baron that flies from danger he reined in the mileanhour pony no difficult feat and saluted the formidable monarch  king james expressed himself with royal directness youre that old snoozer thats running sheep on this range aint you said he what right have you got to do it do you own any land or lease any  i have two sections leased from the state said old man ellison mildly  not by no means you havent said king james your lease expired yesterday and i had a man at the land office on the minute to take it up you dont control a foot of grass in texas you sheep men have got to git your times up its a cattle country and there aint any room in it for snoozers this range youve got your sheep on is mine im putting up a wire fence forty by sixty miles and if theres a sheep inside of it when its done itll be a dead one ill give you a week to move yours away if they aint gone by then ill send six men over here with winchesters to make mutton out of the whole lot and if i find you here at the same time this is what youll get  king james patted the breech of his shotgun warningly  old man ellison rode on to the camp of incarnación he sighed many times and the wrinkles in his face grew deeper rumours that the old order was about to change had reached him before the end of free grass was in sight other troubles too had been accumulating upon his shoulders his flocks were decreasing instead of growing the price of wool was declining at every clip even bradshaw the storekeeper at frio city at whose store he bought his ranch supplies was dunning him for his last six months bill and threatening to cut him off and so this last greatest calamity suddenly dealt out to him by the terrible king james was a crusher  when the old man got back to the ranch at sunset he found sam galloway lying on his cot propped against a roll of blankets and wool sacks fingering his guitar  hello uncle ben the troubadour called cheerfully you rolled in early this evening i been trying a new twist on the spanish fandango today i just about got it heres how she goeslisten  thats fine thats mighty fine said old man ellison sitting on the kitchen step and rubbing his white scotchterrier whiskers i reckon youve got all the musicians beat east and west sam as far as the roads are cut out  oh i dont know said sam reflectively but i certainly do get there on variations i guess i can handle anything in five flats about as well as any of em but you look kind of fagged out uncle benaint you feeling right well this evening  little tired thats all sam if you aint played yourself out lets have that mexican piece that starts off with huile huile palomita it seems that that song always kind of soothes and comforts me after ive been riding far or anything bothers me  why seguramente señor said sam ill hit her up for you as often as you like and before i forget about it uncle ben you want to jerk bradshaw up about them last hams he sent us theyre just a little bit strong  a man sixtyfive years old living on a sheep ranch and beset by a complication of disasters cannot successfully and continuously dissemble moreover a troubadour has eyes quick to see unhappiness in others around himbecause it disturbs his own ease so on the next day sam again questioned the old man about his air of sadness and abstraction then old man ellison told him the story of king jamess threats and orders and that pale melancholy and red ruin appeared to have marked him for their own the troubadour took the news thoughtfully he had heard much about king james  on the third day of the seven days of grace allowed him by the autocrat of the range old man ellison drove his buckboard to frio city to fetch some necessary supplies for the ranch bradshaw was hard but not implacable he divided the old mans order by two and let him have a little more time one article secured was a new fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour  five miles out of frio city on his way home the old man met king james riding into town his majesty could never look anything but fierce and menacing but today his slits of eyes appeared to be a little wider than they usually were  good day said the king gruffly ive been wanting to see you i hear it said by a cowman from sandy yesterday that you was from jackson county mississippi originally i want to know if thats a fact  born there said old man ellison and raised there till i was twentyone  this man says went on king james that he thinks you was related to the jackson county reeveses was he right  aunt caroline reeves said the old man was my halfsister  she was my aunt said king james i run away from home when i was sixteen now lets retalk over some things that we discussed a few days ago they call me a bad man and theyre only half right theres plenty of room in my pasture for your bunch of sheep and their increase for a long time to come aunt caroline used to cut out sheep in cake dough and bake em for me you keep your sheep where they are and use all the range you want hows your finances  the old man related his woes in detail dignifiedly with restraint and candour  she used to smuggle extra grub into my school basketim speaking of aunt caroline said king james im going over to frio city today and ill ride back by your ranch tomorrow ill draw 2000 out of the bank there and bring it over to you and ill tell bradshaw to let you have everything you want on credit you are bound to have heard the old saying at home that the jackson county reeveses and kings would stick closer by each other than chestnut burrs well im a king yet whenever i run across a reeves so you look out for me along about sundown tomorrow and dont worry about nothing shouldnt wonder if the dry spell dont kill out the young grass  old man ellison drove happily ranchward once more the smiles filled out his wrinkles very suddenly by the magic of kinship and the good that lies somewhere in all hearts his troubles had been removed  on reaching the ranch he found that sam galloway was not there his guitar hung by its buckskin string to a hackberry limb moaning as the gulf breeze blew across its masterless strings  the kiowa endeavoured to explain  sam he catch pony said he and say he ride to frio city what for no can damn sabe say he come back tonight maybe so that all  as the first stars came out the troubadour rode back to his haven he pastured his pony and went into the house his spurs jingling martially  old man ellison sat at the kitchen table having a tin cup of beforesupper coffee he looked contented and pleased  hello sam said he im darned glad to see ye back i dont know how i managed to get along on this ranch anyhow before ye dropped in to cheer things up ill bet yeve been skylarking around with some of them frio city gals now thats kept ye so late  and then old man ellison took another look at sams face and saw that the minstrel had changed to the man of action  and while sam is unbuckling from his waist old man ellisons sixshooter that the latter had left behind when he drove to town we may well pause to remark that anywhere and whenever a troubadour lays down the guitar and takes up the sword trouble is sure to follow it is not the expert thrust of athos nor the cold skill of aramis nor the iron wrist of porthos that we have to fearit is the gascons furythe wild and unacademic attack of the troubadourthe sword of dartagnan  i done it said sam i went over to frio city to do it i couldnt let him put the skibunk on you uncle ben i met him in summerss saloon i knowed what to do i said a few things to him that nobody else heard he reached for his gun firsthalf a dozen fellows saw him do itbut i got mine unlimbered first three doses i gave himright around the lungs and a saucer could have covered up all of em he wont bother you no more  thisiskingjamesyou speakof asked old man ellison while he sipped his coffee  you bet it was and they took me before the county judge and the witnesses what saw him draw his gun first was all there well of course they put me under 300 bond to appear before the court but there was four or five boys on the spot ready to sign the bail he wont bother you no more uncle ben you ought to have seen how close them bullet holes was together i reckon playing a guitar as much as i do must kind of limber a fellows trigger finger up a little dont you think uncle ben  then there was a little silence in the castle except for the spluttering of a venison steak that the kiowa was cooking  sam said old man ellison stroking his white whiskers with a tremulous hand would you mind getting the guitar and playing that huile huile palomita piece once or twice it always seems to be kind of soothing and comforting when a mans tired and fagged out  there is no more to be said except that the title of the story is wrong it should have been called the last of the barons there never will be an end to the troubadours and now and then it does seem that the jingle of their guitars will drown the sound of the muffled blows of the pickaxes and trip hammers of all the workers in the world     ii  the sleuths   in the big city a man will disappear with the suddenness and completeness of the flame of a candle that is blown out all the agencies of inquisitionthe hounds of the trail the sleuths of the citys labyrinths the closet detectives of theory and inductionwill be invoked to the search most often the mans face will be seen no more sometimes he will reappear in sheboygan or in the wilds of terre haute calling himself one of the synonyms of smith and without memory of events up to a certain time including his grocers bill sometimes it will be found after dragging the rivers and polling the restaurants to see if he may be waiting for a welldone sirloin that he has moved next door  this snuffing out of a human being like the erasure of a chalk man from a blackboard is one of the most impressive themes in dramaturgy  the case of mary snyder in point should not be without interest  a man of middle age of the name of meeks came from the west to new york to find his sister mrs mary snyder a widow aged fiftytwo who had been living for a year in a tenement house in a crowded neighbourhood  at her address he was told that mary snyder had moved away longer than a month before no one could tell him her new address  on coming out mr meeks addressed a policeman who was standing on the corner and explained his dilemma  my sister is very poor he said and i am anxious to find her i have recently made quite a lot of money in a lead mine and i want her to share my prosperity there is no use in advertising her because she cannot read  the policeman pulled his moustache and looked so thoughtful and mighty that meeks could almost feel the joyful tears of his sister mary dropping upon his bright blue tie  you go down in the canal street neighbourhood said the policeman and get a job drivin the biggest dray you can find theres old women always gettin knocked over by drays down there you might see er among em if you dont want to do that you better go round to headquarters and get em to put a fly cop onto the dame  at police headquarters meeks received ready assistance a general alarm was sent out and copies of a photograph of mary snyder that her brother had were distributed among the stations in mulberry street the chief assigned detective mullins to the case  the detective took meeks aside and said  this is not a very difficult case to unravel shave off your whiskers fill your pockets with good cigars and meet me in the café of the waldorf at three oclock this afternoon  meeks obeyed he found mullins there they had a bottle of wine while the detective asked questions concerning the missing woman  now said mullins new york is a big city but weve got the detective business systematized there are two ways we can go about finding your sister we will try one of em first you say shes fiftytwo  a little past said meeks  the detective conducted the westerner to a branch advertising office of one of the largest dailies there he wrote the following ad and submitted it to meeks  wanted at onceone hundred attractive chorus girls for a new musical comedy apply all day at no  broadway  meeks was indignant  my sister said he is a poor hardworking elderly woman i do not see what aid an advertisement of this kind would be toward finding her  all right said the detective i guess you dont know new york but if youve got a grouch against this scheme well try the other one its a sure thing but itll cost you more  never mind the expense said meeks well try it  the sleuth led him back to the waldorf engage a couple of bedrooms and a parlour he advised and lets go up  this was done and the two were shown to a superb suite on the fourth floor meeks looked puzzled the detective sank into a velvet armchair and pulled out his cigar case  i forgot to suggest old man he said that you should have taken the rooms by the month they wouldnt have stuck you so much for em  by the month exclaimed meeks what do you mean  oh itll take time to work the game this way i told you it would cost you more well have to wait till spring therell be a new city directory out then very likely your sisters name and address will be in it  meeks rid himself of the city detective at once on the next day some one advised him to consult shamrock jolnes new yorks famous private detective who demanded fabulous fees but performed miracles in the way of solving mysteries and crimes  after waiting for two hours in the anteroom of the great detectives apartment meeks was shown into his presence jolnes sat in a purple dressinggown at an inlaid ivory chess table with a magazine before him trying to solve the mystery of they the famous sleuths thin intellectual face piercing eyes and rate per word are too well known to need description  meeks set forth his errand my fee if successful will be 500 said shamrock jolnes  meeks bowed his agreement to the price  i will undertake your case mr meeks said jolnes finally the disappearance of people in this city has always been an interesting problem to me i remember a case that i brought to a successful outcome a year ago a family bearing the name of clark disappeared suddenly from a small flat in which they were living i watched the flat building for two months for a clue one day it struck me that a certain milkman and a grocers boy always walked backward when they carried their wares upstairs following out by induction the idea that this observation gave me i at once located the missing family they had moved into the flat across the hall and changed their name to kralc  shamrock jolnes and his client went to the tenement house where mary snyder had lived and the detective demanded to be shown the room in which she had lived it had been occupied by no tenant since her disappearance  the room was small dingy and poorly furnished meeks seated himself dejectedly on a broken chair while the great detective searched the walls and floor and the few sticks of old rickety furniture for a clue  at the end of half an hour jolnes had collected a few seemingly unintelligible articlesa cheap black hat pin a piece torn off a theatre programme and the end of a small torn card on which was the word left and the characters c 12  shamrock jolnes leaned against the mantel for ten minutes with his head resting upon his hand and an absorbed look upon his intellectual face at the end of that time he exclaimed with animation  come mr meeks the problem is solved i can take you directly to the house where your sister is living and you may have no fears concerning her welfare for she is amply provided with fundsfor the present at least  meeks felt joy and wonder in equal proportions  how did you manage it he asked with admiration in his tones  perhaps jolness only weakness was a professional pride in his wonderful achievements in induction he was ever ready to astound and charm his listeners by describing his methods  by elimination said jolnes spreading his clues upon a little table i got rid of certain parts of the city to which mrs snyder might have removed you see this hatpin that eliminates brooklyn no woman attempts to board a car at the brooklyn bridge without being sure that she carries a hatpin with which to fight her way into a seat and now i will demonstrate to you that she could not have gone to harlem behind this door are two hooks in the wall upon one of these mrs snyder has hung her bonnet and upon the other her shawl you will observe that the bottom of the hanging shawl has gradually made a soiled streak against the plastered wall the mark is cleancut proving that there is no fringe on the shawl now was there ever a case where a middleaged woman wearing a shawl boarded a harlem train without there being a fringe on the shawl to catch in the gate and delay the passengers behind her so we eliminate harlem  therefore i conclude that mrs snyder has not moved very far away on this torn piece of card you see the word left the letter c and the number 12 now i happen to know that no 12 avenue c is a firstclass boarding house far beyond your sisters meansas we suppose but then i find this piece of a theatre programme crumpled into an odd shape what meaning does it convey none to you very likely mr meeks but it is eloquent to one whose habits and training take cognizance of the smallest things  you have told me that your sister was a scrub woman she scrubbed the floors of offices and hallways let us assume that she procured such work to perform in a theatre where is valuable jewellery lost the oftenest mr meeks in the theatres of course look at that piece of programme mr meeks observe the round impression in it it has been wrapped around a ringperhaps a ring of great value mrs snyder found the ring while at work in the theatre she hastily tore off a piece of a programme wrapped the ring carefully and thrust it into her bosom the next day she disposed of it and with her increased means looked about her for a more comfortable place in which to live when i reach thus far in the chain i see nothing impossible about no 12 avenue c it is there we will find your sister mr meeks  shamrock jolnes concluded his convincing speech with the smile of a successful artist meekss admiration was too great for words together they went to no 12 avenue c it was an oldfashioned brownstone house in a prosperous and respectable neighbourhood  they rang the bell and on inquiring were told that no mrs snyder was known there and that not within six months had a new occupant come to the house  when they reached the sidewalk again meeks examined the clues which he had brought away from his sisters old room  i am no detective he remarked to jolnes as he raised the piece of theatre programme to his nose but it seems to me that instead of a ring having been wrapped in this paper it was one of those round peppermint drops and this piece with the address on it looks to me like the end of a seat couponno 12 row c left aisle  shamrock jolnes had a faraway look in his eyes  i think you would do well to consult juggins said he  who is juggins asked meeks  he is the leader said jolnes of a new modern school of detectives their methods are different from ours but it is said that juggins has solved some extremely puzzling cases i will take you to him  they found the greater juggins in his office he was a small man with light hair deeply absorbed in reading one of the bourgeois works of nathaniel hawthorne  the two great detectives of different schools shook hands with ceremony and meeks was introduced  state the facts said juggins going on with his reading  when meeks ceased the greater one closed his book and said  do i understand that your sister is fiftytwo years of age with a large mole on the side of her nose and that she is a very poor widow making a scanty living by scrubbing and with a very homely face and figure  that describes her exactly admitted meeks juggins rose and put on his hat  in fifteen minutes he said i will return bringing you her present address  shamrock jolnes turned pale but forced a smile  within the specified time juggins returned and consulted a little slip of paper held in his hand  your sister mary snyder he announced calmly will be found at no 162 chilton street she is living in the back hall bedroom five flights up the house is only four blocks from here he continued addressing meeks suppose you go and verify the statement and then return here mr jolnes will await you i dare say  meeks hurried away in twenty minutes he was back again with a beaming face  she is there and well he cried name your fee  two dollars said juggins  when meeks had settled his bill and departed shamrock jolnes stood with his hat in his hand before juggins  if it would not be asking too much he stammeredif you would favour me so farwould you object to  certainly not said juggins pleasantly i will tell you how i did it you remember the description of mrs snyder did you ever know a woman like that who wasnt paying weekly instalments on an enlarged crayon portrait of herself the biggest factory of that kind in the country is just around the corner i went there and got her address off the books thats all     iii  witches loaves   miss martha meacham kept the little bakery on the corner the one where you go up three steps and the bell tinkles when you open the door  miss martha was forty her bankbook showed a credit of two thousand dollars and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart many people have married whose chances to do so were much inferior to miss marthas  two or three times a week a customer came in in whom she began to take an interest he was a middleaged man wearing spectacles and a brown beard trimmed to a careful point  he spoke english with a strong german accent his clothes were worn and darned in places and wrinkled and baggy in others but he looked neat and had very good manners  he always bought two loaves of stale bread fresh bread was five cents a loaf stale ones were two for five never did he call for anything but stale bread  once miss martha saw a red and brown stain on his fingers she was sure then that he was an artist and very poor no doubt he lived in a garret where he painted pictures and ate stale bread and thought of the good things to eat in miss marthas bakery  often when miss martha sat down to her chops and light rolls and jam and tea she would sigh and wish that the gentlemannered artist might share her tasty meal instead of eating his dry crust in that draughty attic miss marthas heart as you have been told was a sympathetic one  in order to test her theory as to his occupation she brought from her room one day a painting that she had bought at a sale and set it against the shelves behind the bread counter  it was a venetian scene a splendid marble palazzio so it said on the picture stood in the foregroundor rather forewater for the rest there were gondolas with the lady trailing her hand in the water clouds sky and chiarooscuro in plenty no artist could fail to notice it  two days afterward the customer came in  two loafs of stale bread if you blease  you haf here a fine bicture madame he said while she was wrapping up the bread  yes says miss martha revelling in her own cunning i do so admire art and no it would not do to say artists thus early and paintings she substituted you think it is a good picture  der balance said the customer is not in good drawing der bairspective of it is not true goot morning madame  he took his bread bowed and hurried out  yes he must be an artist miss martha took the picture back to her room  how gentle and kindly his eyes shone behind his spectacles what a broad brow he had to be able to judge perspective at a glanceand to live on stale bread but genius often has to struggle before it is recognized  what a thing it would be for art and perspective if genius were backed by two thousand dollars in bank a bakery and a sympathetic heart to but these were daydreams miss martha  often now when he came he would chat for a while across the showcase he seemed to crave miss marthas cheerful words  he kept on buying stale bread never a cake never a pie never one of her delicious sally lunns  she thought he began to look thinner and discouraged her heart ached to add something good to eat to his meagre purchase but her courage failed at the act she did not dare affront him she knew the pride of artists  miss martha took to wearing her bluedotted silk waist behind the counter in the back room she cooked a mysterious compound of quince seeds and borax ever so many people use it for the complexion  one day the customer came in as usual laid his nickel on the showcase and called for his stale loaves while miss martha was reaching for them there was a great tooting and clanging and a fireengine came lumbering past  the customer hurried to the door to look as any one will suddenly inspired miss martha seized the opportunity  on the bottom shelf behind the counter was a pound of fresh butter that the dairyman had left ten minutes before with a bread knife miss martha made a deep slash in each of the stale loaves inserted a generous quantity of butter and pressed the loaves tight again  when the customer turned once more she was tying the paper around them  when he had gone after an unusually pleasant little chat miss martha smiled to herself but not without a slight fluttering of the heart  had she been too bold would he take offense but surely not there was no language of edibles butter was no emblem of unmaidenly forwardness  for a long time that day her mind dwelt on the subject she imagined the scene when he should discover her little deception  he would lay down his brushes and palette there would stand his easel with the picture he was painting in which the perspective was beyond criticism  he would prepare for his luncheon of dry bread and water he would slice into a loafah  miss martha blushed would he think of the hand that placed it there as he ate would he  the front door bell jangled viciously somebody was coming in making a great deal of noise  miss martha hurried to the front two men were there one was a young man smoking a pipea man she had never seen before the other was her artist  his face was very red his hat was on the back of his head his hair was wildly rumpled he clinched his two fists and shook them ferociously at miss martha at miss martha  dummkopf he shouted with extreme loudness and then tausendonfer or something like it in german  the young man tried to draw him away  i vill not go he said angrily else i shall told her  he made a bass drum of miss marthas counter  you haf shpoilt me he cried his blue eyes blazing behind his spectacles i vill tell you you vas von meddingsome old cat  miss martha leaned weakly against the shelves and laid one hand on her bluedotted silk waist the young man took the other by the collar  come on he said youve said enough he dragged the angry one out at the door to the sidewalk and then came back  guess you ought to be told maam he said what the row is about thats blumberger hes an architectural draftsman i work in the same office with him  hes been working hard for three months drawing a plan for a new city hall it was a prize competition he finished inking the lines yesterday you know a draftsman always makes his drawing in pencil first when its done he rubs out the pencil lines with handfuls of stale bread crumbs thats better than india rubber  blumbergers been buying the bread here well todaywell you know maam that butter isntwell blumbergers plan isnt good for anything now except to cut up into railroad sandwiches  miss martha went into the back room she took off the bluedotted silk waist and put on the old brown serge she used to wear then she poured the quince seed and borax mixture out of the window into the ash can     iv  the pride of the cities   said mr kipling the cities are full of pride challenging each to each even so  new york was empty two hundred thousand of its people were away for the summer three million eight hundred thousand remained as caretakers and to pay the bills of the absentees but the two hundred thousand are an expensive lot  the new yorker sat at a roofgarden table ingesting solace through a straw his panama lay upon a chair the july audience was scattered among vacant seats as widely as outfielders when the champion batter steps to the plate vaudeville happened at intervals the breeze was cool from the bay around and aboveeverywhere except on the stagewere stars glimpses were to be had of waiters always disappearing like startled chamois prudent visitors who had ordered refreshments by phone in the morning were now being served the new yorker was aware of certain drawbacks to his comfort but content beamed softly from his rimless eyeglasses his family was out of town the drinks were warm the ballet was suffering from lack of both tune and talcumbut his family would not return until september  then up into the garden stumbled the man from topaz city nevada the gloom of the solitary sightseer enwrapped him bereft of joy through loneliness he stalked with a widowers face through the halls of pleasure thirst for human companionship possessed him as he panted in the metropolitan draught straight to the new yorkers table he steered  the new yorker disarmed and made reckless by the lawless atmosphere of a roof garden decided upon utter abandonment of his lifes traditions he resolved to shatter with one rash daredevil impulsive hairbrained act the conventions that had hitherto been woven into his existence carrying out this radical and precipitous inspiration he nodded slightly to the stranger as he drew nearer the table  the next moment found the man from topaz city in the list of the new yorkers closest friends he took a chair at the table he gathered two others for his feet he tossed his broadbrimmed hat upon a fourth and told his lifes history to his newfound pard  the new yorker warmed a little as an apartmenthouse furnace warms when the strawberry season begins a waiter who came within hail in an unguarded moment was captured and paroled on an errand to the doctor wiley experimental station the ballet was now in the midst of a musical vagary and danced upon the stage programmed as bolivian peasants clothed in some portions of its anatomy as norwegian fisher maidens in others as ladiesinwaiting of marie antoinette historically denuded in other portions so as to represent sea nymphs and presenting the tout ensemble of a social club of central park west housemaids at a fish fry  been in the city long inquired the new yorker getting ready the exact tip against the waiters coming with large change from the bill  me said the man from topaz city four days never in topaz city was you  i said the new yorker i was never farther west than eighth avenue i had a brother who died on ninth but i met the cortege at eighth there was a bunch of violets on the hearse and the undertaker mentioned the incident to avoid mistake i cannot say that i am familiar with the west  topaz city said the man who occupied four chairs is one of the finest towns in the world  i presume that you have seen the sights of the metropolis said the new yorker four days is not a sufficient length of time in which to view even our most salient points of interest but one can possibly form a general impression our architectural supremacy is what generally strikes visitors to our city most forcibly of course you have seen our flatiron building it is considered  saw it said the man from topaz city but you ought to come out our way its mountainous you know and the ladies all wear short skirts for climbing and  excuse me said the new yorker but that isnt exactly the point new york must be a wonderful revelation to a visitor from the west now as to our hotels  say said the man from topaz city that reminds methere were sixteen stage robbers shot last year within twenty miles of  i was speaking of hotels said the new yorker we lead europe in that respect and as far as our leisure class is concerned we are far  oh i dont know interrupted the man from topaz city there were twelve tramps in our jail when i left home i guess new york isnt so  beg pardon you seem to misapprehend the idea of course you visited the stock exchange and wall street where the  oh yes said the man from topaz city as he lighted a pennsylvania stogie and i want to tell you that weve got the finest town marshal west of the rockies bill rainer he took in five pickpockets out of the crowd when red nose thompson laid the cornerstone of his new saloon topaz city dont allow  have another rhine wine and seltzer suggested the new yorker ive never been west as i said but there cant be any place out there to compare with new york as to the claims of chicago i  one man said the topaziteone man only has been murdered and robbed in topaz city in the last three  oh i know what chicago is interposed the new yorker have you been up fifth avenue to see the magnificent residences of our mil  seen em all you ought to know reub stegall the assessor of topaz when old man tilbury that owns the only twostory house in town tried to swear his taxes from 6000 down to 45075 reub buckled on his fortyfive and went down to see  yes yes but speaking of our great cityone of its greatest features is our superb police department there is no body of men in the world that can equal it for  that waiter gets around like a langley flying machine remarked the man from topaz city thirstily weve got men in our town too worth 400000 theres old bill withers and colonel metcalf and  have you seen broadway at night asked the new yorker courteously there are few streets in the world that can compare with it when the electrics are shining and the pavements are alive with two hurrying streams of elegantly clothed men and beautiful women attired in the costliest costumes that wind in and out in a close maze of expensively  never knew but one case in topaz city said the man from the west jim bailey our mayor had his watch and chain and 235 in cash taken from his pocket while  thats another matter said the new yorker while you are in our city you should avail yourself of every opportunity to see its wonders our rapid transit system  if you was out in topaz broke in the man from there i could show you a whole cemetery full of people that got killed accidentally talking about mangling folks up why when berry rogers turned loose that old doublebarrelled shotgun of his loaded with slugs at anybody  here waiter called the new yorker two more of the same it is acknowledged by every one that our city is the centre of art and literature and learning take for instance our afterdinner speakers where else in the country would you find such wit and eloquence as emanate from depew and ford and  if you take the papers interrupted the westerner you must have read of pete websters daughter the websters live two blocks north of the courthouse in topaz city miss tillie webster she slept forty days and nights without waking up the doctors said that  pass the matches please said the new yorker have you observed the expedition with which new buildings are being run up in new york improved inventions in steel framework and  i noticed said the nevadian that the statistics of topaz city showed only one carpenter crushed by falling timbers last year and he was caught in a cyclone  they abuse our sky line continued the new yorker and it is likely that we are not yet artistic in the construction of our buildings but i can safely assert that we lead in pictorial and decorative art in some of our houses can be found masterpieces in the way of paintings and sculpture one who has the entree to our best galleries will find  back up exclaimed the man from topaz city there was a game last month in our town in which 90000 changed hands on a pair of  taromttara went the orchestra the stage curtain blushing pink at the name asbestos inscribed upon it came down with a slow midsummer movement the audience trickled leisurely down the elevator and stairs  on the sidewalk below the new yorker and the man from topaz city shook hands with alcoholic gravity the elevated crashed raucously surface cars hummed and clanged cabmen swore newsboys shrieked wheels clattered earpiercingly the new yorker conceived a happy thought with which he aspired to clinch the preeminence of his city  you must admit said he that in the way of noise new york is far ahead of any other  back to the everglades said the man from topaz city in 1900 when sousas band and the repeating candidate were in our town you couldnt  the rattle of an express wagon drowned the rest of the words     v  holding up a train      note the man who told me these things was for several years    an outlaw in the southwest and a follower of the pursuit he    so frankly describes his description of the modus operandi    should prove interesting his counsel of value to the    potential passenger in some future holdup while his    estimate of the pleasures of train robbing will hardly induce    any one to adopt it as a profession i give the story in    almost exactly his own words                                                          o h   most people would say if their opinion was asked for that holding up a train would be a hard job well it isnt its easy i have contributed some to the uneasiness of railroads and the insomnia of express companies and the most trouble i ever had about a holdup was in being swindled by unscrupulous people while spending the money i got the danger wasnt anything to speak of and we didnt mind the trouble  one man has come pretty near robbing a train by himself two have succeeded a few times three can do it if they are hustlers but five is about the right number the time to do it and the place depend upon several things  the first stickup i was ever in happened in 1890 maybe the way i got into it will explain how most train robbers start in the business five out of six western outlaws are just cowboys out of a job and gone wrong the sixth is a tough from the east who dresses up like a bad man and plays some lowdown trick that gives the boys a bad name wire fences and nesters made five of them a bad heart made the sixth  jim s and i were working on the 101 ranch in colorado the nesters had the cowman on the go they had taken up the land and elected officers who were hard to get along with jim and i rode into la junta one day going south from a roundup we were having a little fun without malice toward anybody when a farmer administration cut in and tried to harvest us jim shot a deputy marshal and i kind of corroborated his side of the argument we skirmished up and down the main street the boomers having bad luck all the time after a while we leaned forward and shoved for the ranch down on the ceriso we were riding a couple of horses that couldnt fly but they could catch birds  a few days after that a gang of the la junta boomers came to the ranch and wanted us to go back with them naturally we declined we had the house on them and before we were done refusing that old dobe was plumb full of lead when dark came we fagged em a batch of bullets and shoved out the back door for the rocks they sure smoked us as we went we had to drift which we did and rounded up down in oklahoma  well there wasnt anything we could get there and being mighty hard up we decided to transact a little business with the railroads jim and i joined forces with tom and ike mooretwo brothers who had plenty of sand they were willing to convert into dust i can call their names for both of them are dead tom was shot while robbing a bank in arkansas ike was killed during the more dangerous pastime of attending a dance in the creek nation  we selected a place on the santa fé where there was a bridge across a deep creek surrounded by heavy timber all passenger trains took water at the tank close to one end of the bridge it was a quiet place the nearest house being five miles away the day before it happened we rested our horses and made medicine as to how we should get about it our plans were not at all elaborate as none of us had ever engaged in a holdup before  the santa fé flyer was due at the tank at 1115 p m at eleven tom and i lay down on one side of the track and jim and ike took the other as the train rolled up the headlight flashing far down the track and the steam hissing from the engine i turned weak all over i would have worked a whole year on the ranch for nothing to have been out of that affair right then some of the nerviest men in the business have told me that they felt the same way the first time  the engine had hardly stopped when i jumped on the runningboard on one side while jim mounted the other as soon as the engineer and fireman saw our guns they threw up their hands without being told and begged us not to shoot saying they would do anything we wanted them to  hit the ground i ordered and they both jumped off we drove them before us down the side of the train while this was happening tom and ike had been blazing away one on each side of the train yelling like apaches so as to keep the passengers herded in the cars some fellow stuck a little twentytwo calibre out one of the coach windows and fired it straight up in the air i let drive and smashed the glass just over his head that settled everything like resistance from that direction  by this time all my nervousness was gone i felt a kind of pleasant excitement as if i were at a dance or a frolic of some sort the lights were all out in the coaches and as tom and ike gradually quit firing and yelling it got to be almost as still as a graveyard i remember hearing a little bird chirping in a bush at the side of the track as if it were complaining at being waked up  i made the fireman get a lantern and then i went to the express car and yelled to the messenger to open up or get perforated he slid the door back and stood in it with his hands up jump overboard son i said and he hit the dirt like a lump of lead there were two safes in the cara big one and a little one by the way i first located the messengers arsenala doublebarrelled shotgun with buckshot cartridges and a thirtyeight in a drawer i drew the cartridges from the shotgun pocketed the pistol and called the messenger inside i shoved my gun against his nose and put him to work he couldnt open the big safe but he did the little one there was only nine hundred dollars in it that was mighty small winnings for our trouble so we decided to go through the passengers we took our prisoners to the smokingcar and from there sent the engineer through the train to light up the coaches beginning with the first one we placed a man at each door and ordered the passengers to stand between the seats with their hands up  if you want to find out what cowards the majority of men are all you have to do is rob a passenger train i dont mean because they dont resistill tell you later on why they cant do thatbut it makes a man feel sorry for them the way they lose their heads big burly drummers and farmers and exsoldiers and highcollared dudes and sports that a few moments before were filling the car with noise and bragging get so scared that their ears flop  there were very few people in the day coaches at that time of night so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper the pullman conductor met me at one door while jim was going round to the other one he very politely informed me that i could not go into that car as it did not belong to the railroad company and besides the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and firing never in all my life have i met with a finer instance of official dignity and reliance upon the power of mr pullmans great name i jabbed my sixshooter so hard against mr conductors front that i afterward found one of his vest buttons so firmly wedged in the end of the barrel that i had to shoot it out he just shut up like a weakspringed knife and rolled down the car steps  i opened the door of the sleeper and stepped inside a big fat old man came wabbling up to me puffing and blowing he had one coatsleeve on and was trying to put his vest on over that i dont know who he thought i was  young man young man says he you must keep cool and not get excited above everything keep cool  i cant says i excitements just eating me up and then i let out a yell and turned loose my fortyfive through the skylight  that old man tried to dive into one of the lower berths but a screech came out of it and a bare foot that took him in the breadbasket and landed him on the floor i saw jim coming in the other door and i hollered for everybody to climb out and line up  they commenced to scramble down and for a while we had a threeringed circus the men looked as frightened and tame as a lot of rabbits in a deep snow they had on on an average about a quarter of a suit of clothes and one shoe apiece one chap was sitting on the floor of the aisle looking as if he were working a hard sum in arithmetic he was trying very solemn to pull a ladys number two shoe on his number nine foot  the ladies didnt stop to dress they were so curious to see a real live train robber bless em that they just wrapped blankets and sheets around themselves and came out squeaky and fidgety looking they always show more curiosity and sand than the men do  we got them all lined up and pretty quiet and i went through the bunch i found very little on themi mean in the way of valuables one man in the line was a sight he was one of those big overgrown solemn snoozers that sit on the platform at lectures and look wise before crawling out he had managed to put on his long frocktailed coat and his high silk hat the rest of him was nothing but pajamas and bunions when i dug into that prince albert i expected to drag out at least a block of gold mine stock or an armful of government bonds but all i found was a little boys french harp about four inches long what it was there for i dont know i felt a little mad because he had fooled me so i stuck the harp up against his mouth  if you cant payplay i says  i cant play says he  then learn right off quick says i letting him smell the end of my gunbarrel  he caught hold of the harp turned red as a beet and commenced to blow he blew a dinky little tune i remembered hearing when i was a kid      prettiest little gal in the countryoh    mammy and daddy told me so   i made him keep on playing it all the time we were in the car now and then hed get weak and off the key and id turn my gun on him and ask what was the matter with that little gal and whether he had any intention of going back on her which would make him start up again like sixty i think that old boy standing there in his silk hat and bare feet playing his little french harp was the funniest sight i ever saw one little redheaded woman in the line broke out laughing at him you could have heard her in the next car  then jim held them steady while i searched the berths i grappled around in those beds and filled a pillowcase with the strangest assortment of stuff you ever saw now and then id come across a little popgun pistol just about right for plugging teeth with which id throw out the window when i finished with the collection i dumped the pillowcase load in the middle of the aisle there were a good many watches bracelets rings and pocketbooks with a sprinkling of false teeth whiskey flasks facepowder boxes chocolate caramels and heads of hair of various colours and lengths there were also about a dozen ladies stockings into which jewellery watches and rolls of bills had been stuffed and then wadded up tight and stuck under the mattresses i offered to return what i called the scalps saying that we were not indians on the warpath but none of the ladies seemed to know to whom the hair belonged  one of the womenand a goodlooker she waswrapped in a striped blanket saw me pick up one of the stockings that was pretty chunky and heavy about the toe and she snapped out  thats mine sir youre not in the business of robbing women are you  now as this was our first holdup we hadnt agreed upon any code of ethics so i hardly knew what to answer but anyway i replied well not as a specialty if this contains your personal property you can have it back  it just does she declared eagerly and reached out her hand for it  youll excuse my taking a look at the contents i said holding the stocking up by the toe out dumped a big gents gold watch worth two hundred a gents leather pocketbook that we afterward found to contain six hundred dollars a 32calibre revolver and the only thing of the lot that could have been a ladys personal property was a silver bracelet worth about fifty cents  i said madame heres your property and handed her the bracelet now i went on how can you expect us to act square with you when you try to deceive us in this manner im surprised at such conduct  the young woman flushed up as if she had been caught doing something dishonest some other woman down the line called out the mean thing i never knew whether she meant the other lady or me  when we finished our job we ordered everybody back to bed told em good night very politely at the door and left we rode forty miles before daylight and then divided the stuff each one of us got 175285 in money we lumped the jewellery around then we scattered each man for himself  that was my first train robbery and it was about as easily done as any of the ones that followed but that was the last and only time i ever went through the passengers i dont like that part of the business afterward i stuck strictly to the express car during the next eight years i handled a good deal of money  the best haul i made was just seven years after the first one we found out about a train that was going to bring out a lot of money to pay off the soldiers at a government post we stuck that train up in broad daylight five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough we didnt even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun we had no trouble at all in getting the money which was all in gold of course a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery it was government stuff and the government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for the only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime i dont know what the government thought about the excuse but i know that it was a good one the surprisethat is the keynote of the trainrobbing business the papers published all kinds of stories about the loss finally agreeing that it was between nine thousand and ten thousand dollars the government sawed wood here are the correct figures printed for the first timefortyeight thousand dollars if anybody will take the trouble to look over uncle sams private accounts for that little debit to profit and loss he will find that i am right to a cent  by that time we were expert enough to know what to do we rode due west twenty miles making a trail that a broadway policeman could have followed and then we doubled back hiding our tracks on the second night after the holdup while posses were scouring the country in every direction jim and i were eating supper in the second story of a friends house in the town where the alarm started from our friend pointed out to us in an office across the street a printing press at work striking off handbills offering a reward for our capture  i have been asked what we do with the money we get well i never could account for a tenth part of it after it was spent it goes fast and freely an outlaw has to have a good many friends a highly respected citizen may and often does get along with very few but a man on the dodge has got to have sidekickers with angry posses and rewardhungry officers cutting out a hot trail for him he must have a few places scattered about the country where he can stop and feed himself and his horse and get a few hours sleep without having to keep both eyes open when he makes a haul he feels like dropping some of the coin with these friends and he does it liberally sometimes i have at the end of a hasty visit at one of these havens of refuge flung a handful of gold and bills into the laps of the kids playing on the floor without knowing whether my contribution was a hundred dollars or a thousand  when oldtimers make a big haul they generally go far away to one of the big cities to spend their money green hands however successful a holdup they make nearly always give themselves away by showing too much money near the place where they got it  i was in a job in 94 where we got twenty thousand dollars we followed our favourite plan for a getawaythat is doubled on our trailand laid low for a time near the scene of the trains bad luck one morning i picked up a newspaper and read an article with big headlines stating that the marshal with eight deputies and a posse of thirty armed citizens had the train robbers surrounded in a mesquite thicket on the cimarron and that it was a question of only a few hours when they would be dead men or prisoners while i was reading that article i was sitting at breakfast in one of the most elegant private residences in washington city with a flunky in knee pants standing behind my chair jim was sitting across the table talking to his halfuncle a retired naval officer whose name you have often seen in the accounts of doings in the capital we had gone there and bought rattling outfits of good clothes and were resting from our labours among the nabobs we must have been killed in that mesquite thicket for i can make an affidavit that we didnt surrender  now i propose to tell why it is easy to hold up a train and then why no one should ever do it  in the first place the attacking party has all the advantage that is of course supposing that they are oldtimers with the necessary experience and courage they have the outside and are protected by the darkness while the others are in the light hemmed into a small space and exposed the moment they show a head at a window or door to the aim of a man who is a dead shot and who wont hesitate to shoot  but in my opinion the main condition that makes train robbing easy is the element of surprise in connection with the imagination of the passengers if you have ever seen a horse that has eaten loco weed you will understand what i mean when i say that the passengers get locoed that horse gets the awfullest imagination on him in the world you cant coax him to cross a little branch stream two feet wide it looks as big to him as the mississippi river thats just the way with the passenger he thinks there are a hundred men yelling and shooting outside when maybe there are only two or three and the muzzle of a fortyfive looks like the entrance to a tunnel the passenger is all right although he may do mean little tricks like hiding a wad of money in his shoe and forgetting to digup until you jostle his ribs some with the end of your sixshooter but theres no harm in him  as to the train crew we never had any more trouble with them than if they had been so many sheep i dont mean that they are cowards i mean that they have got sense they know theyre not up against a bluff its the same way with the officers ive seen secret service men marshals and railroad detectives fork over their change as meek as moses i saw one of the bravest marshals i ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while i was taking toll he wasnt afraid he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit besides many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtnt to take chances whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train he expects to get killed some day and he generally does my advice to you if you should ever be in a holdup is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed the officers lose money if the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against john doe et al and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives and the government foots the bills so with them it is a question of mileage rather than courage  i will give one instance to support my statement that the surprise is the best card in playing for a holdup  along in 92 the daltons were cutting out a hot trail for the officers down in the cherokee nation those were their lucky days and they got so reckless and sandy that they used to announce before hand what job they were going to undertake once they gave it out that they were going to hold up the m k  t flyer on a certain night at the station of pryor creek in indian territory  that night the railroad company got fifteen deputy marshals in muscogee and put them on the train beside them they had fifty armed men hid in the depot at pryor creek  when the katy flyer pulled in not a dalton showed up the next station was adair six miles away when the train reached there and the deputies were having a good time explaining what they would have done to the dalton gang if they had turned up all at once it sounded like an army firing outside the conductor and brakeman came running into the car yelling train robbers  some of those deputies lit out of the door hit the ground and kept on running some of them hid their winchesters under the seats two of them made a fight and were both killed  it took the daltons just ten minutes to capture the train and whip the escort in twenty minutes more they robbed the express car of twentyseven thousand dollars and made a clean getaway  my opinion is that those deputies would have put up a stiff fight at pryor creek where they were expecting trouble but they were taken by surprise and locoed at adair just as the daltons who knew their business expected they would  i dont think i ought to close without giving some deductions from my experience of eight years on the dodge it doesnt pay to rob trains leaving out the question of right and morals which i dont think i ought to tackle there is very little to envy in the life of an outlaw after a while money ceases to have any value in his eyes he gets to looking upon the railroads and express companies as his bankers and his sixshooter as a cheque book good for any amount he throws away money right and left most of the time he is on the jump riding day and night and he lives so hard between times that he doesnt enjoy the taste of high life when he gets it he knows that his time is bound to come to lose his life or liberty and that the accuracy of his aim the speed of his horse and the fidelity of his sider are all that postpone the inevitable  it isnt that he loses any sleep over danger from the officers of the law in all my experience i never knew officers to attack a band of outlaws unless they outnumbered them at least three to one  but the outlaw carries one thought constantly in his mindand that is what makes him so sore against life more than anything elsehe knows where the marshals get their recruits of deputies he knows that the majority of these upholders of the law were once lawbreakers horse thieves rustlers highwaymen and outlaws like himself and that they gained their positions and immunity by turning states evidence by turning traitor and delivering up their comrades to imprisonment and death he knows that some dayunless he is shot firsthis judas will set to work the trap will be laid and he will be the surprised instead of a surpriser at a stickup  that is why the man who holds up trains picks his company with a thousand times the care with which a careful girl chooses a sweetheart that is why he raises himself from his blanket of nights and listens to the tread of every horses hoofs on the distant road that is why he broods suspiciously for days upon a jesting remark or an unusual movement of a tried comrade or the broken mutterings of his closest friend sleeping by his side  and it is one of the reasons why the trainrobbing profession is not so pleasant a one as either of its collateral branchespolitics or cornering the market     vi  ulysses and the dogman   do you know the time of the dogmen  when the forefinger of twilight begins to smudge the cleardrawn lines of the big city there is inaugurated an hour devoted to one of the most melancholy sights of urban life  out from the towering flat crags and apartment peaks of the cliff dwellers of new york steals an army of beings that were once men even yet they go upright upon two limbs and retain human form and speech but you will observe that they are behind animals in progress each of these beings follows a dog to which he is fastened by an artificial ligament  these men are all victims to circe not willingly do they become flunkeys to fido bell boys to bull terriers and toddlers after towzer modern circe instead of turning them into animals has kindly left the difference of a sixfoot leash between them every one of those dogmen has been either cajoled bribed or commanded by his own particular circe to take the dear household pet out for an airing  by their faces and manner you can tell that the dogmen are bound in a hopeless enchantment never will there come even a dogcatcher ulysses to remove the spell  the faces of some are stonily set they are past the commiseration the curiosity or the jeers of their fellowbeings years of matrimony of continuous compulsory canine constitutionals have made them callous they unwind their beasts from lamp posts or the ensnared legs of profane pedestrians with the stolidity of mandarins manipulating the strings of their kites  others more recently reduced to the ranks of rovers retinue take their medicine sulkily and fiercely they play the dog on the end of their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a searobin on her hook they glare at you threateningly if you look at them as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war these are halfmutinous dogmen not quite circeized and you will do well not to kick their charges should they sniff around your ankles  others of the tribe do not seem to feel so keenly they are mostly unfresh youths with gold caps and drooping cigarettes who do not harmonize with their dogs the animals they attend wear satin bows in their collars and the young men steer them so assiduously that you are tempted to the theory that some personal advantage contingent upon satisfactory service waits upon the execution of their duties  the dogs thus personally conducted are of many varieties but they are one in fatness in pampered diseased vileness of temper in insolent snarling capriciousness of behaviour they tug at the leash fractiously they make leisurely nasal inventory of every door step railing and post they sit down to rest when they choose they wheeze like the winner of a third avenue beefsteakeating contest they blunder clumsily into open cellars and coal holes they lead the dogmen a merry dance  these unfortunate dry nurses of dogdom the cur cuddlers mongrel managers spitz stalkers poodle pullers skye scrapers dachshund dandlers terrier trailers and pomeranian pushers of the cliffdwelling circes follow their charges meekly the doggies neither fear nor respect them masters of the house these men whom they hold in leash may be but they are not masters of them from cosey corner to fire escape from divan to dumbwaiter doggys snarl easily drives this twolegged being who is commissioned to walk at the other end of his string during his outing  one twilight the dogmen came forth as usual at their circes pleading guerdon or crack of the whip one among them was a strong man apparently of too solid virtues for this airy vocation his expression was melancholic his manner depressed he was leashed to a vile white dog loathsomely fat fiendishly illnatured gloatingly intractable toward his despised conductor  at a corner nearest to his apartment house the dogman turned down a side street hoping for fewer witnesses to his ignominy the surfeited beast waddled before him panting with spleen and the labour of motion  suddenly the dog stopped a tall brown longcoated widebrimmed man stood like a colossus blocking the sidewalk and declaring  well im a son of a gun  jim berry breathed the dogman with exclamation points in his voice  sam telfair cried widebrim again you dingbasted old willywalloo give us your hoof  their hands clasped in the brief tight greeting of the west that is death to the handshake microbe  you old fat rascal continued widebrim with a wrinkled brown smile its been five years since i seen you i been in this town a week but you cant find nobody in such a place well you dinged old married man how are they coming

throwed your lasso over are you the poundmaster of this burg do you call that a dog or what  i need a drink said the dogman dejected at the reminder of his old dog of the sea come on  hard by was a café tis ever so in the big city  they sat at a table and the bloated monster yelped and scrambled at the end of his leash to get at the café cat  whiskey said jim to the waiter  make it two said the

if youre going to be in the city for awhile we will  no siree im starting for home this evening on the 725 like to stay longer but i cant  ill walk down to the ferry with you said the dogman  the dog had bound a leg each of jim and the chair together and had sunk into a comatose slumber jim stumbled and the leash was slightly wrenched the shrieks of the awakened beast rang for a block around  if thats your dog said jim when they were on the street again whats to hinder you from running that habeas corpus youve got around his neck over a limb and walking off and forgetting him  id never dare to said the dogman awed at the bold proposition he sleeps in the bed i sleep on a lounge he runs howling to marcella if i look at him some night jim im going to get even with that dog ive made up my mind to do it im going to creep over with a knife and cut a hole in his mosquito bar so they can get in to him see if i dont do it  you aint yourself sam telfair you aint what you was once i dont know

wildest steer on little powder in 39 12  i did didnt i said the other with a temporary gleam in his eye but that was before i was dogmatized  does misses telfair began jim  hush said the dogman heres another café  they lined up at the bar the dog fell asleep at their feet  whiskey said jim  make it two said the dogman  i thought about you said jim when i bought that wild land i wished you was out there to help me with the stock  last tuesday said the dogman he bit me on the ankle because i asked for cream in my coffee he always gets the cream  youd like prairie view now said jim the boys from the roundups for fifty miles around ride in there one corner of my pasture is in sixteen miles of the town theres a straight forty miles of wire on one side of it  you pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom said the dogman and you pass through the parlour to get to the bath room and you back out through the diningroom to get into the bedroom so you can turn around and leave by the kitchen and he snores and barks in his sleep and i have to smoke in the park on account of his asthma  dont missis telfair began jim  oh shut up said the dogman what is it this time  whiskey said jim  make it two said the dogman  well ill be racking along down toward the ferry said the other  come on there you mangy turtlebacked snakeheaded benchlegged tonandahalf of soapgrease shouted the dogman with a new note in his voice and a new hand on the leash the dog scrambled after them with an angry whine at such unusual language from his guardian  at the foot of twentythird street the dogman led the way through swinging doors  last chance said he speak up  whiskey said jim  make it two said the dogman  i dont know said the ranchman where ill find the man i want to take charge of the little powder outfit i want somebody i know something about finest stretch of prairie and timber you ever squinted your eye over sam now if you was  speaking of hydrophobia said the dogman the other night he chewed a piece out of my leg because i knocked a fly off of marcellas arm it ought to be cauterized says marcella and i was thinking so myself i telephones for the doctor and when he comes marcella says to me help me hold the poor dear while the doctor fixes his mouth oh i hope he got no virus on any of his toofies when he bit you now what do you think of that  does missis telfair began jim  oh drop it said the dogman come again  whiskey said jim  make it two said the dogman  they walked on to the ferry the ranchman stepped to the ticket window  suddenly the swift landing of three or four heavy kicks was heard the air was rent by piercing canine shrieks and a pained outraged lubberly bowlegged pudding of a dog ran frenziedly up the street alone  ticket to denver said jim  make it two shouted the exdogman reaching for his inside pocket     vii  the champion of the weather   if you should speak of the kiowa reservation to the average new yorker he probably wouldnt know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at albany or a leitmotif from parsifal but out in the kiowa reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of new york  a party of us were on a hunting trip in the reservation bud kingsbury our guide philosopher and friend was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night one of the party a pinkishhaired young man in a correct hunting costume sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette and remarked carelessly to bud  nice night  why yes said bud as nice as any night could be that aint received the broadway stamp of approval  now the young man was from new york but the rest of us wondered how bud guessed it so when the steaks were done we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination and as bud was something of a territorial talking machine he made oration as follows  how did i know he was from new york well i figured it out as soon as he sprung them two words on me i was in new york myself a couple of years ago and i noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the rancho manhattan  found new york rather different from the panhandle didnt you bud asked one of the hunters  cant say that i did answered bud anyways not more than some the main trail in that town which they call broadway is plenty travelled but theyre about the same brand of bipeds that tramp around in cheyenne and amarillo at first i was sort of rattled by the crowds but i soon says to myself here now bud theyre just plain folks like you and geronimo and grover cleveland and the watson boys so dont get all flustered up with consternation under your saddle blanket and then i feels calm and peaceful like i was back in the nation again at a ghost dance or a green corn powwow  id been saving up for a year to give this new york a whirl i knew a man named summers that lived there but i couldnt find him so i played a lone hand at enjoying the intoxicating pleasures of the cornfed metropolis  for a while i was so frivolous and locoed by the electric lights and the noises of the phonographs and the secondstory railroads that i forgot one of the crying needs of my western system of natural requirements i never was no hand to deny myself the pleasures of sociable vocal intercourse with friends and strangers out in the territories when i meet a man i never saw before inside of nine minutes i know his income religion size of collar and his wifes temper and how much he pays for clothes alimony and chewing tobacco its a gift with me not to be penurious with my conversation  but this here new york was inaugurated on the idea of abstemiousness in regard to the parts of speech at the end of three weeks nobody in the city had fired even a blank syllable in my direction except the waiter in the grub emporium where i fed and as his outpourings of syntax wasnt nothing but plagiarisms from the bill of fare he never satisfied my yearnings which was to have somebody hit if i stood next to a man at a bar hed edge off and give a baldwinziegler look as if he suspected me of having the north pole concealed on my person i began to wish that id gone to abilene or waco for my paseado for the mayor of them places will drink with you and the first citizen you meet will tell you his middle name and ask you to take a chance in a raffle for a music box  well one day when i was particular hankering for to be gregarious with something more loquacious than a lamp post a fellow in a caffy says to me says he  nice day  he was a kind of a manager of the place and i reckon hed seen me in there a good many times he had a face like a fish and an eye like judas but i got up and put one arm around his neck  pardner i says sure its a nice day youre the first gentleman in all new york to observe that the intricacies of human speech might not be altogether wasted on william kingsbury but dont you think says i that twas a little cool early in the morning and aint there a feeling of rain in the air tonight but along about noon it sure was gallupsious weather hows all up to the house you doing right well with the caffy now  well sir that galoot just turns his back and walks off stiff without a word after all my trying to be agreeable i didnt know what to make of it that night i finds a note from summers whod been away from town giving the address of his camp i goes up to his house and has a good oldtime talk with his folks and i tells summers about the actions of this coyote in the caffy and desires interpretation  oh says summers he wasnt intending to strike up a conversation with you thats just the new york style hed seen you was a regular customer and he spoke a word or two just to show you he appreciated your custom you oughtnt to have followed it up thats about as far as we care to go with a stranger a word or so about the weather may be ventured but we dont generally make it the basis of an acquaintance  billy says i the weather and its ramifications is a solemn subject with me meteorology is one of my sore points no man can open up the question of temperature or humidity or the glad sunshine with me and then turn tail on it without its leading to a falling barometer im going down to see that man again and give him a lesson in the art of continuous conversation you say new york etiquette allows him two words and no answer well hes going to turn himself into a weather bureau and finish what he begun with me besides indulging in neighbourly remarks on other subjects  summers talked agin it but i was irritated some and i went on the street car back to that caffy  the same fellow was there yet walking round in a sort of back corral where there was tables and chairs a few people was sitting around having drinks and sneering at one another  i called that man to one side and herded him into a corner i unbuttoned enough to show him a thirtyeight i carried stuck under my vest  pardner i says a brief space ago i was in here and you seized the opportunity to say it was a nice day when i attempted to corroborate your weather signal you turned your back and walked off now says i you froghearted languageshy stiffnecked cross between a spitzbergen sea cook and a muzzled oyster you resume where you left off in your discourse on the weather  the fellow looks at me and tries to grin but he sees i dont and he comes around serious  well says he eyeing the handle of my gun it was rather a nice day some warmish though  particulars you mealymouthed snoozer i sayslets have the specificationsexpatiatefill in the outlines when you start anything with me in shorthand its bound to turn out a storm signal  looked like rain yesterday says the man but it cleared off fine in the forenoon i hear the farmers are needing rain right badly upstate  thats the kind of a canter says i shake the new york dust off your hoofs and be a real agreeable kind of a centaur you broke the ice you know and were getting better acquainted every minute seems to me i asked you about your family  theyre all well thanks says he wewe have a new piano  now youre coming it i says this cold reserve is breaking up at last that little touch about the piano almost makes us brothers whats the youngest kids name i asks him  thomas says he hes just getting well from the measles  i feel like id known you always says i now there was just one moreare you doing right well with the caffy now  pretty well he says im putting away a little money  glad to hear it says i now go back to your work and get civilized keep your hands off the weather unless youre ready to follow it up in a personal manner its a subject that naturally belongs to sociability and the forming of new ties and i hate to see it handed out in small change in a town like this  so the next day i rolls up my blankets and hits the trail away from new york city  for many minutes after bud ceased talking we lingered around the fire and then all hands began to disperse for bed  as i was unrolling my bedding i heard the pinkishhaired young man saying to bud with something like anxiety in his voice  as i say mr kingsbury there is something really beautiful about this night the delightful breeze and the bright stars and the clear air unite in making it wonderfully attractive  yes said bud its a nice night     viii  makes the whole world kin   the burglar stepped inside the window quickly and then he took his time a burglar who respects his art always takes his time before taking anything else  the house was a private residence by its boarded front door and untrimmed boston ivy the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap that no one had ever understood her sensitive lonely heart he knew by the light in the thirdstory front windows and by the lateness of the season that the master of the house had come home and would soon extinguish his light and retire for it was september of the year and of the soul in which season the houses good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies  the burglar lighted a cigarette the guarded glow of the match illuminated his salient points for a moment he belonged to the third type of burglars  this third type has not yet been recognized and accepted the police have made us familiar with the first and second their classification is simple the collar is the distinguishing mark  when a burglar is caught who does not wear a collar he is described as a degenerate of the lowest type singularly vicious and depraved and is suspected of being the desperate criminal who stole the handcuffs out of patrolman hennessys pocket in 1878 and walked away to escape arrest  the other wellknown type is the burglar who wears a collar he is always referred to as a raffles in real life he is invariably a gentleman by daylight breakfasting in a dress suit and posing as a paperhanger while after dark he plies his nefarious occupation of burglary his mother is an extremely wealthy and respected resident of ocean grove and when he is conducted to his cell he asks at once for a nail file and the police gazette he always has a wife in every state in the union and fiancées in all the territories and the newspapers print his matrimonial gallery out of their stock of cuts of the ladies who were cured by only one bottle after having been given up by five doctors experiencing great relief after the first dose  the burglar wore a blue sweater he was neither a raffles nor one of the chefs from hells kitchen the police would have been baffled had they attempted to classify him they have not yet heard of the respectable unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station  this burglar of the third class began to prowl he wore no masks dark lanterns or gum shoes he carried a 38calibre revolver in his pocket and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully  the furniture of the house was swathed in its summer dust protectors the silver was far away in safedeposit vaults the burglar expected no remarkable haul his objective point was that dimly lighted room where the master of the house should be sleeping heavily after whatever solace he had sought to lighten the burden of his loneliness a touch might be made there to the extent of legitimate fair professional profitsloose money a watch a jewelled stickpinnothing exorbitant or beyond reason he had seen the window left open and had taken the chance  the burglar softly opened the door of the lighted room the gas was turned low a man lay in the bed asleep on the dresser lay many things in confusiona crumpled roll of bills a watch keys three poker chips crushed cigars a pink silk hair bow and an unopened bottle of bromoseltzer for a bulwark in the morning  the burglar took three steps toward the dresser the man in the bed suddenly uttered a squeaky groan and opened his eyes his right hand slid under his pillow but remained there  lay still said the burglar in conversational tone burglars of the third type do not hiss the citizen in the bed looked at the round end of the burglars pistol and lay still  now hold up both your hands commanded the burglar  the citizen had a little pointed brownandgray beard like that of a painless dentist he looked solid esteemed irritable and disgusted he sat up in bed and raised his right hand above his head  up with the other one ordered the burglar you might be amphibious and shoot with your left you can count two cant you hurry up now  cant raise the other one said the citizen with a contortion of his lineaments  whats the matter with it  rheumatism in the shoulder  inflammatory  was the inflammation has gone down the burglar stood for a moment or two holding his gun on the afflicted one he glanced at the plunder on the dresser and then with a halfembarrassed air back at the man in the bed then he too made a sudden grimace  dont stand there making faces snapped the citizen badhumouredly if youve come to burgle why dont you do it theres some stuff lying around  scuse me said the burglar with a grin but it just socked me one too its good for you that rheumatism and me happens to be old pals i got it in my left arm too most anybody but me would have popped you when you wouldnt hoist that left claw of yours  how long have you had it inquired the citizen  four years i guess that aint all once youve got it its you for a rheumatic lifethats my judgment  ever try rattlesnake oil asked the citizen interestedly  gallons said the burglar if all the snakes ive used the oil of was strung out in a row theyd reach eight times as far as saturn and the rattles could be heard at valparaiso indiana and back  some use chiselums pills remarked the citizen  fudge said the burglar took em five months no good i had some relief the year i tried finkelhams extract balm of gilead poultices and pottss pain pulverizer but i think it was the buckeye i carried in my pocket what done the trick  is yours worse in the morning or at night asked the citizen  night said the burglar just when im busiest say take down that arm of yoursi guess you wontsay did you ever try blickerstaffs blood builder  i never did does yours come in paroxysms or is it a steady pain  the burglar sat down on the foot of the bed and rested his gun on his crossed knee  it jumps said he it strikes me when i aint looking for it i had to give up secondstory work because i got stuck sometimes halfway up tell you whati dont believe the bloomin doctors know what is good for it  same here ive spent a thousand dollars without getting any relief yours swell any  of mornings and when its goin to raingreat christopher  me too said the citizen i can tell when a streak of humidity the size of a tablecloth starts from florida on its way to new york and if i pass a theatre where theres an east lynne matinee going on the moisture starts my left arm jumping like a toothache  its undilutedhades said the burglar  youre dead right said the citizen  the burglar looked down at his pistol and thrust it into his pocket with an awkward attempt at ease  say old man he said constrainedly ever try opodeldoc  slop said the citizen angrily might as well rub on restaurant butter  sure concurred the burglar its a salve suitable for little minnie when the kitty scratches her finger ill tell you what were up against it i only find one thing that eases her up hey little old sanitary ameliorating lestweforget booze saythis jobs offscuse meget on your clothes and lets go out and have some scuse the liberty butouch there she goes again  for a week said the citizen i havent been able to dress myself without help im afraid thomas is in bed and  climb out said the burglar ill help you get into your duds  the conventional returned as a tidal wave and flooded the citizen he stroked his brownandgray beard  its very unusual he began  heres your shirt said the burglar fall out i knew a man who said omberrys ointment fixed him in two weeks so he could use both hands in tying his fourinhand  as they were going out the door the citizen turned and started back  liked to forgot my money he explained laid it on the dresser last night  the burglar caught him by the right sleeve  come on he said bluffly i ask you leave it alone ive got the price ever try witch hazel and oil of wintergreen     ix  at arms with morpheus   i never could quite understand how tom hopkins came to make that blunder for he had been through a whole term at a medical collegebefore he inherited his aunts fortuneand had been considered strong in therapeutics  we had been making a call together that evening and afterward tom ran up to my rooms for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments i had stepped into the other room for a moment when i heard tom sing out  oh billy im going to take about four grains of quinine if you dont mind im feeling all blue and shivery guess im taking cold  all right i called back the bottle is on the second shelf take it in a spoonful of that elixir of eucalyptus it knocks the bitter out  after i came back we sat by the fire and got our briars going in about eight minutes tom sank back into a gentle collapse  i went straight to the medicine cabinet and looked  you unmitigated hayseed i growled see what money will do for a mans brains  there stood the morphine bottle with the stopple out just as tom had left it  i routed out another young md who roomed on the floor above and sent him for old doctor gales two squares away tom hopkins has too much money to be attended by rising young practitioners alone  when gales came we put tom through as expensive a course of treatment as the resources of the profession permit after the more drastic remedies we gave him citrate of caffeine in frequent doses and strong coffee and walked him up and down the floor between two of us old gales pinched him and slapped his face and worked hard for the big check he could see in the distance the young md from the next floor gave tom a most hearty rousing kick and then apologized to me  couldnt help it he said i never kicked a millionaire before in my life i may never have another opportunity  now said doctor gales after a couple of hours hell do but keep him awake for another hour you can do that by talking to him and shaking him up occasionally when his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep ill leave him with you now  i was left alone with tom whom we had laid on a couch he lay very still and his eyes were half closed i began my work of keeping him awake  well old man i said youve had a narrow squeak but weve pulled you through when you were attending lectures tom didnt any of the professors ever casually remark that morphia never spells quinia especially in fourgrain doses but i wont pile it up on you until you get on your feet but you ought to have been a druggist tom youre splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions  tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile  bly he murmured i feel jus like a humn bird flyin around a jolly lot of most shpensive roses don bozzer me goin sleep now  and he went to sleep in two seconds i shook him by the shoulder  now tom i said severely this wont do the big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour open your eyes youre not entirely safe yet you know wake up  tom hopkins weighs one hundred and ninetyeight he gave me another somnolent grin and fell into deeper slumber i would have made him move about but i might as well have tried to make cleopatras needle waltz around the room with me toms breathing became stertorous and that in connection with morphia poisoning means danger  then i began to think i could not rouse his body i must strive to excite his mind make him angry was an idea that suggested itself good i thought but how there was not a joint in toms armour dear old fellow he was good nature itself and a gallant gentleman fine and true and clean as sunlight he came from somewhere down south where they still have ideals and a code new york had charmed but had not spoiled him he had that oldfashioned chivalrous reverence for women thateurekathere was my idea i worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination i chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old tom hopkins then i took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped he opened his eyes lazily i assumed an expression of scorn and contempt and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose  listen to me hopkins i said in cutting and distinct tones you and i have been good friends but i want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have  tom looked the least bit interested  whats the matter billy he muttered composedly dont your clothes fit you  if i were in your place i went on which thank god i am not i think i would be afraid to close my eyes how about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome southern pinesthe girl that youve forgotten since you came into your confounded money oh i know what im talking about while you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you but now since you are a millionaire its different i wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worshipthe southern gentlemen im sorry hopkins that i was forced to speak about these matters but youve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that i would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks  poor tom i could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate he was distinctly angry and i didnt blame him tom had a southern temper his eyes were open now and they showed a gleam or two of fire but the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue  ccconfound you he stammered ill ssmash you  he tried to rise from the couch with all his size he was very weak now i thrust him back with one arm he lay there glaring like a lion in a trap  that will hold you for a while you old loony i said to myself i got up and lit my pipe for i was needing a smoke i walked around a bit congratulating myself on my brilliant idea  i heard a snore i looked around tom was asleep again i walked over and punched him on the jaw he looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot i chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard  i want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can i said insultingly ive told you what i think of you if you have any honour or honesty left you will think twice before you attempt again to associate with gentlemen shes a poor girl isnt she i sneered somewhat too plain and unfashionable for us since we got our money be ashamed to walk on fifth avenue with her wouldnt you hopkins youre fortyseven times worse than a cad who cares for your money i dont ill bet that girl dont perhaps if you didnt have it youd be more of a man as it is youve made a cur of yourself andi thought that quite dramaticperhaps broken a faithful heart old tom hopkins breaking a faithful heart let me be rid of you as soon as possible  i turned my back on tom and winked at myself in a mirror i heard him moving and i turned again quickly i didnt want a hundred and ninetyeight pounds falling on me from the rear but tom had only turned partly over and laid one arm across his face he spoke a few words rather more distinctly than before  i couldnt havetalked this wayto you billy even if id heard peoplelyin bout you but jus soons i can sstand upill break your neckdon fget it  i did feel a little ashamed then but it was to save tom in the morning when i explained it we would have a good laugh over it together  in about twenty minutes tom dropped into a sound easy slumber i felt his pulse listened to his respiration and let him sleep everything was normal and tom was safe i went into the other room and tumbled into bed  i found tom up and dressed when i awoke the next morning he was entirely himself again with the exception of shaky nerves and a tongue like a whiteoak chip  what an idiot i was he said thoughtfully i remember thinking that quinine bottle looked queer while i was taking the dose have much trouble in bringing me round  i told him no his memory seemed bad about the entire affair i concluded that he had no recollection of my efforts to keep him awake and decided not to enlighten him some other time i thought when he was feeling better we would have some fun over it  when tom was ready to go he stopped with the door open and shook my hand  much obliged old fellow he said quietly for taking so much trouble with meand for what you said im going down now to telegraph to the little girl     x  a ghost of a chance   actually a hod repeated mrs kinsolving pathetically  mrs bellamy bellmore arched a sympathetic eyebrow thus she expressed condolence and a generous amount of apparent surprise  fancy her telling everywhere recapitulated mrs kinsolving that she saw a ghost in the apartment she occupied hereour choicest guestrooma ghost carrying a hod on its shoulderthe ghost of an old man in overalls smoking a pipe and carrying a hod the very absurdity of the thing shows her malicious intent there never was a kinsolving that carried a hod every one knows that mr kinsolvings father accumulated his money by large building contracts but he never worked a day with his own hands he had this house built from his own plans butoh a hod why need she have been so cruel and malicious  it is really too bad murmured mrs bellmore with an approving glance of her fine eyes about the vast chamber done in lilac and old gold and it was in this room she saw it oh no im not afraid of ghosts dont have the least fear on my account im glad you put me in here i think family ghosts so interesting but really the story does sound a little inconsistent i should have expected something better from mrs fischersuympkins dont they carry bricks in hods why should a ghost bring bricks into a villa built of marble and stone im so sorry but it makes me think that age is beginning to tell upon mrs fischersuympkins  this house continued mrs kinsolving was built upon the site of an old one used by the family during the revolution there wouldnt be anything strange in its having a ghost and there was a captain kinsolving who fought in general greenes army though weve never been able to secure any papers to vouch for it if there is to be a family ghost why couldnt it have been his instead of a bricklayers  the ghost of a revolutionary ancestor wouldnt be a bad idea agreed mrs bellmore but you know how arbitrary and inconsiderate ghosts can be maybe like love they are engendered in the eye one advantage of those who see ghosts is that their stories cant be disproved by a spiteful eye a revolutionary knapsack might easily be construed to be a hod dear mrs kinsolving think no more of it i am sure it was a knapsack  but she told everybody mourned mrs kinsolving inconsolable she insisted upon the details there is the pipe and how are you going to get out of the overalls  shant get into them said mrs bellmore with a prettily suppressed yawn too stiff and wrinkly is that you felice prepare my bath please do you dine at seven at clifftop mrs kinsolving so kind of you to run in for a chat before dinner i love those little touches of informality with a guest they give such a home flavour to a visit so sorry i must be dressing i am so indolent i always postpone it until the last moment  mrs fischersuympkins had been the first large plum that the kinsolvings had drawn from the social pie for a long time the pie itself had been out of reach on a top shelf but the purse and the pursuit had at last lowered it mrs fischersuympkins was the heliograph of the smart society parading corps the glitter of her wit and actions passed along the line transmitting whatever was latest and most daring in the game of peepshow formerly her fame and leadership had been secure enough not to need the support of such artifices as handing around live frogs for favours at a cotillon but now these things were necessary to the holding of her throne beside middle age had come to preside incongruous at her capers the sensational papers had cut her space from a page to two columns her wit developed a sting her manners became more rough and inconsiderate as if she felt the royal necessity of establishing her autocracy by scorning the conventionalities that bound lesser potentates  to some pressure at the command of the kinsolvings she had yielded so far as to honour their house by her presence for an evening and night she had her revenge upon her hostess by relating with grim enjoyment and sarcastic humour her story of the vision carrying the hod to that lady in raptures at having penetrated thus far toward the coveted inner circle the result came as a crushing disappointment everybody either sympathized or laughed and there was little to choose between the two modes of expression  but later on mrs kinsolvings hopes and spirits were revived by the capture of a second and greater prize  mrs bellamy bellmore had accepted an invitation to visit at clifftop and would remain for three days mrs bellmore was one of the younger matrons whose beauty descent and wealth gave her a reserved seat in the holy of holies that required no strenuous bolstering she was generous enough thus to give mrs kinsolving the accolade that was so poignantly desired and at the same time she thought how much it would please terence perhaps it would end by solving him  terence was mrs kinsolvings son aged twentynine quite goodlooking enough and with two or three attractive and mysterious traits for one he was very devoted to his mother and that was sufficiently odd to deserve notice for others he talked so little that it was irritating and he seemed either very shy or very deep terence interested mrs bellmore because she was not sure which it was she intended to study him a little longer unless she forgot the matter if he was only shy she would abandon him for shyness is a bore if he was deep she would also abandon him for depth is precarious  on the afternoon of the third day of her visit terence hunted up mrs bellmore and found her in a nook actually looking at an album  its so good of you said he to come down here and retrieve the day for us i suppose you have heard that mrs fischersuympkins scuttled the ship before she left she knocked a whole plank out of the bottom with a hod my mother is grieving herself ill about it cant you manage to see a ghost for us while you are here mrs bellmorea bangup swell ghost with a coronet on his head and a cheque book under his arm  that was a naughty old lady terence said mrs bellmore to tell such stories perhaps you gave her too much supper your mother doesnt really take it seriously does she  i think she does answered terence one would think every brick in the hod had dropped on her its a good mammy and i dont like to see her worried its to be hoped that the ghost belongs to the hodcarriers union and will go out on a strike if he doesnt there will be no peace in this family  im sleeping in the ghostchamber said mrs bellmore pensively but its so nice i wouldnt change it even if i were afraid which im not it wouldnt do for me to submit a counter story of a desirable aristocratic shade would it i would do so with pleasure but it seems to me it would be too obviously an antidote for the other narrative to be effective  true said terence running two fingers thoughtfully into his crisp brown hair that would never do how would it work to see the same ghost again minus the overalls and have gold bricks in the hod that would elevate the spectre from degrading toil to a financial plane dont you think that would be respectable enough  there was an ancestor who fought against the britishers wasnt there your mother said something to that effect  i believe so one of those old chaps in raglan vests and golf trousers i dont care a continental for a continental myself but the mother has set her heart on pomp and heraldry and pyrotechnics and i want her to be happy  you are a good boy terence said mrs bellmore sweeping her silks close to one side of her not to beat your mother sit here by me and lets look at the album just as people used to do twenty years ago now tell me about every one of them who is this tall dignified gentleman leaning against the horizon with one arm on the corinthian column  that old chap with the big feet inquired terence craning his neck thats greatuncle obrannigan he used to keep a rathskeller on the bowery  i asked you to sit down terence if you are not going to amuse or obey me i shall report in the morning that i saw a ghost wearing an apron and carrying schooners of beer now that is better to be shy at your age terence is a thing that you should blush to acknowledge    at breakfast on the last morning of her visit mrs bellmore startled and entranced every one present by announcing positively that she had seen the ghost  did it have aaa mrs kinsolving in her suspense and agitation could not bring out the word  no indeedfar from it  there was a chorus of questions from others at the table werent you frightened what did it do how did it look how was it dressed did it say anything didnt you scream  ill try to answer everything at once said mrs bellmore heroically although im frightfully hungry something awakened meim not sure whether it was a noise or a touchand there stood the phantom i never burn a light at night so the room was quite dark but i saw it plainly i wasnt dreaming it was a tall man all misty white from head to foot it wore the full dress of the old colonial dayspowdered hair baggy coat skirts lace ruffles and a sword it looked intangible and luminous in the dark and moved without a sound yes i was a little frightened at firstor startled i should say it was the first ghost i had ever seen no it didnt say anything i didnt scream i raised up on my elbow and then it glided silently away and disappeared when it reached the door  mrs kinsolving was in the seventh heaven the description is that of captain kinsolving of general greenes army one of our ancestors she said in a voice that trembled with pride and relief i really think i must apologize for our ghostly relative mrs bellmore i am afraid he must have badly disturbed your rest  terence sent a smile of pleased congratulation toward his mother attainment was mrs kinsolvings at last and he loved to see her happy  i suppose i ought to be ashamed to confess said mrs bellmore who was now enjoying her breakfast that i wasnt very much disturbed i presume it would have been the customary thing to scream and faint and have all of you running about in picturesque costumes but after the first alarm was over i really couldnt work myself up to a panic the ghost retired from the stage quietly and peacefully after doing its little turn and i went to sleep again  nearly all listened politely accepted mrs bellmore s story as a madeup affair charitably offered as an offset to the unkind vision seen by mrs fischersuympkins but one or two present perceived that her assertions bore the genuine stamp of her own convictions truth and candour seemed to attend upon every word even a scoffer at ghostsif he were very observantwould have been forced to admit that she had at least in a very vivid dream been honestly aware of the weird visitor  soon mrs bellmores maid was packing in two hours the auto would come to convey her to the station as terence was strolling upon the east piazza mrs bellmore came up to him with a confidential sparkle in her eye  i didnt wish to tell the others all of it she said but i will tell you in a way i think you should be held responsible can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night  rattled chains suggested terence after some thought or groaned they usually do one or the other  do you happen to know continued mrs bellmore with sudden irrelevancy if i resemble any one of the female relatives of your restless ancestor captain kinsolving  dont think so said terence with an extremely puzzled air never heard of any of them being noted beauties  then why said mrs bellmore looking the young man gravely in the eye should that ghost have kissed me as im sure it did  heavens exclaimed terence in wideeyed amazement you dont mean that mrs bellmore did he actually kiss you  i said it corrected mrs bellmore i hope the impersonal pronoun is correctly used  but why did you say i was responsible  because you are the only living male relative of the ghost  i see unto the third and fourth generation but seriously did hedid ithow do you  know how does any one know i was asleep and that is what awakened me im almost certain  almost  well i awoke just asoh cant you understand what i mean when anything arouses you suddenly you are not positive whether you dreamed orand yet you know that dear me terence must i dissect the most elementary sensations in order to accommodate your extremely practical intelligence  but about kissing ghosts you know said terence humbly i require the most primary instruction i never kissed a ghost is itis it  the sensation said mrs bellmore with deliberate but slightly smiling emphasis since you are seeking instruction is a mingling of the material and the spiritual  of course said terence suddenly growing serious it was a dream or some kind of an hallucination nobody believes in spirits these days if you told the tale out of kindness of heart mrs bellmore i cant express how grateful i am to you it has made my mother supremely happy that revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea  mrs bellmore sighed the usual fate of ghostseers is mine she said resignedly my privileged encounter with a spirit is attributed to lobster salad or mendacity well i have at least one memory left from the wrecka kiss from the unseen world was captain kinsolving a very brave man do you know terence  he was licked at yorktown i believe said terence reflecting they say he skedaddled with his company after the first battle there  i thought he must have been timid said mrs bellmore absently he might have had another  another battle asked terence dully  what else could i mean i must go and get ready now the auto will be here in an hour ive enjoyed clifftop immensely such a lovely morning isnt it terence  on her way to the station mrs bellmore took from her bag a silk handkerchief and looked at it with a little peculiar smile then she tied it in several very hard knots and threw it at a convenient moment over the edge of the cliff along which the road ran  in his room terence was giving some directions to his man brooks have this stuff done up in a parcel he said and ship it to the address on that card  the card was that of a new york costumer the stuff was a gentlemans costume of the days of 76 made of white satin with silver buckles white silk stockings and white kid shoes a powdered wig and a sword completed the dress  and look about brooks added terence a little anxiously for a silk handkerchief with my initials in one corner i must have dropped it somewhere  it was a month later when mrs bellmore and one or two others of the smart crowd were making up a list of names for a coaching trip through the catskills mrs bellmore looked over the list for a final censoring the name of terence kinsolving was there mrs bellmore ran her prohibitive pencil lightly through the name  too shy she murmured sweetly in explanation     xi  jimmy hayes and muriel   i   supper was over and there had fallen upon the camp the silence that accompanies the rolling of cornhusk cigarettes the water hole shone from the dark earth like a patch of fallen sky coyotes yelped dull thumps indicated the rockinghorse movements of the hobbled ponies as they moved to fresh grass a halftroop of the frontier battalion of texas rangers were distributed about the fire  a wellknown soundthe fluttering and scraping of chaparral against wooden stirrupscame from the thick brush above the camp the rangers listened cautiously they heard a loud and cheerful voice call out reassuringly  brace up muriel old girl were most there now been a long ride for ye aint it ye old antediluvian handful of animated carpettacks hey now quit a tryin to kiss me dont hold on to my neck so tightthis here paint hoss aint any too shorefooted let me tell ye hes liable to dump us both off if we dont watch out  two minutes of waiting brought a tired paint pony singlefooting into camp a gangling youth of twenty lolled in the saddle of the muriel whom he had been addressing nothing was to be seen  hi fellows shouted the rider cheerfully this heres a letter fer lieutenant manning  he dismounted unsaddled dropped the coils of his stakerope and got his hobbles from the saddlehorn while lieutenant manning in command was reading the letter the newcomer rubbed solicitously at some dried mud in the loops of the hobbles showing a consideration for the forelegs of his mount  boys said the lieutenant waving his hand to the rangers this is mr james hayes hes a new member of the company captain mclean sends him down from el paso the boys will see that you have some supper hayes as soon as you get your pony hobbled  the recruit was received cordially by the rangers still they observed him shrewdly and with suspended judgment picking a comrade on the border is done with ten times the care and discretion with which a girl chooses a sweetheart on your sidekickers nerve loyalty aim and coolness your own life may depend many times  after a hearty supper hayes joined the smokers about the fire his appearance did not settle all the questions in the minds of his brother rangers they saw simply a loose lank youth with towcoloured sunburned hair and a berrybrown ingenuous face that wore a quizzical goodnatured smile  fellows said the new ranger im goin to interduce to you a lady friend of mine aint ever heard anybody call her a beauty but youll all admit shes got some fine points about her come along muriel  he held open the front of his blue flannel shirt out of it crawled a horned frog a bright red ribbon was tied jauntily around its spiky neck it crawled to its owners knee and sat there motionless  this here muriel said hayes with an oratorical wave of his hand has got qualities she never talks back she always stays at home and shes satisfied with one red dress for every day and sunday too  look at that blame insect said one of the rangers with a grin ive seen plenty of them horny frogs but i never knew anybody to have one for a sidepartner does the blame thing know you from anybody else  take it over there and see said hayes  the stumpy little lizard known as the horned frog is harmless he has the hideousness of the prehistoric monsters whose reduced descendant he is but he is gentler than the dove  the ranger took muriel from hayess knee and went back to his seat on a roll of blankets the captive twisted and clawed and struggled vigorously in his hand after holding it for a moment or two the ranger set it upon the ground awkwardly but swiftly the frog worked its four oddly moving legs until it stopped close by hayess foot  well dang my hide said the other ranger the little cuss knows you never thought them insects had that much sense    ii   jimmy hayes became a favourite in the ranger camp he had an endless store of goodnature and a mild perennial quality of humour that is well adapted to camp life he was never without his horned frog in the bosom of his shirt during rides on his knee or shoulder in camp under his blankets at night the ugly little beast never left him  jimmy was a humourist of a type that prevails in the rural south and west unskilled in originating methods of amusing or in witty conceptions he had hit upon a comical idea and clung to it reverently it had seemed to jimmy a very funny thing to have about his person with which to amuse his friends a tame horned frog with a red ribbon around its neck as it was a happy idea why not perpetuate it  the sentiments existing between jimmy and the frog cannot be exactly determined the capability of the horned frog for lasting affection is a subject upon which we have had no symposiums it is easier to guess jimmys feelings muriel was his chef doeuvre of wit and as such he cherished her he caught flies for her and shielded her from sudden northers yet his care was half selfish and when the time came she repaid him a thousand fold other muriels have thus overbalanced the light attentions of other jimmies  not at once did jimmy hayes attain full brotherhood with his comrades they loved him for his simplicity and drollness but there hung above him a great sword of suspended judgment to make merry in camp is not all of a rangers life there are horsethieves to trail desperate criminals to run down bravos to battle with bandits to rout out of the chaparral peace and order to be compelled at the muzzle of a sixshooter jimmy had been most generally a cowpuncher he said he was inexperienced in ranger methods of warfare therefore the rangers speculated apart and solemnly as to how he would stand fire for let it be known the honour and pride of each ranger company is the individual bravery of its members  for two months the border was quiet the rangers lolled listless in camp and thenbringing joy to the rusting guardians of the frontiersebastiano saldar an eminent mexican desperado and cattlethief crossed the rio grande with his gang and began to lay waste the texas side there were indications that jimmy hayes would soon have the opportunity to show his mettle the rangers patrolled with alacrity but saldars men were mounted like lochinvar and were hard to catch  one evening about sundown the rangers halted for supper after a long ride their horses stood panting with their saddles on the men were frying bacon and boiling coffee suddenly out of the brush sebastiano saldar and his gang dashed upon them with blazing sixshooters and highvoiced yells it was a neat surprise the rangers swore in annoyed tones and got their winchesters busy but the attack was only a spectacular dash of the purest mexican type after the florid demonstration the raiders galloped away yelling down the river the rangers mounted and pursued but in less than two miles the fagged ponies laboured so that lieutenant manning gave the word to abandon the chase and return to the camp  then it was discovered that jimmy hayes was missing some one remembered having seen him run for his pony when the attack began but no one had set eyes on him since morning came but no jimmy they searched the country around on the theory that he had been killed or wounded but without success then they followed after saldars gang but it seemed to have disappeared manning concluded that the wily mexican had recrossed the river after his theatric farewell and indeed no further depredations from him were reported  this gave the rangers time to nurse a soreness they had as has been said the pride and honour of the company is the individual bravery of its members and now they believed that jimmy hayes had turned coward at the whiz of mexican bullets there was no other deduction buck davis pointed out that not a shot was fired by saldars gang after jimmy was seen running for his horse there was no way for him to have been shot no he had fled from his first fight and afterward he would not return aware that the scorn of his comrades would be a worse thing to face than the muzzles of many rifles  so mannings detachment of mcleans company frontier battalion was gloomy it was the first blot on its escutcheon never before in the history of the service had a ranger shown the white feather all of them had liked jimmy hayes and that made it worse  days weeks and months went by and still that little cloud of unforgotten cowardice hung above the camp    iii   nearly a year afterwardafter many camping grounds and many hundreds of miles guarded and defendedlieutenant manning with almost the same detachment of men was sent to a point only a few miles below their old camp on the river to look after some smuggling there one afternoon while they were riding through a dense mesquite flat they came upon a patch of open hogwallow prairie there they rode upon the scene of an unwritten tragedy  in a big hogwallow lay the skeletons of three mexicans their clothing alone served to identify them the largest of the figures had once been sebastiano saldar his great costly sombrero heavy with gold ornamentationa hat famous all along the rio grandelay there pierced by three bullets along the ridge of the hogwallow rested the rusting winchesters of the mexicansall pointing in the same direction  the rangers rode in that direction for fifty yards there in a little depression of the ground with his rifle still bearing upon the three lay another skeleton it had been a battle of extermination there was nothing to identify the solitary defender his clothingsuch as the elements had left distinguishableseemed to be of the kind that any ranchman or cowboy might have worn  some cowpuncher said manning that they caught out alone good boy he put up a dandy scrap before they got him so thats why we didnt hear from don sebastiano any more  and then from beneath the weatherbeaten rags of the dead man there wriggled out a horned frog with a faded red ribbon around its neck and sat upon the shoulder of its long quiet master mutely it told the story of the untried youth and the swift paint ponyhow they had outstripped all their comrades that day in the pursuit of the mexican raiders and how the boy had gone down upholding the honour of the company  the ranger troop herded close and a simultaneous wild yell arose from their lips the outburst was at once a dirge an apology an epitaph and a pæan of triumph a strange requiem you may say over the body of a fallen comrade but if jimmy hayes could have heard it he would have understood     xii  the door of unrest   i sat an hour by sun in the editors room of the montopolis weekly bugle i was the editor  the saffron rays of the declining sunlight filtered through the cornstalks in micajah widdups gardenpatch and cast an amber glory upon my pastepot i sat at the editorial desk in my nonrotary revolving chair and prepared my editorial against the oligarchies the room with its one window was already a prey to the twilight one by one with my trenchant sentences i lopped off the heads of the political hydra while i listened full of kindly peace to the homecoming cowbells and wondered what mrs flanagan was going to have for supper  then in from the dusky quiet street there drifted and perched himself upon a corner of my desk old father times younger brother his face was beardless and as gnarled as an english walnut i never saw clothes such as he wore they would have reduced josephs coat to a monochrome but the colours were not the dyers stains and patches and the work of sun and rust were responsible for the diversity on his coarse shoes was the dust conceivably of a thousand leagues i can describe him no further except to say that he was little and weird and oldold i began to estimate in centuries when i saw him yes and i remember that there was an odour a faint odour like aloes or possibly like myrrh or leather and i thought of museums  and then i reached for a pad and pencil for business is business and visits of the oldest inhabitants are sacred and honourable requiring to be chronicled  i am glad to see you sir i said i would offer you a chair butyou see sir i went on i have lived in montopolis only three weeks and i have not met many of our citizens i turned a doubtful eye upon his duststained shoes and concluded with a newspaper phrase i suppose that you reside in our midst  my visitor fumbled in his raiment drew forth a soiled card and handed it to me upon it was written in plain but unsteadily formed characters the name michob ader  i am glad you called mr ader i said as one of our older citizens you must view with pride the recent growth and enterprise of montopolis among other improvements i think i can promise that the town will now be provided with a live enterprising newspa  do ye know the name on that card asked my caller interrupting me  it is not a familiar one to me i said  again he visited the depths of his ancient vestments this time he brought out a torn leaf of some book or journal brown and flimsy with age the heading of the page was the turkish spy in oldstyle type the printing upon it was this  there is a man come to paris in this year 1643 who pretends to have lived these sixteen hundred years he says of himself that he was a shoemaker in jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion that his name is michob ader and that when jesus the christian messias was condemned by pontius pilate the roman president he paused to rest while bearing his cross to the place of crucifixion before the door of michob ader the shoemaker struck jesus with his fist saying go why tarriest thou the messias answered him i indeed am going but thou shalt tarry until i come thereby condemning him to live until the day of judgment he lives forever but at the end of every hundred years he falls into a fit or trance on recovering from which he finds himself in the same state of youth in which he was when jesus suffered being then about thirty years of age  such is the story of the wandering jew as told by michob ader who relates here the printing ended  i must have muttered aloud something to myself about the wandering jew for the old man spake up bitterly and loudly  tis a lie said he like nine tenths of what ye call history tis a gentile i am and no jew i am after footing it out of jerusalem my son but if that makes me a jew then everything that comes out of a bottle is babies milk ye have my name on the card ye hold and ye have read the bit of paper they call the turkish spy that printed the news when i stepped into their office on the 12th day of june in the year 1643 just as i have called upon ye today  i laid down my pencil and pad clearly it would not do here was an item for the local column of the bugle thatbut it would not do still fragments of the impossible personal began to flit through my conventionalized brain uncle michob is as spry on his legs as a young chap of only a thousand or so our venerable caller relates with pride that george washno ptolemy the greatonce dandled him on his knee at his fathers house uncle michob says that our wet spring was nothing in comparison with the dampness that ruined the crops around mount ararat when he was a boy but no noit would not do  i was trying to think of some conversational subject with which to interest my visitor and was hesitating between walking matches and the pliocene age when the old man suddenly began to weep poignantly and distressfully  cheer up mr ader i said a little awkwardly this matter may blow over in a few hundred years more there has already been a decided reaction in favour of judas iscariot and colonel burr and the celebrated violinist signor nero this is the age of whitewash you must not allow yourself to become downhearted  unknowingly i had struck a chord the old man blinked belligerently through his senile tears  tis time he said that the liars be doin justice to somebody yer historians are no more than a pack of old women gabblin at a wake a finer man than the imperor nero niver wore sandals man i was at the burnin of rome i knowed the imperor well for in them days i was a wellknown character in thim days they had rayspect for a man that lived forever  but twas of the imperor nero i was goin to tell ye i struck into rome up the appian way on the night of july the 16th the year 64 i had just stepped down by way of siberia and afghanistan and one foot of me had a frostbite and the other a blister burned by the sand of the desert and i was feelin a bit blue from doin patrol duty from the north pole down to the last chance corner in patagonia and bein miscalled a jew in the bargain well im tellin ye i was passin the circus maximus and it was dark as pitch over the way and then i heard somebody sing out is that you michob  over aginst the wall hid out amongst a pile of barrels and old drygoods boxes was the imperor nero wid his togy wrapped around his toes smokin a long black segar  have one michob says he  none of the weeds for me says inayther pipe nor segar whats the use says i of smokin when yeve not got the ghost of a chance of killin yeself by doin it  true for ye michob ader my perpetual jew says the imperor yere not always wandering sure tis danger gives the spice of our pleasuresnext to their bein forbidden  and for what says i do ye smoke be night in dark places widout even a cinturion in plain clothes to attend ye  have ye ever heard michob says the imperor of predestinarianism  ive had the cousin of it says i ive been on the trot with pedestrianism for many a year and more to come as ye well know  the longer word says me friend nero is the tachin of this new sect of people they call the christians tis them thats raysponsible for me smokin be night in holes and corners of the dark  and then i sets down and takes off a shoe and rubs me foot that is frosted and the imperor tells me about it it seems that since i passed that way before the imperor had mandamused the impress wid a divorce suit and misses poppæa a cilibrated lady was ingaged widout riferences as housekeeper at the palace all in one day says the imperor she puts up new lace windycurtains in the palace and joins the antitobacco society and whin i feels the need of a smoke i must be after sneakin out to these piles of lumber in the dark so there in the dark me and the imperor sat and i told him of me travels and when they say the imperor was an incindiary they lie twas that night the fire started that burnt the city tis my opinion that it began from a stump of segar that he threw down among the boxes and tis a lie that he fiddled he did all he could for six days to stop it sir  and now i detected a new flavour to mr michob ader it had not been myrrh or balm or hyssop that i had smelled the emanation was the odour of bad whiskeyand worse still of low comedythe sort that small humorists manufacture by clothing the grave and reverend things of legend and history in the vulgar topical frippery that passes for a certain kind of wit michob ader as an impostor claiming nineteen hundred years and playing his part with the decency of respectable lunacy i could endure but as a tedious wag cheapening his egregious story with songbook levity his importance as an entertainer grew less  and then as if he suspected my thoughts he suddenly shifted his key  youll excuse me sir he whined but sometimes i get a little mixed in my head i am a very old man and it is hard to remember everything  i knew that he was right and that i should not try to reconcile him with roman history so i asked for news concerning other ancients with whom he had walked familiar  above my desk hung an engraving of raphaels cherubs you could yet make out their forms though the dust blurred their outlines strangely  ye calls them cherrubs cackled the old man babes ye fancy they are with wings and theres one wid legs and a bow and arrow that ye call cupidi know where they was found the greatgreatgreatgrandfather of thim all was a billygoat bein an editor sir do ye happen to know where solomon s temple stood  i fancied that it was inin persia well i did not know  tis not in history nor in the bible where it was but i saw it meself the first pictures of cherrubs and cupids was sculptured upon thim walls and pillars two of the biggest sir stood in the adytum to form the baldachin over the ark but the wings of thim sculptures was intindid for horns and the faces was the faces of goats ten thousand goats there was in and about the temple and your cherrubs was billygoats in the days of king solomon but the painters misconstrued the horns into wings  and i knew tamerlane the lame timour sir very well i saw him at keghut and at zaranj he was a little man no larger than yerself with hair the colour of an amber pipe stem they buried him at samarkand i was at the wake sir oh he was a finebuilt man in his coffin six feet long with black whiskers to his face and i see em throw turnips at the imperor vispacian in africa all over the world i have tramped sir without the body of me findin any rest twas so commanded i saw jerusalem destroyed and pompeii go up in the fireworks and i was at the coronation of charlemagne and the lynchin of joan of arc and everywhere i go there comes storms and revolutions and plagues and fires twas so commanded ye have heard of the wandering jew tis all so except that divil a bit am i a jew but history lies as i have told ye are ye quite sure sir that ye havent a drop of whiskey convenient ye well know that i have many miles of walking before me  i have none said i and if you please i am about to leave for my supper  i pushed my chair back creakingly this ancient landlubber was becoming as great an affliction as any crossbowed mariner he shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes overturned my inkstand and went on with his insufferable nonsense  i wouldnt mind it so much he complained if it wasnt for the work i must do on good fridays ye know about pontius pilate sir of course his body whin he killed himself was pitched into a lake on the alps mountains now listen to the job that tis mine to perform on the night of ivery good friday the ould divil goes down in the pool and drags up pontius and the water is bilin and spewin like a wash pot and the ould divil sets the body on top of a throne on the rocks and thin comes me share of the job oh sir ye would pity me thinye would pray for the poor wandering jew that niver was a jew if ye could see the horror of the thing that i must do tis i that must fetch a bowl of water and kneel down before it till it washes its hands i declare to ye that pontius pilate a man dead two hundred years dragged up with the lake slime coverin him and fishes wrigglin inside of him widout eyes and in the discomposition of the body sits there sir and washes his hands in the bowl i hold for him on good fridays twas so commanded  clearly the matter had progressed far beyond the scope of the bugles local column there might have been employment here for the alienist or for those who circulate the pledge but i had had enough of it i got up and repeated that i must go  at this he seized my coat grovelled upon my desk and burst again into distressful weeping whatever it was about i said to myself that his grief was genuine  come now mr ader i said soothingly what is the matter  the answer came brokenly through his racking sobs  because i would not    let the poor christ    rest    upon the step  his hallucination seemed beyond all reasonable answer yet the effect of it upon him scarcely merited disrespect but i knew nothing that might assuage it and i told him once more that both of us should be leaving the office at once  obedient at last he raised himself from my dishevelled desk and permitted me to half lift him to the floor the gale of his grief had blown away his words his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief reminiscence died in himat least the coherent part of it  twas me that did it he muttered as i led him toward the doorme the shoemaker of jerusalem  i got him to the sidewalk and in the augmented light i saw that his face was seared and lined and warped by a sadness almost incredibly the product of a single lifetime  and then high up in the firmamental darkness we heard the clamant cries of some great passing birds my wandering jew lifted his hand with sidetilted head  the seven whistlers he said as one introduces wellknown friends  wild geese said i but i confess that their number is beyond me  they follow me everywhere he said twas so commanded what ye hear is the souls of the seven jews that helped with the crucifixion sometimes theyre plovers and sometimes geese but yell find them always flyin where i go  i stood uncertain how to take my leave i looked down the street shuffled my feet looked back againand felt my hair rise the old man had disappeared  and then my capillaries relaxed for i dimly saw him footing it away through the darkness but he walked so swiftly and silently and contrary to the gait promised by his age that my composure was not all restored though i knew not why  that night i was foolish enough to take down some dustcovered volumes from my modest shelves i searched hermippus redivvus and salathiel and the pepys collection in vain and then in a book called the citizen of the world and in one two centuries old i came upon what i desired michob ader had indeed come to paris in the year 1643 and related to the turkish spy an extraordinary story he claimed to be the wandering jew and that  but here i fell asleep for my editorial duties had not been light that day  judge hoover was the bugles candidate for congress having to confer with him i sought his home early the next morning and we walked together down town through a little street with which i was unfamiliar  did you ever hear of michob ader i asked him smiling  why yes said the judge and that reminds me of my shoes he has for mending here is his shop now  judge hoover stepped into a dingy small shop i looked up at the sign and saw mike obader boot and shoe maker on it some wild geese passed above honking clearly i scratched my ear and frowned and then trailed into the shop  there sat my wandering jew on his shoemakers bench trimming a halfsole he was drabbled with dew grassstained unkempt and miserable and on his face was still the unexplained wretchedness the problematic sorrow the esoteric woe that had been written there by nothing less it seemed than the stylus of the centuries  judge hoover inquired kindly concerning his shoes the old shoemaker looked up and spoke sanely enough he had been ill he said for a few days the next day the shoes would be ready he looked at me and i could see that i had no place in his memory so out we went and on our way  old mike remarked the candidate has been on one of his sprees he gets crazy drunk regularly once a month but hes a good shoemaker  what is his history i inquired  whiskey epitomized judge hoover that explains him  i was silent but i did not accept the explanation and so when i had the chance i asked old man sellers who browsed daily on my exchanges  mike obader said he was makin shoes in montopolis when i come here goin on fifteen year ago i guess whiskeys his trouble once a month he gets off the track and stays so a week hes got a rigmarole somethin about his bein a jew pedler that he tells evrybody nobody wont listen to him any more when hes sober he aint sich a foolhes got a sight of books in the back room of his shop that he reads i guess you can lay all his trouble to whiskey  but again i would not not yet was my wandering jew rightly construed for me i trust that women may not be allowed a title to all the curiosity in the world so when montopoliss oldest inhabitant some ninety score years younger than michob ader dropped in to acquire promulgation in print i siphoned his perpetual trickle of reminiscence in the direction of the uninterpreted maker of shoes  uncle abner was the complete history of montopolis bound in butternut  obader he quavered come here in 69 he was the first shoemaker in the place folks generally considers him crazy at times now but he dont harm nobody i spose drinkin upset his mindyes drinkin very likely done it its a powerful bad thing drinkin im an old old man sir and i never see no good in drinkin  i felt disappointment i was willing to admit drink in the case of my shoemaker but i preferred it as a recourse instead of a cause why had he pitched upon his perpetual strange note of the wandering jew why his unutterable grief during his aberration i could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation  did mike obader ever have a great loss or trouble of any kind i asked  lemme see about thirty year ago there was somethin of the kind i recollect montopolis sir in them days used to be a mighty strict place  well mike obader had a daughter thena right pretty girl she was too gay a sort for montopolis so one day she slips off to another town and runs away with a circus it was two years before she comes back all fixed up in fine clothes and rings and jewellery to see mike he wouldnt have nothin to do with her so she stays around town awhile anyway i reckon the men folks wouldnt have raised no objections but the women egged em on to order her to leave town but she had plenty of spunk and told em to mind their own business  so one night they decided to run her away a crowd of men and women drove her out of her house and chased her with sticks and stones she run to her fathers door callin for help mike opens it and when he sees who it is he hits her with his fist and knocks her down and shuts the door  and then the crowd kept on chunkin her till she run clear out of town and the next day they finds her drowned dead in hunters mill pond i mind it all now that was thirty year ago  i leaned back in my nonrotary revolving chair and nodded gently like a mandarin at my pastepot  when old mike has a spell went on uncle abner tepidly garrulous he thinks hes the wanderin jew  he is said i nodding away  and uncle abner cackled insinuatingly at the editors remark for he was expecting at least a stickful in the personal notes of the bugle     xiii  the duplicity of hargraves   when major pendleton talbot of mobile sir and his daughter miss lydia talbot came to washington to reside they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the quietest avenues it was an oldfashioned brick building with a portico upheld by tall white pillars the yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass rows of high box bushes lined the fence and walks it was the southern style and aspect of the place that pleased the eyes of the talbots  in this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms including a study for major talbot who was adding the finishing chapters to his book anecdotes and reminiscences of the alabama army bench and bar  major talbot was of the old old south the present day had little interest or excellence in his eyes his mind lived in that period before the civil war when the talbots owned thousands of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them when the family mansion was the scene of princely hospitality and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the south out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honour an antiquated and punctilious politeness and you would think its wardrobe  such clothes were surely never made within fifty years the major was tall but whenever he made that wonderful archaic genuflexion he called a bow the corners of his frock coat swept the floor that garment was a surprise even to washington which has long ago ceased to shy at the frocks and broadbrimmed hats of southern congressmen one of the boarders christened it a father hubbard and it certainly was high in the waist and full in the skirt  but the major with all his queer clothes his immense area of plaited ravelling shirt bosom and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side both was smiled at and liked in mrs vardeman s select boarding house some of the young department clerks would often string him as they called it getting him started upon the subject dearest to himthe traditions and history of his beloved southland during his talks he would quote freely from the anecdotes and reminiscences but they were very careful not to let him see their designs for in spite of his sixtyeight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes  miss lydia was a plump little old maid of thirtyfive with smoothly drawn tightly twisted hair that made her look still older old fashioned too she was but antebellum glory did not radiate from her as it did from the major she possessed a thrifty common sense and it was she who handled the finances of the family and met all comers when there were bills to pay the major regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances they kept coming in so persistently and so often why the major wanted to know could they not be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient periodsay when the anecdotes and reminiscences had been published and paid for miss lydia would calmly go on with her sewing and say well pay as we go as long as the money lasts and then perhaps theyll have to lump it  most of mrs vardemans boarders were away during the day being nearly all department clerks and business men but there was one of them who was about the house a great deal from morning to night this was a young man named henry hopkins hargravesevery one in the house addressed him by his full namewho was engaged at one of the popular vaudeville theatres vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane in the last few years and mr hargraves was such a modest and wellmannered person that mrs vardeman could find no objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders  at the theatre hargraves was known as an allround dialect comedian having a large repertoire of german irish swede and blackface specialties but mr hargraves was ambitious and often spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy  this young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for major talbot whenever that gentleman would begin his southern reminiscences or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes hargraves could always be found the most attentive among his listeners  for a time the major showed an inclination to discourage the advances of the play actor as he privately termed him but soon the young mans agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old gentlemans stories completely won him over  it was not long before the two were like old chums the major set apart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book during the anecdotes hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right point the major was moved to declare to miss lydia one day that young hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old regime and when it came to talking of those old daysif major talbot liked to talk mr hargraves was entranced to listen  like almost all old people who talk of the past the major loved to linger over details in describing the splendid almost royal days of the old planters he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of the negro who held his horse or the exact date of certain minor happenings or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year but hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest on the contrary he would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the life of that time and he never failed to extract ready replies  the fox hunts the possum suppers the hoe downs and jubilees in the negro quarters the banquets in the plantationhouse hall when invitations went for fifty miles around the occasional feuds with the neighbouring gentry the majors duel with rathbone culbertson about kitty chalmers who afterward married a thwaite of south carolina and private yacht races for fabulous sums on mobile bay the quaint beliefs improvident habits and loyal virtues of the old slavesall these were subjects that held both the major and hargraves absorbed for hours at a time  sometimes at night when the young man would be coming upstairs to his room after his turn at the theatre was over the major would appear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him going in hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter sugar bowl fruit and a big bunch of fresh green mint  it occurred to me the major would beginhe was always ceremoniousthat perhaps you might have found your duties at theat your place of occupationsufficiently arduous to enable you mr hargraves to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind when he wrote tired natures sweet restorerone of our southern juleps  it was a fascination to hargraves to watch him make it he took rank among artists when he began and he never varied the process with what delicacy he bruised the mint with what exquisite nicety he estimated the ingredients with what solicitous care he capped the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe and then the hospitality and grace with which he offered it after the selected oat straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths  after about four months in washington miss lydia discovered one morning that they were almost without money the anecdotes and reminiscences was completed but publishers had not jumped at the collected gems of alabama sense and wit the rental of a small house which they still owned in mobile was two months in arrears their board money for the month would be due in three days miss lydia called her father to a consultation  no money said he with a surprised look it is quite annoying to be called on so frequently for these petty sums really i  the major searched his pockets he found only a twodollar bill which he returned to his vest pocket  i must attend to this at once lydia he said kindly get me my umbrella and i will go down town immediately the congressman from our district general fulghum assured me some days ago that he would use his influence to get my book published at an early date i will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made  with a sad little smile miss lydia watched him button his father hubbard and depart pausing at the door as he always did to bow profoundly  that evening at dark he returned it seemed that congressman fulghum had seen the publisher who had the majors manuscript for reading that person had said that if the anecdotes etc were carefully pruned down about one half in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end he might consider its publication  the major was in a white heat of anger but regained his equanimity according to his code of manners as soon as he was in miss lydias presence  we must have money said miss lydia with a little wrinkle above her nose give me the two dollars and i will telegraph to uncle ralph for some tonight  the major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed it on the table  perhaps it was injudicious he said mildly but the sum was so merely nominal that i bought tickets to the theatre tonight its a new war drama lydia i thought you would be pleased to witness its first production in washington i am told that the south has very fair treatment in the play i confess i should like to see the performance myself  miss lydia threw up her hands in silent despair  still as the tickets were bought they might as well be used so that evening as they sat in the theatre listening to the lively overture even miss lydia was minded to relegate their troubles for the hour to second place the major in spotless linen with his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned and his white hair smoothly roached looked really fine and distinguished the curtain went up on the first act of a magnolia flower revealing a typical southern plantation scene major talbot betrayed some interest  oh see exclaimed miss lydia nudging his arm and pointing to her programme  the major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of characters that her finger indicated      col webster calhoun     h hopkins hargraves   its our mr hargraves said miss lydia it must be his first appearance in what he calls the legitimate im so glad for him  not until the second act did col webster calhoun appear upon the stage when he made his entry major talbot gave an audible sniff glared at him and seemed to freeze solid miss lydia uttered a little ambiguous squeak and crumpled her programme in her hand for colonel calhoun was made up as nearly resembling major talbot as one pea does another the long thin white hair curly at the ends the aristocratic beak of a nose the crumpled wide ravelling shirt front the string tie with the bow nearly under one ear were almost exactly duplicated and then to clinch the imitation he wore the twin to the majors supposed to be unparalleled coat highcollared baggy empirewaisted ampleskirted hanging a foot lower in front than behind the garment could have been designed from no other pattern from then on the major and miss lydia sat bewitched and saw the counterfeit presentment of a haughty talbot dragged as the major afterward expressed it through the slanderous mire of a corrupt stage  mr hargraves had used his opportunities well he had caught the majors little idiosyncrasies of speech accent and intonation and his pompous courtliness to perfectionexaggerating all to the purposes of the stage when he performed that marvellous bow that the major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause  miss lydia sat immovable not daring to glance toward her father sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of her disapproval she could not entirely suppress  the culmination of hargravess audacious imitation took place in the third act the scene is where colonel calhoun entertains a few of the neighbouring planters in his den  standing at a table in the centre of the stage with his friends grouped about him he delivers that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in a magnolia flower at the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party  major talbot sitting quietly but white with indignation heard his best stories retold his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded and the dream of the anecdotes and reminiscences served exaggerated and garbled his favourite narrativethat of his duel with rathbone culbertsonwas not omitted and it was delivered with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it  the monologue concluded with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concocting a julep illustrated by the act here major talbots delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hairs breadthfrom his dainty handling of the fragrant weedthe onethousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentlemen and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heavenbestowed plantto his solicitous selection of the oaten straws  at the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type was so exact so sure and thorough that the leading characters in the play were forgotten after repeated calls hargraves came before the curtain and bowed his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success  at last miss lydia turned and looked at the major his thin nostrils were working like the gills of a fish he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise  we will go lydia he said chokingly this is an abominabledesecration  before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat we will stay it out she declared do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the original coat so they remained to the end  hargravess success must have kept him up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear  about three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of major talbots study the major opened it and hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning paperstoo full of his triumph to notice anything unusual in the majors demeanour  i put it all over em last night major he began exultantly i had my inning and i think scored heres what the post says      his conception and portrayal of the oldtime southern colonel    with his absurd grandiloquence his eccentric garb his quaint    idioms and phrases his motheaten pride of family and his    really kind heart fastidious sense of honour and lovable    simplicity is the best delineation of a character role on    the boards today the coat worn by colonel calhoun is itself    nothing less than an evolution of genius mr hargraves has    captured his public   how does that sound major for a first nighter  i had the honourthe majors voice sounded ominously frigidof witnessing your very remarkable performance sir last night  hargraves looked disconcerted  you were there i didnt know you everi didnt know you cared for the theatre oh i say major talbot he exclaimed frankly dont you be offended i admit i did get a lot of pointers from you that helped me out wonderfully in the part but its a type you knownot individual the way the audience caught on shows that half the patrons of that theatre are southerners they recognized it  mr hargraves said the major who had remained standing you have put upon me an unpardonable insult you have burlesqued my person grossly betrayed my confidence and misused my hospitality if i thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign manual of a gentleman or what is due one i would call you out sir old as i am i will ask you to leave the room sir  the actor appeared to be slightly bewildered and seemed hardly to take in the full meaning of the old gentlemans words  i am truly sorry you took offence he said regretfully up here we dont look at things just as you people do i know men who would buy out half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it  they are not from alabama sir said the major haughtily  perhaps not i have a pretty good memory major let me quote a few lines from your book in response to a toast at a banquet given inmilledgeville i believeyou uttered and intend to have printed these words      the northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except    in so far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial    profit he will suffer without resentment any imputation cast    upon the honour of himself or his loved ones that does not bear    with it the consequence of pecuniary loss in his charity he    gives with a liberal hand but it must be heralded with the    trumpet and chronicled in brass   do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of colonel calhoun last night  the description said the major frowning isnot without grounds some exaglatitude must be allowed in public speaking  and in public acting replied hargraves  that is not the point persisted the major unrelenting it was a personal caricature i positively decline to overlook it sir  major talbot said hargraves with a winning smile i wish you would understand me i want you to know that i never dreamed of insulting you in my profession all life belongs to me i take what i want and what i can and return it over the footlights now if you will lets let it go at that i came in to see you about something else weve been pretty good friends for some months and im going to take the risk of offending you again i know you are hard up for moneynever mind how i found out a boarding house is no place to keep such matters secretand i want you to let me help you out of the pinch ive been there often enough myself ive been getting a fair salary all the season and ive saved some money youre welcome to a couple hundredor even moreuntil you get  stop commanded the major with his arm outstretched it seems that my book didnt lie after all you think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honour under no circumstances would i accept a loan from a casual acquaintance and as to you sir i would starve before i would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed i beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment  hargraves took his departure without another word he also left the house the same day moving as mrs vardeman explained at the supper table nearer the vicinity of the downtown theatre where a magnolia flower was booked for a weeks run  critical was the situation with major talbot and miss lydia there was no one in washington to whom the majors scruples allowed him to apply for a loan miss lydia wrote a letter to uncle ralph but it was doubtful whether that relatives constricted affairs would permit him to furnish help the major was forced to make an apologetic address to mrs vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board referring to delinquent rentals and delayed remittances in a rather confused strain  deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source  late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old coloured man who wanted to see major talbot the major asked that he be sent up to his study soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway with his hat in hand bowing and scraping with one clumsy foot he was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black his big coarse shoes shone with a metallic lustre suggestive of stove polish his bushy wool was grayalmost white after middle life it is difficult to estimate the age of a negro this one might have seen as many years as had major talbot  i be bound you dont know me mars pendleton were his first words  the major rose and came forward at the old familiar style of address it was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt but they had been widely scattered and he could not recall the voice or face  i dont believe i do he said kindlyunless you will assist my memory  dont you member cindys mose mars pendleton what migrated mediately after de war  wait a moment said the major rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers he loved to recall everything connected with those beloved days cindys mose he reflected you worked among the horsesbreaking the colts yes i remember now

hardly be expected to remember you uncle mose at that age and as you say im plum growed up and was a blessed long time ago but im glad to see you even if i cant remember you  and she was and so was the major something alive and tangible had come to link them with the happy past the three sat and talked over the olden times the major and uncle mose correcting or prompting each other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and days  the major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home  uncle mose am a delicate he explained to de grand baptis convention in dis city i never preached none but bein a residin elder in de church and able fur to pay my own expenses dey sent me along  and how did you know we were in washington inquired miss lydia  deys a cullud man works in de

took uncle moses hand and laid his other upon his shoulder  dear faithful old servitor he said in an unsteady voice i dont mind saying to you that mars pendleton spent his last dollar in the world a week ago we will accept this money uncle mose since in a way it is a sort of payment as well as a token of the loyalty and devotion of the old regime lydia my dear take the money you are better fitted than i to manage its expenditure  take it honey said uncle mose hit belongs to you hits talbot money  after uncle mose had gone miss lydia had a good cryfor joy and the major turned his face to a corner and smoked his clay pipe volcanically  the succeeding days saw the talbots restored to peace and ease miss lydias face lost its worried look the major appeared in a new frock coat in which he looked like a wax figure personifying the memory of his golden age another publisher who read the manuscript of the anecdotes and reminiscences thought that with a little retouching and toning down of the high lights he could make a really bright and salable volume of it altogether the situation was comfortable and not without the touch of hope that is often sweeter than arrived blessings  one day about a week after their piece of good luck a maid brought a letter for miss lydia to her room the postmark showed that it was from new york not knowing any one there miss lydia in a mild flutter of wonder sat down by her table and opened the letter with her scissors this was what she read      dear miss talbot     i thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune i    have received and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars    per week by a new york stock company to play colonel calhoun    in a magnolia flower     there is something else i wanted you to know i guess youd    better not tell major talbot i was anxious to make him some    amends for the great help he was to me in studying the part    and for the bad humour he was in about it he refused to let    me so i did it anyhow i could easily spare the three    hundred     sincerely yours     h hopkins hargraves     ps how did i play uncle mose   major talbot passing through the hall saw miss lydias door open and stopped  any mail for us this morning lydia dear he asked  miss lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress  the mobile chronicle came she said promptly its on the table in your study     xiv  let me feel your pulse   so i went to a doctor  how long has it been since you took any alcohol into your system he asked  turning my head sidewise i answered oh quite awhile  he was a young doctor somewhere between twenty and forty he wore heliotrope socks but he looked like napoleon i liked him immensely  now said he i am going to show you the effect of alcohol upon your circulation i think it was circulation he said though it may have been advertising  he bared my left arm to the elbow brought out a bottle of whiskey and gave me a drink he began to look more like napoleon i began to like him better  then he put a tight compress on my upper arm stopped my pulse with his fingers and squeezed a rubber bulb connected with an apparatus on a stand that looked like a thermometer the mercury jumped up and down without seeming to stop anywhere but the doctor said it registered two hundred and thirtyseven or one hundred and sixtyfive or some such number  now said he you see what alcohol does to the bloodpressure  its marvellous said i but do you think it a sufficient test have one on me and lets try the other arm but no  then he grasped my hand i thought i was doomed and he was saying goodbye but all he wanted to do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fiftycent poker chips that he had fastened to a card  its the hæmoglobin test he explained the colour of your blood is wrong  well said i i know it should be blue but this is a country of mixups some of my ancestors were cavaliers but they got thick with some people on nantucket island so  i mean said the doctor that the shade of red is too light  oh said i its a case of matching instead of matches  the doctor then pounded me severely in the region of the chest when he did that i dont know whether he reminded me most of napoleon or battling or lord nelson then he looked grave and mentioned a string of grievances that the flesh is heir tomostly ending in itis i immediately paid him fifteen dollars on account  is or are it or some or any of them necessarily fatal i asked i thought my connection with the matter justified my manifesting a certain amount of interest  all of them he answered cheerfully but their progress may be arrested with care and proper continuous treatment you may live to be eightyfive or ninety  i began to think of the doctors bill eightyfive would be sufficient i am sure was my comment i paid him ten dollars more on account  the first thing to do he said with renewed animation is to find a sanitarium where you will get a complete rest for a while and allow your nerves to get into a better condition i myself will go with you and select a suitable one  so he took me to a madhouse in the catskills it was on a bare mountain frequented only by infrequent frequenters you could see nothing but stones and boulders some patches of snow and scattered pine trees the young physician in charge was most agreeable he gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm it was luncheon time and we were invited to partake there were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room the young physician in charge came to our table and said it is a custom with our guests not to regard themselves as patients but merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation  my doctor called loudly to a waitress to bring some phosphoglycerate of lime hash dogbread bromoseltzer pancakes and nux vomica tea for my repast then a sound arose like a sudden wind storm among pine trees it was produced by every guest in the room whispering loudly neurastheniaexcept one man with a nose whom i distinctly heard say chronic alcoholism i hope to meet him again the physician in charge turned and walked away  an hour or so after luncheon he conducted us to the workshopsay fifty yards from the house thither the guests had been conducted by the physician in charges understudy and spongeholdera man with feet and a blue sweater he was so tall that i was not sure he had a face but the armour packing company would have been delighted with his hands  here said the physician in charge our guests find relaxation from past mental worries by devoting themselves to physical labourrecreation in reality  there were turninglathes carpenters outfits claymodelling tools spinningwheels weavingframes treadmills bass drums enlargedcrayonportrait apparatuses blacksmith forges and everything seemingly that could interest the paying lunatic guests of a firstrate sanitarium  the lady making mud pies in the corner whispered the physician in charge is no other thanlula lulington the authoress of the novel entitled why love loves what she is doing now is simply to rest her mind after performing that piece of work  i had seen the book why doesnt she do it by writing another one instead i asked  as you see i wasnt as far gone as they thought i was  the gentleman pouring water through the funnel continued the physician in charge is a wall street broker broken down from overwork  i buttoned my coat  others he pointed out were architects playing with noahs arks ministers reading darwins theory of evolution lawyers sawing wood tiredout society ladies talking ibsen to the bluesweatered spongeholder a neurotic millionaire lying asleep on the floor and a prominent artist drawing a little red wagon around the room  you look pretty strong said the physician in charge to me i think the best mental relaxation for you would be throwing small boulders over the mountainside and then bringing them up again  i was a hundred yards away before my doctor overtook me  whats the matter he asked  the matter is said i that there are no aeroplanes handy so i am going to merrily and hastily jog the footpathway to yon station and catch the first unlimitedsoftcoal express back to town  well said the doctor perhaps you are right this seems hardly the suitable place for you but what you need is restabsolute rest and exercise  that night i went to a hotel in the city and said to the clerk what i need is absolute rest and exercise can you give me a room with one of those tall folding beds in it and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while i rest  the clerk rubbed a speck off one of his finger nails and glanced sidewise at a tall man in a white hat sitting in the lobby that man came over and asked me politely if i had seen the shrubbery at the west entrance i had not so he showed it to me and then looked me over  i thought you had em he said not unkindly but i guess youre all right youd better go see a doctor old man  a week afterward my doctor tested my blood pressure again without the preliminary stimulant he looked to me a little less like napoleon and his socks were of a shade of tan that did not appeal to me  what you need he decided is sea air and companionship  would a mermaid i began but he slipped on his professional manner  i myself he said will take you to the hotel bonair off the coast of long island and see that you get in good shape it is a quiet comfortable resort where you will soon recuperate  the hotel bonair proved to be a ninehundredroom fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side diningroom and given only a terrapin and champagne table dhôte the bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen the corsair anchored there the day we arrived i saw mr morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel still it was a very inexpensive place nobody could afford to pay their prices when you went away you simply left your baggage stole a skiff and beat it for the mainland in the night  when i had been there one day i got a pad of monogrammed telegraph blanks at the clerks desk and began to wire to all my friends for getaway money my doctor and i played one game of croquet on the golf links and went to sleep on the lawn  when we got back to town a thought seemed to occur to him suddenly by the way he asked how do you feel  relieved of very much i replied  now a consulting physician is different he isnt exactly sure whether he is to be paid or not and this uncertainty insures you either the most careful or the most careless attention my doctor took me to see a consulting physician he made a poor guess and gave me careful attention i liked him immensely he put me through some coördination exercises  have you a pain in the back of your head he asked i told him i had not  shut your eyes he ordered put your feet close together and jump backward as far as you can  i always was a good backward jumper with my eyes shut so i obeyed my head struck the edge of the bathroom door which had been left open and was only three feet away the doctor was very sorry he had overlooked the fact that the door was open he closed it  now touch your nose with your right forefinger he said  where is it i asked  on your face said he  i mean my right forefinger i explained  oh excuse me said he he reopened the bathroom door and i took my finger out of the crack of it after i had performed the marvellous digitonasal feat i said  i do not wish to deceive you as to symptoms doctor i really have something like a pain in the back of my head he ignored the symptom and examined my heart carefully with a latestpopularairpennyintheslot eartrumpet i felt like a ballad  now he said gallop like a horse for about five minutes around the room  i gave the best imitation i could of a disqualified percheron being led out of madison square garden then without dropping in a penny he listened to my chest again  no glanders in our family doc i said  the consulting physician held up his forefinger within three inches of my nose look at my finger he commanded  did you ever try pears i began but he went on with his test rapidly  now look across the bay at my finger across the bay at my finger at my finger across the bay across the bay at my finger across the bay this for about three minutes  he explained that this was a test of the action of the brain it seemed easy to me i never once mistook his finger for the bay ill bet that if he had used the phrases gaze as it were unpreoccupied outwardor rather laterallyin the direction of the horizon underlaid so to speak with the adjacent fluid inlet and now returningor rather in a manner withdrawing your attention bestow it upon my upraised digitill bet i say that henry james himself could have passed the examination  after asking me if i had ever had a grand uncle with curvature of the spine or a cousin with swelled ankles the two doctors retired to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bath tub for their consultation i ate an apple and gazed first at my finger and then across the bay  the doctors came out looking grave more they looked tombstones and tennesseepaperspleasecopy they wrote out a diet list to which i was to be restricted it had everything that i had ever heard of to eat on it except snails and i never eat a snail unless it overtakes me and bites me first  you must follow this diet strictly said the doctors  id follow it a mile if i could get onetenth of whats on it i answered  of next importance they went on is outdoor air and exercise and here is a prescription that will be of great benefit to you  then all of us took something they took their hats and i took my departure  i went to a druggist and showed him the prescription  it will be 287 for an ounce bottle he said  will you give me a piece of your wrapping cord said i  i made a hole in the prescription ran the cord through it tied it around my neck and tucked it inside all of us have a little superstition and mine runs to a confidence in amulets  of course there was nothing the matter with me but i was very ill i couldnt work sleep eat or bowl the only way i could get any sympathy was to go without shaving for four days even then somebody would say old man you look as hardy as a pine knot been up for a jaunt in the maine woods eh  then suddenly i remembered that i must have outdoor air and exercise so i went down south to johns john is an approximate relative by verdict of a preacher standing with a little book in his hands in a bower of chrysanthemums while a hundred thousand people looked on john has a country house seven miles from pineville it is at an altitude and on the blue ridge mountains in a state too dignified to be dragged into this controversy john is mica which is more valuable and clearer than gold  he met me at pineville and we took the trolley car to his home it is a big neighbourless cottage on a hill surrounded by a hundred mountains we got off at his little private station where johns family and amaryllis met and greeted us amaryllis looked at me a trifle anxiously  a rabbit came bounding across the hill between us and the house i threw down my suitcase and pursued it hotfoot after i had run twenty yards and seen it disappear i sat down on the grass and wept disconsolately  i cant catch a rabbit any more i sobbed im of no further use in the world i may as well be dead  oh what is itwhat is it brother john i heard amaryllis say  nerves a little unstrung said john in his calm way dont worry get up you rabbitchaser and come on to the house before the biscuits get cold it was about twilight and the mountains came up nobly to miss murfrees descriptions of them  soon after dinner i announced that i believed i could sleep for a year or two including legal holidays so i was shown to a room as big and cool as a flower garden where there was a bed as broad as a lawn soon afterward the remainder of the household retired and then there fell upon the land a silence  i had not heard a silence before in years it was absolute i raised myself on my elbow and listened to it sleep i thought that if i only could hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself i could compose myself to rest i thought once that i heard a sound like the sail of a catboat flapping as it veered about in a breeze but i decided that it was probably only a tack in the carpet still i listened  suddenly some belated little bird alighted upon the windowsill and in what he no doubt considered sleepy tones enunciated the noise generally translated as cheep  i leaped into the air  hey whats the matter down there called john from his room above mine  oh nothing i answered except that i accidentally bumped my head against the ceiling  the next morning i went out on the porch and looked at the mountains there were fortyseven of them in sight i shuddered went into the big hall sitting room of the house selected pancoasts family practice of medicine from a bookcase and began to read john came in took the book away from me and led me outside he has a farm of three hundred acres furnished with the usual complement of barns mules peasantry and harrows with three front teeth broken off i had seen such things in my childhood and my heart began to sink  then john spoke of alfalfa and i brightened at once oh yes said i wasnt she in the chorus oflets see  green you know said john and tender and you plow it under after the first season  i know said i and the grass grows over her  right said john you know something about farming after all  i know something of some farmers said i and a sure scythe will mow them down some day  on the way back to the house a beautiful and inexplicable creature walked across our path i stopped irresistibly fascinated gazing at it john waited patiently smoking his cigarette he is a modern farmer after ten minutes he said are you going to stand there looking at that chicken all day breakfast is nearly ready  a chicken said i  a white orpington hen if you want to particularize  a white orpington hen i repeated with intense interest the fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity and i followed like a child after the pied piper five minutes more were allowed me by john and then he took me by the sleeve and conducted me to breakfast  after i had been there a week i began to grow alarmed i was sleeping and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life for a man in my desperate condition that would never do so i sneaked down to the trolleycar station took the car for pineville and went to see one of the best physicians in town by this time i knew exactly what to do when i needed medical treatment i hung my hat on the back of a chair and said rapidly  doctor i have cirrhosis of the heart indurated arteries neurasthenia neuritis acute indigestion and convalescence i am going to live on a strict diet i shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning i shall endeavour to be cheerful and fix my mind on pleasant subjects in the way of drugs i intend to take a phosphorous pill three times a day preferably after meals and a tonic composed of the tinctures of gentian cinchona calisaya and cardamon compound into each teaspoonful of this i shall mix tincture of nux vomica beginning with one drop and increasing it a drop each day until the maximum dose is reached i shall drop this with a medicinedropper which can be procured at a trifling cost at any pharmacy good morning  i took my hat and walked out after i had closed the door i remembered something that i had forgotten to say i opened it again the doctor had not moved from where he had been sitting but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again  i forgot to mention said i that i shall also take absolute rest and exercise  after this consultation i felt much better the reëstablishing in my mind of the fact that i was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that i almost became gloomy again there is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful  john looked after me carefully after i had evinced so much interest in his white orpington chicken he tried his best to divert my mind and was particular to lock his hen house of nights gradually the tonic mountain air the wholesome food and the daily walks among the hills so alleviated my malady that i became utterly wretched and despondent i heard of a country doctor who lived in the mountains nearby i went to see him and told him the whole story he was a graybearded man with clear blue wrinkled eyes in a homemade suit of gray jeans  in order to save time i diagnosed my case touched my nose with my right forefinger struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick sounded my chest stuck out my tongue and asked him the price of cemetery lots in pineville  he lit his pipe and looked at me for about three minutes brother he said after a while you are in a mighty bad way theres a chance for you to pull through but its a mighty slim one  what can it be i asked eagerly i have taken arsenic and gold phosphorus exercise nux vomica hydrotherapeutic baths rest excitement codein and aromatic spirits of ammonia is there anything left in the pharmacopoeia  somewhere in these mountains said the doctor theres a plant growinga flowering plant thatll cure you and its about the only thing that will its of a kind thats as old as the world but of late its powerful scarce and hard to find you and i will have to hunt it up im not engaged in active practice now im getting along in years but ill take your case youll have to come every day in the afternoon and help me hunt for this plant till we find it the city doctors may know a lot about new scientific things but they dont know much about the cures that nature carries around in her saddlebags  so every day the old doctor and i hunted the cureall plant among the mountains and valleys of the blue ridge together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves that we had to catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling we waded through gorges and chasms breastdeep with laurel and ferns we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles we wound our way like indians through brakes of pineroad side hill side river side mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant  as the old doctor said it must have grown scarce and hard to find but we followed our quest day by day we plumbed the valleys scaled the heights and tramped the plateaus in search of the miraculous plant mountainbred he never seemed to tire i often reached home too fatigued to do anything except fall into bed and sleep until morning this we kept up for a month  one evening after i had returned from a sixmile tramp with the old doctor amaryllis and i took a little walk under the trees near the road we looked at the mountains drawing their royalpurple robes around them for their nights repose  im glad youre well again she said when you first came you frightened me i thought you were really ill  well again i almost shrieked do you know that i have only one chance in a thousand to live  amaryllis looked at me in surprise why said she you are as strong as one of the ploughmules you sleep ten or twelve hours every night and you are eating us out of house and home what more do you want  i tell you said i that unless we find the magicthat is the plant we are looking forin time nothing can save me the doctor tells me so  what doctor  doctor tatumthe old doctor who lives halfway up black oak mountain do you know him  i have known him since i was able to talk and is that where you go every dayis it he who takes you on these long walks and climbs that have brought back your health and strength god bless the old doctor  just then the old doctor himself drove slowly down the road in his rickety old buggy i waved my hand at him and shouted that i would be on hand the next day at the usual time he stopped his horse and called to amaryllis to come out to him they talked for five minutes while i waited then the old doctor drove on  when we got to the house amaryllis lugged out an encyclopædia and sought a word in it the doctor said she told me that you neednt call any more as a patient but hed be glad to see you any time as a friend and then he told me to look up my name in the encyclopædia and tell you what it means it seems to be the name of a genus of flowering plants and also the name of a country girl in theocritus and virgil what do you suppose the doctor meant by that  i know what he meant said i i know now  a word to a brother who may have come under the spell of the unquiet lady neurasthenia  the formula was true even though gropingly at times the physicians of the walled cities had put their fingers upon the specific medicament  and so for the exercise one is referred to good doctor tatum on black oak mountaintake the road to your right at the methodist meeting house in the pinegrove  absolute rest and exercise  what rest more remedial than to sit with amaryllis in the shade and with a sixth sense read the wordless theocritan idyl of the goldbannered blue mountains marching orderly into the dormitories of the night     xv  october and june   the captain gazed gloomily at his sword that hung upon the wall in the closet near by was stored his faded uniform stained and worn by weather and service what a long long time it seemed since those old days of wars alarms  and now veteran that he was of his countrys strenuous times he had been reduced to abject surrender by a womans soft eyes and smiling lips as he sat in his quiet room he held in his hand the letter he had just received from herthe letter that had caused him to wear that look of gloom he reread the fatal paragraph that had destroyed his hope      in declining the honour you have done me in asking me to be    your wife i feel that i ought to speak frankly the reason    i have for so doing is the great difference between our ages    i like you very very much but i am sure that our marriage    would not be a happy one i am sorry to have to refer to this    but i believe that you will appreciate my honesty in giving    you the true reason   the captain sighed and leaned his head upon his hand yes there were many years between their ages but he was strong and rugged he had position and wealth would not his love his tender care and the advantages he could bestow upon her make her forget the question of age besides he was almost sure that she cared for him  the captain was a man of prompt action in the field he had been distinguished for his decisiveness and energy he would see her and plead his cause again in person agewhat was it to come between him and the one he loved  in two hours he stood ready in light marching order for his greatest battle he took the train for the old southern town in tennessee where she lived  theodora deming was on the steps of the handsome porticoed old mansion enjoying the summer twilight when the captain entered the gate and came up the gravelled walk she met him with a smile that was free from embarrassment as the captain stood on the step below her the difference in their ages did not appear so great he was tall and straight and cleareyed and browned she was in the bloom of lovely womanhood  i wasnt expecting you said theodora but now that youve come you may sit on the step didnt you get my letter  i did said the captain and thats why i came i say now theo reconsider your answer wont you  theodora smiled softly upon him he carried his years well she was really fond of his strength his wholesome looks his manlinessperhaps if  no no she said shaking her head positively its out of the question i like you a whole lot but marrying wont do my age and yours arebut dont make me say it againi told you in my letter  the captain flushed a little through the bronze on his face he was silent for a while gazing sadly into the twilight beyond a line of woods that he could see was a field where the boys in blue had once bivouacked on their march toward the sea how long ago it seemed now truly fate and father time had tricked him sorely just a few years interposed between himself and happiness  theodoras hand crept down and rested in the clasp of his firm brown one she felt at least that sentiment that is akin to love  dont take it so hard please she said gently its all for the best ive reasoned it out very wisely all by myself some day youll be glad i didnt marry you it would be very nice and lovely for a whilebut just think in only a few short years what different tastes we would have one of us would want to sit by the fireside and read and maybe nurse neuralgia or rheumatism of evenings while the other would be crazy for balls and theatres and late suppers no my dear friend while it isnt exactly january and may its a clear case of october and pretty early in june  id always do what you wanted me to do theo if you wanted to  no you wouldnt you think now that you would but you wouldnt please dont ask me any more  the captain had lost his battle but he was a gallant warrior and when he rose to make his final adieu his mouth was grimly set and his shoulders were squared  he took the train for the north that night on the next evening he was back in his room where his sword was hanging against the wall he was dressing for dinner tying his white tie into a very careful bow and at the same time he was indulging in a pensive soliloquy  pon my honour i believe theo was right after all nobody can deny that shes a peach but she must be twentyeight at the very kindest calculation  for you see the captain was only nineteen and his sword had never been drawn except on the parade ground at chattanooga which was as near as he ever got to the spanishamerican war     xvi  the church with an overshotwheel   lakelands is not to be found in the catalogues of fashionable summer resorts it lies on a low spur of the cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the clinch river lakelands proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn narrowgauge railroad line you wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into lakelands from fright and loneliness or whether lakelands got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the cars to carry it home  you wonder again why it was named lakelands there are no lakes and the lands about are too poor to be worth mentioning  half a mile from the village stands the eagle house a big roomy old mansion run by josiah rankin for the accommodation of visitors who desire the mountain air at inexpensive rates the eagle house is delightfully mismanaged it is full of ancient instead of modern improvements and it is altogether as comfortably neglected and pleasingly disarranged as your own home but you are furnished with clean rooms and good and abundant fare yourself and the piny woods must do the rest nature has provided a mineral spring grapevine swings and croqueteven the wickets are wooden you have art to thank only for the fiddleandguitar music twice a week at the hop in the rustic pavilion  the patrons of the eagle house are those who seek recreation as a necessity as well as a pleasure they are busy people who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnights winding to insure a years running of their wheels you will find students there from the lower towns now and then an artist or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills a few quiet families spend the summers there and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to lakelands as schoolmarms  a quarter of a mile from the eagle house was what would have been described to its guests as an object of interest in the catalogue had the eagle house issued a catalogue this was an old old mill that was no longer a mill in the words of josiah rankin it was the only church in the united states sah with an overshotwheel and the only mill in the world sah with pews and a pipe organ the guests of the eagle house attended the old mill church each sabbath and heard the preacher liken the purified christian to bolted flour ground to usefulness between the millstones of experience and suffering  every year about the beginning of autumn there came to the eagle house one abram strong who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest in lakelands he was called father abram because his hair was so white his face so strong and kind and florid his laugh so merry and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance even new guests after three or four days acquaintance gave him this familiar title  father abram came a long way to lakelands he lived in a big roaring town in the northwest where he owned mills not little mills with pews and an organ in them but great ugly mountainlike mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an antheap and now you must be told about father abram and the mill that was a church for their stories run together  in the days when the church was a mill mr strong was the miller there was no jollier dustier busier happier miller in all the land than he he lived in a little cottage across the road from the mill his hand was heavy but his toll was light and the mountaineers brought their grain to him across many weary miles of rocky roads  the delight of the millers life was his little daughter aglaia that was a brave name truly for a flaxenhaired toddler but the mountaineers love sonorous and stately names the mother had encountered it somewhere in a book and the deed was done in her babyhood aglaia herself repudiated the name as far as common use went and persisted in calling herself dums the miller and his wife often tried to coax from aglaia the source of this mysterious name but without results at last they arrived at a theory in the little garden behind the cottage was a bed of rhododendrons in which the child took a peculiar delight and interest it may have been that she perceived in dums a kinship to the formidable name of her favourite flowers  when aglaia was four years old she and her father used to go through a little performance in the mill every afternoon that never failed to come off the weather permitting when supper was ready her mother would brush her hair and put on a clean apron and send her across to the mill to bring her father home when the miller saw her coming in the mill door he would come forward all white with the flour dust and wave his hand and sing an old millers song that was familiar in those parts and ran something like this      the wheel goes round     the grist is ground        the dusty millers merry     he sings all day     his work is play        while thinking of his dearie   then aglaia would run to him laughing and call  dada come take dums home and the miller would swing her to his shoulder and march over to supper singing the millers song every evening this would take place  one day only a week after her fourth birthday aglaia disappeared when last seen she was plucking wild flowers by the side of the road in front of the cottage a little while later her mother went out to see that she did not stray too far away and she was already gone  of course every effort was made to find her the neighbours gathered and searched the woods and the mountains for miles around they dragged every foot of the mill race and the creek for a long distance below the dam never a trace of her did they find a night or two before there had been a family of wanderers camped in a grove near by it was conjectured that they might have stolen the child but when their wagon was overtaken and searched she could not be found  the miller remained at the mill for nearly two years and then his hope of finding her died out he and his wife moved to the northwest in a few years he was the owner of a modern mill in one of the important milling cities in that region mrs strong never recovered from the shock caused by the loss of aglaia and two years after they moved away the miller was left to bear his sorrow alone  when abram strong became prosperous he paid a visit to lakelands and the old mill the scene was a sad one for him but he was a strong man and always appeared cheery and kindly it was then that he was inspired to convert the old mill into a church lakelands was too poor to build one and the still poorer mountaineers could not assist there was no place of worship nearer than twenty miles  the miller altered the appearance of the mill as little as possible the big overshotwheel was left in its place the young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood the dam was partly destroyed and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed inside the mill the changes were greater the shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were of course all removed there were two rows of benches with aisles between and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end on three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats and reached by a stairway inside there was also an organa real pipe organin the gallery that was the pride of the congregation of the old mill church miss phoebe summers was the organist the lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each sundays service the rev mr banbridge was the preacher and rode down from squirrel gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service and abram strong paid for everything he paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year and miss phoebe two hundred dollars  thus in memory of aglaia the old mill was converted into a blessing for the community in which she had once lived it seemed that the brief life of the child had brought about more good than the three score years and ten of many but abram strong set up yet another monument to her memory  out from his mills in the northwest came the aglaia flour made from the hardest and finest wheat that could be raised the country soon found out that the aglaia flour had two prices one was the highest market price and the other wasnothing  wherever there happened a calamity that left people destitutea fire a flood a tornado a strike or a famine there would go hurrying a generous consignment of the aglaia at its nothing price it was given away cautiously and judiciously but it was freely given and not a penny could the hungry ones pay for it there got to be a saying that whenever there was a disastrous fire in the poor districts of a city the fire chiefs buggy reached the scene first next the aglaia flour wagon and then the fire engines  so this was abram strongs other monument to aglaia perhaps to a poet the theme may seem too utilitarian for beauty but to some the fancy will seem sweet and fine that the pure white virgin flour flying on its mission of love and charity might be likened to the spirit of the lost child whose memory it signalized  there came a year that brought hard times to the cumberlands grain crops everywhere were light and there were no local crops at all mountain floods had done much damage to property even game in the woods was so scarce that the hunters brought hardly enough home to keep their folk alive especially about lakelands was the rigour felt  as soon as abram strong heard of this his messages flew and the little narrowgauge cars began to unload aglaia flour there the millers orders were to store the flour in the gallery of the old mill church and that every one who attended the church was to carry home a sack of it  two weeks after that abram strong came for his yearly visit to the eagle house and became father abram again  that season the eagle house had fewer guests than usual among them was rose chester miss chester came to lakelands from atlanta where she worked in a department store this was the first vacation outing of her life the wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the eagle house she had taken a fancy to rose and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks holiday the managers wife gave her a letter to mrs rankin who gladly received her in her own charge and care  miss chester was not very strong she was about twenty and pale and delicate from an indoor life but one week of lakelands gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully the time was early september when the cumberlands are at their greatest beauty the mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours one breathed aerial champagne the nights were deliciously cool causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the eagle house  father abram and miss chester became great friends the old miller learned her story from mrs rankin and his interest went out quickly to the slender lonely girl who was making her own way in the world  the mountain country was new to miss chester she had lived many years in the warm flat town of atlanta and the grandeur and variety of the cumberlands delighted her she was determined to enjoy every moment of her stay her little hoard of savings had been estimated so carefully in connection with her expenses that she knew almost to a penny what her very small surplus would be when she returned to work  miss chester was fortunate in gaining father abram for a friend and companion he knew every road and peak and slope of the mountains near lakelands through him she became acquainted with the solemn delight of the shadowy tilted aisles of the pine forests the dignity of the bare crags the crystal tonic mornings the dreamy golden afternoons full of mysterious sadness so her health improved and her spirits grew light she had a laugh as genial and hearty in its feminine way as the famous laugh of father abram both of them were natural optimists and both knew how to present a serene and cheerful face to the world  one day miss chester learned from one of the guests the history of father abrams lost child quickly she hurried away and found the miller seated on his favourite rustic bench near the chalybeate spring he was surprised when his little friend slipped her hand into his and looked at him with tears in her eyes  oh father abram she said im so sorry i didnt know until today about your little daughter you will find her yet some day oh i hope you will  the miller looked down at her with his strong ready smile  thank you miss rose he said in his usual cheery tones but i do not expect to find aglaia for a few years i hoped that she had been stolen by vagrants and that she still lived but i have lost that hope i believe that she was drowned  i can understand said miss chester how the doubt must have made it so hard to bear and yet you are so cheerful and so ready to make other peoples burdens light good father abram  good miss rose mimicked the miller smiling who thinks of others more than you do  a whimsical mood seemed to strike miss chester  oh father abram she cried wouldnt it be grand if i should prove to be your daughter wouldnt it be romantic and wouldnt you like to have me for a daughter  indeed i would said the miller heartily if aglaia had lived i could wish for nothing better than for her to have grown up to be just such a little woman as you are maybe you are aglaia he continued falling in with her playful mood cant you remember when we lived at the mill  miss chester fell swiftly into serious meditation her large eyes were fixed vaguely upon something in the distance father abram was amused at her quick return to seriousness she sat thus for a long time before she spoke  no she said at length with a long sigh i cant remember anything at all about a mill i dont think that i ever saw a flour mill in my life until i saw your funny little church and if i were your little girl i would remember it wouldnt i im so sorry father abram  so am i said father abram humouring her but if you cannot remember that you are my little girl miss rose surely you can recollect being some one elses you remember your own parents of course  oh yes i remember them very wellespecially my father he wasnt a bit like you father abram oh i was only making believe come now youve rested long enough you promised to show me the pool where you can see the trout playing this afternoon i never saw a trout  late one afternoon father abram set out for the old mill alone he often went to sit and think of the old days when he lived in the cottage across the road time had smoothed away the sharpness of his grief until he no longer found the memory of those times painful but whenever abram strong sat in the melancholy september afternoons on the spot where dums used to run in every day with her yellow curls flying the smile that lakelands always saw upon his face was not there  the miller made his way slowly up the winding steep road the trees crowded so close to the edge of it that he walked in their shade with his hat in his hand squirrels ran playfully upon the old rail fence at his right quails were calling to their young broods in the wheat stubble the low sun sent a torrent of pale gold up the ravine that opened to the west early septemberit was within a few days only of the anniversary of aglaias disappearance  the old overshotwheel half covered with mountain ivy caught patches of the warm sunlight filtering through the trees the cottage across the road was still standing but it would doubtless go down before the next winters mountain blasts it was overrun with morning glory and wild gourd vines and the door hung by one hinge  father abram pushed open the mill door and entered softly and then he stood still wondering he heard the sound of some one within weeping inconsolably he looked and saw miss chester sitting in a dim pew with her head bowed upon an open letter that her hands held  father abram went to her and laid one of his strong hands firmly upon hers she looked up breathed his name and tried to speak further  not yet miss rose said the miller kindly dont try to talk yet theres nothing as good for you as a nice quiet little cry when you are feeling blue  it seemed that the old miller who had known so much sorrow himself was a magician in driving it away from others miss chesters sobs grew easier presently she took her little plainbordered handkerchief and wiped away a drop or two that had fallen from her eyes upon father abrams big hand then she looked up and smiled through her tears miss chester could always smile before her tears had dried just as father abram could smile through his own grief in that way the two were very much alike  the miller asked her no questions but by and by miss chester began to tell him  it was the old story that always seems so big and important to the young and that brings reminiscent smiles to their elders love was the theme as may be supposed there was a young man in atlanta full of all goodness and the graces who had discovered that miss chester also possessed these qualities above all other people in atlanta or anywhere else from greenland to patagonia she showed father abram the letter over which she had been weeping it was a manly tender letter a little superlative and urgent after the style of love letters written by young men full of goodness and the graces he proposed for miss chesters hand in marriage at once life he said since her departure for a threeweeks visit was not to be endured he begged for an immediate answer and if it were favourable he promised to fly ignoring the narrowgauge railroad at once to lakelands  and now where does the trouble come in asked the miller when he had read the letter  i cannot marry him said miss chester  do you want to marry him asked father abram  oh i love him she answered but down went her head and she sobbed again  come miss rose said the miller you can give me your confidence i do not question you but i think you can trust me  i do trust you said the girl i will tell you why i must refuse ralph i am nobody i havent even a name the name i call myself is a lie ralph is a noble man i love him with all my heart but i can never be his  what talk is this said father abram you said that you remember your parents why do you say you have no name i do not understand  i do remember them said miss chester i remember them too well my first recollections are of our life somewhere in the far south we moved many times to different towns and states i have picked cotton and worked in factories and have often gone without enough food and clothes my mother was sometimes good to me my father was always cruel and beat me i think they were both idle and unsettled  one night when we were living in a little town on a river near atlanta they had a great quarrel it was while they were abusing and taunting each other that i learnedoh father abram i learned that i didnt even have the right to bedont you understand i had no right even to a name i was nobody  i ran away that night i walked to atlanta and found work i gave myself the name of rose chester and have earned my own living ever since now you know why i cannot marry ralphand oh i can never tell him why  better than any sympathy more helpful than pity was father abrams depreciation of her woes  why dear dear is that all he said fie fie i thought something was in the way if this perfect young man is a man at all he will not care a pinch of bran for your family tree dear miss rose take my word for it it is yourself he cares for tell him frankly just as you have told me and ill warrant that he will laugh at your story and think all the more of you for it  i shall never tell him said miss chester sadly and i shall never marry him nor any one else i have not the right  but they saw a long shadow come bobbing up the sunlit road and then came a shorter one bobbing by its side and presently two strange figures approached the church the long shadow was made by miss phoebe summers the organist come to practise tommy teague aged twelve was responsible for the shorter shadow it was tommys day to pump the organ for miss phoebe and his bare toes proudly spurned the dust of the road  miss phoebe in her lilacspray chintz dress with her accurate little curls hanging over each ear courtesied low to father abram and shook her curls ceremoniously at miss chester then she and her assistant climbed the steep stairway to the organ loft  in the gathering shadows below father abram and miss chester lingered they were silent and it is likely that they were busy with their memories miss chester sat leaning her head on her hand with her eyes fixed far away father abram stood in the next pew looking thoughtfully out of the door at the road and the ruined cottage  suddenly the scene was transformed for him back almost a score of years into the past for as tommy pumped away miss phoebe struck a low bass note on the organ and held it to test the volume of air that it contained the church ceased to exist so far as father abram was concerned the deep booming vibration that shook the little frame building was no note from an organ but the humming of the mill machinery he felt sure that the old overshotwheel was turning that he was back again a dusty merry miller in the old mountain mill and now evening was come and soon would come aglaia with flying colours toddling across the road to take him home to supper father abrams eyes were fixed upon the broken door of the cottage  and then came another wonder in the gallery overhead the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows perhaps a mouse had been at one of them anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour covering father abram from head to foot with the white dust and then the old miller stepped into the aisle and waved his arms and began to sing the millers song      the wheel goes round     the grist is ground        the dusty millers merry   and then the rest of the miracle happened miss chester was leaning forward from her pew as pale as the flour itself her wideopen eyes staring at father abram like one in a waking dream when he began the song she stretched out her arms to him her lips moved she called to him in dreamy tones dada come take dums home  miss phoebe released the low key of the organ but her work had been well done the note that she struck had beaten down the doors of a closed memory and father abram held his lost aglaia close in his arms  when you visit lakelands they will tell you more of this story they will tell you how the lines of it were afterward traced and the history of the millers daughter revealed after the gipsy wanderers had stolen her on that september day attracted by her childish beauty but you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the eagle house and then you can have the story at your ease it seems best that our part of it should close while miss phoebes deep bass note was yet reverberating softly  and yet to my mind the finest thing of it all happened while father abram and his daughter were walking back to the eagle house in the long twilight almost too glad to speak  father she said somewhat timidly and doubtfully have you a great deal of money  a great deal said the miller well that depends there is plenty unless you want to buy the moon or something equally expensive  would it cost very very much asked aglaia who had always counted her dimes so carefully to send a telegram to atlanta  ah said father abram with a little sigh i see you want to ask ralph to come  aglaia looked up at him with a tender smile  i want to ask him to wait she said i have just found my father and i want it to be just we two for a while i want to tell him he will have to wait     xvii  new york by camp fire light   away out in the creek nation we learned things about new york  we were on a hunting trip and were camped one night on the bank of a little stream bud kingsbury was our skilled hunter and guide and it was from his lips that we had explanations of manhattan and the queer folks that inhabit it bud had once spent a month in the metropolis and a week or two at other times and he was pleased to discourse to us of what he had seen  fifty yards away from our camp was pitched the teepee of a wandering family of indians that had come up and settled there for the night an old old indian woman was trying to build a fire under an iron pot hung upon three sticks  bud went over to her assistance and soon had her fire going when he came back we complimented him playfully upon his gallantry  oh said bud dont mention it its a way i have whenever i see a lady trying to cook things in a pot and having trouble i always go to the rescue i done the same thing once in a hightoned house in new york city heap big society teepee on fifth avenue that injun lady kind of recalled it to my mind yes i endeavours to be polite and help the ladies out  the camp demanded the particulars  i was manager of the triangle b ranch in the panhandle said bud it was owned at that time by old man sterling of new york he wanted to sell out and he wrote for me to come on to new york and explain the ranch to the syndicate that wanted to buy so i sends to fort worth and has a forty dollar suit of clothes made and hits the trail for the big village  well when i got there old man sterling and his outfit certainly laid themselves out to be agreeable we had business and pleasure so mixed up that you couldnt tell whether it was a treat or a trade half the time we had trolley rides and cigars and theatre roundups and rubber parties  rubber parties said a listener inquiringly  sure said bud didnt you never attend em you walk around and try to look at the tops of the skyscrapers well we sold the ranch and old man sterling asks me round to his house to take grub on the night before i started back it wasnt any highcollared affairjust me and the old man and his wife and daughter but they was a finehaired outfit all right and the lilies of the field wasnt in it they made my fort worth clothes carpenter look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings and then the table was all pompous with flowers and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybodys plate youd have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub but id been in new york over a week then and i was getting on to stylish ways i kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies and then i tackled the chuck with the same weapons it aint much trouble to travel with the highflyers after you find out their gait  i got along fine i was feeling cool and agreeable and pretty soon i was talking away fluent as you please all about the ranch and the west and telling em how the indians eat grasshopper stew and snakes and you never saw people so interested  but the real joy of that feast was that miss sterling just a little trick she was not bigger than two bits worth of chewing plug but she had a way about her that seemed to say she was the people and you believed it and yet she never put on any airs and she smiled at me the same as if i was a millionaire while i was telling about a creek dog feast and listened like it was news from home  by and by after we had eat oysters and some watery soup and truck that never was in my repertory a methodist preacher brings in a kind of camp stove arrangement all silver on long legs with a lamp under it  miss sterling lights up and begins to do some cooking right on the supper table i wondered why old man sterling didnt hire a cook with all the money he had pretty soon she dished out some cheesy tasting truck that she said was rabbit but i swear there had never been a molly cotton tail in a mile of it  the last thing on the programme was lemonade it was brought around in little flat glass bowls and set by your plate i was pretty thirsty and i picked up mine and took a big swig of it right there was where the little lady had made a mistake she had put in the lemon all right but shed forgot the sugar the best housekeepers slip up sometimes i thought maybe miss sterling was just learning to keep house and cookthat rabbit would surely make you think soand i says to myself little lady sugar or no sugar ill stand by you and i raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade and then all the balance of em picks up their bowls and does the same and then i gives miss sterling the laugh proper just to carry it off like a joke so she wouldnt feel bad about the mistake  after we all went into the sitting room she sat down and talked to me quite awhile  it was so kind of you mr kingsbury says she to bring my blunder off so nicely it was so stupid of me to forget the sugar  never you mind says i some lucky man will throw his rope over a mighty elegant little housekeeper some day not far from here  if you mean me mr kingsbury says she laughing out loud i hope he will be as lenient with my poor housekeeping as you have been  dont mention it says i anything to oblige the ladies  bud ceased his reminiscences and then some one asked him what he considered the most striking and prominent trait of new yorkers  the most visible and peculiar trait of new york folks answered bud is new york most of em has new york on the brain they have heard of other places such as waco and paris and hot springs and london but they dont believe in em they think that town is all merino now to show you how much they care for their village ill tell you about one of em that strayed out as far as the triangle b while i was working there  this new yorker come out there looking for a job on the ranch he said he was a good horseback rider and there was pieces of tanbark hanging on his clothes yet from his riding school  well for a while they put him to keeping books in the ranch store for he was a devil at figures but he got tired of that and asked for something more in the line of activity the boys on the ranch liked him all right but he made us tired shouting new york all the time every night hed tell us about east river and j p morgan and the eden musee and hetty green and central park till we used to throw tin plates and branding irons at him  one day this chap gets on a pitching pony and the pony kind of sidled up his back and went to eating grass while the new yorker was coming down  he come down on his head on a chunk of mesquit wood and he didnt show any designs toward getting up again we laid him out in a tent and he begun to look pretty dead so gideon pease saddles up and burns the wind for old doc sleepers residence in dogtown thirty miles away  the doctor comes over and he investigates the patient  boys says he you might as well go to playing sevenup for his saddle and clothes for his heads fractured and if he lives ten minutes it will be a remarkable case of longevity  of course we didnt gamble for the poor roosters saddlethat was one of docs jokes but we stood around feeling solemn and all of us forgive him for having talked us to death about new york  i never saw anybody about to hand in his checks act more peaceful than this fellow his eyes were fixed way up in the air and he was using rambling words to himself all about sweet music and beautiful streets and whiterobed forms and he was smiling like dying was a pleasure  hes about gone now said doc whenever they begin to think they see heaven its all off  blamed if that new york man didnt sit right up when he heard the doc say that  say says he kind of disappointed was that heaven confound it all i thought it was broadway some of you fellows get my clothes im going to get up  and ill be blamed concluded bud if he wasnt on the train with a ticket for new york in his pocket four days afterward     xviii  the adventures of shamrock jolnes   i am so fortunate as to count shamrock jolnes the great new york detective among my muster of friends jolnes is what is called the inside man of the city detective force he is an expert in the use of the typewriter and it is his duty whenever there is a murder mystery to be solved to sit at a desk telephone at headquarters and take down the messages of cranks who phone in their confessions to having committed the crime  but on certain off days when confessions are coming in slowly and three or four newspapers have run to earth as many different guilty persons jolnes will knock about the town with me exhibiting to my great delight and instruction his marvellous powers of observation and deduction  the other day i dropped in at headquarters and found the great detective gazing thoughtfully at a string that was tied tightly around his little finger  good morning whatsup he said without turning his head im glad to notice that youve had your house fitted up with electric lights at last  will you please tell me i said in surprise how you knew that i am sure that i never mentioned the fact to any one and the wiring was a rush order not completed until this morning  nothing easier said jolnes genially as you came in i caught the odour of the cigar you are smoking i know an expensive cigar and i know that not more than three men in new york can afford to smoke cigars and pay gas bills too at the present time that was an easy one but i am working just now on a little problem of my own  why have you that string on your finger i asked  thats the problem said jolnes my wife tied that on this morning to remind me of something i was to send up to the house sit down whatsup and excuse me for a few moments  the distinguished detective went to a wall telephone and stood with the receiver to his ear for probably ten minutes  were you listening to a confession i asked when he had returned to his chair  perhaps said jolnes with a smile it might be called something of the sort to be frank with you whatsup ive cut out the dope ive been increasing the quantity for so long that morphine doesnt have much effect on me any more ive got to have something more powerful that telephone i just went to is connected with a room in the waldorf where theres an authors reading in progress now to get at the solution of this string  after five minutes of silent pondering jolnes looked at me with a smile and nodded his head  wonderful man i exclaimed already  it is quite simple he said holding up his finger you see that knot that is to prevent my forgetting it is therefore a forgetmeknot a forgetmenot is a flower it was a sack of flour that i was to send home  beautiful i could not help crying out in admiration  suppose we go out for a ramble suggested jolnes  there is only one case of importance on hand just now old man mccarty one hundred and four years old died from eating too many bananas the evidence points so strongly to the mafia that the police have surrounded the second avenue katzenjammer gambrinus club no 2 and the capture of the assassin is only the matter of a few hours the detective force has not yet been called on for assistance  jolnes and i went out and up the street toward the corner where we were to catch a surface car  halfway up the block we met rheingelder an acquaintance of ours who held a city hall position  good morning rheingelder said jolnes halting  nice breakfast that was you had this morning  always on the lookout for the detectives remarkable feats of deduction i saw jolness eye flash for an instant upon a long yellow splash on the shirt bosom and a smaller one upon the chin of rheingelderboth undoubtedly made by the yolk of an egg  oh dot is some of your detectiveness said rheingelder shaking all over with a smile vell i pet you trinks und cigars all round dot you cannot tell vot i haf eaten for breakfast  done said jolnes sausage pumpernickel and coffee  rheingelder admitted the correctness of the surmise and paid the bet when we had proceeded on our way i said to jolnes  i thought you looked at the egg spilled on his chin and shirt front  i did said jolnes that is where i began my deduction rheingelder is a very economical saving man yesterday eggs dropped in the market to twentyeight cents per dozen today they are quoted at fortytwo rheingelder ate eggs yesterday and today he went back to his usual fare a little thing like this isnt anything whatsup it belongs to the primary arithmetic class  when we boarded the street car we found the seats all occupiedprincipally by ladies jolnes and i stood on the rear platform  about the middle of the car there sat an elderly man with a short gray beard who looked to be the typical welldressed new yorker at successive corners other ladies climbed aboard and soon three or four of them were standing over the man clinging to straps and glaring meaningly at the man who occupied the coveted seat but he resolutely retained his place  we new yorkers i remarked to jolnes have about lost our manners as far as the exercise of them in public goes  perhaps so said jolnes lightly but the man you evidently refer to happens to be a very chivalrous and courteous gentleman from old virginia he is spending a few days in new york with his wife and two daughters and he leaves for the south tonight  you know him then i said in amazement  i never saw him before we stepped on the car declared the detective smilingly  by the gold tooth of the witch of endor i cried if you can construe all that from his appearance you are dealing in nothing else than black art  the habit of observationnothing more said jolnes if the old gentleman gets off the car before we do i think i can demonstrate to you the accuracy of my deduction  three blocks farther along the gentleman rose to leave the car jolnes addressed him at the door  pardon me sir but are you not colonel hunter of norfolk virginia  no suh was the extremely courteous answer my name suh is ellisonmajor winfield r ellison from fairfax county in the same state i know a good many people suh in norfolkthe goodriches the tollivers and the crabtrees suh but i never had the pleasure of meeting yo friend colonel hunter i am happy to say suh that i am going back to virginia tonight after having spent a week in yo city with my wife and three daughters i shall be in norfolk in about ten days and if you will give me yo name suh i will take pleasure in looking up colonel hunter and telling him that you inquired after him suh  thank you said jolnes tell him that reynolds sent his regards if you will be so kind  i glanced at the great new york detective and saw that a look of intense chagrin had come upon his clearcut features failure in the slightest point always galled shamrock jolnes  did you say your three daughters he asked of the virginia gentleman  yes suh my three daughters all as fine girls as there are in fairfax county was the answer  with that major ellison stopped the car and began to descend the step  shamrock jolnes clutched his arm  one moment sir he begged in an urbane voice in which i alone detected the anxietyam i not right in believing that one of the young ladies is an adopted daughter  you are suh admitted the major from the ground but how the devil you knew it suh is mo than i can tell  and mo than i can tell too i said as the car went on  jolnes was restored to his calm observant serenity by having wrested victory from his apparent failure so after we got off the car he invited me into a café promising to reveal the process of his latest wonderful feat  in the first place he began after we were comfortably seated i knew the gentleman was no new yorker because he was flushed and uneasy and restless on account of the ladies that were standing although he did not rise and give them his seat i decided from his appearance that he was a southerner rather than a westerner  next i began to figure out his reason for not relinquishing his seat to a lady when he evidently felt strongly but not overpoweringly impelled to do so i very quickly decided upon that i noticed that one of his eyes had received a severe jab in one corner which was red and inflamed and that all over his face were tiny round marks about the size of the end of an uncut lead pencil also upon both of his patent leather shoes were a number of deep imprints shaped like ovals cut off square at one end  now there is only one district in new york city where a man is bound to receive scars and wounds and indentations of that sortand that is along the sidewalks of twentythird street and a portion of sixth avenue south of there i knew from the imprints of trampling french heels on his feet and the marks of countless jabs in the face from umbrellas and parasols carried by women in the shopping district that he had been in conflict with the amazonian troops and as he was a man of intelligent appearance i knew he would not have braved such dangers unless he had been dragged thither by his own women folk therefore when he got on the car his anger at the treatment he had received was sufficient to make him keep his seat in spite of his traditions of southern chivalry  that is all very well i said but why did you insist upon daughtersand especially two daughters why couldnt a wife alone have taken him shopping  there had to be daughters said jolnes calmly if he had only a wife and she near his own age he could have bluffed her into going alone if he had a young wife she would prefer to go alone so there you are  ill admit that i said but now why two daughters and how in the name of all the prophets did you guess that one was adopted when he told you he had three  dont say guess said jolnes with a touch of pride in his air there is no such word in the lexicon of ratiocination in major ellisons buttonhole there was a carnation and a rosebud backed by a geranium leaf no woman ever combined a carnation and a rosebud into a boutonniere close your eyes whatsup and give the logic of your imagination a chance cannot you see the lovely adele fastening the carnation to the lapel so that papa may be gay upon the street and then the romping edith may dancing up with sisterly jealousy to add her rosebud to the adornment  and then i cried beginning to feel enthusiasm when he declared that he had three daughters  i could see said jolnes one in the background who added no flower and i knew that she must be  adopted i broke in i give you every credit but how did you know he was leaving for the south tonight  in his breast pocket said the great detective something large and oval made a protuberance good liquor is scarce on trains and it is a long journey from new york to fairfax county  again i must bow to you i said and tell me this so that my last shred of doubt will be cleared away why did you decide that he was from virginia  it was very faint i admit answered shamrock jolnes but no trained observer could have failed to detect the odour of mint in the car     xix  the lady higher up   new york city they said was deserted and that accounted doubtless for the sounds carrying so far in the tranquil summer air the breeze was southbysouthwest the hour was midnight the theme was a bit of feminine gossip by wireless mythology three hundred and sixtyfive feet above the heated asphalt the tiptoeing symbolic deity on manhattan pointed her vacillating arrow straight for the time in the direction of her exalted sister on liberty island the lights of the great garden were out the benches in the square were filled with sleepers in postures so strange that beside them the writhing figures in dores illustrations of the inferno would have straightened into tailors dummies the statue of diana on the tower of the gardenits constancy shown by its weathercock ways its innocence by the coating of gold that it has acquired its devotion to style by its single graceful flying scarf its candour and artlessness by its habit of ever drawing the long bow its metropolitanism by its posture of swift flight to catch a harlem trainremained poised with its arrow pointed across the upper bay had that arrow sped truly and horizontally it would have passed fifty feet above the head of the heroic matron whose duty it is to offer a castironical welcome to the oppressed of other lands  seaward this lady gazed and the furrows between steamship lines began to cut steerage rates the translators too have put an extra burden upon her liberty lighting the world as her creator christened her would have had a no more responsible duty except for the size of it than that of an electrician or a standard oil magnate but to enlighten the world as our learned civic guardians englished it requires abler qualities and so poor liberty instead of having a sinecure as a mere illuminator must be converted into a chautauqua schoolmaam with the oceans for her field instead of the placid classic lake with a fireless torch and an empty head must she dispel the shadows of the world and teach it its a b cs  ah there mrs liberty called a clear rollicking soprano voice through the still midnight air  is that you miss diana excuse my not turning my head im not as flighty and whirlywhirly as some and tis so hoarse i am i can hardly talk on account of the peanuthulls left on the stairs in me throat by that last boatload of tourists from marietta ohio tis after being a fine evening miss  if you dont mind my asking came the belllike tones of the golden statue id like to know

ye wasnt so lightheaded and giddy yed know that i was made by a dago and presented to the american people on behalf of the french government for the purpose of welcomin irish immigrants into the dutch city of new york tis that ive been doing night and day since i was erected ye must know miss diana that tis with statues the same as with peopletis not their makers nor the purposes for which they were created that influence the operations of their tongues at allits the associations with which they become associated im telling ye  youre dead right agreed diana i notice it on myself if any of the old guys from olympus were to come along and hand me any hot air in the ancient greek i couldnt tell it from a conversation between a coney island car conductor and a fivecent fare  im right glad yeve made up your mind to be sociable miss diana said mrs liberty tis a lonesome life i have down here is there anything doin up in the city miss diana dear  oh la la lano said diana notice that la la la aunt liberty got that from paris by night on the roof garden under me youll hear that la la la at the café mccann now along with garsong the bohemian crowd there have become tired of garsong since orafferty the head waiter punched three of them for calling him it oh no the towns strickly on the bum these nights everybodys away saw a downtown merchant on a roof garden this evening with his stenographer show was so dull he went to sleep a waiter biting on a dime tip to see if it was good half woke him up he looks around and sees his little pothooks perpetrator hm says he will you take a letter miss de st montmorency sure in a minute says she if youll make it an x  that was the best thing happened on the roof so you see how dull it is la la la  tis fine ye have it up there in society

lonesome down there with so much water around you i dont see how you ever keep your hair in curl and that mother hubbard you are wearing went out ten years ago i think those sculptor guys ought to be held for damages for putting iron or marble clothes on a lady thats where mr st gaudens was wise im always a little ahead of the styles but theyre coming my way pretty fast excuse my back a momenti

your job aunt liberty youre all right all right     xx  the greater coney   next sunday said dennis carnahan ill be after going down to see the new coney island thats risen like a phoenix bird from the ashes of the old resort im going with norah flynn and well fall victims to all the dry goods deceptions from the redflannel eruption of mount vesuvius to the pink silk ribbons on the racesuicide problems in the incubator kiosk  was i there before i was i was there last tuesday did i see the sights i did not  last monday i amalgamated myself with the bricklayers union and in accordance with the rules i was ordered to quit work the same day on account of a sympathy strike with the lady salmon canners lodge no2 of tacoma washington  twas disturbed i was in mind and proclivities by losing me job bein already harassed in me soul on account of havin quarrelled with norah flynn a week before by reason of hard words spoken at the dairymen and streetsprinkler drivers semiannual ball caused by jealousy and prickly heat and that divil andy coghlin  so i says it will be coney for tuesday and if the chutes and the short change and the greencorn silk between the teeth dont create diversions and get me feeling better then i dont know at all  ye will have heard that coney has received moral reconstruction the old bowery where they used to take your tintype by force and give ye knockout drops before having your palm read is now called the wall street of the island the wienerwurst stands are required by law to keep a news ticker in em and the doughnuts are examined every four years by a retired steamboat inspector the nigger mans head that was used by the old patrons to throw baseballs at is now illegal and by order of the police commissioner the image of a man drivin an automobile has been substituted i hear that the old immoral amusements have been suppressed people who used to go down from new york to sit in the sand and dabble in the surf now give up their quarters to squeeze through turnstiles and see imitations of city fires and floods painted on canvas the reprehensible and degradin resorts that disgraced old coney are said to be wiped out the wipinout process consists of raisin the price from 10 cents to 25 cents and hirin a blonde named maudie to sell tickets instead of micky the bowery bite thats what they sayi dont know  but to coney i goes atuesday i gets off the l and starts for the glitterin show twas a fine sight the babylonian towers and the hindoo roof gardens was blazin with thousands of electric lights and the streets was thick with people tis a true thing they say that coney levels all rank i see millionaires eatin popcorn and trampin along with the crowd and i see eightdollaraweek clothinstore clerks in red automobiles fightin one another for whod squeeze the horn when they come to a corner  i made a mistake i says to myself twas not coney i needed when a mans sad tis not scenes of hilarity he wants twould be far better for him to meditate in a graveyard or to attend services at the paradise roof gardens tis no consolation when a mans lost his sweetheart to order hot corn and have the waiter bring him the powdered sugar cruet instead of salt and then conceal himself or to have zozookum the gipsy palmist tell him that he has three children and to look out for another serious calamity price twentyfive cents  i walked far away down on the beach to the ruins of an old pavilion near one corner of this new private park dreamland a year ago that old pavilion was standin up straight and the oldstyle waiters was slammin a weeks supply of clam chowder down in front of you for a nickel and callin you cully friendly and vice was rampant and you got back to new york with enough change to take a car at the bridge now they tell me that they serve welsh rabbits on surf avenue and you get the right change back in the movinpicture joints  i sat down at one side of the old pavilion and looked at the surf spreadin itself on the beach and thought about the time me and norah flynn sat on that spot last summer twas before reform struck the island and we was happy we had tintypes and chowder in the ribald dives and the egyptian sorceress of the nile told norah out of her hand while i was waitin in the door that twould be the luck of her to marry a redheaded gossoon with two crooked legs and i was overrunnin with joy on account of the allusion and twas there that norah flynn put her two hands in mine a year before and we talked of flats and the things she could cook and the love business that goes with such episodes and that was coney as we loved it and as the hand of satan was upon it friendly and noisy and your moneys worth with no fence around the ocean and not too many electric lights to show the sleeve of a black serge coat against a white shirtwaist  i sat with my back to the parks where they had the moon and the dreams and the steeples corralled and longed for the old coney there wasnt many people on the beach lots of them was feedin pennies into the slot machines to see the interrupted courtship in the movin pictures and a good many was takin the sea air in the canals of venice and some was breathin the smoke of the sea battle by actual warships in a tank filled with real water a few was down on the sands enjoyin the moonlight and the water and the heart of me was heavy for the new morals of the old island while the bands behind me played and the sea pounded on the bass drum in front  and directly i got up and walked along the old pavilion and there on the other side of half in the dark was a slip of a girl sittin on the tumbledown timbers and unless im a liar she was cryin by herself there all alone  is it trouble you are in now miss says i and whats to be done about it  tis none of your business at all denny carnahan says she sittin up straight and it was the voice of no other than norah flynn  then its not says i and were after having a pleasant evening miss flynn have ye seen the sights of this new coney island then i presume ye have come here for that purpose says i  i have says she me mother and uncle tim they are waiting beyond tis an elegant evening ive had ive seen all the attractions that be  right ye are says i to norah and i dont know when ive been that amused after disportin meself among the most laughable moral improvements of the revised shell games i took meself to the shore for the benefit of the cool air and did ye observe the durbar miss flynn  i did says she reflectin but tis not safe im thinkin to ride down them slantin things into the water  how did ye fancy the shoot the chutes i asks  true then im afraid of guns says norah they make such noise in my ears but uncle tim he shot them he did and won cigars tis a fine time we had this day mr carnahan  im glad youve enjoyed yerself i says i suppose youve had a roarin fine time seein the sights and how did the incubators and the helterskelter and the midgets suit the taste of ye  ii wasnt hungry says norah faint but mother ate a quantity of all of em im that pleased with the fine things in the new coney island says she that its the happiest day ive seen in a long time at all  did you see venice says i  we did says she she was a beauty she was all dressed in red she was with  i listened no more to norah flynn i stepped up and i gathered her in my arms  tis a storyteller ye are norah flynn says i yeve seen no more of the greater coney island than i have meself come now tell the truthye came to sit by the old pavilion by the waves where you sat last summer and made dennis carnahan a happy man speak up and tell the truth  norah stuck her nose against me vest  i despise it denny she says half cryin mother and uncle tim went to see the shows but i came down here to think of you i couldnt bear the lights and the crowd are you forgivin me denny for the words we had  twas me fault says i i came here for the same reason meself look at the lights norah i says turning my back to the seaaint they pretty  they are says norah with her eyes shinin and do ye hear the bands playin oh denny i think id like to see it all  the old coney is gone darlin i says to her everything moves when a mans glad its not scenes of sadness he wants tis a greater coney we have here but we couldnt see it till we got in the humour for it next sunday norah darlin well see the new place from end to end     xxi  law and order   i found myself in texas recently revisiting old places and vistas at a sheep ranch where i had sojourned many years ago i stopped for a week and as all visitors do i heartily plunged into the business at hand which happened to be that of dipping the sheep  now this process is so different from ordinary human baptism that it deserves a word of itself a vast iron cauldron with half the fires of avernus beneath it is partly filled with water that soon boils furiously into that is cast concentrated lye lime and sulphur which is allowed to stew and fume until the witches broth is strong enough to scorch the third arm of palladino herself  then this concentrated brew is mixed in a long deep vat with cubic gallons of hot water and the sheep are caught by their hind legs and flung into the compound after being thoroughly ducked by means of a forked pole in the hands of a gentleman detailed for that purpose they are allowed to clamber up an incline into a corral and dry or die as the state of their constitutions may decree if you ever caught an ablebodied twoyearold mutton by the hind legs and felt the 750 volts of kicking that he can send though your arm seventeen times before you can hurl him into the vat you will of course hope that he may die instead of dry  but this is merely to explain why bud oakley and i gladly stretched ourselves on the bank of the nearby charco after the dipping glad for the welcome inanition and pure contact with the earth after our muscleracking labours the flock was a small one and we finished at three in the afternoon so bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and some side bacon mr mills the ranch owner and my old friend rode away to the ranch with his force of mexican trabajadores  while the bacon was frizzling nicely there was the sound of horses hoofs behind us buds sixshooter lay in its scabbard ten feet away from his hand he paid not the slightest heed to the approaching horseman this attitude of a texas ranchman was so different from the oldtime custom that i marvelled instinctively i turned to inspect the possible foe that menaced us in the rear i saw a horseman dressed in black who might have been a lawyer or a parson or an undertaker trotting peaceably along the road by the arroyo  bud noticed my precautionary movement and smiled sarcastically and sorrowfully  youve been away too long said he you dont need to look around any more when anybody gallops up behind you in this state unless something hits you in the back and even then its liable to be only a bunch of tracts or a petition to sign against the trusts i never looked at that hombre that rode by but ill bet a quart of sheep dip that hes some doubledyed son of a popgun out rounding up prohibition votes  times have changed bud said i oracularly law and order is the rule now in the south and the southwest  i caught a cold gleam from buds pale blue eyes  not that i i began hastily  of course you dont said bud warmly you know better youve lived here before law and order you say twenty years ago we had em here we only had two or three laws such as against murder before witnesses and being caught stealing horses and voting the republican ticket but how is it now all we get is orders and the laws go out of the state them legislators set up there at austin and dont do nothing but make laws against kerosene oil and schoolbooks being brought into the state i reckon they was afraid some man would go home some evening after work and light up and get an education and go to work and make laws to repeal aforesaid laws me im for the old days when law and order meant what they said a law was a law and a order was a order  but i began  i was going on continued bud while this coffee is boiling to describe to you a case of genuine law and order that i knew of once in the times when cases was decided in the chambers of a sixshooter instead of a supreme court  youve heard of old ben kirkman the cattle king his ranch run from the nueces to the rio grande in them days as you know there was cattle barons and cattle kings the difference was this when a cattleman went to san antone and bought beer for the newspaper reporters and only give them the number of cattle he actually owned they wrote him up for a baron when he bought em champagne wine and added in the amount of cattle he had stole they called him a king  luke summers was one of his range bosses and down to the kings ranch comes one day a bunch of these oriental people from new york or kansas city or thereabouts luke was detailed with a squad to ride about with em and see that the rattlesnakes got fair warning when they was coming and drive the deer out of their way among the bunch was a blackeyed girl that wore a number two shoe thats all i noticed about her but luke must have seen more for he married her one day before the caballard started back and went over on canada verde and set up a ranch of his own im skipping over the sentimental stuff on purpose because i never saw or wanted to see any of it and luke takes me along with him because we was old friends and i handled cattle to suit him  im skipping over much what followed because i never saw or wanted to see any of itbut three years afterward there was a boy kid stumbling and blubbering around the galleries and floors of lukes ranch i never had no use for kids but it seems they did and im skipping over much what followed until one day out to the ranch drives in hacks and buckboards a lot of mrs summerss friends from the easta sister or so and two or three men one looked like an uncle to somebody and one looked like nothing and the other one had on corkscrew pants and spoke in a tone of voice i never liked a man who spoke in a tone of voice  im skipping over much what followed but one afternoon when i rides up to the ranch house to get some orders about a drove of beeves that was to be shipped i hears something like a popgun go off i waits at the hitching rack not wishing to intrude on private affairs in a little while luke comes out and gives some orders to some of his mexican hands and they go and hitch up sundry and divers vehicles and mighty soon out comes one of the sisters or so and some of the two or three men but two of the two or three men carries between em the corkscrew man who spoke in a tone of voice and lays him flat down in one of the wagons and they all might have been seen wending their way away  bud says luke to me i want you to fix up a little and go up to san antone with me  let me get on my mexican spurs says i and im your company  one of the sisters or so seems to have stayed at the ranch with mrs summers and the kid we rides to encinal and catches the international and hits san antone in the morning after breakfast luke steers me straight to the office of a lawyer they go in a room and talk and then come out  oh there wont be any trouble mr summers says the lawyer ill acquaint judge simmons with the facts today and the matter will be put through as promptly as possible law and order reigns in this state as swift and sure as any in the country  ill wait for the decree if it wont take over half an hour says luke  tut tut says the lawyer man law must take its course come back day after tomorrow at halfpast nine  at that time me and luke shows up and the lawyer hands him a folded document and luke writes him out a check  on the sidewalk luke holds up the paper to me and puts a finger the size of a kitchen door latch on it and says  decree of absolute divorce with custody of the child  skipping over much what has happened of which i know nothing says i it looks to me like a split couldnt the lawyer man have made it a strike for you  bud says he in a pained style that child is the one thing i have to live for she may go but the boy is minethink of iti have custody of the child  all right says i if its the law lets abide by it but i think says i that judge simmons might have used exemplary clemency or whatever is the legal term in our case  you see i wasnt inveigled much into the desirableness of having infants around a ranch except the kind that feed themselves and sell for so much on the hoof when they grow up but luke was struck with that sort of parental foolishness that i never could understand all the way riding from the station back to the ranch he kept pulling that decree out of his pocket and laying his finger on the back of it and reading off to me the sum and substance of it custody of the child bud says he dont forget itcustody of the child  but when we hits the ranch we finds our decree of court obviated nolle prossed and remanded for trial mrs summers and the kid was gone they tell us that an hour after me and luke had started for san antone she had a team hitched and lit out for the nearest station with her trunks and the youngster  luke takes out his decree once more and reads off its emoluments  it aint possible bud says he for this to be its contrary to law and order its wrote as plain as day herecustody of the child  there is what you might call a human leaning says i toward smashing em bothnot to mention the child  judge simmons goes on luke is a incorporated officer of the law she cant take the boy away he belongs to me by statutes passed and approved by the state of texas  and hes removed from the jurisdiction of mundane mandamuses says i by the unearthly statutes of female partiality let us praise the lord and be thankful for whatever small mercies i begins but i see luke dont listen to me tired as he was he calls for a fresh horse and starts back again for the station  he come back two weeks afterward not saying much  we cant get the trail says he but weve done all the telegraphing that the wiresll stand and weve got these city rangers they call detectives on the lookout in the meantime bud says he well round up them cows on brush creek and wait for the law to take its course  and after that we never alluded to allusions as you might say  skipping over much what happened in the next twelve years luke was made sheriff of mojada county he made me his office deputy now dont get in your mind no wrong apparitions of a office deputy doing sums in a book or mashing letters in a cider press in them days his job was to watch the back windows so nobody didnt plug the sheriff in the rear while he was adding up mileage at his desk in front and in them days i had qualifications for the job and there was law and order in mojada county and schoolbooks and all the whiskey you wanted and the government built its own battleships instead of collecting nickels from the school children to do it with and as i say there was law and order instead of enactments and restrictions such as disfigure our umpire state today we had our office at bildad the county seat from which we emerged forth on necessary occasions to soothe whatever fracases and unrest that might occur in our jurisdiction  skipping over much what happened while me and luke was sheriff i want to give you an idea of how the law was respected in them days luke was what you would call one of the most conscious men in the world he never knew much book law but he had the inner emoluments of justice and mercy inculcated into his system if a respectable citizen shot a mexican or held up a train and cleaned out the safe in the express car and luke ever got hold of him hed give the guilty party such a reprimand and a cussin out that hed probable never do it again but once let somebody steal a horse unless it was a spanish pony or cut a wire fence or otherwise impair the peace and indignity of mojada county luke and me would be on em with habeas corpuses and smokeless powder and all the modern inventions of equity and etiquette  we certainly had our county on a basis of lawfulness ive known persons of eastern classification with little spotted caps and buttonedup shoes to get off the train at bildad and eat sandwiches at the railroad station without being shot at or even roped and drug about by the citizens of the town  luke had his own ideas of legality and justice he was kind of training me to succeed him when he went out of office he was always looking ahead to the time when hed quit sheriffing what he wanted to do was to build a yellow house with latticework under the porch and have hens scratching in the yard the one main thing in his mind seemed to be the yard  bud he says to me by instinct and sentiment im a contractor i want to be a contractor thats what ill be when i get out of office  what kind of a contractor says i it sounds like a kind of a business to me you aint going to haul cement or establish branches or work on a railroad are you  you dont understand says luke im tired of space and horizons and territory and distances and things like that what i want is reasonable contraction i want a yard with a fence around it that you can go out and set on after supper and listen to whippoorwills says luke  thats the kind of a man he was he was homelike although hed had bad luck in such investments but he never talked about them times on the ranch it seemed like hed forgotten about it i wondered how with his ideas of yards and chickens and notions of latticework hed seemed to have got out of his mind that kid of his that had been taken away from him unlawful in spite of his decree of court but he wasnt a man you could ask about such things as he didnt refer to in his own conversation  i reckon hed put all his emotions and ideas into being sheriff ive read in books about men that was disappointed in these poetic and finehaired and highcollared affairs with ladies renouncing truck of that kind and wrapping themselves up into some occupation like painting pictures or herding sheep or science or teaching schoolsomething to make em forget well i guess that was the way with luke but as he couldnt paint pictures he took it out in rounding up horse thieves and in making mojada county a safe place to sleep in if you was well armed and not afraid of requisitions or tarantulas  one day there passes through bildad a bunch of these money investors from the east and they stopped off there bildad being the dinner station on the i  g n they was just coming back from mexico looking after mines and such there was five of emfour solid parties with gold watch chains that would grade up over two hundred pounds on the hoof and one kid about seventeen or eighteen  this youngster had on one of them cowboy suits such as tenderfoots bring west with em and you could see he was aching to wing a couple of indians or bag a grizzly or two with the little pearlhandled gun he had buckled around his waist  i walked down to the depot to keep an eye on the outfit and see that they didnt locate any land or scare the cow ponies hitched in front of murchisons store or act otherwise unseemly luke was away after a gang of cattle thieves down on the frio and i always looked after the law and order when he wasnt there  after dinner this boy comes out of the diningroom while the train was waiting and prances up and down the platform ready to shoot all antelope lions or private citizens that might endeavour to molest or come too near him he was a goodlooking kid only he was like all them tenderfootshe didnt know a lawandorder town when he saw it  by and by along comes pedro johnson the proprietor of the crystal palace chiliconcarne stand in bildad pedro was a man who liked to amuse himself so he kind of herd rides this youngster laughing at him tickled to death i was too far away to hear but the kid seems to mention some remarks to pedro and pedro goes up and slaps him about nine feet away and laughs harder than ever and then the boy gets up quicker than he fell and jerks out his little pearlhandle andbing bing bing pedro gets it three times in special and treasured portions of his carcass i saw the dust fly off his clothes every time the bullets hit sometimes them little thirtytwos cause worry at close range  the engine bell was ringing and the train starting off slow i goes up to the kid and places him under arrest and takes away his gun but the first thing i knew that caballard of capitalists makes a break for the train one of em hesitates in front of me for a second and kind of smiles and shoves his hand up against my chin and i sort of laid down on the platform and took a nap i never was afraid of guns but i dont want any person except a barber to take liberties like that with my face again when i woke up the whole outfittrain boy and allwas gone i asked about pedro and they told me the doctor said he would recover provided his wounds didnt turn out to be fatal  when luke got back three days later and i told him about it he was mad all over  whynt you telegraph to san antone he asks and have the bunch arrested there  oh well says i i always did admire telegraphy but astronomy was what i had took up just then that capitalist sure knew how to gesticulate with his hands  luke got madder and madder he investigates and finds in the depot a card one of the men had dropped that gives the address of some hombre called scudder in new york city  bud says luke im going after that bunch im going there and get the man or boy as you say he was and bring him back im sheriff of mojada county and i shall keep law and order in its precincts while im able to draw a gun and i want you to go with me no eastern yankee can shoot up a respectable and wellknown citizen of bildad specially with a thirtytwo calibre and escape the law pedro johnson says luke is one of our most prominent citizens and business men ill appoint sam bell acting sheriff with penitentiary powers while im away and you and me will take the six fortyfive northbound tomorrow evening and follow up this trail  im your company says i i never see this new york but id like to but luke says i dont you have to have a dispensation or a habeas corpus or something from the state when you reach out that far for rich men and malefactors  did i have a requisition says luke when i went over into the brazos bottoms and brought back bill grimes and two more for holding up the international did me and you have a search warrant or a posse comitatus when we rounded up them six mexican cow thieves down in hidalgo its my business to keep order in mojada county  and its my business as office deputy says i to see that business is carried on according to law between us both we ought to keep things pretty well cleaned up  so the next day luke packs a blanket and some collars and his mileage book in a haversack and him and me hits the breeze for new york it was a powerful long ride the seats in the cars was too short for sixfooters like us to sleep comfortable on and the conductor had to keep us from getting off at every town that had fivestory houses in it but we got there finally and we seemed to see right away that he was right about it  luke says i as office deputy and from a law standpoint it dont look to me like this place is properly and legally in the jurisdiction of mojada county texas  from the standpoint of order says he its amenable to answer for its sins to the properly appointed authorities from bildad to jerusalem  amen says i but lets turn our trick sudden and ride i dont like the looks of this place  think of pedro johnson says luke a friend of mine and yours shot down by one of these gilded abolitionists at his very door  it was at the door of the freight depot says i but the law will not be balked at a quibble like that  we put up at one of them big hotels on broadway the next morning i goes down about two miles of stairsteps to the bottom and hunts for luke it aint no use it looks like san jacinto day in san antone theres a thousand folks milling around in a kind of a roofedover plaza with marble pavements and trees growing right out of em and i see no more chance of finding luke than if we was hunting each other in the big pear flat down below old fort ewell but soon luke and me runs together in one of the turns of them marble alleys  it aint no use bud says he i cant find no place to eat at ive been looking for restaurant signs and smelling for ham all over the camp but im used to going hungry when i have to now says he im going out and get a hack and ride down to the address on this scudder card you stay here and try to hustle some grub but i doubt if youll find it i wish wed brought along some cornmeal and bacon and beans ill be back when i see this scudder if the trail aint wiped out  so i starts foraging for breakfast for the honour of old mojada county i didnt want to seem green to them abolitionists so every time i turned a corner in them marble halls i went up to the first desk or counter i see and looks around for grub if i didnt see what i wanted i asked for something else in about half an hour i had a dozen cigars five story magazines and seven or eight railroad timetables in my pockets and never a smell of coffee or bacon to point out the trail  once a lady sitting at a table and playing a game kind of like pushpin told me to go into a closet that she called number 3 i went in and shut the door and the blamed thing lit itself up i set down on a stool before a shelf and waited thinks i this is a private diningroom but no waiter never came when i got to sweating good and hard i goes out again  did you get what you wanted says she  no maam says i not a bite  then theres no charge says she  thanky maam says i and i takes up the trail again  by and by i thinks ill shed etiquette and i picks up one of them boys with blue clothes and yellow buttons in front and he leads me to what he calls the caffay breakfast room and the first thing i lays my eyes on when i go in is that boy that had shot pedro johnson he was setting all alone at a little table hitting a egg with a spoon like he was afraid hed break it  i takes the chair across the table from him and he looks insulted and makes a move like he was going to get up  keep still son says i youre apprehended arrested and in charge of the texas authorities go on and hammer that egg some more if its the inside of it you want now what did you shoot mr johnson of bildad for  and may i ask who you are says he  you may says i go ahead  i suppose youre on says this kid without batting his eyes but what are you eating here waiter he calls out raising his finger take this gentlemans order  a beefsteak says i and some fried eggs and a can of peaches and a quart of coffee will about suffice  we talk awhile about the sundries of life and then he says  what are you going to do about that shooting i had a right to shoot that man says he he called me names that i couldnt overlook and then he struck me he carried a gun too what else could i do  well have to take you back to texas says i  id like to go back says the boy with a kind of a grinif it wasnt on an occasion of this kind its the life i like ive always wanted to ride and shoot and live in the open air ever since i can remember  who was this gang of stout parties you took this trip with i asks  my stepfather says he and some business partners of his in some mexican mining and land schemes  i saw you shoot pedro johnson says i and i took that little popgun away from you that you did it with and when i did so i noticed three or four little scars in a row over your right eyebrow youve been in rookus before havent you  ive had these scars ever since i can remember says he i dont know how they came there  was you ever in texas before says i  not that i remember of says he but i thought i had when we struck the prairie country but i guess i hadnt  have you got a mother i asks  she died five years ago says he  skipping over the most of what followedwhen luke came back i turned the kid over to him he had seen scudder and told him what he wanted and it seems that scudder got active with one of these telephones as soon as he left for in about an hour afterward there comes to our hotel some of these city rangers in everyday clothes that they call detectives and marches the whole outfit of us to what they call a magistrates court they accuse luke of attempted kidnapping and ask him what he has to say  this snipe says luke to the judge shot and wilfully punctured with malice and forethought one of the most respected and prominent citizens of the town of bildad texas your honor and in so doing laid himself liable to the penitence of law and order and i hereby make claim and demand restitution of the state of new york city for the said alleged criminal and i know he done it  have you the usual and necessary requisition papers from the governor of your state asks the judge  my usual papers says luke was taken away from me at the hotel by these gentlemen who represent law and order in your city they was two colts 45s that ive packed for nine years and if i dont get em back therell be more trouble you can ask anybody in mojada county about luke summers i dont usually need any other kind of papers for what i do  i see the judge looks mad so i steps up and says  your honor the aforesaid defendant mr luke summers sheriff of mojada county texas is as fine a man as ever threw a rope or upheld the statutes and codicils of the greatest state in the union but he  the judge hits his table with a wooden hammer and asks who i am  bud oakley says i office deputy of the sheriffs office of mojada county texas representing says i the law luke summers i goes on represents order and if your honor will give me about ten minutes in private talk ill explain the whole thing to you and show you the equitable and legal requisition papers which i carry in my pocket  the judge kind of half smiles and says he will talk with me in his private room in there i put the whole thing up to him in such language as i had and when we goes outside he announces the verdict that the young man is delivered into the hands of the texas authorities and calls the next case  skipping over much of what happened on the way back ill tell you how the thing wound up in bildad  when we got the prisoner in the sheriffs office i says to luke  you remember that kid of yoursthat twoyear old that they stole away from

into the case of martin burney  they were constructing the speedway along the west bank of the harlem river the grubboat of dennis corrigan subcontractor was moored to a tree on the bank twentytwo men belonging to the little green island toiled there at the sinewcracking labour one among them who wrought in the kitchen of the grubboat was of the race of the goths over them all stood the exorbitant corrigan harrying them like the captain of a galley crew he paid them so little that most of the gang work as they might earned little more than food and tobacco many of them were in debt to him corrigan boarded them all in the grubboat and gave them good grub for he got it back in work  martin burney was furthest behind of all he was a little man all muscles and hands and feet with a grayred stubbly beard he was too light for the work which would have glutted the capacity of a steam shovel  the work was hard besides that the banks of the river were humming with mosquitoes as a child in a dark room fixes his regard on the pale light of a comforting window these toilers watched the sun that brought around the one hour of the day that tasted less bitter after the sundown supper they would huddle together on the river bank and send the mosquitoes whining and eddying back from the malignant puffs of twentythree reeking pipes thus socially banded against the foe they wrenched out of the hour a few wellsmoked drops from the cup of joy  each week burney grew deeper in debt corrigan kept a small stock of goods on the boat which he sold to the men at prices that brought him no loss burney was a good customer at the tobacco counter one sack when he went to work in the morning and one when he came in at night so much was his account swelled daily burney was something of a smoker yet it was not true that he ate his meals with a pipe in his mouth which had been said of him the little man was not discontented he had plenty to eat plenty of tobacco and a tyrant to curse so why should not he an irishman be well satisfied  one morning as he was starting with the others for work he stopped at the pine counter for his usual sack of tobacco  theres no more for ye said corrigan your accounts closed ye are a losing investment no not even tobaccy my son no more tobaccy on account if ye want to work on and eat do so but the smoke of ye has all ascended tis my advice that ye hunt a new job  i have no tobaccy to smoke in my pipe this day mr corrigan said burney not quite understanding that such a thing could happen to him  earn it said corrigan and then buy it  burney stayed on he knew of no other job at first he did not realize that tobacco had got to be his father and mother his confessor and sweetheart and wife and child  for three days he managed to fill his pipe from the other mens sacks and then they shut him off one and all they told him rough but friendly that of all things in the world tobacco must be quickest forthcoming to a fellowman desiring it but that beyond the immediate temporary need requisition upon the store of a comrade is pressed with great danger to friendship  then the blackness of the pit arose and filled the heart of burney sucking the corpse of his deceased dudheen he staggered through his duties with his barrowful of stones and dirt feeling for the first time that the curse of adam was upon him other men bereft of a pleasure might have recourse to other delights but burney had only two comforts in life one was his pipe the other was an ecstatic hope that there would be no speedways to build on the other side of jordan  at meal times he would let the other men go first into the grubboat and then he would go down on his hands and knees grovelling fiercely upon the ground where they had been sitting trying to find some stray crumbs of tobacco once he sneaked down the river bank and filled his pipe with dead willow leaves at the first whiff of the smoke he spat in the direction of the boat and put the finest curse he knew on corriganone that began with the first corrigans born on earth and ended with the corrigans that shall hear the trumpet of gabriel blow he began to hate corrigan with all his shaking nerves and soul even murder occurred to him in a vague sort of way five days he went without the taste of tobaccohe who had smoked all day and thought the night misspent in which he had not awakened for a pipeful or two under the bedclothes  one day a man stopped at the boat to say that there was work to be had in the bronx park where a large number of labourers were required in making some improvements  after dinner burney walked thirty yards down the river bank away from the maddening smell of the others pipes he sat down upon a stone he was thinking he would set out for the bronx at least he could earn tobacco there what if the books did say he owed corrigan any mans work was worth his keep but then he hated to go without getting even with the hardhearted screw who had put his pipe out was there any way to do it  softly stepping among the clods came tony he of the race of goths who worked in the kitchen he grinned at burneys elbow and that unhappy man full of race animosity and holding urbanity in contempt growled at him what dye want yedago  tony also contained a grievanceand a plot he too was a corrigan hater and had been primed to see it in others  how you likea mr corrigan he asked you thinka him a nicea man  to hell with m he said may his liver turn to water and the bones of him crack in the cold of his heart may dog fennel grow upon his ancestors graves and the grandsons of his children be born without eyes may whiskey turn to clabber in his mouth and every time he sneezes may he blister the soles of his feet and the smoke of his pipemay it make his eyes water and the drops fall on the grass that his cows eat and poison the butter that he spreads on his bread  though tony remained a stranger to the beauties of this imagery he gathered from it the conviction that it was sufficiently anticorrigan in its tendency so with the confidence of a fellowconspirator he sat by burney upon the stone and unfolded his plot  it was very simple in design every day after dinner it was corrigans habit to sleep for an hour in his bunk at such times it was the duty of the cook and his helper tony to leave the boat so that no noise might disturb the autocrat the cook always spent this hour in walking exercise tonys plan was this after corrigan should be asleep he tony and burney would cut the mooring ropes that held the boat to the shore tony lacked the nerve to do the deed alone then the awkward boat would swing out into a swift current and surely overturn against a rock there was below  come on and do it said burney if the back of ye aches from the lick he gave ye as the pit of me stomach does for the taste of a bit of smoke we cant cut the ropes too quick  all aright said tony but better wait bouta ten minute more givea corrigan plenty time get gooda sleep  they waited sitting upon the stone the rest of the men were at work out of sight around a bend in the road everything would have gone wellexcept perhaps with corrigan had not tony been moved to decorate the plot with its conventional accompaniment he was of dramatic blood and perhaps he intuitively divined the appendage to villainous machinations as prescribed by the stage he pulled from his shirt bosom a long black beautiful venomous cigar and handed it to burney  you likea smoke while we wait he asked  burney clutched it and snapped off the end as a terrier bites at a rat he laid it to his lips like a longlost sweetheart when the smoke began to draw he gave a long deep sigh and the bristles of his grayred moustache curled down over the cigar like the talons of an eagle slowly the red faded from the whites of his eyes he fixed his gaze dreamily upon the hills across the river the minutes came and went  bout time to go now said tony that damna corrigan he be in the reever very quick  burney started out of his trance with a grunt he turned his head and gazed with a surprised and pained severity at his accomplice he took the cigar partly from his mouth but sucked it back again immediately chewed it lovingly once or twice and spoke in virulent puffs from the corner of his mouth  what is it ye yaller haythen would ye lay contrivances against the enlightened races of the earth ye instigator of illegal crimes would ye seek to persuade martin burney into the dirty tricks of an indecent dago would ye be for murderin your benefactor the good man that gives ye food and work take that ye punkincoloured assassin  the torrent of burneys indignation carried with it bodily assault the toe of his shoe sent the wouldbe cutter of ropes tumbling from his seat  tony arose and fled his vendetta he again relegated to the files of things that might have been beyond the boat he fled and awayaway he was afraid to remain  burney with expanded chest watched his late coplotter disappear then he too departed setting his face in the direction of the bronx  in his wake was a rank and pernicious trail of noisome smoke that brought peace to his heart and drove the birds from the roadside into the deepest thickets     xxiii  the caliph and the cad   surely there is no pastime more diverting than that of mingling incognito with persons of wealth and station where else but in those circles can one see life in its primitive crude state unhampered by the conventions that bind the dwellers in a lower sphere  there was a certain caliph of bagdad who was accustomed to go down among the poor and lowly for the solace obtained from the relation of their tales and histories is it not strange that the humble and povertystricken have not availed themselves of the pleasure they might glean by donning diamonds and silks and playing caliph among the haunts of the upper world  there was one who saw the possibilities of thus turning the tables on haroun al raschid his name was corny brannigan and he was a truck driver for a canal street importing firm and if you read further you will learn how he turned upper broadway into bagdad and learned something about himself that he did not know before  many people would have called corny a snobpreferably by means of a telephone his chief interest in life his chosen amusement and his sole diversion after working hours was to place himself in juxtapositionsince he could not hope to minglewith people of fashion and means  every evening after corny had put up his team and dined at a lunchcounter that made immediateness a specialty he would clothe himself in evening raiment as correct as any you will see in the palm rooms then he would betake himself to that ravishing radiant roadway devoted to thespis thais and bacchus  for a time he would stroll about the lobbies of the best hotels his soul steeped in blissful content beautiful women cooing like doves but feathered like birds of paradise flicked him with their robes as they passed courtly gentlemen attended them gallant and assiduous and cornys heart within him swelled like sir lancelots for the mirror spoke to him as he passed and said corny lad theres not a guy among em that looks a bit the sweller than yerself and you drivin of a truck and them swearin off their taxes and playin the red in art galleries with the best in the land  and the mirrors spake the truth mr corny brannigan had acquired the outward polish if nothing more long and keen observation of polite society had gained for him its manner its genteel air andmost difficult of acquirementits repose and ease  now and then in the hotels corny had managed conversation and temporary acquaintance with substantial if not distinguished guests with many of these he had exchanged cards and the ones he received he carefully treasured for his own use later leaving the hotel lobbies corny would stroll leisurely about lingering at the theatre entrance dropping into the fashionable restaurants as if seeking some friend he rarely patronized any of these places he was no bee come to suck honey but a butterfly flashing his wings among the flowers whose calyces held no sweets for him his wages were not large enough to furnish him with more than the outside garb of the gentleman to have been one of the beings he so cunningly imitated corny brannigan would have given his right hand  one night corny had an adventure after absorbing the delights of an hours lounging in the principal hotels along broadway he passed up into the stronghold of thespis cab drivers hailed him as a likely fare to his prideful content languishing eyes were turned upon him as a hopeful source of lobsters and the delectable ascendant globules of effervescence these overtures and unconscious compliments corny swallowed as manna and hoped bill the off horse would be less lame in the left forefoot in the morning  beneath a cluster of milky globes of electric light corny paused to admire the sheen of his lowcut patent leather shoes the building occupying the angle was a pretentious café out of this came a couple a lady in a white cobwebby evening gown with a lace wrap like a wreath of mist thrown over it and a man tall faultless assuredtoo assured they moved to the edge of the sidewalk and halted cornys eye ever alert for pointers in swell behaviour took them in with a sidelong glance  the carriage is not here said the lady you ordered it to wait  i ordered it for ninethirty said the man it should be here now  a familiar note in the ladys voice drew a more especial attention from corny it was pitched in a key well known to him the soft electric shone upon her face sisters of sorrow have no quarters fixed for them in the index to the book of breaking hearts you will find that broadway follows very soon after the bowery this ladys face was sad and her voice was attuned with it they waited as if for the carriage corny waited too for it was out of doors and he was never tired of accumulating and profiting by knowledge of gentlemanly conduct  jack said the lady dont be angry ive done everything i could to please you this evening why do you act so  oh youre an angel said the man depend upon woman to throw the blame upon a man  im not blaming you im only trying to make you happy  you go about it in a very peculiar way  you have been cross with me all the evening without any cause  oh there isnt any cause exceptyou make me tired  corny took out his card case and looked over his collection he selected one that read mr r lionel whytemelville bloomsbury square london this card he had inveigled from a tourist at the king edward hotel corny stepped up to the man and presented it with a correctly formal air  may i ask why i am selected for the honour asked the ladys escort  now mr corny brannigan had a very wise habit of saying little during his imitations of the caliph of bagdad the advice of lord chesterfield wear a black coat and hold your tongue he believed in without having heard but now speech was demanded and required of him  no gent said corny would talk to a lady like you done fie upon you willie even if she happens to be your wife you ought to have more respect for your clothes than to chin her back that way maybe it aint my buttin but it goes anyhowyou strike me as bein a whole lot to the wrong  the ladys escort indulged in more elegantly expressed but fetching repartee corny eschewing his truck drivers vocabulary retorted as nearly as he could in polite phrases then diplomatic relations were severed there was a brief but lively setto with other than oral weapons from which corny came forth easily victor  a carriage dashed up driven by a tardy and solicitous coachman  will you kindly open the door for me asked the lady corny assisted her to enter and took off his hat the escort was beginning to scramble up from the sidewalk  i beg your pardon maam said corny if hes your man  hes no man of mine said the lady perhaps hebut theres no chance of his being now drive home michael if you care to take thiswith my thanks  three red roses were thrust out through the carriage window into cornys hand he took them and the hand for an instant and then the carriage sped away  corny gathered his foes hat and began to brush the dust from his clothes  come along said corny taking the other man by the arm  his late opponent was yet a little dazed by the hard knocks he had received corny led him carefully into a saloon three doors away  the drinks for us said corny me and my friend  youre a queer feller said the ladys late escortlick a man and then want to set em up  youre my best friend said corny exultantly you dont understand well listen you just put me wise to somethin i been playin gent a long time thinkin it was just the glad rags i had and nothin else sayyoure a swell aint you well you trot in that class i guess i dont but i found out one thingim a gentleman byand i know it now whatll you have to drink     xxiv  the diamond of kali   the original news item concerning the diamond of the goddess kali was handed in to the city editor he smiled and held it for a moment above the wastebasket then he laid it back on his desk and said try the sunday people they might work something out of it  the sunday editor glanced the item over and said hm afterward he sent for a reporter and expanded his comment  you might see general ludlow he said and make a story out of this if you can diamond stories are a drug but this one is big enough to be found by a scrubwoman wrapped up in a piece of newspaper and tucked under the corner of the hall linoleum find out first if the general has a daughter who intends to go on the stage if not you can go ahead with the story run cuts of the kohinoor and j p morgans collection and work in pictures of the kimberley mines and barney barnato fill in with a tabulated comparison of the values of diamonds radium and veal cutlets since the meat strike and let it run to a half page  on the following day the reporter turned in his story the sunday editor let his eye sprint along its lines hm he said again this time the copy went into the wastebasket with scarcely a flutter  the reporter stiffened a little around the lips but he was whistling softly and contentedly between his teeth when i went over to talk with him about it an hour later  i dont blame the old man said he magnanimously for cutting it out it did sound like funny business but it happened exactly as i wrote it say why dont you fish that story out of the wb and use it seems to me its as good as the tommyrot you write  i accepted the tip and if you read further you will learn the facts about the diamond of the goddess kali as vouched for by one of the most reliable reporters on the staff  gen marcellus b ludlow lives in one of those decaying but venerated old redbrick mansions in the west twenties the general is a member of an old new york family that does not advertise he is a globetrotter by birth a gentleman by predilection a millionaire by the mercy of heaven and a connoisseur of precious stones by occupation  the reporter was admitted promptly when he made himself known at the generals residence at about eight thirty on the evening that he received the assignment in the magnificent library he was greeted by the distinguished traveller and connoisseur a tall erect gentleman in the early fifties with a nearly white moustache and a bearing so soldierly that one perceived in him scarcely a trace of the national guardsman his weatherbeaten countenance lit up with a charming smile of interest when the reporter made known his errand  ah you have heard of my latest find i shall be glad to show you what i conceive to be one of the six most valuable blue diamonds in existence  the general opened a small safe in a corner of the library and brought forth a plushcovered box opening this he exposed to the reporters bewildered gaze a huge and brilliant diamondnearly as large as a hailstone  this stone said the general is something more than a mere jewel it once formed the central eye of the threeeyed goddess kali who is worshipped by one of the fiercest and most fanatical tribes of india if you will arrange yourself comfortably i will give you a brief history of it for your paper  general ludlow brought a decanter of whiskey and glasses from a cabinet and set a comfortable armchair for the lucky scribe  the phansigars or thugs of india began the general are the most dangerous and dreaded of the tribes of north india they are extremists in religion and worship the horrid goddess kali in the form of images their rites are interesting and bloody the robbing and murdering of travellers are taught as a worthy and obligatory deed by their strange religious code their worship of the threeeyed goddess kali is conducted so secretly that no traveller has ever heretofore had the honour of witnessing the ceremonies that distinction was reserved for myself  while at sakaranpur between delhi and khelat i used to explore the jungle in every direction in the hope of learning something new about these mysterious phansigars  one evening at twilight i was making my way through a teakwood forest when i came upon a deep circular depression in an open space in the centre of which was a rude stone temple i was sure that this was one of the temples of the thugs so i concealed myself in the undergrowth to watch  when the moon rose the depression in the clearing was suddenly filled with hundreds of shadowy swiftly gliding forms then a door opened in the temple exposing a brightly illuminated image of the goddess kali before which a whiterobed priest began a barbarous incantation while the tribe of worshippers prostrated themselves upon the earth  but what interested me most was the central eye of the huge wooden idol i could see by its flashing brilliancy that it was an immense diamond of the purest water  after the rites were concluded the thugs slipped away into the forest as silently as they had come the priest stood for a few minutes in the door of the temple enjoying the cool of the night before closing his rather warm quarters suddenly a dark lithe shadow slipped down into the hollow leaped upon the priest and struck him down with a glittering knife then the murderer sprang at the image of the goddess like a cat and pried out the glowing central eye of kali with his weapon straight toward me he ran with his royal prize when he was within two paces i rose to my feet and struck him with all my force between the eyes he rolled over senseless and the magnificent jewel fell from his hand that is the splendid blue diamond you have just seena stone worthy of a monarchs crown  thats a corking story said the reporter that decanter is exactly like the one that john w gates always sets out during an interview  pardon me said general ludlow for forgetting hospitality in the excitement of my narrative help yourself  heres looking at you said the reporter  what i am afraid of now said the general lowering his voice is that i may be robbed of the diamond the jewel that formed an eye of their goddess is their most sacred symbol somehow the tribe suspected me of having it and members of the band have followed me half around the earth they are the most cunning and cruel fanatics in the world and their religious vows would compel them to assassinate the unbeliever who has desecrated their sacred treasure  once in lucknow three of their agents disguised as servants in a hotel endeavoured to strangle me with a twisted cloth again in london two thugs made up as street musicians climbed into my window at night and attacked me they have even tracked me to this country my life is never safe a month ago while i was at a hotel in the berkshires three of them sprang upon me from the roadside weeds i saved myself then by my knowledge of their customs  how was that general asked the reporter  there was a cow grazing near by said general ludlow a gentle jersey cow i ran to her side and stood the three thugs ceased their attack knelt and struck the ground thrice with their foreheads then after many respectful salaams they departed  afraid the cow would hook asked the reporter  no the cow is a sacred animal to the phansigars next to their goddess they worship the cow they have never been known to commit any deed of violence in the presence of the animal they reverence  its a mighty interesting story said the reporter if you dont mind ill take another drink and then a few notes  i will join you said general ludlow with a courteous wave of his hand  if i were you advised the reporter id take that sparkler to texas get on a cow ranch there and the pharisees  phansigars corrected the general  oh yes the fancy guys would run up against a long horn every time they made a break  general ludlow closed the diamond case and thrust it into his bosom  the spies of the tribe have found me out in new york he said straightening his tall figure im familiar with the east indian cast of countenance and i know that my every movement is watched they will undoubtedly attempt to rob and murder me here  here exclaimed the reporter seizing the decanter and pouring out a liberal amount of its contents  at any moment said the general but as a soldier and a connoisseur i shall sell my life and my diamond as dearly as i can  at this point of the reporters story there is a certain vagueness but it can be gathered that there was a loud crashing noise at the rear of the house they were in general ludlow buttoned his coat closely and sprang for the door but the reporter clutched him firmly with one hand while he held the decanter with the other  tell me before we fly he urged in a voice thick with some inward turmoil do any of your daughters contemplate going on the stage  i have no daughtersfly for your lifethe phansigars are upon us cried the general  the two men dashed out of the front door of the house  the hour was late as their feet struck the sidewalk strange men of dark and forbidding appearance seemed to rise up out of the earth and encompass them one with asiatic features pressed close to the general and droned in a terrible voice  buy cast clo  another darkwhiskered and sinister sped lithely to his side and began in a whining voice  say mister have yer got a dime fer a poor feller what  they hurried on but only into the arms of a blackeyed duskybrowed being who held out his hat under their noses while a confederate of oriental hue turned the handle of a street organ near by  twenty steps farther on general ludlow and the reporter found themselves in the midst of half a dozen villainouslooking men with highturned coat collars and faces bristling with unshaven beards  run for it hissed the general they have discovered the possessor of the diamond of the goddess kali  the two men took to their heels the avengers of the goddess pursued  oh lordy groaned the reporter there isnt a cow this side of brooklyn were lost  when near the corner they both fell over an iron object that rose from the sidewalk close to the gutter clinging to it desperately they awaited their fate  if i only had a cow moaned the reporteror another nip from that decanter general  as soon as the pursuers observed where their victims had found refuge they suddenly fell back and retreated to a considerable distance  they are waiting for reinforcements in order to attack us said general ludlow  but the reporter emitted a ringing laugh and hurled his hat triumphantly into the air  guess again he shouted and leaned heavily upon the iron object your old fancy guys or thugs whatever you call em are up to date dear general this is a pump weve stranded uponsame as a cow in new york hic see thash why the nfuriated smoked guys dont attack ussee sacred anmal the pump in n york my dear general  but further down in the shadows of twentyeighth street the marauders were holding a parley  come on reddy said one lets go frisk the old un hes been showin a sparkler as big as a hen egg all around eighth avenue for two weeks past  not on your silhouette decided reddy you see em rallyin round the pump theyre friends of bills bill wont stand for nothin of this kind in his district since he got that bid to esopus  this exhausts the facts concerning the kali diamond but it is deemed not inconsequent to close with the following brief paid item that appeared two days later in a morning paper  it is rumored that a niece of gen marcellus b ludlow of new york city will appear on the stage next season  her diamonds are said to be extremely valuable and of much historic interest     xxv  the day we celebrate   in the tropics hopalong bibb the bird fancier was saying to me the seasons months fortnights weekends holidays dogdays sundays and yesterdays get so jumbled together in the shuffle that you never know when a year has gone by until youre in the middle of the next one  hopalong bibb kept his bird store on lower fourth avenue he was an exseaman and beachcomber who made regular voyages to southern ports and imported personally conducted invoices of talking parrots and dialectic paroquets he had a stiff knee neck and nerve i had gone to him to buy a parrot to present at christmas to my aunt joanna  this one said i disregarding his homily on the subdivisions of timethis one that seems all red white and blueto what genus of beasts does he belong he appeals at once to my patriotism and to my love of discord in colour schemes  thats a cockatoo from ecuador said bibb all he has been taught to say is merry christmas a seasonable bird hes only seven dollars and ill bet many a human has stuck you for more money by making the same speech to you  and then bibb laughed suddenly and loudly  that bird he explained reminds me hes got his dates mixed he ought to be saying e pluribus unum to match his feathers instead of trying to work the santa claus graft it reminds me of the time me and liverpool sam got our ideas of things tangled up on the coast of costa rica on account of the weather and other phenomena to be met with in the tropics  we were as it were stranded on that section of the spanish main with no money to speak of and no friends that should be talked about either we had stoked and secondcooked ourselves down there on a fruit steamer from new orleans to try our luck which was discharged after we got there for lack of evidence there was no work suitable to our instincts so me and liverpool began to subsist on the red rum of the country and such fruit as we could reap where we had not sown it was an alluvial town called soledad where there was no harbour or future or recourse between steamers the town slept and drank rum it only woke up when there were bananas to ship it was like a man sleeping through dinner until the dessert  when me and liverpool got so low down that the american consul wouldnt speak to us we knew wed struck bed rock  we boarded with a snuffbrown lady named chica who kept a rumshop and a ladies and gents restaurant in a street called the calle de los fortyseven inconsolable saints when our credit played out there liverpool whose stomach overshadowed his sensations of noblesse oblige married chica this kept us in rice and fried plantain for a month and then chica pounded liverpool one morning sadly and earnestly for fifteen minutes with a casserole handed down from the stone age and we knew that we had outwelcomed our liver that night we signed an engagement with don jaime mcspinosa a hybrid banana fancier of the place to work on his fruit preserves nine miles out of town we had to do it or be reduced to sea water and broken doses of feed and slumber  now speaking of liverpool sam i dont malign or inexculpate him to you any more than i would to his face but in my opinion when an englishman gets as low as he can hes got to dodge so that the dregs of other nations dont drop ballast on him out of their balloons and if hes a liverpool englishman why firedamp is what hes got to look out for being a natural american thats my personal view but liverpool and me had much in common we were without decorous clothes or ways and means of existence and as the saying goes misery certainly does enjoy the society of accomplices  our job on old mcspinosas plantation was chopping down banana stalks and loading the bunches of fruit on the backs of horses then a native dressed up in an alligator hide belt a machete and a pair of aa sheeting pajamas drives em over to the coast and piles em up on the beach  you ever been in a banana grove its as solemn as a rathskeller at seven a m its like being lost behind the scenes at one of these mushroom musical shows you cant see the sky for the foliage above you and the ground is knee deep in rotten leaves and its so still that you can hear the stalks growing again after you chop em down  at night me and liverpool herded in a lot of grass huts on the edge of a lagoon with the red yellow and black employés of don jaime there we lay fighting mosquitoes and listening to the monkeys squalling and the alligators grunting and splashing in the lagoon until daylight with only snatches of sleep between times  we soon lost all idea of what time of the year it was its just about eighty degrees there in december and june and on fridays and at midnight and election day and any other old time sometimes it rains more than at others and thats all the difference you notice a man is liable to live along there without noticing any fugiting of tempus until some day the undertaker calls in for him just when hes beginning to think about cutting out the gang and saving up a little to invest in real estate  i dont know how long we worked for don jaime but it was through two or three rainy spells eight or ten hair cuts and the life of three pairs of sailcloth trousers all the money we earned went for rum and tobacco but we ate and that was something  all of a sudden one day me and liverpool find the trade of committing surgical operations on banana stalks turning to aloes and quinine in our mouths its a seizure that often comes upon white men in latin and geographical countries we wanted to be addressed again in language and see the smoke of a steamer and read the real estate transfers and gents outfitting ads in an old newspaper even soledad seemed like a centre of civilization to us so that evening we put our thumbs on our nose at don jaimes fruit stand and shook his grass burrs off our feet  it was only twelve miles to soledad but it took me and liverpool two days to get there it was banana grove nearly all the way and we got twisted time and again it was like paging the palm room of a new york hotel for a man named smith  when we saw the houses of soledad between the trees all my disinclination toward this liverpool sam rose up in me i stood him while we were two white men against the banana brindles but now when there were prospects of my exchanging even cuss words with an american citizen i put him back in his proper place and he was a sight too with his rumpainted nose and his red whiskers and elephant feet with leather sandals strapped to them i suppose i looked about the same  it looks to me says i like great britain ought to be made to keep such ginswilling scurvy unbecoming mud larks as you at home instead of sending em over here to degrade and taint foreign lands we kicked you out of america once and we ought to put on rubber boots and do it again  oh you go to ell says liverpool which was about all the repartee he ever had  well soledad looked fine to me after don jaime s plantation liverpool and me walked into it side by side from force of habit past the calabosa and the hotel grande down across the plaza toward chicas hut where we hoped that liverpool being a husband of hers might work his luck for a meal  as we passed the twostory little frame house occupied by the american club we noticed that the balcony had been decorated all around with wreaths of evergreens and flowers and the flag was flying from the pole on the roof stanzey the consul and arkright a goldmine owner were smoking on the balcony me and liverpool waved our dirty hands toward em and smiled real society smiles but they turned their backs to us and went on talking and we had played whist once with the two of em up to the time when liverpool held all thirteen trumps for four hands in succession it was some holiday we knew but we didnt know the day nor the year  a little further along we saw a reverend man named pendergast who had come to soledad to build a church standing under a cocoanut palm with his little black alpaca coat and green umbrella  boys boys says he through his blue spectacles is it as bad as this are you so far reduced  were reduced says i to very vulgar fractions  it is indeed sad says pendergast to see my countrymen in such circumstances  cut arf of that out old party says liverpool cawnt you tell a member of the british upper classes when you see one  shut up i told liverpool youre on foreign soil now or that portion of it thats not on you  and on this day too goes on pendergast grievouson this most glorious day of the year when we should all be celebrating the dawn of christian civilization and the downfall of the wicked  i did notice bunting and bouquets decorating the town reverend says i but i didnt know what it was for weve been so long out of touch with calendars that we didnt know whether it was summer time or saturday afternoon  here is two dollars says pendergast digging up two chili silver wheels and handing em to me go my men and observe the rest of the day in a befitting manner  me and liverpool thanked him kindly and walked away  shall we eat i asks  oh ell says liverpool whats money for  very well then i says since you insist upon it well drink  so we pull up in a rum shop and get a quart of it and go down on the beach under a cocoanut tree and celebrate  not having eaten anything but oranges in two days the rum has immediate effect and once more i conjure up great repugnance toward the british nation  stand up here i says to liverpool you scum of a despot limited monarchy and have another dose of bunker hill that good man mr pendergast says i said we were to observe the day in a befitting manner and im not going to see his money misapplied  oh you go to ell says liverpool and i started in with a fine lefthander on his right eye  liverpool had been a fighter once but dissipation and bad company had taken the nerve out of him in ten minutes i had him lying on the sand waving the white flag  get up says i kicking him in the ribs and come along with me  liverpool got up and followed behind me because it was his habit wiping the red off his face and nose i led him to reverend pendergasts shack and called him out  look at this sir says ilook at this thing that was once a proud britisher you gave us two dollars and told us to celebrate the day the starspangled banner still waves hurrah for the stars and eagles  dear me says pendergast holding up his hands fighting on this day of all days on christmas day when peace on  christmas hell says i i thought it was the fourth of july    merry christmas said the red white and blue cockatoo  take him for six dollars said hopalong bibb hes got his dates and colours mixed
