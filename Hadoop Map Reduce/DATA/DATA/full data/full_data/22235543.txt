saw rain falling and the rainbow drawn    on lammermuir  hearkening i heard again    in my precipitous city beaten bells    winnow the keen sea wind  and here afar    intent on my own race and place i

in the end if this the least be good    if any deed be done if any fire    burn in the imperfect page the praise be thine     introductory   in the wild end of a moorland parish far out of the sight of any house there stands a cairn among the heather and a little by east of it in the going down of the braeside a monument with some verses half defaced  it was here that claverhouse shot with his own hand the praying weaver of balweary and the chisel of old mortality has clinked on that lonely gravestone  public and domestic history have thus marked with a bloody finger this hollow among the hills and since the cameronian gave his life there two hundred years ago in a glorious folly and without comprehension or regret the silence of the moss has been broken once again by the report of firearms and the cry of the dying  the deil’s hags was the old name  but the place is now called francie’s cairn  for a while it was told that francie walked  aggic hogg met him in the gloaming by the cairnside and he spoke to her with chattering teeth so that his words were lost  he pursued rob todd if any one could have believed robbie for the space of half a mile with pitiful entreaties  but the age is one of incredulity these superstitious decorations speedily fell off and the facts of the story itself like the bones of a giant buried there and half dug up survived naked and imperfect in the memory of the scattered neighbours  to this day of winter nights when the sleet is on the window and the cattle are quiet in the byre there will be told again amid the silence of the young and the additions and corrections of the old the tale of the justiceclerk and of his son young hermiston that vanished from men’s knowledge of the two kirsties and the four black brothers of the cauldstaneslap and of frank innes “the young fool advocate” that came into these moorland parts to find his destiny     chapter i—life and death of mrs weir   the lord justiceclerk was a stranger in that part of the country but his lady wife was known there from a child as her race had been before her  the old “riding rutherfords of hermiston” of whom she was the last descendant had been famous men of yore ill neighbours ill subjects and ill husbands to their wives though not their properties  tales of them were rife for twenty miles about and their name was even printed in the page of our scots histories not always to their credit  one bit the dust at flodden one was hanged at his peel door by james the fifth another fell dead in a carouse with tom dalyell while a fourth and that was jean’s own father died presiding at a hellfire club of which he was the founder  there were many heads shaken in crossmichael at that judgment the more so as the man had a villainous reputation among high and low and both with the godly and the worldly  at that very hour of his demise he had ten going pleas before the session eight of them oppressive  and the same doom extended even to his agents his grieve that had been his right hand in many a lefthand business being cast from his horse one night and drowned in a peathag on the kyeskairs and his very doer although lawyers have long spoons surviving him not long and dying on a sudden in a bloody flux  in all these generations while a male rutherford was in the saddle with his lads or brawling in a changehouse there would be always a whitefaced wife immured at home in the old peel or the later mansionhouse  it seemed this succession of martyrs bided long but took their vengeance in the end and that was in the person of the last descendant jean  she bore the name of the rutherfords but she was the daughter of their trembling wives  at the first she was not wholly without charm  neighbours recalled in her as a child a strain of elfin wilfulness gentle little mutinies sad little gaieties even a morning gleam of beauty that was not to be fulfilled  she withered in the growing and whether it was the sins of her sires or the sorrows of her mothers came to her maturity depressed and as it were defaced no blood of life in her no grasp or gaiety pious anxious tender tearful and incompetent  it was a wonder to many that she had married—seeming so wholly of the stuff that makes old maids  but chance cast her in the path of adam weir then the new lordadvocate a recognised risen man the conqueror of many obstacles and thus late in the day beginning to think upon a wife  he was one who looked rather to obedience than beauty yet it would seem he was struck with her at the first look  “wha’s she” he said turning to his host and when he had been told “ay” says he “she looks menseful  she minds me—” and then after a pause which some have been daring enough to set down to sentimental recollections “is she releegious” he asked and was shortly after at his own request presented  the acquaintance which it seems profane to call a courtship was pursued with mr weir’s accustomed industry and was long a legend or rather a source of legends in the parliament house  he was described coming rosy with much port into the drawingroom walking direct up to the lady and assailing her with pleasantries to which the embarrassed fair one responded in what seemed a kind of agony “eh mr weir” or “o mr weir” or “keep me mr weir”  on the very eve of their engagement it was related that one had drawn near to the tender couple and had overheard the lady cry out with the tones of one who talked for the sake of talking “keep me mr weir and what became of him” and the profound accents of the suitor reply “haangit mem haangit”  the motives upon either side were much debated  mr weir must have supposed his bride to be somehow suitable perhaps he belonged to that class of men who think a weak head the ornament of women—an opinion invariably punished in this life  her descent and her estate were beyond question her wayfaring ancestors and her litigious father had done well by jean there was ready money and there were broad acres ready to fall wholly to the husband to lend dignity to his descendants and to himself a title when he should be called upon the bench  on the side of jean there was perhaps some fascination of curiosity as to this unknown male animal that approached her with the roughness of a ploughman and the aplomb of an advocate  being so trenchantly opposed to all she knew loved or understood he may well have seemed to her the extreme if scarcely the ideal of his sex  and besides he was an ill man to refuse  a little over forty at the period of his marriage he looked already older and to the force of manhood added the senatorial dignity of years it was perhaps with an unreverend awe but he was awful  the bench the bar and the most experienced and reluctant witness bowed to his authority—and why not jeannie rutherford  the heresy about foolish women is always punished i have said and lord hermiston began to pay the penalty at once  his house in george square was wretchedly illguided nothing answerable to the expense of maintenance but the cellar which was his own private care  when things went wrong at dinner as they continually did my lord would look up the table at his wife “i think these broth would be better to sweem in than to sup”  or else to the butler “here m‘killop awa’ wi’ this raadical gigot—tak’ it to the french man and bring me some puddocks  it seems rather a sore kind of a business that i should be all day in court haanging raadicals and get nawthing to my denner”  of course this was but a manner of speaking and he had never hanged a man for being a radical in his life the law of which he was the faithful minister directing otherwise  and of course these growls were in the nature of pleasantry but it was of a recondite sort and uttered as they were in his resounding voice and commented on by that expression which they called in the parliament house “hermiston’s hanging face”—they struck mere dismay into the wife  she sat before him speechless and fluttering at each dish as at a fresh ordeal her eye hovered toward my lord’s countenance and fell again if he but ate in silence unspeakable relief was her portion if there were complaint the world was darkened  she would seek out the cook who was always her sister in the lord  “o my dear this is the most dreidful thing that my lord can never be contented in his own house” she would begin and weep and pray with the cook and then the cook would pray with mrs weir and the next day’s meal would never be a penny the better—and the next cook when she came would be worse if anything but just as pious  it was often wondered that lord hermiston bore it as he did indeed he was a stoical old voluptuary contented with sound wine and plenty of it  but there were moments when he overflowed  perhaps half a dozen times in the history of his married life—“here tak’ it awa’ and bring me a piece bread and kebbuck” he had exclaimed with an appalling explosion of his voice and rare gestures none thought to dispute or to make excuses the service was arrested mrs weir sat at the head of the table whimpering without disguise and his lordship opposite munched his bread and cheese in ostentatious disregard  once only mrs weir had ventured to appeal  he was passing her chair on his way into the study  “o edom” she wailed in a voice tragic with tears and reaching out to him both hands in one of which she held a sopping pockethandkerchief  he paused and looked upon her with a face of wrath into which there stole as he looked a twinkle of humour  “noansense” he said  “you and your noansense  what do i want with a christian faim’ly  i want christian broth  get me a lass that can plainboil a potato if she was a whüre off the streets”  and with these words which echoed in her tender ears like blasphemy he had passed on to his study and shut the door behind him  such was the housewifery in george square  it was better at hermiston where kirstie elliott the sister of a neighbouring bonnetlaird and an eighteenth cousin of the lady’s bore the charge of all and kept a trim house and a good country table  kirstie was a woman in a thousand clean capable notable once a moorland helen and still comely as a blood horse and healthy as the hill wind  high in flesh and voice and colour she ran the house with her whole intemperate soul in a bustle not without buffets  scarce more pious than decency in those days required she was the cause of many an anxious thought and many a tearful prayer to mrs weir  housekeeper and mistress renewed the parts of martha and mary and though with a pricking conscience mary reposed on martha’s strength as on a rock  even lord hermiston held kirstie in a particular regard  there were few with whom he unbent so gladly few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries  “kirstie and me maun have our joke” he would declare in high goodhumour as he buttered kirstie’s scones and she waited at table  a man who had no need either of love or of popularity a keen reader of men and of events there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared he would have been quite unprepared to learn that kirstie hated him  he thought maid and master were well matched hard bandy healthy broad scots folk without a hair of nonsense to the pair of them  and the fact was that she made a goddess and an only child of the effete and tearful lady and even as she waited at table her hands would sometimes itch for my lord’s ears  thus at least when the family were at hermiston not only my lord but mrs weir too enjoyed a holiday  free from the dreadful lookingfor of the miscarried dinner she would mind her seam read her piety books and take her walk which was my lord’s orders sometimes by herself sometimes with archie the only child of that scarce natural union  the child was her next bond to life  her frosted sentiment bloomed again she breathed deep of life she let loose her heart in that society  the miracle of her motherhood was ever new to her  the sight of the little man at her skirt intoxicated her with the sense of power and froze her with the consciousness of her responsibility  she looked forward and seeing him in fancy grow up and play his diverse part on the world’s theatre caught in her breath and lifted up her courage with a lively effort  it was only with the child that she forgot herself and was at moments natural yet it was only with the child that she had conceived and managed to pursue a scheme of conduct  archie was to be a great man and a good a minister if possible a saint for certain  she tried to engage his mind upon her favourite books rutherford’s letters scougalls grace abounding and the like  it was a common practice of hers and strange to remember now that she would carry the child to the deil’s hags sit with him on the praying weaver’s stone and talk of the covenanters till their tears ran down  her view of history was wholly artless a design in snow and ink upon the one side tender innocents with psalms upon their lips upon the other the persecutors booted bloodyminded flushed with wine a suffering christ a raging beelzebub persecutor was a word that knocked upon the woman’s heart it was her highest thought of wickedness and the mark of it was on her house  her greatgreatgrandfather had drawn the sword against the lord’s anointed on the field of rullion green and breathed his last tradition said in the arms of the detestable dalyell  nor could she blind herself to this that had they lived in those old days hermiston himself would have been numbered alongside of bloody mackenzie and the politic lauderdale and rothes in the band of god’s immediate enemies  the sense of this moved her to the more fervour she had a voice for that name of persecutor that thrilled in the child’s marrow and when one day the mob hooted and hissed them all in my lord’s travelling carriage and cried “down with the persecutor down with hanging hermiston” and mamma covered her eyes and wept and papa let down the glass and looked out upon the rabble with his droll formidable face bitter and smiling as they said he sometimes looked when he gave sentence archie was for the moment too much amazed to be alarmed but he had scarce got his mother by herself before his shrill voice was raised demanding an explanation why had they called papa a persecutor  “keep me my precious” she exclaimed  “keep me my dear this is poleetical  ye must never ask me anything poleetical erchie  your faither is a great man my dear and it’s no for me or you to be judging him  it would be telling us all if we behaved ourselves in our several stations the way your faither does in his high office and let me hear no more of any such disrespectful and undutiful questions  no that you meant to be undutiful my lamb your mother kens that—she kens it well dearie”  and so slid off to safer topics and left on the mind of the child an obscure but ineradicable sense of something wrong  mrs weir’s philosophy of life was summed in one expression—tenderness in her view of the universe which was all lighted up with a glow out of the doors of hell good people must walk there in a kind of ecstasy of tenderness  the beasts and plants had no souls they were here but for a day and let their day pass gently  and as for the immortal men on what black downward path were many of them wending and to what a horror of an immortality  “are not two sparrows” “whosoever shall smite thee” “god sendeth his rain” “judge not that ye be not judged”—these texts made her body of divinity she put them on in the morning with her clothes and lay down to sleep with them at night they haunted her like a favourite air they clung about her like a favourite perfume  their minister was a marrowy expounder of the law and my lord sat under him with relish but mrs weir respected him from far off heard him like the cannon of a beleaguered city usefully booming outside on the dogmatic ramparts and meanwhile within and out of shot dwelt in her private garden which she watered with grateful tears  it seems strange to say of this colourless and ineffectual woman but she was a true enthusiast and might have made the sunshine and the glory of a cloister perhaps none but archie knew she could be eloquent perhaps none but he had seen her—her colour raised her hands clasped or quivering—glow with gentle ardour  there is a corner of the policy of hermiston where you come suddenly in view of the summit of black fell sometimes like the mere grass top of a hill sometimes and this is her own expression like a precious jewel in the heavens  on such days upon the sudden view of it her hand would tighten on the child’s fingers her voice rise like a song  “i to the hills” she would repeat  “and o erchie are nae these like the hills of naphtali” and her tears would flow  upon an impressionable child the effect of this continual and pretty accompaniment to life was deep  the woman’s quietism and piety passed on to his different nature undiminished but whereas in her it was a native sentiment in him it was only an implanted dogma  nature and the child’s pugnacity at times revolted  a cad from the potterrow once struck him in the mouth he struck back the pair fought it out in the back stable lane towards the meadows and archie returned with a considerable decline in the number of his front teeth and unregenerately boasting of the losses of the foe  it was a sore day for mrs weir she wept and prayed over the infant backslider until my lord was due from court and she must resume that air of tremulous composure with which she always greeted him the judge was that day in an observant mood and remarked upon the absent teeth  “i am afraid erchie will have been fechting with some of they blagyard lads” said mrs weir  my lord’s voice rang out as it did seldom in the privacy of his own house  “i’ll have norm of that sir” he cried  “do you hear me—nonn of that  no son of mine shall be speldering in the glaur with any dirty raibble”  the anxious mother was grateful for so much support she had even feared the contrary  and that night when she put the child to bed—“now my dear ye see” she said “i told you what your faither would think of it if he heard ye had fallen into this dreidful sin and let you and me pray to god that ye may be keepit from the like temptation or strengthened to resist it”  the womanly falsity of this was thrown away  ice and iron cannot be welded and the points of view of the justiceclerk and mrs weir were not less unassimilable  the character and position of his father had long been a stumblingblock to archie and with every year of his age the difficulty grew more instant  the man was mostly silent when he spoke at all it was to speak of the things of the world always in a worldly spirit often in language that the child had been schooled to think coarse and sometimes with words that he knew to be sins in themselves tenderness was the first duty and my lord was invariably harsh  god was love the name of my lord to all who knew him was fear  in the world as schematised for archie by his mother the place was marked for such a creature  there were some whom it was good to pity and well though very likely useless to pray for they were named reprobates goats god’s enemies brands for the burning and archie tallied every mark of identification and drew the inevitable private inference that the lord justiceclerk was the chief of sinners  the mother’s honesty was scarce complete  there was one influence she feared for the child and still secretly combated that was my lord’s and half unconsciously half in a wilful blindness she continued to undermine her husband with his son  as long as archie remained silent she did so ruthlessly with a single eye to heaven and the child’s salvation but the day came when archie spoke  it was 1801 and archie was seven and beyond his years for curiosity and logic when he brought the case up openly  if judging were sinful and forbidden how came papa to be a judge to have that sin for a trade to bear the name of it for a distinction  “i can’t see it” said the little rabbi and wagged his head  mrs weir abounded in commonplace replies  “no i cannae see it” reiterated archie  “and i’ll tell you what mamma i don’t think you and me’s justifeed in staying with him”  the woman awoke to remorse she saw herself disloyal to her man her sovereign and breadwinner in whom with what she had of worldliness she took a certain subdued pride  she expatiated in reply on my lord’s honour and greatness his useful services in this world of sorrow and wrong and the place in which he stood far above where babes and innocents could hope to see or criticise  but she had builded too well—archie had his answers pat were not babes and innocents the type of the kingdom of heaven  were not honour and greatness the badges of the world  and at any rate how about the mob that had once seethed about the carriage  “it’s all very fine” he concluded “but in my opinion papa has no right to be it  and it seems that’s not the worst yet of it  it seems he’s called “the hanging judge”—it seems he’s crooool  i’ll tell you what it is mamma there’s a tex’ borne in upon me it were better for that man if a milestone were bound upon his back and him flung into the deepestmost pairts of the sea”  “o my lamb ye must never say the like of that” she cried  “ye’re to honour faither and mother dear that your days may be long in the land it’s atheists that cry out against him—french atheists erchie  ye would never surely even yourself down to be saying the same thing as french atheists  it would break my heart to think that of you  and o erchie here are’na you setting up to judge  and have ye no forgot god’s plain command—the first with promise dear  mind you upon the beam and the mote”  having thus carried the war into the enemy’s camp the terrified lady breathed again  and no doubt it is easy thus to circumvent a child with catchwords but it may be questioned how far it is effectual  an instinct in his breast detects the quibble and a voice condemns it  he will instantly submit privately hold the same opinion  for even in this simple and antique relation of the mother and the child hypocrisies are multiplied  when the court rose that year and the family returned to hermiston it was a common remark in all the country that the lady was sore failed she seemed to loose and seize again her touch with life now sitting inert in a sort of durable bewilderment anon waking to feverish and weak activity  she dawdled about the lasses at their work looking stupidly on she fell to rummaging in old cabinets and presses and desisted when half through she would begin remarks with an air of animation and drop them without a struggle  her common appearance was of one who has forgotten something and is trying to remember and when she overhauled one after another the worthless and touching mementoes of her youth she might have been seeking the clue to that lost thought  during this period she gave many gifts to the neighbours and house lasses giving them with a manner of regret that embarrassed the recipients  the last night of all she was busy on some female work and toiled upon it with so manifest and painful a devotion that my lord who was not often curious inquired as to its nature  she blushed to the eyes  “o edom it’s for you” she said  “it’s slippers i—i hae never made ye any”  “ye daft auld wife” returned his lordship  “a bonny figure i would be palmering about in bauchles”  the next day at the hour of her walk kirstie interfered  kirstie took this decay of her mistress very hard bore her a grudge quarrelled with and railed upon her the anxiety of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper  this day of all days she insisted disrespectfully with rustic fury that mrs weir should stay at home  but “no no” she said “it’s my lord’s orders” and set forth as usual  archie was visible in the acre bog engaged upon some childish enterprise the instrument of which was mire and she stood and looked at him a while like one about to call then thought otherwise sighed and shook her head and proceeded on her rounds alone  the house lasses were at the burnside washing and saw her pass with her loose weary dowdy gait  “she’s a terrible feckless wife the mistress” said the one  “tut” said the other “the wumman’s seeck”  “weel i canna see nae differ in her” returned the first  “a fushionless quean a feckless carline”  the poor creature thus discussed rambled a while in the grounds without a purpose  tides in her mind ebbed and flowed and carried her to and fro like seaweed  she tried a path paused returned and tried another questing forgetting her quest the spirit of choice extinct in her bosom or devoid of sequency  on a sudden it appeared as though she had remembered or had formed a resolution wheeled about returned with hurried steps and appeared in the diningroom where kirstie was at the cleaning like one charged with an important errand  “kirstie” she began and paused and then with conviction “mr weir isna speeritually minded but he has been a good man to me”  it was perhaps the first time since her husband’s elevation that she had forgotten the handle to his name of which the tender inconsistent woman was not a little proud  and when kirstie looked up at the speaker’s face she was aware of a change  “godsake what’s the maitter wi’ ye mem” cried the housekeeper starting from the rug  “i do not ken” answered her mistress shaking her head  “but he is not speeritually minded my dear”  “here sit down with ye  godsake what ails the wife” cried kirstie and helped and forced her into my lord’s own chair by the cheek of the hearth  “keep me what’s this” she gasped  “kirstie what’s this  i’m frich’ened”  they were her last words  it was the lowering nightfall when my lord returned  he had the sunset in his back all clouds and glory and before him by the wayside spied kirstie elliott waiting  she was dissolved in tears and addressed him in the high false note of barbarous mourning such as still lingers modified among scots heather  “the lord peety ye hermiston the lord prepare ye” she keened out “weary upon me that i should have to tell it”  he reined in his horse and looked upon her with the hanging face  “has the french landit” cried he  “man man” she said “is that a’ ye can think of  the lord prepare ye the lord comfort and support ye”  “is onybody deid” said his lordship  “it’s no erchie”  “bethankit no” exclaimed the woman startled into a more natural tone “na na it’s no sae bad as that  it’s the mistress my lord she just fair flittit before my e’en  she just gi’ed a sab and was by wi’ it eh my bonny miss jeannie that i mind sae weel”  and forth again upon that pouring tide of lamentation in which women of her class excel and overabound  lord hermiston sat in the saddle beholding her  then he seemed to recover command upon himself  “well it’s something of the suddenest” said he  “but she was a dwaibly body from the first”  and he rode home at a precipitate amble with kirstie at his horse’s heels  dressed as she was for her last walk they had laid the dead lady on her bed  she was never interesting in life in death she was not impressive and as her husband stood before her with his hands crossed behind his powerful back that which he looked upon was the very image of the insignificant  “her and me were never cut out for one another” he remarked at last “it was a daftlike marriage”  and then with a most unusual gentleness of tone “puir bitch” said he “puir bitch”  then suddenly “where’s erchie”  kirstie had decoyed him to her room and given him “a jeelypiece”  “ye have some kind of gumption too” observed the judge and considered his housekeeper grimly  “when all’s said” he added “i micht have done waur—i micht have been marriet upon a skirting jezebel like you”  “there’s naebody thinking of you hermiston” cried the offended woman “we think of her that’s out of her sorrows  and could she have done waur  tell me that hermiston—tell me that before her claycauld corp”  “weel there’s some of them gey an’ ill to please” observed his lordship     chapter ii—father and son   my lord justiceclerk was known to many the man adam weir perhaps to none  he had nothing to explain or to conceal he sufficed wholly and silently to himself and that part of our nature which goes out too often with false coin to acquire glory or love seemed in him to be omitted  he did not try to be loved he did not care to be it is probable the very thought of it was a stranger to his mind  he was an admired lawyer a highly unpopular judge and he looked down upon those who were his inferiors in either distinction who were lawyers of less grasp or judges not so much detested  in all the rest of his days and doings not one trace of vanity appeared and he went on through life with a mechanical movement as of the unconscious that was almost august  he saw little of his son  in the childish maladies with which the boy was troubled he would make daily inquiries and daily pay him a visit entering the sickroom with a facetious and appalling countenance letting off a few perfunctory jests and going again swiftly to the patient’s relief  once a court holiday falling opportunely my lord had his carriage and drove the child himself to hermiston the customary place of convalescence  it is conceivable he had been more than usually anxious for that journey always remained in archie’s memory as a thing apart his father having related to him from beginning to end and with much detail three authentic murder cases  archie went the usual round of other edinburgh boys the high school and the college and hermiston looked on or rather looked away with scarce an affectation of interest in his progress  daily indeed upon a signal after dinner he was brought in given nuts and a glass of port regarded sardonically sarcastically questioned  “well sir and what have you donn with your book today” my lord might begin and set him posers in law latin  to a child just stumbling into corderius papinian and paul proved quite invincible  but papa had memory of no other  he was not harsh to the little scholar having a vast fund of patience learned upon the bench and was at no pains whether to conceal or to express his disappointment “well ye have a long jaunt before ye yet” he might observe yawning and fall back on his own thoughts as like as not until the time came for separation and my lord would take the decanter and the glass and be off to the back chamber looking on the meadows where he toiled on his cases till the hours were small  there was no “fuller man” on the bench his memory was marvellous though wholly legal if he had to “advise” extempore none did it better yet there was none who more earnestly prepared  as he thus watched in the night or sat at table and forgot the presence of his son no doubt but he tasted deeply of recondite pleasures  to be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life and perhaps only in law and the higher mathematics may this devotion be maintained suffice to itself without reaction and find continual rewards without excitement  this atmosphere of his father’s sterling industry was the best of archie’s education  assuredly it did not attract him assuredly it rather rebutted and depressed  yet it was still present unobserved like the ticking of a clock an arid ideal a tasteless stimulant in the boy’s life  but hermiston was not all of one piece  he was besides a mighty toper he could sit at wine until the day dawned and pass directly from the table to the bench with a steady hand and a clear head  beyond the third bottle he showed the plebeian in a larger print the low gross accent the low foul mirth grew broader and commoner he became less formidable and infinitely more disgusting  now the boy had inherited from jean rutherford a shivering delicacy unequally mated with potential violence  in the playingfields and amongst his own companions he repaid a coarse expression with a blow at his father’s table when the time came for him to join these revels he turned pale and sickened in silence of all the guests whom he there encountered he had toleration for only one david keith carnegie lord glenalmond  lord glenalmond was tall and emaciated with long features and long delicate hands  he was often compared with the statue of forbes of culloden in the parliament house and his blue eye at more than sixty preserved some of the fire of youth  his exquisite disparity with any of his fellowguests his appearance as of an artist and an aristocrat stranded in rude company riveted the boy’s attention and as curiosity and interest are the things in the world that are the most immediately and certainly rewarded lord glenalmond was attracted by the boy  “and so this is your son hermiston” he asked laying his hand on archie’s shoulder  “he’s getting a big lad”  “hout” said the gracious father “just his mother over again—daurna say boo to a goose”  but the stranger retained the boy talked to him drew him out found in him a taste for letters and a fine ardent modest youthful soul and encouraged him to be a visitor on sunday evenings in his bare cold lonely diningroom where he sat and read in the isolation of a bachelor grown old in refinement  the beautiful gentleness and grace of the old judge and the delicacy of his person thoughts and language spoke to archie’s heart in its own tongue  he conceived the ambition to be such another and when the day came for him to choose a profession it was in emulation of lord glenalmond not of lord hermiston that he chose the bar  hermiston looked on at this friendship with some secret pride but openly with the intolerance of scorn  he scarce lost an opportunity to put them down with a rough jape and to say truth it was not difficult for they were neither of them quick  he had a word of contempt for the whole crowd of poets painters fiddlers and their admirers the bastard race of amateurs which was continually on his lips  “signor feedleeerie” he would say  “o for goad’s sake no more of the signor”  “you and my father are great friends are you not” asked archie once  “there is no man that i more respect archie” replied lord glenalmond “he is two things of price  he is a great lawyer and he is upright as the day”  “you and he are so different” said the boy his eyes dwelling on those of his old friend like a lover’s on his mistress’s  “indeed so” replied the judge “very different  and so i fear are you and he  yet i would like it very ill if my young friend were to misjudge his father  he has all the roman virtues cato and brutus were such i think a son’s heart might well be proud of such an ancestry of one”  “and i would sooner he were a plaided herd” cried archie with sudden bitterness  “and that is neither very wise nor i believe entirely true” returned glenalmond  “before you are done you will find some of these expressions rise on you like a remorse  they are merely literary and decorative they do not aptly express your thought nor is your thought clearly apprehended and no doubt your father if he were here would say ‘signor feedleeerie’”  with the infinitely delicate sense of youth archie avoided the subject from that hour  it was perhaps a pity  had he but talked—talked freely—let himself gush out in words the way youth loves to do and should there might have been no tale to write upon the weirs of hermiston  but the shadow of a threat of ridicule sufficed in the slight tartness of these words he read a prohibition and it is likely that glenalmond meant it so  besides the veteran the boy was without confidant or friend  serious and eager he came through school and college and moved among a crowd of the indifferent in the seclusion of his shyness  he grew up handsome with an open speaking countenance with graceful youthful ways he was clever he took prizes he shone in the speculative society  it should seem he must become the centre of a crowd of friends but something that was in part the delicacy of his mother in part the austerity of his father held him aloof from all  it is a fact and a strange one that among his contemporaries hermiston’s son was thought to be a chip of the old block  “you’re a friend of archie weir’s” said one to frank innes and innes replied with his usual flippancy and more than his usual insight “i know weir but i never met archie”  no one had met archie a malady most incident to only sons  he flew his private signal and none heeded it it seemed he was abroad in a world from which the very hope of intimacy was banished and he looked round about him on the concourse of his fellowstudents and forward to the trivial days and acquaintances that were to come without hope or interest  as time went on the tough and rough old sinner felt himself drawn to the son of his loins and sole continuator of his new family with softnesses of sentiment that he could hardly credit and was wholly impotent to express  with a face voice and manner trained through forty years to terrify and repel rhadamanthus may be great but he will scarce be engaging  it is a fact that he tried to propitiate archie but a fact that cannot be too lightly taken the attempt was so unconspicuously made the failure so stoically supported  sympathy is not due to these steadfast iron natures  if he failed to gain his son’s friendship or even his son’s toleration on he went up the great bare staircase of his duty uncheered and undepressed  there might have been more pleasure in his relations with archie so much he may have recognised at moments but pleasure was a byproduct of the singular chemistry of life which only fools expected  an idea of archie’s attitude since we are all grown up and have forgotten the days of our youth it is more difficult to convey  he made no attempt whatsoever to understand the man with whom he dined and breakfasted  parsimony of pain glut of pleasure these are the two alternating ends of youth and archie was of the parsimonious  the wind blew cold out of a certain quarter—he turned his back upon it stayed as little as was possible in his father’s presence and when there averted his eyes as much as was decent from his father’s face  the lamp shone for many hundred days upon these two at table—my lord ruddy gloomy and unreverent archie with a potential brightness that was always dimmed and veiled in that society and there were not perhaps in christendom two men more radically strangers  the father with a grand simplicity either spoke of what interested himself or maintained an unaffected silence  the son turned in his head for some topic that should be quite safe that would spare him fresh evidences either of my lord’s inherent grossness or of the innocence of his inhumanity treading gingerly the ways of intercourse like a lady gathering up her skirts in a bypath if he made a mistake and my lord began to abound in matter of offence archie drew himself up his brow grew dark his share of the talk expired but my lord would faithfully and cheerfully continue to pour out the worst of himself before his silent and offended son  “well it’s a poor hert that never rejoices” he would say at the conclusion of such a nightmare interview  “but i must get to my plewstilts” and he would seclude himself as usual in his back room and archie go forth into the night and the city quivering with animosity and scorn     chapter iii—in the matter of the hanging of duncan jopp   it chanced in the year 1813 that archie strayed one day into the justiciary court  the macer made room for the son of the presiding judge  in the dock the centre of men’s eyes there stood a wheycoloured misbegotten caitiff duncan jopp on trial for his life his story as it was raked out before him in that public scene was one of disgrace and vice and cowardice the very nakedness of crime and the creature heard and it seemed at times as though he understood—as if at times he forgot the horror of the place he stood in and remembered the shame of what had brought him there  he kept his head bowed and his hands clutched upon the rail his hair dropped in his eyes and at times he flung it back and now he glanced about the audience in a sudden fellness of terror and now looked in the face of his judge and gulped there was pinned about his throat a piece of dingy flannel and this it was perhaps that turned the scale in archie’s mind between disgust and pity  the creature stood in a vanishing point yet a little while and he was still a man and had eyes and apprehension yet a little longer and with a last sordid piece of pageantry he would cease to be  and here in the meantime with a trait of human nature that caught at the beholder’s breath he was tending a sore throat  over against him my lord hermiston occupied the bench in the red robes of criminal jurisdiction his face framed in the white wig  honest all through he did not affect the virtue of impartiality this was no case for refinement there was a man to be hanged he would have said and he was hanging him  nor was it possible to see his lordship and acquit him of gusto in the task  it was plain he gloried in the exercise of his trained faculties in the clear sight which pierced at once into the joint of fact in the rude unvarnished gibes with which he demolished every figment of defence  he took his ease and jested unbending in that solemn place with some of the freedom of the tavern and the rag of man with the flannel round his neck was hunted gallowsward with jeers  duncan had a mistress scarce less forlorn and greatly older than himself who came up whimpering and curtseying to add the weight of her betrayal  my lord gave her the oath in his most roaring voice and added an intolerant warning  “mind what ye say now janet” said he  “i have an e’e upon ye i’m ill to jest with”  presently after she was tremblingly embarked on her story “and what made ye do this ye auld runt” the court interposed  “do ye mean to tell me ye was the panel’s mistress”  “if you please ma loard” whined the female  “godsake ye made a bonny couple” observed his lordship and there was something so formidable and ferocious in his scorn that not even the galleries thought to laugh  the summing up contained some jewels  “these two peetiable creatures seem to have made up thegither it’s not for us to explain why”—“the panel who whatever else he may be appears to be equally ill setout in mind and boady”—“neither the panel nor yet the old wife appears to have had so much common sense as even to tell a lie when it was necessary”  and in the course of sentencing my lord had this obiter dictum “i have been the means under god of haanging a great number but never just such a disjaskit rascal as yourself”  the words were strong in themselves the light and heat and detonation of their delivery and the savage pleasure of the speaker in his task made them tingle in the ears  when all was over archie came forth again into a changed world  had there been the least redeeming greatness in the crime any obscurity any dubiety perhaps he might have understood  but the culprit stood with his sore throat in the sweat of his mortal agony without defence or excuse a thing to cover up with blushes a being so much sunk beneath the zones of sympathy that pity might seem harmless  and the judge had pursued him with a monstrous relishing gaiety horrible to be conceived a trait for nightmares  it is one thing to spear a tiger another to crush a toad there are æsthetics even of the slaughterhouse and the loathsomeness of duncan jopp enveloped and infected the image of his judge  archie passed by his friends in the high street with incoherent words and gestures  he saw holyrood in a dream remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded he had a vision of the old radiant stories of queen mary and prince charlie of the hooded stag of the splendour and crime the velvet and bright iron of the past and dismissed them with a cry of pain  he lay and moaned in the hunter’s bog and the heavens were dark above him and the grass of the field an offence  “this is my father” he said  “i draw my life from him the flesh upon my bones is his the bread i am fed with is the wages of these horrors”  he recalled his mother and ground his forehead in the earth  he thought of flight and where was he to flee to of other lives but was there any life worth living in this den of savage and jeering animals  the interval before the execution was like a violent dream  he met his father he would not look at him he could not speak to him  it seemed there was no living creature but must have been swift to recognise that imminent animosity but the hide of the justiceclerk remained impenetrable  had my lord been talkative the truce could never have subsisted but he was by fortune in one of his humours of sour silence and under the very guns of his broadside archie nursed the enthusiasm of rebellion  it seemed to him from the top of his nineteen years’ experience as if he were marked at birth to be the perpetrator of some signal action to set back fallen mercy to overthrow the usurping devil that sat horned and hoofed on her throne  seductive jacobin figments which he had often refuted at the speculative swam up in his mind and startled him as with voices and he seemed to himself to walk accompanied by an almost tangible presence of new beliefs and duties  on the named morning he was at the place of execution  he saw the fleering rabble the flinching wretch produced  he looked on for a while at a certain parody of devotion which seemed to strip the wretch of his last claim to manhood  then followed the brutal instant of extinction and the paltry dangling of the remains like a broken jumpingjack  he had been prepared for something terrible not for this tragic meanness he stood a moment silent and then—“i denounce this goddefying murder” he shouted and his father if he must have disclaimed the sentiment might have owned the stentorian voice with which it was uttered  frank innes dragged him from the spot  the two handsome lads followed the same course of study and recreation and felt a certain mutual attraction founded mainly on good looks  it had never gone deep frank was by nature a thin jeering creature not truly susceptible whether of feeling or inspiring friendship and the relation between the pair was altogether on the outside a thing of common knowledge and the pleasantries that spring from a common acquaintance  the more credit to frank that he was appalled by archie’s outburst and at least conceived the design of keeping him in sight and if possible in hand for the day  but archie who had just defied—was it god or satan—would not listen to the word of a college companion  “i will not go with you” he said  “i do not desire your company sir i would be alone”  “here weir man don’t be absurd” said innes keeping a tight hold upon his sleeve  “i will not let you go until i know what you mean to do with yourself it’s no use brandishing that staff”  for indeed at that moment archie had made a sudden—perhaps a warlike—movement  “this has been the most insane affair you know it has  you know very well that i’m playing the good samaritan  all i wish is to keep you quiet”  “if quietness is what you wish mr innes” said archie “and you will promise to leave me entirely to myself i will tell you so much that i am going to walk in the country and admire the beauties of nature”  “honour bright” asked frank  “i am not in the habit of lying mr innes” retorted archie  “i have the honour of wishing you goodday”  “you won’t forget the spec” asked innes  “the spec” said archie  “o no i won’t forget the spec”  and the one young man carried his tortured spirit forth of the city and all the day long by one road and another in an endless pilgrimage of misery while the other hastened smilingly to spread the news of weir’s access of insanity and to drum up for that night a full attendance at the speculative where further eccentric developments might certainly be looked for  i doubt if innes had the least belief in his prediction i think it flowed rather from a wish to make the story as good and the scandal as great as possible not from any illwill to archie—from the mere pleasure of beholding interested faces  but for all that his words were prophetic  archie did not forget the spec he put in an appearance there at the due time and before the evening was over had dealt a memorable shock to his companions  it chanced he was the president of the night  he sat in the same room where the society still meets—only the portraits were not there the men who afterwards sat for them were then but beginning their career  the same lustre of many tapers shed its light over the meeting the same chair perhaps supported him that so many of us have sat in since  at times he seemed to forget the business of the evening but even in these periods he sat with a great air of energy and determination  at times he meddled bitterly and launched with defiance those fines which are the precious and rarely used artillery of the president  he little thought as he did so how he resembled his father but his friends remarked upon it chuckling  so far in his high place above his fellowstudents he seemed set beyond the possibility of any scandal but his mind was made up—he was determined to fulfil the sphere of his offence  he signed to innes whom he had just fined and who just impeached his ruling to succeed him in the chair stepped down from the platform and took his place by the chimneypiece the shine of many wax tapers from above illuminating his pale face the glow of the great red fire relieving from behind his slim figure  he had to propose as an amendment to the next subject in the casebook “whether capital punishment be consistent with god’s will or man’s policy”  a breath of embarrassment of something like alarm passed round the room so daring did these words appear upon the lips of hermiston’s only son  but the amendment was not seconded the previous question was promptly moved and unanimously voted and the momentary scandal smuggled by  innes triumphed in the fulfilment of his prophecy  he and archie were now become the heroes of the night but whereas every one crowded about innes when the meeting broke up but one of all his companions came to speak to archie  “weir man  that was an extraordinary raid of yours” observed this courageous member taking him confidentially by the arm as they went out  “i don’t think it a raid” said archie grimly  “more like a war  i saw that poor brute hanged this morning and my gorge rises at it yet”  “huttut” returned his companion and dropping his arm like something hot he sought the less tense society of others  archie found himself alone  the last of the faithful—or was it only the boldest of the curious—had fled  he watched the black huddle of his fellowstudents draw off down and up the street in whispering or boisterous gangs  and the isolation of the moment weighed upon him like an omen and an emblem of his destiny in life  bred up in unbroken fear himself among trembling servants and in a house which at the least ruffle in the master’s voice shuddered into silence he saw himself on the brink of the red valley of war and measured the danger and length of it with awe  he made a detour in the glimmer and shadow of the streets came into the back stable lane and watched for a long while the light burn steady in the judge’s room  the longer he gazed upon that illuminated windowblind the more blank became the picture of the man who sat behind it endlessly turning over sheets of process pausing to sip a glass of port or rising and passing heavily about his booklined walls to verify some reference  he could not combine the brutal judge and the industrious dispassionate student the connecting link escaped him from such a dual nature it was impossible he should predict behaviour and he asked himself if he had done well to plunge into a business of which the end could not be foreseen and presently after with a sickening decline of confidence if he had done loyally to strike his father  for he had struck him—defied him twice over and before a cloud of witnesses—struck him a public buffet before crowds  who had called him to judge his father in these precarious and high questions the office was usurped  it might have become a stranger in a son—there was no blinking it—in a son it was disloyal  and now between these two natures so antipathetic so hateful to each other there was depending an unpardonable affront and the providence of god alone might foresee the manner in which it would be resented by lord hermiston  these misgivings tortured him all night and arose with him in the winter’s morning they followed him from class to class they made him shrinkingly sensitive to every shade of manner in his companions they sounded in his ears through the current voice of the professor and he brought them home with him at night unabated and indeed increased  the cause of this increase lay in a chance encounter with the celebrated dr gregory  archie stood looking vaguely in the lighted window of a book shop trying to nerve himself for the approaching ordeal  my lord and he had met and parted in the morning as they had now done for long with scarcely the ordinary civilities of life and it was plain to the son that nothing had yet reached the father’s ears  indeed when he recalled the awful countenance of my lord a timid hope sprang up in him that perhaps there would be found no one bold enough to carry tales  if this were so he asked himself would he begin again and he found no answer it was at this moment that a hand was laid upon his arm and a voice said in his ear “my dear mr archie you had better come and see me”  he started turned round and found himself face to face with dr gregory  “and why should i come to see you” he asked with the defiance of the miserable  “because you are looking exceedingly ill” said the doctor “and you very evidently want looking after my young friend  good folk are scarce you know and it is not every one that would be quite so much missed as yourself  it is not every one that hermiston would miss”  and with a nod and a smile the doctor passed on  a moment after archie was in pursuit and had in turn but more roughly seized him by the arm  “what do you mean what did you mean by saying that  what makes you think that hermis—my father would have missed me”  the doctor turned about and looked him all over with a clinical eye  a far more stupid man than dr gregory might have guessed the truth but ninetynine out of a hundred even if they had been equally inclined to kindness would have blundered by some touch of charitable exaggeration the doctor was better inspired  he knew the father well in that white face of intelligence and suffering he divined something of the son and he told without apology or adornment the plain truth  “when you had the measles mr archibald you had them gey and ill and i thought you were going to slip between my fingers” he said  “well your father was anxious  how did i know it says you  simply because i am a trained observer  the sign that i saw him make ten thousand would have missed and perhaps—perhaps i say because he’s a hard man to judge of—but perhaps he never made another  a strange thing to consider  it was this  one day i came to him ‘hermiston’ said i ‘there’s a change’  he never said a word just glowered at me if ye’ll pardon the phrase like a wild beast  ‘a change for the better’ said i  and i distinctly heard him take his breath”  the doctor left no opportunity for anticlimax nodding his cocked hat a piece of antiquity to which he clung and repeating “distinctly” with raised eyebrows he took his departure and left archie speechless in the street  the anecdote might be called infinitely little and yet its meaning for archie was immense  “i did not know the old man had so much blood in him”  he had never dreamed this sire of his this aboriginal antique this adamantine adam had even so much of a heart as to be moved in the least degree for another—and that other himself who had insulted him with the generosity of youth archie was instantly under arms upon the other side had instantly created a new image of lord hermiston that of a man who was all iron without and all sensibility within  the mind of the vile jester the tongue that had pursued duncan jopp with unmanly insults the unbeloved countenance that he had known and feared for so long were all forgotten and he hastened home impatient to confess his misdeeds impatient to throw himself on the mercy of this imaginary character  he was not to be long without a rude awakening  it was in the gloaming when he drew near the doorstep of the lighted house and was aware of the figure of his father approaching from the opposite side  little daylight lingered but on the door being opened the strong yellow shine of the lamp gushed out upon the landing and shone full on archie as he stood in the oldfashioned observance of respect to yield precedence the judge came without haste stepping stately and firm his chin raised his face as he entered the lamplight strongly illumined his mouth set hard  there was never a wink of change in his expression without looking to the right or left he mounted the stair passed close to archie and entered the house  instinctively the boy upon his first coming had made a movement to meet him instinctively he recoiled against the railing as the old man swept by him in a pomp of indignation  words were needless he knew all—perhaps more than all—and the hour of judgment was at hand  it is possible that in this sudden revulsion of hope and before these symptoms of impending danger archie might have fled  but not even that was left to him  my lord after hanging up his cloak and hat turned round in the lighted entry and made him an imperative and silent gesture with his thumb and with the strange instinct of obedience archie followed him into the house  all dinnertime there reigned over the judge’s table a palpable silence and as soon as the solids were despatched he rose to his feet  “m‘killup tak’ the wine into my room” said he and then to his son “archie you and me has to have a talk”  it was at this sickening moment that archie’s courage for the first and last time entirely deserted him  “i have an appointment” said he  “it’ll have to be broken then” said hermiston and led the way into his study  the lamp was shaded the fire trimmed to a nicety the table covered deep with orderly documents the backs of law books made a frame upon all sides that was only broken by the window and the doors  for a moment hermiston warmed his hands at the fire presenting his back to archie then suddenly disclosed on him the terrors of the hanging face  “what’s this i hear of ye” he asked  there was no answer possible to archie  “i’ll have to tell ye then” pursued hermiston  “it seems ye’ve been skirting against the father that begot ye and one of his maijesty’s judges in this land and that in the public street and while an order of the court was being executit  forbye which it would appear that ye’ve been airing your opeenions in a coallege debatin’ society” he paused a moment and then with extraordinary bitterness added “ye damned eediot”  “i had meant to tell you” stammered archie  “i see you are well informed”  “muckle obleeged to ye” said his lordship and took his usual seat “and so you disapprove of caapital punishment” he added  “i am sorry sir i do” said archie  “i am sorry too” said his lordship  “and now if you please we shall approach this business with a little more parteecularity  i hear that at the hanging of duncan jopp—and man ye had a fine client there—in the middle of all the riffraff of the ceety ye thought fit to cry out ‘this is a damned murder and my gorge rises at the man that haangit him’”  “no sir these were not my words” cried archie  “what were yer words then” asked the judge  “i believe i said ‘i denounce it as a murder’” said the son  “i beg your pardon—a goddefying murder  i have no wish to conceal the truth” he added and looked his father for a moment in the face  “god it would only need that of it next” cried hermiston  “there was nothing about your gorge rising then”  “that was afterwards my lord as i was leaving the speculative  i said i had been to see the miserable creature hanged and my gorge rose at it”  “did ye though” said hermiston  “and i suppose ye knew who haangit him”  “i was present at the trial i ought to tell you that i ought to explain  i ask your pardon beforehand for any expression that may seem undutiful  the position in which i stand is wretched” said the unhappy hero now fairly face to face with the business he had chosen  “i have been reading some of your cases  i was present while jopp was tried  it was a hideous business  father it was a hideous thing  grant he was vile why should you hunt him with a vileness equal to his own  it was done with glee—that is the word—you did it with glee and i looked on god help me with horror”  “you’re a young gentleman that doesna approve of caapital punishment” said hermiston  “weel i’m an auld man that does  i was glad to get jopp haangit and what for would i pretend i wasna  you’re all for honesty it seems you couldn’t even steik your mouth on the public street  what for should i steik mines upon the bench the king’s officer bearing the sword a dreid to evildoers as i was from the beginning and as i will be to the end  mair than enough of it heedious  i never gave twa thoughts to heediousness i have no call to be bonny  i’m a man that gets through with my day’s business and let that suffice”  the ring of sarcasm had died out of his voice as he went on the plain words became invested with some of the dignity of the justiceseat  “it would be telling you if you could say as much” the speaker resumed “but ye cannot  ye’ve been reading some of my cases ye say  but it was not for the law in them it was to spy out your faither’s nakedness a fine employment in a son  you’re splairging you’re running at lairge in life like a wild nowt  it’s impossible you should think any longer of coming to the bar  you’re not fit for it no splairger is  and another thing son of mines or no son of mines you have flung fylement in public on one of the senators of the coallege of justice and i would make it my business to see that ye were never admitted there yourself  there is a kind of a decency to be observit  then comes the next of it—what am i to do with ye next  ye’ll have to find some kind of a trade for i’ll never support ye in idleset  what do ye fancy ye’ll be fit for  the pulpit na they could never get diveenity into that bloackhead  him that the law of man whammles is no likely to do muckle better by the law of god what would ye make of hell  wouldna your gorge rise at that  na there’s no room for splairgers under the fower quarters of john calvin what else is there  speak up  have ye got nothing of your own”  “father let me go to the peninsula” said archie  “that’s all i’m fit for—to fight”  “all quo’ he” returned the judge  “and it would be enough too if i thought it  but i’ll never trust ye so near the french you that’s so frenchifeed”  “you do me injustice there sir” said archie  “i am loyal i will not boast but any interest i may have ever felt in the french—”  “have ye been so loyal to me” interrupted his father  there came no reply  “i think not” continued hermiston  “and i would send no man to be a servant to the king god bless him that has proved such a shauchling son to his own faither  you can splairge here on edinburgh street and where’s the hairm  it doesna play buff on me  and if there were twenty thousand eediots like yourself sorrow a duncan jopp would hang the fewer  but there’s no splairging possible in a camp and if ye were to go to it you would find out for yourself whether lord well’n’ton approves of caapital punishment or not  you a sodger” he cried with a sudden burst of scorn  “ye auld wife the sodgers would bray at ye like cuddies”  as at the drawing of a curtain archie was aware of some illogicality in his position and stood abashed  he had a strong impression besides of the essential valour of the old gentleman before him how conveyed it would be hard to say  “well have ye no other proposeetion” said my lord again  “you have taken this so calmly sir that i cannot but stand ashamed” began archie  “i’m nearer voamiting though than you would fancy” said my lord  the blood rose to archie’s brow  “i beg your pardon i should have said that you had accepted my affront    i admit it was an affront i did not think to apologise but i do i ask your pardon it will not be so again i pass you my word of honour    i should have said that i admired your magnanimity with—this—offender” archie concluded with a gulp  “i have no other son ye see” said hermiston  “a bonny one i have gotten  but i must just do the best i can wi’ him and what am i to do if ye had been younger i would have wheepit ye for this rideeculous exhibeetion  the way it is i have just to grin and bear  but one thing is to be clearly understood  as a faither i must grin and bear it but if i had been the lord advocate instead of the lord justiceclerk son or no son mr erchibald weir would have been in a jyle the night”  archie was now dominated  lord hermiston was coarse and cruel and yet the son was aware of a bloomless nobility an ungracious abnegation of the man’s self in the man’s office  at every word this sense of the greatness of lord hermiston’s spirit struck more home and along with it that of his own impotence who had struck—and perhaps basely struck—at his own father and not reached so far as to have even nettled him  “i place myself in your hands without reserve” he said  “that’s the first sensible word i’ve had of ye the night” said hermiston  “i can tell ye that would have been the end of it the one way or the other but it’s better ye should come there yourself than what i would have had to hirstle ye  weel by my way of it—and my way is the best—there’s just the one thing it’s possible that ye might be with decency and that’s a laird  ye’ll be out of hairm’s way at the least of it  if ye have to rowt ye can rowt amang the kye and the maist feck of the caapital punishment ye’re like to come across’ll be guddling trouts now i’m for no idle lairdies every man has to work if it’s only at peddling ballants to work or to be wheeped or to be haangit  if i set ye down at hermiston i’ll have to see you work that place the way it has never been workit yet ye must ken about the sheep like a herd ye must be my grieve there and i’ll see that i gain by ye  is that understood”  “i will do my best” said archie  “well then i’ll send kirstie word the morn and ye can go yourself the day after” said hermiston  “and just try to be less of an eediot” he concluded with a freezing smile and turned immediately to the papers on his desk     chapter iv—opinions of the bench   late the same night after a disordered walk archie was admitted into lord glenalmond’s diningroom where he sat with a book upon his knee beside three frugal coals of fire  in his robes upon the bench glenalmond had a certain air of burliness plucked of these it was a maypole of a man that rose unsteadily from his chair to give his visitor welcome  archie had suffered much in the last days he had suffered again that evening his face was white and drawn his eyes wild and dark but lord glenalmond greeted him without the least mark of surprise or curiosity  “come in come in” said he  “come in and take a seat  carstairs” to his servant “make up the fire and then you can bring a bit of supper” and again to archie with a very trivial accent “i was half expecting you” he added  “no supper” said archie  “it is impossible that i should eat”  “not impossible” said the tall old man laying his hand upon his shoulder “and if you will believe me necessary”  “you know what brings me” said archie as soon as the servant had left the room  “i have a guess i have a guess” replied glenalmond  “we will talk of it presently—when carstairs has come and gone and you have had a piece of my good cheddar cheese and a pull at the porter tankard not before”  “it is impossible i should eat” repeated archie  “tut tut” said lord glenalmond  “you have eaten nothing today and i venture to add nothing yesterday  there is no case that may not be made worse this may be a very disagreeable business but if you were to fall sick and die it would be still more so and for all concerned—for all concerned”  “i see you must know all” said archie  “where did you hear it”  “in the mart of scandal in the parliament house” said glenalmond  “it runs riot below among the bar and the public but it sifts up to us upon the bench and rumour has some of her voices even in the divisions”  carstairs returned at this moment and rapidly laid out a little supper during which lord glenalmond spoke at large and a little vaguely on indifferent subjects so that it might be rather said of him that he made a cheerful noise than that he contributed to human conversation and archie sat upon the other side not heeding him brooding over his wrongs and errors  but so soon as the servant was gone he broke forth again at once  “who told my father  who dared to tell him  could it have been you”  “no it was not me” said the judge “although—to be quite frank with you and after i had seen and warned you—it might have been me—i believe it was glenkindie”  “that shrimp” cried archie  “as you say that shrimp” returned my lord “although really it is scarce a fitting mode of expression for one of the senators of the college of justice  we were hearing the parties in a long crucial case before the fifteen creech was moving at some length for an infeftment when i saw glenkindie lean forward to hermiston with his hand over his mouth and make him a secret communication  no one could have guessed its nature from your father from glenkindie yes his malice sparked out of him a little grossly  but your father no  a man of granite  the next moment he pounced upon creech  ‘mr creech’ says he ‘i’ll take a look of that sasine’ and for thirty minutes after” said glenalmond with a smile “messrs creech and co were fighting a pretty uphill battle which resulted i need hardly add in their total rout  the case was dismissed  no i doubt if ever i heard hermiston better inspired  he was literally rejoicing in apicibus juris”  archie was able to endure no longer  he thrust his plate away and interrupted the deliberate and insignificant stream of talk  “here” he said “i have made a fool of myself if i have not made something worse do you judge between us—judge between a father and a son  i can speak to you it is not like    i will tell you what i feel and what i mean to do and you shall be the judge” he repeated  “i decline jurisdiction” said glenalmond with extreme seriousness “but my dear boy if it will do you any good to talk and if it will interest you at all to hear what i may choose to say when i have heard you i am quite at your command  let an old man say it for once and not need to blush i love you like a son”  there came a sudden sharp sound in archie’s throat  “ay” he cried “and there it is  love  like a son  and how do you think i love my father”  “quietly quietly” says my lord  “i will be very quiet” replied archie  “and i will be baldly frank  i do not love my father i wonder sometimes if i do not hate him  there’s my shame perhaps my sin at least and in the sight of god not my fault  how was i to love him  he has never spoken to me never smiled upon me i do not think he ever touched me  you know the way he talks you do not talk so yet you can sit and hear him without shuddering and i cannot  my soul is sick when he begins with it i could smite him in the mouth  and all that’s nothing  i was at the trial of this jopp you were not there but you must have heard him often the man’s notorious for it for being—look at my position he’s my father and this is how i have to speak of him—notorious for being a brute and cruel and a coward  lord glenalmond i give you my word when i came out of that court i longed to die—the shame of it was beyond my strength but i—i—” he rose from his seat and began to pace the room in a disorder  “well who am i  a boy who have never been tried have never done anything except this twopenny impotent folly with my father  but i tell you my lord and i know myself i am at least that kind of a man—or that kind of a boy if you prefer it—that i could die in torments rather than that any one should suffer as that scoundrel suffered  well and what have i done  i see it now  i have made a fool of myself as i said in the beginning and i have gone back and asked my father’s pardon and placed myself wholly in his hands—and he has sent me to hermiston” with a wretched smile “for life i suppose—and what can i say he strikes me as having done quite right and let me off better than i had deserved”  “my poor dear boy” observed glenalmond  “my poor dear and if you will allow me to say so very foolish boy  you are only discovering where you are to one of your temperament or of mine a painful discovery  the world was not made for us it was made for ten hundred millions of men all different from each other and from us there’s no royal road there we just have to sclamber and tumble  don’t think that i am at all disposed to be surprised don’t suppose that i ever think of blaming you indeed i rather admire  but there fall to be offered one or two observations on the case which occur to me and which if you will listen to them dispassionately may be the means of inducing you to view the matter more calmly  first of all i cannot acquit you of a good deal of what is called intolerance  you seem to have been very much offended because your father talks a little sculduddery after dinner which it is perfectly licit for him to do and which although i am not very fond of it myself appears to be entirely an affair of taste  your father i scarcely like to remind you since it is so trite a commonplace is older than yourself  at least he is major and sui juris and may please himself in the matter of his conversation  and do you know i wonder if he might not have as good an answer against you and me  we say we sometimes find him coarse but i suspect he might retort that he finds us always dull  perhaps a relevant exception”  he beamed on archie but no smile could be elicited  “and now” proceeded the judge “for ‘archibald on capital punishment’ this is a very plausible academic opinion of course i do not and i cannot hold it but that’s not to say that many able and excellent persons have not done so in the past  possibly in the past also i may have a little dipped myself in the same heresy  my third client or possibly my fourth was the means of a return in my opinions  i never saw the man i more believed in i would have put my hand in the fire i would have gone to the cross for him and when it came to trial he was gradually pictured before me by undeniable probation in the light of so gross so coldblooded and so blackhearted a villain that i had a mind to have cast my brief upon the table  i was then boiling against the man with even a more tropical temperature than i had been boiling for him but i said to myself ‘no you have taken up his case and because you have changed your mind it must not be suffered to let drop  all that rich tide of eloquence that you prepared last night with so much enthusiasm is out of place and yet you must not desert him you must say something’  so i said something and i got him off  it made my reputation  but an experience of that kind is formative  a man must not bring his passions to the bar—or to the bench” he added  the story had slightly rekindled archie’s interest  “i could never deny” he began—“i mean i can conceive that some men would be better dead  but who are we to know all the springs of god’s unfortunate creatures  who are we to trust ourselves where it seems that god himself must think twice before he treads and to do it with delight yes with delight  tigris ut aspera”  “perhaps not a pleasant spectacle” said glenalmond  “and yet do you know i think somehow a great one”  “i’ve had a long talk with him tonight” said archie  “i was supposing so” said glenalmond  “and he struck me—i cannot deny that he struck me as something very big” pursued the son  “yes he is big  he never spoke about himself only about me  i suppose i admired him  the dreadful part—”  “suppose we did not talk about that” interrupted glenalmond  “you know it very well it cannot in any way help that you should brood upon it and i sometimes wonder whether you and i—who are a pair of sentimentalists—are quite good judges of plain men”  “how do you mean” asked archie  “fair judges mean” replied glenalmond  “can we be just to them  do we not ask too much  there was a word of yours just now that impressed me a little when you asked me who we were to know all the springs of god’s unfortunate creatures  you applied that as i understood to capital cases only  but does it—i ask myself—does it not apply all through  is it any less difficult to judge of a good man or of a halfgood man than of the worst criminal at the bar  and may not each have relevant excuses”  “ah but we do not talk of punishing the good” cried archie  “no we do not talk of it” said glenalmond  “but i think we do it your father for instance”  “you think i have punished him” cried archie  lord glenalmond bowed his head  “i think i have” said archie  “and the worst is i think he feels it how much who can tell with such a being  but i think he does”  “and i am sure of it” said glenalmond  “has he spoken to you then” cried archie  “o no” replied the judge  “i tell you honestly” said archie “i want to make it up to him  i will go i have already pledged myself to go to hermiston  that was to him and now i pledge myself to you in the sight of god that i will close my mouth on capital punishment and all other subjects where our views may clash for—how long shall i say when shall i have sense enough—ten years  is that well”  “it is well” said my lord  “as far as it goes” said archie  “it is enough as regards myself it is to lay down enough of my conceit  but as regards him whom i have publicly insulted  what am i to do to him  how do you pay attentions to a—an alp like that”  “only in one way” replied glenalmond  “only by obedience punctual prompt and scrupulous”  “and i promise that he shall have it” answered archie  “i offer you my hand in pledge of it”  “and i take your hand as a solemnity” replied the judge  “god bless you my dear and enable you to keep your promise  god guide you in the true way and spare your days and preserve to you your honest heart” at that he kissed the young man upon the forehead in a gracious distant antiquated way and instantly launched with a marked change of voice into another subject  “and now let us replenish the tankard and i believe if you will try my cheddar again you would find you had a better appetite  the court has spoken and the case is dismissed”  “no there is one thing i must say” cried archie  “i must say it in justice to himself  i know—i believe faithfully slavishly after our talk—he will never ask me anything unjust  i am proud to feel it that we have that much in common i am proud to say it to you”  the judge with shining eyes raised his tankard  “and i think perhaps that we might permit ourselves a toast” said he  “i should like to propose the health of a man very different from me and very much my superior—a man from whom i have often differed who has often in the trivial expression rubbed me the wrong way but whom i have never ceased to respect and i may add to be not a little afraid of  shall i give you his name”  “the lord justiceclerk lord hermiston” said archie almost with gaiety and the pair drank the toast deeply  it was not precisely easy to reestablish after these emotional passages the natural flow of conversation  but the judge eked out what was wanting with kind looks produced his snuffbox which was very rarely seen to fill in a pause and at last despairing of any further social success was upon the point of getting down a book to read a favourite passage when there came a rather startling summons at the front door and carstairs ushered in my lord glenkindie hot from a midnight supper  i am not aware that glenkindie was ever a beautiful object being short and grossbodied and with an expression of sensuality comparable to a bear’s  at that moment coming in hissing from many potations with a flushed countenance and blurred eyes he was strikingly contrasted with the tall pale kingly figure of glenalmond a rush of confused thought came over archie—of shame that this was one of his father’s elect friends of pride that at the least of it hermiston could carry his liquor and last of all of rage that he should have here under his eyes the man that had betrayed him  and then that too passed away and he sat quiet biding his opportunity  the tipsy senator plunged at once into an explanation with glenalmond there was a point reserved yesterday he had been able to make neither head nor tail of it and seeing lights in the house he had just dropped in for a glass of porter—and at this point he became aware of the third person  archie saw the cod’s mouth and the blunt lips of glenkindie gape at him for a moment and the recognition twinkle in his eyes  “who’s this” said he  “what is this possibly you don quickshot  and how are ye  and how’s your father  and what’s all this we hear of you it seems you’re a most extraordinary leveller by all tales  no king no parliaments and your gorge rises at the macers worthy men  hoot toot dear dear me  your father’s son too  most rideeculous”  archie was on his feet flushing a little at the reappearance of his unhappy figure of speech but perfectly selfpossessed  “my lord—and you lord glenalmond my dear friend” he began “this is a happy chance for me that i can make my confession and offer my apologies to two of you at once”  “ah but i don’t know about that  confession  it’ll be judeecial my young friend” cried the jocular glenkindie  “and i’m afraid to listen to ye  think if ye were to make me a coanvert”  “if you would allow me my lord” returned archie “what i have to say is very serious to me and be pleased to be humorous after i am gone”  “remember i’ll hear nothing against the macers” put in the incorrigible glenkindie  but archie continued as though he had not spoken  “i have played both yesterday and today a part for which i can only offer the excuse of youth  i was so unwise as to go to an execution it seems i made a scene at the gallows not content with which i spoke the same night in a college society against capital punishment  this is the extent of what i have done and in case you hear more alleged against me i protest my innocence  i have expressed my regret already to my father who is so good as to pass my conduct over—in a degree and upon the condition that i am to leave my law studies”        chapter v—winter on the moors   i at hermiston   the road to hermiston runs for a great part of the way up the valley of a stream a favourite with anglers and with midges full of falls and pools and shaded by willows and natural woods of birch  here and there but at great distances a byway branches off and a gaunt farmhouse may be descried above in a fold of the hill but the more part of the time the road would be quite empty of passage and the hills of habitation hermiston parish is one of the least populous in scotland and by the time you came that length you would scarce be surprised at the inimitable smallness of the kirk a dwarfish ancient place seated for fifty and standing in a green by the burnside among twoscore gravestones  the manse close by although no more than a cottage is surrounded by the brightness of a flowergarden and the straw roofs of bees and the whole colony kirk and manse garden and graveyard finds harbourage in a grove of rowans and is all the year round in a great silence broken only by the drone of the bees the tinkle of the burn and the bell on sundays  a mile beyond the kirk the road leaves the valley by a precipitous ascent and brings you a little after to the place of hermiston where it comes to an end in the backyard before the coachhouse  all beyond and about is the great field of the hills the plover the curlew and the lark cry there the wind blows as it blows in a ship’s rigging hard and cold and pure and the hilltops huddle one behind another like a herd of cattle into the sunset  the house was sixty years old unsightly comfortable a farmyard and a kitchengarden on the left with a fruit wall where little hard green pears came to their maturity about the end of october  the policy as who should say the park was of some extent but very ill reclaimed heather and moorfowl had crossed the boundary wall and spread and roosted within and it would have tasked a landscape gardener to say where policy ended and unpolicied nature began  my lord had been led by the influence of mr sheriff scott into a considerable design of planting many acres were accordingly set out with fir and the little feathery besoms gave a false scale and lent a strange air of a toyshop to the moors  a great rooty sweetness of bogs was in the air and at all seasons an infinite melancholy piping of hill birds  standing so high and with so little shelter it was a cold exposed house splashed by showers drenched by continuous rains that made the gutters to spout beaten upon and buffeted by all the winds of heaven and the prospect would be often black with tempest and often white with the snows of winter  but the house was wind and weather proof the hearths were kept bright and the rooms pleasant with live fires of peat and archie might sit of an evening and hear the squalls bugle on the moorland and watch the fire prosper in the earthy fuel and the smoke winding up the chimney and drink deep of the pleasures of shelter  solitary as the place was archie did not want neighbours  every night if he chose he might go down to the manse and share a “brewst” of toddy with the minister—a harebrained ancient gentleman long and light and still active though his knees were loosened with age and his voice broke continually in childish trebles—and his lady wife a heavy comely dame without a word to say for herself beyond goodeven and goodday harumscarum clodpole young lairds of the neighbourhood paid him the compliment of a visit  young hay of romanes rode down to call on his cropeared pony young pringle of drumanno came up on his bony grey  hay remained on the hospitable field and must be carried to bed pringle got somehow to his saddle about 3 am and as archie stood with the lamp on the upper doorstep lurched uttered a senseless viewholloa and vanished out of the small circle of illumination like a wraith  yet a minute or two longer the clatter of his breakneck flight was audible then it was cut off by the intervening steepness of the hill and again a great while after the renewed beating of phantom horsehoofs far in the valley of the hermiston showed that the horse at least if not his rider was still on the homeward way  there was a tuesday club at the “crosskeys” in crossmichael where the young bloods of the countryside congregated and drank deep on a percentage of the expense so that he was left gainer who should have drunk the most  archie had no great mind to this diversion but he took it like a duty laid upon him went with a decent regularity did his manfullest with the liquor held up his head in the local jests and got home again and was able to put up his horse to the admiration of kirstie and the lass that helped her  he dined at driffel supped at windielaws he went to the new year’s ball at huntsfield and was made welcome and thereafter rode to hounds with my lord muirfell upon whose name as that of a legitimate lord of parliament in a work so full of lords of session my pen should pause reverently  yet the same fate attended him here as in edinburgh  the habit of solitude tends to perpetuate itself and an austerity of which he was quite unconscious and a pride which seemed arrogance and perhaps was chiefly shyness discouraged and offended his new companions  hay did not return more than twice pringle never at all and there came a time when archie even desisted from the tuesday club and became in all things—what he had had the name of almost from the first—the recluse of hermiston  highnosed miss pringle of drumanno and highstepping miss marshall of the mains were understood to have had a difference of opinion about him the day after the ball—he was none the wiser he could not suppose himself to be remarked by these entrancing ladies  at the ball itself my lord muirfell’s daughter the lady flora spoke to him twice and the second time with a touch of appeal so that her colour rose and her voice trembled a little in his ear like a passing grace in music  he stepped back with a heart on fire coldly and not ungracefully excused himself and a little after watched her dancing with young drumanno of the empty laugh and was harrowed at the sight and raged to himself that this was a world in which it was given to drumanno to please and to himself only to stand aside and envy  he seemed excluded as of right from the favour of such society—seemed to extinguish mirth wherever he came and was quick to feel the wound and desist and retire into solitude  if he had but understood the figure he presented and the impression he made on these bright eyes and tender hearts if he had but guessed that the recluse of hermiston young graceful well spoken but always cold stirred the maidens of the county with the charm of byronism when byronism was new it may be questioned whether his destiny might not even yet have been modified  it may be questioned and i think it should be doubted  it was in his horoscope to be parsimonious of pain to himself or of the chance of pain even to the avoidance of any opportunity of pleasure to have a roman sense of duty an instinctive aristocracy of manners and taste to be the son of adam weir and jean rutherford    2 kirstie   kirstie was now over fifty and might have sat to a sculptor  long of limb and still light of foot deepbreasted robustloined her golden hair not yet mingled with any trace of silver the years had but caressed and embellished her  by the lines of a rich and vigorous maternity she seemed destined to be the bride of heroes and the mother of their children and behold by the iniquity of fate she had passed through her youth alone and drew near to the confines of age a childless woman the tender ambitions that she had received at birth had been by time and disappointment diverted into a certain barren zeal of industry and fury of interference  she carried her thwarted ardours into housework she washed floors with her empty heart  if she could not win the love of one with love she must dominate all by her temper  hasty wordy and wrathful she had a drawn quarrel with most of her neighbours and with the others not much more than armed neutrality  the grieve’s wife had been “sneisty” the sister of the gardener who kept house for him had shown herself “upsitten” and she wrote to lord hermiston about once a year demanding the discharge of the offenders and justifying the demand by much wealth of detail  for it must not be supposed that the quarrel rested with the wife and did not take in the husband also—or with the gardener’s sister and did not speedily include the gardener himself  as the upshot of all this petty quarrelling and intemperate speech she was practically excluded like a lightkeeper on his tower from the comforts of human association except with her own indoor drudge who being but a lassie and entirely at her mercy must submit to the shifty weather of “the mistress’s” moods without complaint and be willing to take buffets or caresses according to the temper of the hour  to kirstie thus situate and in the indian summer of her heart which was slow to submit to age the gods sent this equivocal good thing of archie’s presence she had known him in the cradle and paddled him when he misbehaved and yet as she had not so much as set eyes on him since he was eleven and had his last serious illness the tall slender refined and rather melancholy young gentleman of twenty came upon her with the shock of a new acquaintance  he was “young hermiston” “the laird himsel’” he had an air of distinctive superiority a cold straight glance of his black eyes that abashed the woman’s tantrums in the beginning and therefore the possibility of any quarrel was excluded  he was new and therefore immediately aroused her curiosity he was reticent and kept it awake and lastly he was dark and she fair and he was male and she female the everlasting fountains of interest  her feeling partook of the loyalty of a clanswoman the heroworship of a maiden aunt and the idolatry due to a god  no matter what he had asked of her ridiculous or tragic she would have done it and joyed to do it her passion for it was nothing less entirely filled her  it was a rich physical pleasure to make his bed or light his lamp for him when he was absent to pull off his wet boots or wait on him at dinner when he returned  a young man who should have so doted on the idea moral and physical of any woman might be properly described as being in love head and heels and would have behaved himself accordingly  but kirstie—though her heart leaped at his coming footsteps—though when he patted her shoulder her face brightened for the day—had not a hope or thought beyond the present moment and its perpetuation to the end of time  till the end of time she would have had nothing altered but still continue delightedly to serve her idol and be repaid say twice in the month with a clap on the shoulder  i have said her heart leaped—it is the accepted phrase  but rather when she was alone in any chamber of the house and heard his foot passing on the corridors something in her bosom rose slowly until her breath was suspended and as slowly fell again with a deep sigh when the steps had passed and she was disappointed of her eyes’ desire  this perpetual hunger and thirst of his presence kept her all day on the alert  when he went forth at morning she would stand and follow him with admiring looks  as it grew late and drew to the time of his return she would steal forth to a corner of the policy wall and be seen standing there sometimes by the hour together gazing with shaded eyes waiting the exquisite and barren pleasure of his view a mile off on the mountains when at night she had trimmed and gathered the fire turned down his bed and laid out his nightgear—when there was no more to be done for the king’s pleasure but to remember him fervently in her usually very tepid prayers and go to bed brooding upon his perfections his future career and what she should give him the next day for dinner—there still remained before her one more opportunity she was still to take in the tray and say goodnight  sometimes archie would glance up from his book with a preoccupied nod and a perfunctory salutation which was in truth a dismissal sometimes—and by degrees more often—the volume would be laid aside he would meet her coming with a look of relief and the conversation would be engaged last out the supper and be prolonged till the small hours by the waning fire  it was no wonder that archie was fond of company after his solitary days and kirstie upon her side exerted all the arts of her vigorous nature to ensnare his attention she would keep back some piece of news during dinner to be fired off with the entrance of the supper tray and form as it were the lever de rideau of the evening’s entertainment  once he had heard her tongue wag she made sure of the result  from one subject to another she moved by insidious transitions fearing the least silence fearing almost to give him time for an answer lest it should slip into a hint of separation  like so many people of her class she was a brave narrator her place was on the hearthrug and she made it a rostrum mimeing her stories as she told them fitting them with vital detail spinning them out with endless “quo’ he’s” and “quo’ she’s” her voice sinking into a whisper over the supernatural or the horrific until she would suddenly spring up in affected surprise and pointing to the clock “mercy mr archie” she would say “whatten a time o’ night is this of it  god forgive me for a daft wife”  so it befell by good management that she was not only the first to begin these nocturnal conversations but invariably the first to break them off so she managed to retire and not to be dismissed    3 a border family   such an unequal intimacy has never been uncommon in scotland where the clan spirit survives where the servant tends to spend her life in the same service a helpmeet at first then a tyrant and at last a pensioner where besides she is not necessarily destitute of the pride of birth but is perhaps like kirstie a connection of her master’s and at least knows the legend of her own family and may count kinship with some illustrious dead  for that is the mark of the scot of all classes that he stands in an attitude towards the past unthinkable to englishmen and remembers and cherishes the memory of his forebears good or bad and there burns alive in him a sense of identity with the dead even to the twentieth generation  no more characteristic instance could be found than in the family of kirstie elliott  they were all and kirstie the first of all ready and eager to pour forth the particulars of their genealogy embellished with every detail that memory had handed down or fancy fabricated and behold from every ramification of that tree there dangled a halter  the elliotts themselves have had a chequered history but these elliotts deduced besides from three of the most unfortunate of the border clans—the nicksons the ellwalds and the crozers  one ancestor after another might be seen appearing a moment out of the rain and the hill mist upon his furtive business speeding home perhaps with a paltry booty of lame horses and lean kine or squealing and dealing death in some moorland feud of the ferrets and the wild cats one after another closed his obscure adventures in midair triced up to the arm of the royal gibbet or the baron’s duletree  for the rusty blunderbuss of scots criminal justice which usually hurt nobody but jurymen became a weapon of precision for the nicksons the ellwalds and the crozers  the exhilaration of their exploits seemed to haunt the memories of their descendants alone and the shame to be forgotten pride glowed in their bosoms to publish their relationship to “andrew ellwald of the laverockstanes called ‘unchancy dand’ who was justifeed wi’ seeven mair of the same name at jeddart in the days of king james the sax”  in all this tissue of crime and misfortune the elliotts of cauldstaneslap had one boast which must appear legitimate the males were gallowsbirds born outlaws petty thieves and deadly brawlers but according to the same tradition the females were all chaste and faithful  the power of ancestry on the character is not limited to the inheritance of cells  if i buy ancestors by the gross from the benevolence of lyon king of arms my grandson if he is scottish will feel a quickening emulation of their deeds  the men of the elliotts were proud lawless violent as of right cherishing and prolonging a tradition  in like manner with the women  and the woman essentially passionate and reckless who crouched on the rug in the shine of the peat fire telling these tales had cherished through life a wild integrity of virtue  her father gilbert had been deeply pious a savage disciplinarian in the antique style and withal a notorious smuggler  “i mind when i was a bairn getting mony a skelp and being shoo’d to bed like pou’try” she would say  “that would be when the lads and their bit kegs were on the road  we’ve had the riffraff of twothree counties in our kitchen mony’s the time betwix’ the twelve and the three and their lanterns would be standing in the forecourt ay a score o’ them at once  but there was nae ungodly talk permitted at cauldstaneslap  my faither was a consistent man in walk and conversation just let slip an aith and there was the door to ye  he had that zeal for the lord it was a fair wonder to hear him pray but the family has aye had a gift that way” this father was twice married once to a dark woman of the old ellwald stock by whom he had gilbert presently of cauldstaneslap and secondly to the mother of kirstie  “he was an auld man when he married her a fell auld man wi’ a muckle voice—you could hear him rowting from the top o’ the kyeskairs” she said “but for her it appears she was a perfit wonder  it was gentle blood she had mr archie for it was your ain the countryside gaed gyte about her and her gowden hair  mines is no to be mentioned wi’ it and there’s few weemen has mair hair than what i have or yet a bonnier colour  often would i tell my dear miss jeannie—that was your mother dear she was cruel ta’en up about her hair it was unco’ tender ye see—‘houts miss jeannie’ i would say ‘just fling your washes and your french dentifrishes in the back o’ the fire for that’s the place for them and awa’ down to a burn side and wash yersel’ in cauld hill water and dry your bonny hair in the caller wind o’ the muirs the way that my mother aye washed hers and that i have aye made it a practice to have wishen mines—just you do what i tell ye my dear and ye’ll give me news of it  ye’ll have hair and routh of hair a pigtail as thick’s my arm’ i said ‘and the bonniest colour like the clear gowden guineas so as the lads in kirk’ll no can keep their eyes off it’  weel it lasted out her time puir thing  i cuttit a lock of it upon her corp that was lying there sae cauld  i’ll show it ye some of thir days if ye’re good  but as i was sayin’ my mither—”  on the death of the father there remained goldenhaired kirstie who took service with her distant kinsfolk the rutherfords and blackavised gilbert twenty years older who farmed the cauldstaneslap married and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784 and a daughter like a postscript in ’97 the year of camperdown and cape st vincent  it seemed it was a tradition in the family to wind up with a belated girl  in 1804 at the age of sixty gilbert met an end that might be called heroic  he was due home from market any time from eight at night till five in the morning and in any condition from the quarrelsome to the speechless for he maintained to that age the goodly customs of the scots farmer  it was known on this occasion that he had a good bit of money to bring home the word had gone round loosely  the laird had shown his guineas and if anybody had but noticed it there was an illlooking vagabond crew the scum of edinburgh that drew out of the market long ere it was dusk and took the hillroad by hermiston where it was not to be believed that they had lawful business  one of the countryside one dickieson they took with them to be their guide and dear he paid for it  of a sudden in the ford of the broken dykes this vermin clan fell on the laird six to one and him three parts asleep having drunk hard  but it is ill to catch an elliott  for a while in the night and the black water that was deep as to his saddlegirths he wrought with his staff like a smith at his stithy and great was the sound of oaths and blows  with that the ambuscade was burst and he rode for home with a pistolball in him three knife wounds the loss of his front teeth a broken rib and bridle and a dying horse  that was a race with death that the laird rode  in the mirk night with his broken bridle and his head swimming he dug his spurs to the rowels in the horse’s side and the horse that was even worse off than himself the poor creature screamed out loud like a person as he went so that the hills echoed with it and the folks at cauldstaneslap got to their feet about the table and looked at each other with white faces  the horse fell dead at the yard gate the laird won the length of the house and fell there on the threshold  to the son that raised him he gave the bag of money  “hae” said he  all the way up the thieves had seemed to him to be at his heels but now the hallucination left him—he saw them again in the place of the ambuscade—and the thirst of vengeance seized on his dying mind  raising himself and pointing with an imperious finger into the black night from which he had come he uttered the single command “brocken dykes” and fainted  he had never been loved but he had been feared in honour  at that sight at that word gasped out at them from a toothless and bleeding mouth the old elliott spirit awoke with a shout in the four sons  “wanting the hat” continues my author kirstie whom i but haltingly follow for she told this tale like one inspired “wanting guns for there wasna twa grains o’ pouder in the house wi’ nae mair weepons than their sticks into their hands the fower o’ them took the road  only hob and that was the eldest hunkered at the doorsill where the blood had rin fyled his hand wi’ it—and haddit it up to heeven in the way o’ the auld border aith ‘hell shall have her ain again this nicht’ he raired and rode forth upon his earrand”  it was three miles to broken dykes down hill and a sore road  kirstie has seen men from edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their horses  but the four brothers rode it as if auld hornie were behind and heaven in front  come to the ford and there was dickieson  by all tales he was not dead but breathed and reared upon his elbow and cried out to them for help  it was at a graceless face that he asked mercy  as soon as hob saw by the glint of the lantern the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth in the man’s face “damn you” says he “ye hae your teeth hae ye” and rode his horse to and fro upon that human remnant  beyond that dandie must dismount with the lantern to be their guide he was the youngest son scarce twenty at the time  “a’ nicht long they gaed in the wet heath and jennipers and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared but just followed the bluid stains and the footprints o’ their faither’s murderers  and a’ nicht dandie had his nose to the grund like a tyke and the ithers followed and spak’ naething neither black nor white  there was nae noise to be heard but just the sough of the swalled burns and hob the dour yin risping his teeth as he gaed” with the first glint of the morning they saw they were on the drove road and at that the four stopped and had a dram to their breakfasts for they knew that dand must have guided them right and the rogues could be but little ahead hot foot for edinburgh by the way of the pentland hills  by eight o’clock they had word of them—a shepherd had seen four men “uncoly mishandled” go by in the last hour  “that’s yin a piece” says clem and swung his cudgel  “five o’ them” says hob “god’s death but the faither was a man  and him drunk”  and then there befell them what my author termed “a sair misbegowk” for they were overtaken by a posse of mounted neighbours come to aid in the pursuit four sour faces looked on the reinforcement  “the deil’s broughten you” said clem and they rode thenceforward in the rear of the party with hanging heads  before ten they had found and secured the rogues and by three of the afternoon as they rode up the vennel with their prisoners they were aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something that dripped  “for the boady of the saxt” pursued kirstie “wi’ his head smashed like a hazelnit had been a’ that nicht in the chairge o’ hermiston water and it dunting it on the stanes and grunding it on the shallows and flinging the deid thing heelsowerhurdie at the fa’s o’ spango and in the first o’ the day tweed had got a hold o’ him and carried him off like a wind for it was uncoly swalled and raced wi’ him bobbing under braesides and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the starling of crossmichael brig  sae there they were a’thegither at last for dickieson had been brought in on a cart long syne and folk could see what mainner o’man my brither had been that had held his head again sax and saved the siller and him drunk”  thus died of honourable injuries and in the savour of fame gilbert elliott of the cauldstaneslap but his sons had scarce less glory out of the business their savage haste the skill with which dand had found and followed the trail the barbarity to the wounded dickieson which was like an open secret in the county and the doom which it was currently supposed they had intended for the others struck and stirred popular imagination some century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned the last of the ballads out of that homeric fight and chase but the spirit was dead or had been reincarnated already in mr sheriff scott and the degenerate moorsmen must be content to tell the tale in prose and to make of the “four black brothers” a unit after the fashion of the “twelve apostles” or the “three musketeers”  robert gilbert clement and andrew—in the proper border diminutives hob gib clem and dand elliott—these ballad heroes had much in common in particular their high sense of the family and the family honour but they went diverse ways and prospered and failed in different businesses according to kirstie “they had a’ bees in their bonnets but hob”  hob the laird was indeed essentially a decent man  an elder of the kirk nobody had heard an oath upon his lips save perhaps thrice or so at the sheepwashing since the chase of his father’s murderers  the figure he had shown on that eventful night disappeared as if swallowed by a trap he who had ecstatically dipped his hand in the red blood he who had ridden down dickieson became from that moment on a stiff and rather graceless model of the rustic proprieties cannily profiting by the high war prices and yearly stowing away a little nestegg in the bank against calamity approved of and sometimes consulted by the greater lairds for the massive and placid sense of what he said when he could be induced to say anything and particularly valued by the minister mr torrance as a righthand man in the parish and a model to parents  the transfiguration had been for the moment only some barbarossa some old adam of our ancestors sleeps in all of us till the fit circumstance shall call it into action and for as sober as he now seemed hob had given once for all the measure of the devil that haunted him  he was married and by reason of the effulgence of that legendary night was adored by his wife  he had a mob of little lusty barefoot children who marched in a caravan the long miles to school the stages of whose pilgrimage were marked by acts of spoliation and mischief and who were qualified in the countryside as “fair pests”  but in the house if “faither was in” they were quiet as mice  in short hob moved through life in a great peace—the reward of any one who shall have killed his man with any formidable and figurative circumstance in the midst of a country gagged and swaddled with civilisation  it was a current remark that the elliotts were “guid and bad like sanguishes” and certainly there was a curious distinction the men of business coming alternately with the dreamers  the second brother gib was a weaver by trade had gone out early into the world to edinburgh and come home again with his wings singed  there was an exaltation in his nature which had led him to embrace with enthusiasm the principles of the french revolution and had ended by bringing him under the hawse of my lord hermiston in that furious onslaught of his upon the liberals which sent muir and palmer into exile and dashed the party into chaff it was whispered that my lord in his great scorn for the movement and prevailed upon a little by a sense of neighbourliness had given gib a hint  meeting him one day in the potterrow my lord had stopped in front of him “gib ye eediot” he had said “what’s this i hear of you poalitics poalitics poalitics weaver’s poalitics is the way of it i hear  if ye arena a’thegither dozened with cediocy ye’ll gang your ways back to cauldstaneslap and ca’ your loom and ca’ your loom man” and gilbert had taken him at the word and returned with an expedition almost to be called flight to the house of his father  the clearest of his inheritance was that family gift of prayer of which kirstie had boasted and the baffled politician now turned his attention to religious matters—or as others said to heresy and schism  every sunday morning he was in crossmichael where he had gathered together one by one a sect of about a dozen persons who called themselves “god’s remnant of the true faithful” or for short “god’s remnant” to the profane they were known as “gib’s deils”  bailie sweedie a noted humorist in the town vowed that the proceedings always opened to the tune of “the deil fly away with the exciseman” and that the sacrament was dispensed in the form of hot whiskytoddy both wicked hits at the evangelist who had been suspected of smuggling in his youth and had been overtaken as the phrase went on the streets of crossmichael one fair day  it was known that every sunday they prayed for a blessing on the arms of bonaparte for this “god’s remnant” as they were “skailing” from the cottage that did duty for a temple had been repeatedly stoned by the bairns and gib himself hooted by a squadron of border volunteers in which his own brother dand rode in a uniform and with a drawn sword  the “remnant” were believed besides to be “antinomian in principle” which might otherwise have been a serious charge but the way public opinion then blew it was quite swallowed up and forgotten in the scandal about bonaparte  for the rest gilbert had set up his loom in an outhouse at cauldstaneslap where he laboured assiduously six days of the week  his brothers appalled by his political opinions and willing to avoid dissension in the household spoke but little to him he less to them remaining absorbed in the study of the bible and almost constant prayer the gaunt weaver was drynurse at cauldstaneslap and the bairns loved him dearly  except when he was carrying an infant in his arms he was rarely seen to smile—as indeed there were few smilers in that family when his sisterinlaw rallied him and proposed that he should get a wife and bairns of his own since he was so fond of them “i have no clearness of mind upon that point” he would reply  if nobody called him in to dinner he stayed out  mrs hob a hard unsympathetic woman once tried the experiment  he went without food all day but at dusk as the light began to fail him he came into the house of his own accord looking puzzled  “i’ve had a great gale of prayer upon my speerit” said he  “i canna mind sae muckle’s what i had for denner” the creed of god’s remnant was justified in the life of its founder  “and yet i dinna ken” said kirstie  “he’s maybe no more stockfish than his neeghbours he rode wi’ the rest o’ them and had a good stamach to the work by a’ that i hear  god’s remnant  the deil’s clavers  there wasna muckle christianity in the way hob guided johnny dickieson at the least of it but guid kens  is he a christian even  he might be a mahommedan or a deevil or a fireworshipper for what i ken”  the third brother had his name on a doorplate no less in the city of glasgow “mr clement elliott” as long as your arm  in his case that spirit of innovation which had shown itself timidly in the case of hob by the admission of new manures and which had run to waste with gilbert in subversive politics and heretical religions bore useful fruit in many ingenious mechanical improvements  in boyhood from his addiction to strange devices of sticks and string he had been counted the most eccentric of the family  but that was all by now and he was a partner of his firm and looked to die a bailie  he too had married and was rearing a plentiful family in the smoke and din of glasgow he was wealthy and could have bought out his brother the cocklaird six times over it was whispered and when he slipped away to cauldstaneslap for a wellearned holiday which he did as often as he was able he astonished the neighbours with his broadcloth his beaver hat and the ample plies of his neckcloth  though an eminently solid man at bottom after the pattern of hob he had contracted a certain glasgow briskness and aplomb which set him off  all the other elliotts were as lean as a rake but clement was laying on fat and he panted sorely when he must get into his boots  dand said chuckling “ay clem has the elements of a corporation”  “a provost and corporation” returned clem  and his readiness was much admired  the fourth brother dand was a shepherd to his trade and by starts when he could bring his mind to it excelled in the business  nobody could train a dog like dandie nobody through the peril of great storms in the winter time could do more gallantly  but if his dexterity were exquisite his diligence was but fitful and he served his brother for bed and board and a trifle of pocketmoney when he asked for it  he loved money well enough knew very well how to spend it and could make a shrewd bargain when he liked  but he preferred a vague knowledge that he was well to windward to any counted coins in the pocket he felt himself richer so  hob would expostulate “i’m an amature herd”  dand would reply “i’ll keep your sheep to you when i’m so minded but i’ll keep my liberty too  thir’s no man can coandescend on what i’m worth” clein would expound to him the miraculous results of compound interest and recommend investments  “ay man” dand would say “and do you think if i took hob’s siller that i wouldna drink it or wear it on the lassies and anyway my kingdom is no of this world  either i’m a poet or else i’m nothing”  clem would remind him of old age  “i’ll die young like robbie burns” he would say stoutly  no question but he had a certain accomplishment in minor verse  his “hermiston burn” with its pretty refrain—      “i love to gang thinking whaur ye gang linking              hermiston burn in the howe”  his “auld auld elliotts claycauld elliotts dour bauld elliotts of auld” and his really fascinating piece about the praying weaver’s stone had gained him in the neighbourhood the reputation still possible in scotland of a local bard and though not printed himself he was recognised by others who were and who had become famous  walter scott owed to dandie the text of the “raid of wearie” in the minstrelsy and made him welcome at his house and appreciated his talents such as they were with all his usual generosity  the ettrick shepherd was his sworn crony they would meet drink to excess roar out their lyrics in each other’s faces and quarrel and make it up again till bedtime  and besides these recognitions almost to be called official dandie was made welcome for the sake of his gift through the farmhouses of several contiguous dales and was thus exposed to manifold temptations which he rather sought than fled  he had figured on the stool of repentance for once fulfilling to the letter the tradition of his hero and model  his humorous verses to mr torrance on that occasion—“kenspeckle here my lane i stand”—unfortunately too indelicate for further citation ran through the country like a fiery cross—they were recited quoted paraphrased and laughed over as far away as dumfries on the one hand and dunbar on the other  these four brothers were united by a close bond the bond of that mutual admiration—or rather mutual heroworship—which is so strong among the members of secluded families who have much ability and little culture even the extremes admired each other  hob who had as much poetry as the tongs professed to find pleasure in dand’s verses clem who had no more religion than claverhouse nourished a heartfelt at least an openmouthed admiration of gib’s prayers and dandie followed with relish the rise of clem’s fortunes  indulgence followed hard on the heels of admiration  the laird clem and dand who were tories and patriots of the hottest quality excused to themselves with a certain bashfulness the radical and revolutionary heresies of gib  by another division of the family the laird clem and gib who were men exactly virtuous swallowed the dose of dand’s irregularities as a kind of clog or drawback in the mysterious providence of god affixed to bards and distinctly probative of poetical genius  to appreciate the simplicity of their mutual admiration it was necessary to hear clem arrived upon one of his visits and dealing in a spirit of continuous irony with the affairs and personalities of that great city of glasgow where he lived and transacted business  the various personages ministers of the church municipal officers mercantile bigwigs whom he had occasion to introduce were all alike denigrated all served but as reflectors to cast back a flattering sidelight on the house of cauldstaneslap  the provost for whom clem by exception entertained a measure of respect he would liken to hob  “he minds me o’ the laird there” he would say  “he has some of hob’s grand whunstane sense and the same way with him of steiking his mouth when he’s no very pleased”  and hob all unconscious would draw down his upper lip and produce as if for comparison the formidable grimace referred to  the unsatisfactory incumbent of st enoch’s kirk was thus briefly dismissed “if he had but twa fingers o’ gib’s he would waken them up”  and gib honest man would look down and secretly smile  clem was a spy whom they had sent out into the world of men  he had come back with the good news that there was nobody to compare with the four black brothers no position that they would not adorn no official that it would not be well they should replace no interest of mankind secular or spiritual which would not immediately bloom under their supervision  the excuse of their folly is in two words scarce the breadth of a hair divided them from the peasantry  the measure of their sense is this that these symposia of rustic vanity were kept entirely within the family like some secret ancestral practice  to the world their serious faces were never deformed by the suspicion of any simper of selfcontentment  yet it was known  “they hae a guid pride o’ themsel’s” was the word in the countryside  lastly in a border story there should be added their “twonames”  hob was the laird  “roy ne puis prince ne daigne” he was the laird of cauldstaneslap—say fifty acres—ipsissimus  clement was mr elliott as upon his doorplate the earlier dafty having been discarded as no longer applicable and indeed only a reminder of misjudgment and the imbecility of the public and the youngest in honour of his perpetual wanderings was known by the sobriquet of randy dand  it will be understood that not all this information was communicated by the aunt who had too much of the family failing herself to appreciate it thoroughly in others  but as time went on archie began to observe an omission in the family chronicle  “is there not a girl too” he asked  “ay kirstie  she was named for me or my grandmother at least—it’s the same thing” returned the aunt and went on again about dand whom she secretly preferred by reason of his gallantries  “but what is your niece like” said archie at the next opportunity  “her  as black’s your hat  but i dinna suppose she would maybe be what you would ca’ illlooked a’thegither  na she’s a kind of a handsome jaud—a kind o’ gipsy” said the aunt who had two sets of scales for men and women—or perhaps it would be more fair to say that she had three and the third and the most loaded was for girls  “how comes it that i never see her in church” said archie  “’deed and i believe she’s in glesgie with clem and his wife  a heap good she’s like to get of it  i dinna say for men folk but where weemen folk are born there let them bide  glory to god i was never far’er from here than crossmichael”  in the meanwhile it began to strike archie as strange that while she thus sang the praises of her kinsfolk and manifestly relished their virtues and i may say their vices like a thing creditable to herself there should appear not the least sign of cordiality between the house of hermiston and that of cauldstaneslap  going to church of a sunday as the lady housekeeper stepped with her skirts kilted three tucks of her white petticoat showing below and her best india shawl upon her back if the day were fine in a pattern of radiant dyes she would sometimes overtake her relatives preceding her more leisurely in the same direction  gib of course was absent by skreigh of day he had been gone to crossmichael and his fellowheretics but the rest of the family would be seen marching in open order hob and dand stiffnecked straightbacked sixfooters with severe dark faces and their plaids about their shoulders the convoy of children scattering in a state of high polish on the wayside and every now and again collected by the shrill summons of the mother and the mother herself by a suggestive circumstance which might have afforded matter of thought to a more experienced observer than archie wrapped in a shawl nearly identical with kirstie’s but a thought more gaudy and conspicuously newer  at the sight kirstie grew more tall—kirstie showed her classical profile nose in air and nostril spread the pure blood came in her cheek evenly in a delicate living pink  “a braw day to ye mistress elliott” said she and hostility and gentility were nicely mingled in her tones  “a fine day mem” the laird’s wife would reply with a miraculous curtsey spreading the while her plumage—setting off in other words and with arts unknown to the mere man the pattern of her india shawl  behind her the whole cauldstaneslap contingent marched in closer order and with an indescribable air of being in the presence of the foe and while dandie saluted his aunt with a certain familiarity as of one who was well in court hob marched on in awful immobility  there appeared upon the face of this attitude in the family the consequences of some dreadful feud presumably the two women had been principals in the original encounter and the laird had probably been drawn into the quarrel by the ears too late to be included in the present skindeep reconciliation  “kirstie” said archie one day “what is this you have against your family”  “i dinna complean” said kirstie with a flush  “i say naething”  “i see you do not—not even goodday to your own nephew” said he  “i hae naething to be ashamed of” said she  “i can say the lord’s prayer with a good grace  if hob was ill or in preeson or poverty i would see to him blithely  but for curtchying and complimenting and colloguing thank ye kindly”  archie had a bit of a smile he leaned back in his chair  “i think you and mrs robert are not very good friends” says he slyly “when you have your india shawls on”  she looked upon him in silence with a sparkling eye but an indecipherable expression and that was all that archie was ever destined to learn of the battle of the india shawls  “do none of them ever come here to see you” he inquired  “mr archie” said she “i hope that i ken my place better  it would be a queer thing i think if i was to clamjamfry up your faither’s house—that i should say it—wi’ a dirty blackavised clan no ane o’ them it was worth while to mar soap upon but just mysel’  na they’re all damnifeed wi’ the black ellwalds  i have nae patience wi’ black folk” then with a sudden consciousness of the case of archie “no that it maitters for men sae muckle” she made haste to add “but there’s naebody can deny that it’s unwomanly  long hair is the ornament o’ woman ony way we’ve good warrandise for that—it’s in the bible—and wha can doubt that the apostle had some gowdenhaired lassie in his mind—apostle and all for what was he but just a man like yersel’”     chapter vi—a leaf from christina’s psalmbook   archie was sedulous at church  sunday after sunday he sat down and stood up with that small company heard the voice of mr torrance leaping like an illplayed clarionet from key to key and had an opportunity to study his motheaten gown and the black thread mittens that he joined together in prayer and lifted up with a reverent solemnity in the act of benediction  hermiston pew was a little square box dwarfish in proportion with the kirk itself and enclosing a table not much bigger than a footstool  there sat archie an apparent prince the only undeniable gentleman and the only great heritor in the parish taking his ease in the only pew for no other in the kirk had doors  thence he might command an undisturbed view of that congregation of solid plaided men strapping wives and daughters oppressed children and uneasy sheepdogs  it was strange how archie missed the look of race except the dogs with their refined foxy faces and inimitably curling tails there was no one present with the least claim to gentility  the cauldstaneslap party was scarcely an exception dandie perhaps as he amused himself making verses through the interminable burden of the service stood out a little by the glow in his eye and a certain superior animation of face and alertness of body but even dandie slouched like a rustic  the rest of the congregation like so many sheep oppressed him with a sense of hobnailed routine day following day—of physical labour in the open air oatmeal porridge peas bannock the somnolent fireside in the evening and the nightlong nasal slumbers in a boxbed  yet he knew many of them to be shrewd and humorous men of character notable women making a bustle in the world and radiating an influence from their lowbrowed doors  he knew besides they were like other men below the crust of custom rapture found a way he had heard them beat the timbrel before bacchus—had heard them shout and carouse over their whiskytoddy and not the most dutchbottomed and severe faces among them all not even the solemn elders themselves but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love  men drawing near to an end of life’s adventurous journey—maids thrilling with fear and curiosity on the threshold of entrance—women who had borne and perhaps buried children who could remember the clinging of the small dead hands and the patter of the little feet now silent—he marvelled that among all those faces there should be no face of expectation none that was mobile none into which the rhythm and poetry of life had entered  “o for a live face” he thought and at times he had a memory of lady flora and at times he would study the living gallery before him with despair and would see himself go on to waste his days in that joyless pastoral place and death come to him and his grave be dug under the rowans and the spirit of the earth laugh out in a thunderpeal at the huge fiasco  on this particular sunday there was no doubt but that the spring had come at last  it was warm with a latent shiver in the air that made the warmth only the more welcome  the shallows of the stream glittered and tinkled among bunches of primrose  vagrant scents of the earth arrested archie by the way with moments of ethereal intoxication  the grey quakerish dale was still only awakened in places and patches from the sobriety of its winter colouring and he wondered at its beauty an essential beauty of the old earth it seemed to him not resident in particulars but breathing to him from the whole  he surprised himself by a sudden impulse to write poetry—he did so sometimes loose galloping octosyllabics in the vein of scott—and when he had taken his place on a boulder near some fairy falls and shaded by a whip of a tree that was already radiant with new leaves it still more surprised him that he should have nothing to write  his heart perhaps beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm of the universe  by the time he came to a corner of the valley and could see the kirk he had so lingered by the way that the first psalm was finishing  the nasal psalmody full of turns and trills and graceless graces seemed the essential voice of the kirk itself upraised in thanksgiving “everything’s alive” he said and again cries it aloud “thank god everything’s alive”  he lingered yet a while in the kirkyard  a tuft of primroses was blooming hard by the leg of an old black table tombstone and he stopped to contemplate the random apologue  they stood forth on the cold earth with a trenchancy of contrast and he was struck with a sense of incompleteness in the day the season and the beauty that surrounded him—the chill there was in the warmth the gross black clods about the opening primroses the damp earthy smell that was everywhere intermingled with the scents  the voice of the aged torrance within rose in an ecstasy  and he wondered if torrance also felt in his old bones the joyous influence of the spring morning torrance or the shadow of what once was torrance that must come so soon to lie outside here in the sun and rain with all his rheumatisms while a new minister stood in his room and thundered from his own familiar pulpit  the pity of it and something of the chill of the grave shook him for a moment as he made haste to enter  he went up the aisle reverently and took his place in the pew with lowered eyes for he feared he had already offended the kind old gentleman in the pulpit and was sedulous to offend no further  he could not follow the prayer not even the heads of it  brightnesses of azure clouds of fragrance a tinkle of falling water and singing birds rose like exhalations from some deeper aboriginal memory that was not his but belonged to the flesh on his bones  his body remembered and it seemed to him that his body was in no way gross but ethereal and perishable like a strain of music and he felt for it an exquisite tenderness as for a child an innocent full of beautiful instincts and destined to an early death  and he felt for old torrance—of the many supplications of the few days—a pity that was near to tears  the prayer ended  right over him was a tablet in the wall the only ornament in the roughly masoned chapel—for it was no more the tablet commemorated i was about to say the virtues but rather the existence of a former rutherford of hermiston and archie under that trophy of his long descent and local greatness leaned back in the pew and contemplated vacancy with the shadow of a smile between playful and sad that became him strangely dandie’s sister sitting by the side of clem in her new glasgow finery chose that moment to observe the young laird  aware of the stir of his entrance the little formalist had kept her eyes fastened and her face prettily composed during the prayer  it was not hypocrisy there was no one further from a hypocrite  the girl had been taught to behave to look up to look down to look unconscious to look seriously impressed in church and in every conjuncture to look her best  that was the game of female life and she played it frankly  archie was the one person in church who was of interest who was somebody new reputed eccentric known to be young and a laird and still unseen by christina  small wonder that as she stood there in her attitude of pretty decency her mind should run upon him  if he spared a glance in her direction he should know she was a wellbehaved young lady who had been to glasgow in reason he must admire her clothes and it was possible that he should think her pretty  at that her heart beat the least thing in the world and she proceeded by way of a corrective to call up and dismiss a series of fancied pictures of the young man who should now by rights be looking at her  she settled on the plainest of them—a pink short young man with a dish face and no figure at whose admiration she could afford to smile but for all that the consciousness of his gaze which was really fixed on torrance and his mittens kept her in something of a flutter till the word amen  even then she was far too wellbred to gratify her curiosity with any impatience  she resumed her seat languidly—this was a glasgow touch—she composed her dress rearranged her nosegay of primroses looked first in front then behind upon the other side and at last allowed her eyes to move without hurry in the direction of the hermiston pew  for a moment they were riveted  next she had plucked her gaze home again like a tame bird who should have meditated flight  possibilities crowded on her she hung over the future and grew dizzy the image of this young man slim graceful dark with the inscrutable halfsmile attracted and repelled her like a chasm  “i wonder will i have met my fate” she thought and her heart swelled  torrance was got some way into his first exposition positing a deep layer of texts as he went along laying the foundations of his discourse which was to deal with a nice point in divinity before archie suffered his eyes to wander  they fell first of all on clem looking insupportably prosperous and patronising torrance with the favour of a modified attention as of one who was used to better things in glasgow though he had never before set eyes on him archie had no difficulty in identifying him and no hesitation in pronouncing him vulgar the worst of the family  clem was leaning lazily forward when archie first saw him  presently he leaned nonchalantly back and that deadly instrument the maiden was suddenly unmasked in profile  though not quite in the front of the fashion had anybody cared certain artful glasgow mantuamakers and her own inherent taste had arrayed her to great advantage  her accoutrement was indeed a cause of heartburning and almost of scandal in that infinitesimal kirk company  mrs hob had said her say at cauldstaneslap  “daftlike” she had pronounced it  “a jaiket that’ll no meet  whaur’s the sense of a jaiket that’ll no button upon you if it should come to be weet  what do ye ca’ thir things demmy brokens d’ye say  they’ll be brokens wi’ a vengeance or ye can win back  weel i have nae thing to do wi’ it—it’s no good taste” clem whose purse had thus metamorphosed his sister and who was not insensible to the advertisement had come to the rescue with a “hoot woman  what do you ken of good taste that has never been to the ceety” and hob looking on the girl with pleased smiles as she timidly displayed her finery in the midst of the dark kitchen had thus ended the dispute “the cutty looks weel” he had said “and it’s no very like rain  wear them the day hizzie but it’s no a thing to make a practice o’”  in the breasts of her rivals coming to the kirk very conscious of white underlinen and their faces splendid with much soap the sight of the toilet had raised a storm of varying emotion from the mere unenvious admiration that was expressed in a longdrawn “eh” to the angrier feeling that found vent in an emphatic “set her up”  her frock was of strawcoloured jaconet muslin cut low at the bosom and short at the ankle so as to display her demibroquins of regency violet crossing with many straps upon a yellow cobweb stocking  according to the pretty fashion in which our grandmothers did not hesitate to appear and our greataunts went forth armed for the pursuit and capture of our greatuncles the dress was drawn up so as to mould the contour of both breasts and in the nook between a cairngorm brooch maintained it here too surely in a very enviable position trembled the nosegay of primroses  she wore on her shoulders—or rather on her back and not her shoulders which it scarcely passed—a french coat of sarsenet tied in front with margate braces and of the same colour with her violet shoes about her face clustered a disorder of dark ringlets a little garland of yellow french roses surmounted her brow and the whole was crowned by a village hat of chipped straw  amongst all the rosy and all the weathered faces that surrounded her in church she glowed like an open flower—girl and raiment and the cairngorm that caught the daylight and returned it in a fiery flash and the threads of bronze and gold that played in her hair  archie was attracted by the bright thing like a child  he looked at her again and yet again and their looks crossed  the lip was lifted from her little teeth  he saw the red blood work vividly under her tawny skin  her eye which was great as a stag’s struck and held his gaze he knew who she must be—kirstie she of the harsh diminutive his housekeeper’s niece the sister of the rustic prophet gib—and he found in her the answer to his wishes  christina felt the shock of their encountering glances and seemed to rise clothed in smiles into a region of the vague and bright  but the gratification was not more exquisite than it was brief  she looked away abruptly and immediately began to blame herself for that abruptness she knew what she should have done too late—turned slowly with her nose in the air  and meantime his look was not removed but continued to play upon her like a battery of cannon constantly aimed and now seemed to isolate her alone with him and now seemed to uplift her as on a pillory before the congregation  for archie continued to drink her in with his eyes even as a wayfarer comes to a wellhead on a mountain and stoops his face and drinks with thirst unassuageable  in the cleft of her little breasts the fiery eye of the topaz and the pale florets of primrose fascinated him  he saw the breasts heave and the flowers shake with the heaving and marvelled what should so much discompose the girl and christina was conscious of his gaze—saw it perhaps with the dainty plaything of an ear that peeped among her ringlets she was conscious of changing colour conscious of her unsteady breath  like a creature tracked run down surrounded she sought in a dozen ways to give herself a countenance  she used her handkerchief—it was a really fine one—then she desisted in a panic “he would only think i was too warm”  she took to reading in the metrical psalms and then remembered it was sermontime  last she put a “sugarbool” in her mouth and the next moment repented of the step  it was such a homelylike thing  mr archie would never be eating sweeties in kirk and with a palpable effort she swallowed it whole and her colour flamed high  at this signal of distress archie awoke to a sense of his illbehaviour  what had he been doing  he had been exquisitely rude in church to the niece of his housekeeper he had stared like a lackey and a libertine at a beautiful and modest girl  it was possible it was even likely he would be presented to her after service in the kirkyard and then how was he to look  and there was no excuse  he had marked the tokens of her shame of her increasing indignation and he was such a fool that he had not understood them  shame bowed him down and he looked resolutely at mr torrance who little supposed good worthy man as he continued to expound justification by faith what was his true business to play the part of derivative to a pair of children at the old game of falling in love  christina was greatly relieved at first  it seemed to her that she was clothed again  she looked back on what had passed  all would have been right if she had not blushed a silly fool  there was nothing to blush at if she had taken a sugarbool  mrs mactaggart the elder’s wife in st enoch’s took them often  and if he had looked at her what was more natural than that a young gentleman should look at the bestdressed girl in church  and at the same time she knew far otherwise she knew there was nothing casual or ordinary in the look and valued herself on its memory like a decoration  well it was a blessing he had found something else to look at  and presently she began to have other thoughts  it was necessary she fancied that she should put herself right by a repetition of the incident better managed  if the wish was father to the thought she did not know or she would not recognise it it was simply as a manœuvre of propriety as something called for to lessen the significance of what had gone before that she should a second time meet his eyes and this time without blushing  and at the memory of the blush she blushed again and became one general blush burning from head to foot  was ever anything so indelicate so forward done by a girl before  and here she was making an exhibition of herself before the congregation about nothing  she stole a glance upon her neighbours and behold they were steadily indifferent and clem had gone to sleep and still the one idea was becoming more and more potent with her that in common prudence she must look again before the service ended something of the same sort was going forward in the mind of archie as he struggled with the load of penitence  so it chanced that in the flutter of the moment when the last psalm was given out and torrance was reading the verse and the leaves of every psalmbook in church were rustling under busy fingers two stealthy glances were sent out like antennæ among the pews and on the indifferent and absorbed occupants and drew timidly nearer to the straight line between archie and christina  they met they lingered together for the least fraction of time and that was enough  a charge as of electricity passed through christina and behold the leaf of her psalmbook was torn across  archie was outside by the gate of the graveyard conversing with hob and the minister and shaking hands all round with the scattering congregation when clem and christina were brought up to be presented the laird took off his hat and bowed to her with grace and respect christina made her glasgow curtsey to the laird and went on again up the road for hermiston and cauldstaneslap walking fast breathing hurriedly with a heightened colour and in this strange frame of mind that when she was alone she seemed in high happiness and when any one addressed her she resented it like a contradiction  a part of the way she had the company of some neighbour girls and a loutish young man never had they seemed so insipid never had she made herself so disagreeable  but these struck aside to their various destinations or were outwalked and left behind and when she had driven off with sharp words the proffered convoy of some of her nephews and nieces she was free to go on alone up hermiston brae walking on air dwelling intoxicated among clouds of happiness  near to the summit she heard steps behind her a man’s steps light and very rapid  she knew the foot at once and walked the faster “if it’s me he’s wanting he can run for it” she thought smiling  archie overtook her like a man whose mind was made up  “miss kirstie” he began  “miss christina if you please mr weir” she interrupted  “i canna bear the contraction”  “you forget it has a friendly sound for me  your aunt is an old friend of mine and a very good one  i hope we shall see much of you at hermiston”  “my aunt and my sisterinlaw doesna agree very well  not that i have much ado with it  but still when i’m stopping in the house if i was to be visiting my aunt it would not look consideratelike”  “i am sorry” said archie  “i thank you kindly mr weir” she said  “i whiles think myself it’s a great peety”  “ah i am sure your voice would always be for peace” he cried  “i wouldna be too sure of that” she said  “i have my days like other folk i suppose”  “do you know in our old kirk among our good old grey dames you made an effect like sunshine”  “ah but that would be my glasgow clothes”  “i did not think i was so much under the influence of pretty frocks”  she smiled with a half look at him  “there’s more than you” she said “but you see i’m only cinderella  i’ll have to put all these things by in my trunk next sunday i’ll be as grey as the rest  they’re glasgow clothes you see and it would never do to make a practice of it  it would seem terrible conspicuous”  by that they were come to the place where their ways severed  the old grey moors were all about them in the midst a few sheep wandered and they could see on the one hand the straggling caravan scaling the braes in front of them for cauldstaneslap and on the other the contingent from hermiston bending off and beginning to disappear by detachments into the policy gate  it was in these circumstances that they turned to say farewell and deliberately exchanged a glance as they shook hands  all passed as it should genteelly and in christina’s mind as she mounted the first steep ascent for cauldstaneslap a gratifying sense of triumph prevailed over the recollection of minor lapses and mistakes  she had kilted her gown as she did usually at that rugged pass but when she spied archie still standing and gazing after her the skirts came down again as if by enchantment  here was a piece of nicety for that upland parish where the matrons marched with their coats kilted in the rain and the lasses walked barefoot to kirk through the dust of summer and went bravely down by the burnside and sat on stones to make a public toilet before entering  it was perhaps an air wafted from glasgow or perhaps it marked a stage of that dizziness of gratified vanity in which the instinctive act passed unperceived  he was looking after  she unloaded her bosom of a prodigious sigh that was all pleasure and betook herself to run  when she had overtaken the stragglers of her family she caught up the niece whom she had so recently repulsed and kissed and slapped her and drove her away again and ran after her with pretty cries and laughter  perhaps she thought the laird might still be looking  but it chanced the little scene came under the view of eyes less favourable for she overtook mrs hob marching with clem and dand  “you’re shürely fey lass” quoth dandie  “think shame to yersel’ miss” said the strident mrs hob  “is this the gait to guide yersel’ on the way hame frae kirk  you’re shiirely no sponsible the day  and anyway i would mind my guid claes”  “hoot” said christina and went on before them head in air treading the rough track with the tread of a wild doe  she was in love with herself her destiny the air of the hills the benediction of the sun  all the way home she continued under the intoxication of these skyscraping spirits  at table she could talk freely of young hermiston gave her opinion of him offhand and with a loud voice that he was a handsome young gentleman real well mannered and sensiblelike but it was a pity he looked doleful  only—the moment after—a memory of his eyes in church embarrassed her  but for this inconsiderable check all through mealtime she had a good appetite and she kept them laughing at table until gib who had returned before them from crossmichael and his separative worship reproved the whole of them for their levity  singing “in to herself” as she went her mind still in the turmoil of a glad confusion she rose and tripped upstairs to a little loft lighted by four panes in the gable where she slept with one of her nieces  the niece who followed her presuming on “auntie’s” high spirits was flounced out of the apartment with small ceremony and retired smarting and half tearful to bury her woes in the byre among the hay  still humming christina divested herself of her finery and put her treasures one by one in her great green trunk  the last of these was the psalmbook it was a fine piece the gift of mistress clem in distinct oldfaced type on paper that had begun to grow foxy in the warehouse—not by service—and she was used to wrap it in a handkerchief every sunday after its period of service was over and bury it endwise at the head of her trunk  as she now took it in hand the book fell open where the leaf was torn and she stood and gazed upon that evidence of her bygone discomposure  there returned again the vision of the two brown eyes staring at her intent and bright out of that dark corner of the kirk the whole appearance and attitude the smile the suggested gesture of young hermiston came before her in a flash at the sight of the torn page “i was surely fey” she said echoing the words of dandie and at the suggested doom her high spirits deserted her  she flung herself prone upon the bed and lay there holding the psalmbook in her hands for hours for the more part in a mere stupor of unconsenting pleasure and unreasoning fear  the fear was superstitious there came up again and again in her memory dandie’s illomened words and a hundred grisly and black tales out of the immediate neighbourhood read her a commentary on their force  the pleasure was never realised  you might say the joints of her body thought and remembered and were gladdened but her essential self in the immediate theatre of consciousness talked feverishly of something else like a nervous person at a fire  the image that she most complacently dwelt on was that of miss christina in her character of the fair lass of cauldstaneslap carrying all before her in the strawcoloured frock the violet mantle and the yellow cobweb stockings archie’s image on the other hand when it presented itself was never welcomed—far less welcomed with any ardour and it was exposed at times to merciless criticism  in the long vague dialogues she held in her mind often with imaginary often with unrealised interlocutors archie if he were referred to at all came in for savage handling  he was described as “looking like a stork” “staring like a caulf” “a face like a ghaist’s”  “do you call that manners” she said or “i soon put him in his place”  “‘miss christina if you please mr weir’ says i and just flyped up my skirt tails”  with gabble like this she would entertain herself long whiles together and then her eye would perhaps fall on the torn leaf and the eyes of archie would appear again from the darkness of the wall and the voluble words deserted her and she would lie still and stupid and think upon nothing with devotion and be sometimes raised by a quiet sigh  had a doctor of medicine come into that loft he would have diagnosed a healthy welldeveloped eminently vivacious lass lying on her face in a fit of the sulks not one who had just contracted or was just contracting a mortal sickness of the mind which should yet carry her towards death and despair  had it been a doctor of psychology he might have been pardoned for divining in the girl a passion of childish vanity selflove in excelsis and no more it is to be understood that i have been painting chaos and describing the inarticulate  every lineament that appears is too precise almost every word used too strong  take a fingerpost in the mountains on a day of rolling mists i have but copied the names that appear upon the pointers the names of definite and famous cities far distant and now perhaps basking in sunshine but christina remained all these hours as it were at the foot of the post itself not moving and enveloped in mutable and blinding wreaths of haze  the day was growing late and the sunbeams long and level when she sat suddenly up and wrapped in its handkerchief and put by that psalmbook which had already played a part so decisive in the first chapter of her lovestory  in the absence of the mesmerist’s eye we are told nowadays that the head of a bright nail may fill his place if it be steadfastly regarded  so that torn page had riveted her attention on what might else have been but little and perhaps soon forgotten while the ominous words of dandie—heard not heeded and still remembered—had lent to her thoughts or rather to her mood a cast of solemnity and that idea of fate—a pagan fate uncontrolled by any christian deity obscure lawless and august—moving indissuadably in the affairs of christian men  thus even that phenomenon of love at first sight which is so rare and seems so simple and violent like a disruption of life’s tissue may be decomposed into a sequence of accidents happily concurring  she put on a grey frock and a pink kerchief looked at herself a moment with approval in the small square of glass that served her for a toilet mirror and went softly downstairs through the sleeping house that resounded with the sound of afternoon snoring  just outside the door dandie was sitting with a book in his hand not reading only honouring the sabbath by a sacred vacancy of mind  she came near him and stood still  “i’m for off up the muirs dandie” she said  there was something unusually soft in her tones that made him look up she was pale her eyes dark and bright no trace remained of the levity of the morning  “ay lass  ye’ll have yer ups and downs like me i’m thinkin’” he observed  “what for do ye say that” she asked  “o for naething” says dand  “only i think ye’re mair like me than the lave of them  ye’ve mair of the poetic temper tho’ guid kens little enough of the poetic taalent  it’s an ill gift at the best  look at yoursel’  at denner you were all sunshine and flowers and laughter and now you’re like the star of evening on a lake”  she drank in this hackneyed compliment like wine and it glowed in her veins  “but i’m saying dand”—she came nearer him—“i’m for the muirs  i must have a braith of air  if clem was to be speiring for me try and quaiet him will ye no”  “what way” said dandie  “i ken but the ae way and that’s leein’  i’ll say ye had a sair heid if ye like”  “but i havena” she objected  “i daursay no” he returned  “i said i would say ye had and if ye like to naysay me when ye come back it’ll no mateerially maitter for my chara’ter’s clean gane a’ready past reca’”  “o dand are ye a lecar” she asked lingering  “folks say sae” replied the bard  “wha says sae” she pursued  “them that should ken the best” he responded  “the lassies for ane”  “but dand you would never lee to me” she asked  “i’ll leave that for your pairt of it ye girzie” said he  “ye’ll lee to me fast eneuch when ye hae gotten a jo  i’m tellin’ ye and it’s true when you have a jo miss kirstie it’ll be for guid and ill  i ken i was made that way mysel’ but the deil was in my luck  here gang awa wi’ ye to your muirs and let me be i’m in an hour of inspiraution ye upsetting tawpie”  but she clung to her brother’s neighbourhood she knew not why  “will ye no gie’s a kiss dand” she said  “i aye likit ye fine”  he kissed her and considered her a moment he found something strange in her  but he was a libertine through and through nourished equal contempt and suspicion of all womankind and paid his way among them habitually with idle compliments  “gae wa’ wi’ ye” said he  “ye’re a dentie baby and be content wi’ that”  that was dandie’s way a kiss and a comfit to jenny—a bawbee and my blessing to jill—and goodnight to the whole clan of ye my dears when anything approached the serious it became a matter for men he both thought and said  women when they did not absorb were only children to be shoo’d away  merely in his character of connoisseur however dandie glanced carelessly after his sister as she crossed the meadow  “the brat’s no that bad” he thought with surprise for though he had just been paying her compliments he had not really looked at her  “hey what’s yon”  for the grey dress was cut with short sleeves and skirts and displayed her trim strong legs clad in pink stockings of the same shade as the kerchief she wore round her shoulders and that shimmered as she went  this was not her way in undress he knew her ways and the ways of the whole sex in the countryside no one better when they did not go barefoot they wore stout “rig and furrow” woollen hose of an invisible blue mostly when they were not black outright and dandie at sight of this daintiness put two and two together  it was a silk handkerchief then they would be silken hose they matched—then the whole outfit was a present of clem’s a costly present and not something to be worn through bog and briar or on a late afternoon of sunday  he whistled  “my denty may either your heid’s fair turned or there’s some ongoings” he observed and dismissed the subject  she went slowly at first but ever straighter and faster for the cauldstaneslap a pass among the hills to which the farm owed its name the slap opened like a doorway between two rounded hillocks and through this ran the short cut to hermiston  immediately on the other side it went down through the deil’s hags a considerable marshy hollow of the hill tops full of springs and crouching junipers and pools where the black peatwater slumbered  there was no view from here  a man might have sat upon the praying weaver’s stone a half century and seen none but the cauldstaneslap children twice in the twentyfour hours on their way to the school and back again an occasional shepherd the irruption of a clan of sheep or the birds who haunted about the springs drinking and shrilly piping  so when she had once passed the slap kirstie was received into seclusion  she looked back a last time at the farm  it still lay deserted except for the figure of dandie who was now seen to be scribbling in his lap the hour of expected inspiration having come to him at last  thence she passed rapidly through the morass and came to the farther end of it where a sluggish burn discharges and the path for hermiston accompanies it on the beginning of its downward path  from this corner a wide view was opened to her of the whole stretch of braes upon the other side still sallow and in places rusty with the winter with the path marked boldly here and there by the burnside a tuft of birches and—two miles off as the crow flies—from its enclosures and young plantations the windows of hermiston glittering in the western sun  here she sat down and waited and looked for a long time at these faraway bright panes of glass  it amused her to have so extended a view she thought  it amused her to see the house of hermiston—to see “folk” and there was an indistinguishable human unit perhaps the gardener visibly sauntering on the gravel paths  by the time the sun was down and all the easterly braes lay plunged in clear shadow she was aware of another figure coming up the path at a most unequal rate of approach now half running now pausing and seeming to hesitate  she watched him at first with a total suspension of thought  she held her thought as a person holds his breathing  then she consented to recognise him  “he’ll no be coming here he canna be it’s no possible”  and there began to grow upon her a subdued choking suspense  he was coming his hesitations had quite ceased his step grew firm and swift no doubt remained and the question loomed up before her instant what was she to do  it was all very well to say that her brother was a laird himself it was all very well to speak of casual intermarriages and to count cousinship like auntie kirstie  the difference in their social station was trenchant propriety prudence all that she had ever learned all that she knew bade her flee  but on the other hand the cup of life now offered to her was too enchanting for one moment she saw the question clearly and definitely made her choice  she stood up and showed herself an instant in the gap relieved upon the sky line and the next fled trembling and sat down glowing with excitement on the weaver’s stone  she shut her eyes seeking praying for composure  her hand shook in her lap and her mind was full of incongruous and futile speeches  what was there to make a work about she could take care of herself she supposed  there was no harm in seeing the laird  it was the best thing that could happen  she would mark a proper distance to him once and for all  gradually the wheels of her nature ceased to go round so madly and she sat in passive expectation a quiet solitary figure in the midst of the grey moss  i have said she was no hypocrite but here i am at fault  she never admitted to herself that she had come up the hill to look for archie and perhaps after all she did not know perhaps came as a stone falls for the steps of love in the young and especially in girls are instinctive and unconscious  in the meantime archie was drawing rapidly near and he at least was consciously seeking her neighbourhood  the afternoon had turned to ashes in his mouth the memory of the girl had kept him from reading and drawn him as with cords and at last as the cool of the evening began to come on he had taken his hat and set forth with a smothered ejaculation by the moor path to cauldstaneslap  he had no hope to find her he took the off chance without expectation of result and to relieve his uneasiness the greater was his surprise as he surmounted the slope and came into the hollow of the deil’s hags to see there like an answer to his wishes the little womanly figure in the grey dress and the pink kerchief sitting little and low and lost and acutely solitary in these desolate surroundings and on the weatherbeaten stone of the dead weaver those things that still smacked of winter were all rusty about her and those things that already relished of the spring had put forth the tender and lively colours of the season  even in the unchanging face of the deathstone changes were to be remarked and in the channeled lettering the moss began to renew itself in jewels of green  by an afterthought that was a stroke of art she had turned up over her head the back of the kerchief so that it now framed becomingly her vivacious and yet pensive face  her feet were gathered under her on the one side and she leaned on her bare arm which showed out strong and round tapered to a slim wrist and shimmered in the fading light  young hermiston was struck with a certain chill  he was reminded that he now dealt in serious matters of life and death  this was a grown woman he was approaching endowed with her mysterious potencies and attractions the treasury of the continued race and he was neither better nor worse than the average of his sex and age  he had a certain delicacy which had preserved him hitherto unspotted and which had either of them guessed it made him a more dangerous companion when his heart should be really stirred  his throat was dry as he came near but the appealing sweetness of her smile stood between them like a guardian angel  for she turned to him and smiled though without rising  there was a shade in this cavalier greeting that neither of them perceived neither he who simply thought it gracious and charming as herself nor yet she who did not observe quick as she was the difference between rising to meet the laird and remaining seated to receive the expected admirer  “are ye stepping west hermiston” said she giving him his territorial name after the fashion of the countryside  “i was” said he a little hoarsely “but i think i will be about the end of my stroll now  are you like me miss christina  the house would not hold me  i came here seeking air”  he took his seat at the other end of the tombstone and studied her wondering what was she  there was infinite import in the question alike for her and him  “ay” she said  “i couldna bear the roof either  it’s a habit of mine to come up here about the gloaming when it’s quaiet and caller”  “it was a habit of my mother’s also” he said gravely  the recollection half startled him as he expressed it  he looked around  “i have scarce been here since  it’s peaceful” he said with a long breath  “it’s no like glasgow” she replied  “a weary place yon glasgow  but what a day have i had for my homecoming and what a bonny evening”  “indeed it was a wonderful day” said archie  “i think i will remember it years and years until i come to die  on days like this—i do not know if you feel as i do—but everything appears so brief and fragile and exquisite that i am afraid to touch life  we are here for so short a time and all the old people before us—rutherfords of hermiston elliotts of the cauldstaneslap—that were here but a while since riding about and keeping up a great noise in this quiet corner—making love too and marrying—why where are they now  it’s deadly commonplace but after all the commonplaces are the great poetic truths”  he was sounding her semiconsciously to see if she could understand him to learn if she were only an animal the colour of flowers or had a soul in her to keep her sweet  she on her part her means well in hand watched womanlike for any opportunity to shine to abound in his humour whatever that might be  the dramatic artist that lies dormant or only half awake in most human beings had in her sprung to his feet in a divine fury and chance had served her well  she looked upon him with a subdued twilight look that became the hour of the day and the train of thought earnestness shone through her like stars in the purple west and from the great but controlled upheaval of her whole nature there passed into her voice and rang in her lightest words a thrill of emotion  “have you mind of dand’s song” she answered  “i think he’ll have been trying to say what you have been thinking”  “no i never heard it” he said  “repeat it to me can you”  “it’s nothing wanting the tune” said kirstie  “then sing it me” said he  “on the lord’s day  that would never do mr weir”  “i am afraid i am not so strict a keeper of the sabbath and there is no one in this place to hear us unless the poor old ancient under the stone”  “no that i’m thinking that really” she said  “by my way of thinking it’s just as serious as a psalm  will i sooth it to ye then”  “if you please” said he and drawing near to her on the tombstone prepared to listen  she sat up as if to sing  “i’ll only can sooth it to ye” she explained “i wouldna like to sing out loud on the sabbath  i think the birds would carry news of it to gilbert” and she smiled  “it’s about the elliotts” she continued “and i think there’s few bonnier bits in the bookpoets though dand has never got printed yet”  and she began in the low clear tones of her half voice now sinking almost to a whisper now rising to a particular note which was her best and which archie learned to wait for with growing emotion—      “o they rade in the rain in the days that are gane        in the rain and the wind and the lave     they shoutit in the ha’ and they routit on the hill        but they’re a’ quaitit noo in the grave     auld auld elliotts claycauld elliotts dour bauld elliotte of     auld”  all the time she sang she looked steadfastly before her her knees straight her hands upon her knee her head cast back and up  the expression was admirable throughout for had she not learned it from the lips and under the criticism of the author  when it was done she turned upon archie a face softly bright and eyes gently suffused and shining in the twilight and his heart rose and went out to her with boundless pity and sympathy  his question was answered  she was a human being tuned to a sense of the tragedy of life there were pathos and music and a great heart in the girl  he arose instinctively she also for she saw she had gained a point and scored the impression deeper and she had wit enough left to flee upon a victory  they were but commonplaces that remained to be exchanged but the low moved voices in which they passed made them sacred in the memory  in the falling greyness of the evening he watched her figure winding through the morass saw it turn a last time and wave a hand and then pass through the slap and it seemed to him as if something went along with her out of the deepest of his heart  and something surely had come and come to dwell there  he had retained from childhood a picture now half obliterated by the passage of time and the multitude of fresh impressions of his mother telling him with the fluttered earnestness of her voice and often with dropping tears the tale of the “praying weaver” on the very scene of his brief tragedy and long repose  and now there was a companion piece and he beheld and he should behold for ever christina perched on the same tomb in the grey colours of the evening gracious dainty perfect as a flower and she also singing—      “of old unhappy far off things     and battles long ago”  of their common ancestors now dead of their rude wars composed their weapons buried with them and of these strange changelings their descendants who lingered a little in their places and would soon be gone also and perhaps sung of by others at the gloaming hour  by one of the unconscious arts of tenderness the two women were enshrined together in his memory  tears in that hour of sensibility came into his eyes indifferently at the thought of either and the girl from being something merely bright and shapely was caught up into the zone of things serious as life and death and his dead mother  so that in all ways and on either side fate played his game artfully with this poor pair of children  the generations were prepared the pangs were made ready before the curtain rose on the dark drama  in the same moment of time that she disappeared from archie there opened before kirstie’s eyes the cuplike hollow in which the farm lay  she saw some five hundred feet below her the house making itself bright with candles and this was a broad hint to her to hurry  for they were only kindled on a sabbath night with a view to that family worship which rounded in the incomparable tedium of the day and brought on the relaxation of supper  already she knew that robert must be withinsides at the head of the table “waling the portions” for it was robert in his quality of family priest and judge not the gifted gilbert who officiated  she made good time accordingly down the steep ascent and came up to the door panting as the three younger brothers all roused at last from slumber stood together in the cool and the dark of the evening with a fry of nephews and nieces about them chatting and awaiting the expected signal  she stood back she had no mind to direct attention to her late arrival or to her labouring breath  “kirstie ye have shaved it this time my lass” said clem  “whaur were ye”  “o just taking a dander by mysel’” said kirstie  and the talk continued on the subject of the american war without further reference to the truant who stood by them in the covert of the dusk thrilling with happiness and the sense of guilt  the signal was given and the brothers began to go in one after another amid the jostle and throng of hob’s children  only dandie waiting till the last caught kirstie by the arm  “when did ye begin to dander in pink hosen mistress elliott” he whispered slyly  she looked down she was one blush  “i maun have forgotten to change them” said she and went into prayers in her turn with a troubled mind between anxiety as to whether dand should have observed her yellow stockings at church and should thus detect her in a palpable falsehood and shame that she had already made good his prophecy  she remembered the words of it how it was to be when she had gotten a jo and that that would be for good and evil  “will i have gotten my jo now” she thought with a secret rapture  and all through prayers where it was her principal business to conceal the pink stockings from the eyes of the indifferent mrs hob—and all through supper as she made a feint of eating and sat at the table radiant and constrained—and again when she had left them and come into her chamber and was alone with her sleeping niece and could at last lay aside the armour of society—the same words sounded within her the same profound note of happiness of a world all changed and renewed of a day that had been passed in paradise and of a night that was to be heaven opened  all night she seemed to be conveyed smoothly upon a shallow stream of sleep and waking and through the bowers of beulah all night she cherished to her heart that exquisite hope and if towards morning she forgot it a while in a more profound unconsciousness it was to catch again the rainbow thought with her first moment of awaking     chapter vii—enter mephistopheles   two days later a gig from crossmichael deposited frank innes at the doors of hermiston  once in a way during the past winter archie in some acute phase of boredom had written him a letter  it had contained something in the nature of an invitation or a reference to an invitation—precisely what neither of them now remembered  when innes had received it there had been nothing further from his mind than to bury himself in the moors with archie but not even the most acute political heads are guided through the steps of life with unerring directness  that would require a gift of prophecy which has been denied to man  for instance who could have imagined that not a month after he had received the letter and turned it into mockery and put off answering it and in the end lost it misfortunes of a gloomy cast should begin to thicken over frank’s career  his case may be briefly stated his father a small morayshire laird with a large family became recalcitrant and cut off the supplies he had fitted himself out with the beginnings of quite a good law library which upon some sudden losses on the turf he had been obliged to sell before they were paid for and his bookseller hearing some rumour of the event took out a warrant for his arrest  innes had early word of it and was able to take precautions in this immediate welter of his affairs with an unpleasant charge hanging over him he had judged it the part of prudence to be off instantly had written a fervid letter to his father at inverauld and put himself in the coach for crossmichael  any port in a storm  he was manfully turning his back on the parliament house and its gay babble on porter and oysters the racecourse and the ring and manfully prepared until these clouds should have blown by to share a living grave with archie weir at hermiston  to do him justice he was no less surprised to be going than archie was to see him come and he carried off his wonder with an infinitely better grace  “well here i am” said he as he alighted  “pylades has come to orestes at last  by the way did you get my answer  no  how very provoking well here i am to answer for myself and that’s better still”  “i am very glad to see you of course” said archie  “i make you heartily welcome of course  but you surely have not come to stay with the courts still sitting is that not most unwise”  “damn the courts” says frank  “what are the courts to friendship and a little fishing”  and so it was agreed that he was to stay with no term to the visit but the term which he had privily set to it himself—the day namely when his father should have come down with the dust and he should be able to pacify the bookseller  on such vague conditions there began for these two young men who were not even friends a life of great familiarity and as the days drew on less and less intimacy  they were together at meal times together o’ nights when the hour had come for whiskytoddy but it might have been noticed had there been any one to pay heed that they were rarely so much together by day  archie had hermiston to attend to multifarious activities in the hills in which he did not require and had even refused frank’s escort  he would be off sometimes in the morning and leave only a note on the breakfast table to announce the fact and sometimes with no notice at all he would not return for dinner until the hour was long past  innes groaned under these desertions it required all his philosophy to sit down to a solitary breakfast with composure and all his unaffected goodnature to be able to greet archie with friendliness on the more rare occasions when he came home late for dinner  “i wonder what on earth he finds to do mrs elliott” said he one morning after he had just read the hasty billet and sat down to table  “i suppose it will be business sir” replied the housekeeper drily measuring his distance off to him by an indicated curtsy  “but i can’t imagine what business” he reiterated  “i suppose it will be his business” retorted the austere kirstie  he turned to her with that happy brightness that made the charm of his disposition and broke into a peal of healthy and natural laughter  “well played mrs elliott” he cried and the housekeeper’s face relaxed into the shadow of an iron smile  “well played indeed” said he  “but you must not be making a stranger of me like that  why archie and i were at the high school together and we’ve been to college together and we were going to the bar together when—you know  dear dear me what a pity that was  a life spoiled a fine young fellow as good as buried here in the wilderness with rustics and all for what  a frolic silly if you like but no more  god how good your scones are mrs elliott”  “they’re no mines it was the lassie made them” said kirstie “and saving your presence there’s little sense in taking the lord’s name in vain about idle vivers that you fill your kyte wi’”  “i daresay you’re perfectly right ma’am” quoth the imperturbable frank “but as i was saying this is a pitiable business this about poor archie and you and i might do worse than put our heads together like a couple of sensible people and bring it to an end  let me tell you ma’am that archie is really quite a promising young man and in my opinion he would do well at the bar  as for his father no one can deny his ability and i don’t fancy any one would care to deny that he has the deil’s own temper—”  “if you’ll excuse me mr innes i think the lass is crying on me” said kirstie and flounced from the room  “the damned crossgrained old broomstick” ejaculated innes  in the meantime kirstie had escaped into the kitchen and before her vassal gave vent to her feelings  “here ettercap  ye’ll have to wait on yon innes  i canna haud myself in  ‘puir erchie’  i’d ‘puir erchie’ him if i had my way  and hermiston with the deil’s ain temper  god let him take hermiston’s scones out of his mouth first  there’s no a hair on ayther o’ the weirs that hasna mair spunk and dirdum to it than what he has in his hale dwaibly body  settin’ up his snash to me  let him gang to the black toon where he’s mebbe wantit—birling in a curricle—wi’ pimatum on his heid—making a mess o’ himsel’ wi’ nesty hizzies—a fair disgrace”  it was impossible to hear without admiration kirstie’s graduated disgust as she brought forth one after another these somewhat baseless charges  then she remembered her immediate purpose and turned again on her fascinated auditor  “do ye no hear me tawpie do ye no hear what i’m tellin’ ye will i have to shoo ye in to him if i come to attend to ye mistress” and the maid fled the kitchen which had become practically dangerous to attend on innes’ wants in the front parlour  tantaene irae  has the reader perceived the reason  since frank’s coming there were no more hours of gossip over the supper tray  all his blandishments were in vain he had started handicapped on the race for mrs elliott’s favour  but it was a strange thing how misfortune dogged him in his efforts to be genial  i must guard the reader against accepting kirstie’s epithets as evidence she was more concerned for their vigour than for their accuracy  dwaibly for instance nothing could be more calumnious frank was the very picture of good looks good humour and manly youth he had bright eyes with a sparkle and a dance to them curly hair a charming smile brilliant teeth an admirable carriage of the head the look of a gentleman the address of one accustomed to please at first sight and to improve the impression  and with all these advantages he failed with every one about hermiston with the silent shepherd with the obsequious grieve with the groom who was also the ploughman with the gardener and the gardener’s sister—a pious downhearted woman with a shawl over her ears—he failed equally and flatly  they did not like him and they showed it  the little maid indeed was an exception she admired him devoutly probably dreamed of him in her private hours but she was accustomed to play the part of silent auditor to kirstie’s tirades and silent recipient of kirstie’s buffets and she had learned not only to be a very capable girl of her years but a very secret and prudent one besides  frank was thus conscious that he had one ally and sympathiser in the midst of that general union of disfavour that surrounded watched and waited on him in the house of hermiston but he had little comfort or society from that alliance and the demure little maid twelve on her last birthday preserved her own counsel and tripped on his service brisk dumbly responsive but inexorably unconversational  for the others they were beyond hope and beyond endurance  never had a young apollo been cast among such rustic barbarians  but perhaps the cause of his illsuccess lay in one trait which was habitual and unconscious with him yet diagnostic of the man it was his practice to approach any one person at the expense of some one else  he offered you an alliance against the some one else he flattered you by slighting him you were drawn into a small intrigue against him before you knew how  wonderful are the virtues of this process generally but frank’s mistake was in the choice of the some one else he was not politic in that he listened to the voice of irritation archie had offended him at first by what he had felt to be rather a dry reception had offended him since by his frequent absences  he was besides the one figure continually present in frank’s eye and it was to his immediate dependants that frank could offer the snare of his sympathy  now the truth is that the weirs father and son were surrounded by a posse of strenuous loyalists  of my lord they were vastly proud  it was a distinction in itself to be one of the vassals of the “hanging judge” and his gross formidable joviality was far from unpopular in the neighbourhood of his home  for archie they had one and all a sensitive affection and respect which recoiled from a word of belittlement  nor was frank more successful when he went farther afield  to the four black brothers for instance he was antipathetic in the highest degree hob thought him too light gib too profane  clem who saw him but for a day or two before he went to glasgow wanted to know what the fule’s business was and whether he meant to stay here all session time “yon’s a drone” he pronounced  as for dand it will be enough to describe their first meeting when frank had been whipping a river and the rustic celebrity chanced to come along the path  “i’m told you’re quite a poet” frank had said  “wha tell’t ye that mannie” had been the unconciliating answer  “o everybody” says frank  “god  here’s fame” said the sardonic poet and he had passed on his way  come to think of it we have here perhaps a truer explanation of frank’s failures  had he met mr sheriff scott he could have turned a neater compliment because mr scott would have been a friend worth making dand on the other hand he did not value sixpence and he showed it even while he tried to flatter  condescension is an excellent thing but it is strange how onesided the pleasure of it is  he who goes fishing among the scots peasantry with condescension for a bait will have an empty basket by evening  in proof of this theory frank made a great success of it at the crossmichael club to which archie took him immediately on his arrival his own last appearance on that scene of gaiety  frank was made welcome there at once continued to go regularly and had attended a meeting as the members ever after loved to tell on the evening before his death young hay and young pringle appeared again  there was another supper at windiclaws another dinner at driffel and it resulted in frank being taken to the bosom of the county people as unreservedly as he had been repudiated by the country folk  he occupied hermiston after the manner of an invader in a conquered capital  he was perpetually issuing from it as from a base to toddy parties fishing parties and dinner parties to which archie was not invited or to which archie would not go  it was now that the name of the recluse became general for the young man  some say that innes invented it innes at least spread it abroad  “how’s all with your recluse today” people would ask  “o reclusing away” innes would declare with his bright air of saying something witty and immediately interrupt the general laughter which he had provoked much more by his air than his words “mind you it’s all very well laughing but i’m not very well pleased  poor archie is a good fellow an excellent fellow a fellow i always liked  i think it small of him to take his little disgrace so hard and shut himself up  ‘grant that it is a ridiculous story painfully ridiculous’ i keep telling him ‘be a man  live it down man’  but not he  of course it’s just solitude and shame and all that  but i confess i’m beginning to fear the result  it would be all the pities in the world if a really promising fellow like weir was to end ill  i’m seriously tempted to write to lord hermiston and put it plainly to him”  “i would if i were you” some of his auditors would say shaking the head sitting bewildered and confused at this new view of the matter so deftly indicated by a single word  “a capital idea” they would add and wonder at the aplomb and position of this young man who talked as a matter of course of writing to hermiston and correcting him upon his private affairs  and frank would proceed sweetly confidential “i’ll give you an idea now  he’s actually sore about the way that i’m received and he’s left out in the county—actually jealous and sore  i’ve rallied him and i’ve reasoned with him told him that every one was most kindly inclined towards him told him even that i was received merely because i was his guest  but it’s no use  he will neither accept the invitations he gets nor stop brooding about the ones where he’s left out  what i’m afraid of is that the wound’s ulcerating  he had always one of those dark secret angry natures—a little underhand and plenty of bile—you know the sort he must have inherited it from the weirs whom i suspect to have been a worthy family of weavers somewhere what’s the cant phrase—sedentary occupation  it’s precisely the kind of character to go wrong in a false position like what his father’s made for him or he’s making for himself whichever you like to call it  and for my part i think it a disgrace” frank would say generously  presently the sorrow and anxiety of this disinterested friend took shape he began in private in conversations of two to talk vaguely of bad habits and low habits  “i must say i’m afraid he’s going wrong altogether” he would say  “i’ll tell you plainly and between ourselves i scarcely like to stay there any longer only man i’m positively afraid to leave him alone  you’ll see i shall be blamed for it later on  i’m staying at a great sacrifice  i’m hindering my chances at the bar and i can’t blind my eyes to it  and what i’m afraid of is that i’m going to get kicked for it all round before all’s done  you see nobody believes in friendship nowadays”  “well innes” his interlocutor would reply “it’s very good of you i must say that  if there’s any blame going you’ll always be sure of my good word for one thing”  “well” frank would continue “candidly i don’t say it’s pleasant  he has a very rough way with him his father’s son you know  i don’t say he’s rude—of course i couldn’t be expected to stand that—but he steers very near the wind  no it’s not pleasant but i tell ye man in conscience i don’t think it would be fair to leave him  mind you i don’t say there’s anything actually wrong  what i say is that i don’t like the looks of it man” and he would press the arm of his momentary confidant  in the early stages i am persuaded there was no malice  he talked but for the pleasure of airing himself  he was essentially glib as becomes the young advocate and essentially careless of the truth which is the mark of the young ass and so he talked at random  there was no particular bias but that one which is indigenous and universal to flatter himself and to please and interest the present friend  and by thus milling air out of his mouth he had presently built up a presentation of archie which was known and talked of in all corners of the county  wherever there was a residential house and a walled garden wherever there was a dwarfish castle and a park wherever a quadruple cottage by the ruins of a peeltower showed an old family going down and wherever a handsome villa with a carriage approach and a shrubbery marked the coming up of a new one—probably on the wheels of machinery—archie began to be regarded in the light of a dark perhaps a vicious mystery and the future developments of his career to be looked for with uneasiness and confidential whispering  he had done something disgraceful my dear  what was not precisely known and that good kind young man mr innes did his best to make light of it  but there it was  and mr innes was very anxious about him now he was really uneasy my dear he was positively wrecking his own prospects because he dared not leave him alone  how wholly we all lie at the mercy of a single prater not needfully with any malign purpose  and if a man but talks of himself in the right spirit refers to his virtuous actions by the way and never applies to them the name of virtue how easily his evidence is accepted in the court of public opinion  all this while however there was a more poisonous ferment at work between the two lads which came late indeed to the surface but had modified and magnified their dissensions from the first  to an idle shallow easygoing customer like frank the smell of a mystery was attractive  it gave his mind something to play with like a new toy to a child and it took him on the weak side for like many young men coming to the bar and before they had been tried and found wanting he flattered himself he was a fellow of unusual quickness and penetration they knew nothing of sherlock holmes in those days but there was a good deal said of talleyrand  and if you could have caught frank off his guard he would have confessed with a smirk that if he resembled any one it was the marquis de talleyrandperigord  it was on the occasion of archie’s first absence that this interest took root  it was vastly deepened when kirstie resented his curiosity at breakfast and that same afternoon there occurred another scene which clinched the business  he was fishing swingleburn archie accompanying him when the latter looked at his watch  “well goodbye” said he  “i have something to do  see you at dinner”  “don’t be in such a hurry” cries frank  “hold on till i get my rod up i’ll go with you i’m sick of flogging this ditch”  and he began to reel up his line  archie stood speechless  he took a long while to recover his wits under this direct attack but by the time he was ready with his answer and the angle was almost packed up he had become completely weir and the hanging face gloomed on his young shoulders  he spoke with a laboured composure a laboured kindness even but a child could see that his mind was made up  “i beg your pardon innes i don’t want to be disagreeable but let us understand one another from the beginning  when i want your company i’ll let you know”  “o” cries frank “you don’t want my company don’t you”  “apparently not just now” replied archie  “i even indicated to you when i did if you’ll remember—and that was at dinner  if we two fellows are to live together pleasantly—and i see no reason why we should not—it can only be by respecting each other’s privacy  if we begin intruding—”  “o come  i’ll take this at no man’s hands  is this the way you treat a guest and an old friend” cried innes  “just go home and think over what i said by yourself” continued archie “whether it’s reasonable or whether it’s really offensive or not and let’s meet at dinner as though nothing had happened i’ll put it this way if you like—that i know my own character that i’m looking forward with great pleasure i assure you to a long visit from you and that i’m taking precautions at the first  i see the thing that we—that i if you like—might fall out upon and i step in and obsto principiis  i wager you five pounds you’ll end by seeing that i mean friendliness and i assure you francie i do” he added relenting  bursting with anger but incapable of speech innes shouldered his rod made a gesture of farewell and strode off down the burnside  archie watched him go without moving  he was sorry but quite unashamed  he hated to be inhospitable but in one thing he was his father’s son  he had a strong sense that his house was his own and no man else’s and to lie at a guest’s mercy was what he refused  he hated to seem harsh  but that was frank’s lookout  if frank had been commonly discreet he would have been decently courteous  and there was another consideration  the secret he was protecting was not his own merely it was hers it belonged to that inexpressible she who was fast taking possession of his soul and whom he would soon have defended at the cost of burning cities  by the time he had watched frank as far as the swingleburnfoot appearing and disappearing in the tarnished heather still stalking at a fierce gait but already dwindled in the distance into less than the smallness of lilliput he could afford to smile at the occurrence  either frank would go and that would be a relief—or he would continue to stay and his host must continue to endure him  and archie was now free—by devious paths behind hillocks and in the hollow of burns—to make for the trystingplace where kirstie cried about by the curlew and the plover waited and burned for his coming by the covenanter’s stone  innes went off downhill in a passion of resentment easy to be understood but which yielded progressively to the needs of his situation  he cursed archie for a coldhearted unfriendly rude rude dog and himself still more passionately for a fool in having come to hermiston when he might have sought refuge in almost any other house in scotland  but the step once taken was practically irretrievable  he had no more ready money to go anywhere else he would have to borrow from archie the next clubnight and ill as he thought of his host’s manners he was sure of his practical generosity  frank’s resemblance to talleyrand strikes me as imaginary but at least not talleyrand himself could have more obediently taken his lesson from the facts  he met archie at dinner without resentment almost with cordiality  you must take your friends as you find them he would have said  archie couldn’t help being his father’s son or his grandfather’s the hypothetical weaver’s grandson  the son of a hunks he was still a hunks at heart incapable of true generosity and consideration but he had other qualities with which frank could divert himself in the meanwhile and to enjoy which it was necessary that frank should keep his temper  so excellently was it controlled that he awoke next morning with his head full of a different though a cognate subject  what was archie’s little game  why did he shun frank’s company  what was he keeping secret  was he keeping tryst with somebody and was it a woman  it would be a good joke and a fair revenge to discover  to that task he set himself with a great deal of patience which might have surprised his friends for he had been always credited not with patience so much as brilliancy and little by little from one point to another he at last succeeded in piecing out the situation  first he remarked that although archie set out in all the directions of the compass he always came home again from some point between the south and west  from the study of a map and in consideration of the great expanse of untenanted moorland running in that direction towards the sources of the clyde he laid his finger on cauldstaneslap and two other neighbouring farms kingsmuirs and polintarf  but it was difficult to advance farther  with his rod for a pretext he vainly visited each of them in turn nothing was to be seen suspicious about this trinity of moorland settlements  he would have tried to follow archie had it been the least possible but the nature of the land precluded the idea  he did the next best ensconced himself in a quiet corner and pursued his movements with a telescope  it was equally in vain and he soon wearied of his futile vigilance left the telescope at home and had almost given the matter up in despair when on the twentyseventh day of his visit he was suddenly confronted with the person whom he sought  the first sunday kirstie had managed to stay away from kirk on some pretext of indisposition which was more truly modesty the pleasure of beholding archie seeming too sacred too vivid for that public place  on the two following frank had himself been absent on some of his excursions among the neighbouring families  it was not until the fourth accordingly that frank had occasion to set eyes on the enchantress  with the first look all hesitation was over  she came with the cauldstaneslap party then she lived at cauldstaneslap  here was archie’s secret here was the woman and more than that—though i have need here of every manageable attenuation of language—with the first look he had already entered himself as rival  it was a good deal in pique it was a little in revenge it was much in genuine admiration the devil may decide the proportions  i cannot and it is very likely that frank could not  “mighty attractive milkmaid” he observed on the way home  “who” said archie  “o the girl you’re looking at—aren’t you  forward there on the road she came attended by the rustic bard presumably therefore belongs to his exalted family  the single objection for the four black brothers are awkward customers  if anything were to go wrong gib would gibber and clem would prove inclement and dand fly in danders and hob blow up in gobbets  it would be a helliott of a business”  “very humorous i am sure” said archie  “well i am trying to be so” said frank  “it’s none too easy in this place and with your solemn society my dear fellow  but confess that the milkmaid has found favour in your eyes or resign all claim to be a man of taste”  “it is no matter” returned archie  but the other continued to look at him steadily and quizzically and his colour slowly rose and deepened under the glance until not impudence itself could have denied that he was blushing  and at this archie lost some of his control  he changed his stick from one hand to the other and—“o for god’s sake don’t be an ass” he cried  “ass  that’s the retort delicate without doubt” says frank  “beware of the homespun brothers dear  if they come into the dance you’ll see who’s an ass  think now if they only applied say a quarter as much talent as i have applied to the question of what mr archie does with his evening hours and why he is so unaffectedly nasty when the subject’s touched on—”  “you are touching on it now” interrupted archie with a wince  “thank you  that was all i wanted an articulate confession” said frank  “i beg to remind you—” began archie  but he was interrupted in turn  “my dear fellow don’t  it’s quite needless  the subject’s dead and buried”  and frank began to talk hastily on other matters an art in which he was an adept for it was his gift to be fluent on anything or nothing  but although archie had the grace or the timidity to suffer him to rattle on he was by no means done with the subject  when he came home to dinner he was greeted with a sly demand how things were looking “cauldstaneslap ways”  frank took his first glass of port out after dinner to the toast of kirstie and later in the evening he returned to the charge again  “i say weir you’ll excuse me for returning again to this affair  i’ve been thinking it over and i wish to beg you very seriously to be more careful  it’s not a safe business  not safe my boy” said he  “what” said archie  “well it’s your own fault if i must put a name on the thing but really as a friend i cannot stand by and see you rushing head down into these dangers  my dear boy” said he holding up a warning cigar “consider what is to be the end of it”  “the end of what”—archie helpless with irritation persisted in this dangerous and ungracious guard  “well the end of the milkmaid or to speak more by the card the end of miss christina elliott of the cauldstaneslap”  “i assure you” archie broke out “this is all a figment of your imagination  there is nothing to be said against that young lady you have no right to introduce her name into the conversation”  “i’ll make a note of it” said frank  “she shall henceforth be nameless nameless nameless grigalach  i make a note besides of your valuable testimony to her character  i only want to look at this thing as a man of the world  admitted she’s an angel—but my good fellow is she a lady”  this was torture to archie  “i beg your pardon” he said struggling to be composed “but because you have wormed yourself into my confidence—”  “o come” cried frank  “your confidence  it was rosy but unconsenting your confidence indeed  now look  this is what i must say weir for it concerns your safety and good character and therefore my honour as your friend  you say i wormed myself into your confidence  wormed is good  but what have i done  i have put two and two together just as the parish will be doing tomorrow and the whole of tweeddale in two weeks and the black brothers—well i won’t put a date on that it will be a dark and stormy morning  your secret in other words is poor poll’s  and i want to ask of you as a friend whether you like the prospect  there are two horns to your dilemma and i must say for myself i should look mighty ruefully on either  do you see yourself explaining to the four black brothers or do you see yourself presenting the milkmaid to papa as the future lady of hermiston  do you  i tell you plainly i don’t”  archie rose  “i will hear no more of this” he said in a trembling voice  but frank again held up his cigar  “tell me one thing first  tell me if this is not a friend’s part that i am playing”  “i believe you think it so” replied archle  “i can go as far as that i can do so much justice to your motives  but i will hear no more of it i am going to bed”  “that’s right weir” said frank heartily  “go to bed and think over it and i say man don’t forget your prayers  i don’t often do the moral—don’t go in for that sort of thing—but when i do there’s one thing sure that i mean it”  so archie marched off to bed and frank sat alone by the table for another hour or so smiling to himself richly  there was nothing vindictive in his nature but if revenge came in his way it might as well be good and the thought of archie’s pillow reflections that night was indescribably sweet to him  he felt a pleasant sense of power  he looked down on archie as on a very little boy whose strings he pulled—as on a horse whom he had backed and bridled by sheer power of intelligence and whom he might ride to glory or the grave at pleasure  which was it to be  he lingered long relishing the details of schemes that he was too idle to pursue  poor cork upon a torrent he tasted that night the sweets of omnipotence and brooded like a deity over the strands of that intrigue which was to shatter him before the summer waned     chapter viii—a nocturnal visit   kirstie had many causes of distress  more and more as we grow old—and yet more and more as we grow old and are women frozen by the fear of age—we come to rely on the voice as the single outlet of the soul  only thus in the curtailment of our means can we relieve the straitened cry of the passion within us only thus in the bitter and sensitive shyness of advancing years can we maintain relations with those vivacious figures of the young that still show before us and tend daily to become no more than the moving wallpaper of life  talk is the last link the last relation  but with the end of the conversation when the voice stops and the bright face of the listener is turned away solitude falls again on the bruised heart  kirstie had lost her “cannie hour at e’en” she could no more wander with archie a ghost if you will but a happy ghost in fields elysian  and to her it was as if the whole world had fallen silent to him but an unremarkable change of amusements  and she raged to know it  the effervescency of her passionate and irritable nature rose within her at times to bursting point  this is the price paid by age for unseasonable ardours of feeling  it must have been so for kirstie at any time when the occasion chanced but it so fell out that she was deprived of this delight in the hour when she had most need of it when she had most to say most to ask and when she trembled to recognise her sovereignty not merely in abeyance but annulled  for with the clairvoyance of a genuine love she had pierced the mystery that had so long embarrassed frank  she was conscious even before it was carried out even on that sunday night when it began of an invasion of her rights and a voice told her the invader’s name  since then by arts by accident by small things observed and by the general drift of archie’s humour she had passed beyond all possibility of doubt with a sense of justice that lord hermiston might have envied she had that day in church considered and admitted the attractions of the younger kirstie and with the profound humanity and sentimentality of her nature she had recognised the coming of fate  not thus would she have chosen she had seen in imagination archie wedded to some tall powerful and rosy heroine of the golden locks made in her own image for whom she would have strewed the bridebed with delight and now she could have wept to see the ambition falsified  but the gods had pronounced and her doom was otherwise  she lay tossing in bed that night besieged with feverish thoughts there were dangerous matters pending a battle was toward over the fate of which she hung in jealousy sympathy fear and alternate loyalty and disloyalty to either side  now she was reincarnated in her niece and now in archie  now she saw through the girl’s eyes the youth on his knees to her heard his persuasive instances with a deadly weakness and received his overmastering caresses  anon with a revulsion her temper raged to see such utmost favours of fortune and love squandered on a brat of a girl one of her own house using her own name—a deadly ingredient—and that “didna ken her ain mind an’ was as black’s your hat” now she trembled lest her deity should plead in vain loving the idea of success for him like a triumph of nature anon with returning loyalty to her own family and sex she trembled for kirstie and the credit of the elliotts  and again she had a vision of herself the day over for her oldworld tales and local gossip bidding farewell to her last link with life and brightness and love and behind and beyond she saw but the blank buttend where she must crawl to die  had she then come to the lees she so great so beautiful with a heart as fresh as a girl’s and strong as womanhood  it could not be and yet it was so and for a moment her bed was horrible to her as the sides of the grave  and she looked forward over a waste of hours and saw herself go on to rage and tremble and be softened and rage again until the day came and the labours of the day must be renewed  suddenly she heard feet on the stairs—his feet and soon after the sound of a windowsash flung open  she sat up with her heart beating  he had gone to his room alone and he had not gone to bed  she might again have one of her night cracks and at the entrancing prospect a change came over her mind with the approach of this hope of pleasure all the baser metal became immediately obliterated from her thoughts  she rose all woman and all the best of woman tender pitiful hating the wrong loyal to her own sex—and all the weakest of that dear miscellany nourishing cherishing next her soft heart voicelessly flattering hopes that she would have died sooner than have acknowledged  she tore off her nightcap and her hair fell about her shoulders in profusion  undying coquetry awoke  by the faint light of her nocturnal rush she stood before the lookingglass carried her shapely arms above her head and gathered up the treasures of her tresses  she was never backward to admire herself that kind of modesty was a stranger to her nature and she paused struck with a pleased wonder at the sight  “ye daft auld wife” she said answering a thought that was not and she blushed with the innocent consciousness of a child  hastily she did up the massive and shining coils hastily donned a wrapper and with the rushlight in her hand stole into the hall  below stairs she heard the clock ticking the deliberate seconds and frank jingling with the decanters in the diningroom  aversion rose in her bitter and momentary  “nesty tippling puggy” she thought and the next moment she had knocked guardedly at archie’s door and was bidden enter  archie had been looking out into the ancient blackness pierced here and there with a rayless star taking the sweet air of the moors and the night into his bosom deeply seeking perhaps finding peace after the manner of the unhappy  he turned round as she came in and showed her a pale face against the windowframe  “is that you kirstie” he asked  “come in”  “it’s unco late my dear” said kirstie affecting unwillingness  “no no” he answered “not at all  come in if you want a crack  i am not sleepy god knows”  she advanced took a chair by the toilet table and the candle and set the rushlight at her foot  something—it might be in the comparative disorder of her dress it might be the emotion that now welled in her bosom—had touched her with a wand of transformation and she seemed young with the youth of goddesses  “mr erchie” she began “what’s this that’s come to ye”  “i am not aware of anything that has come” said archie and blushed and repented bitterly that he had let her in  “o my dear that’ll no dae” said kirstie  “it’s ill to blend the eyes of love  o mr erchie tak a thocht ere it’s ower late  ye shouldna be impatient o’ the braws o’ life they’ll a’ come in their saison like the sun and the rain  ye’re young yet ye’ve mony cantie years afore ye see and dinna wreck yersel’ at the outset like sae mony ithers hae patience—they telled me aye that was the owercome o’ life—hae patience there’s a braw day coming yet  gude kens it never cam to me and here i am wi’ nayther man nor bairn to ca’ my ain wearying a’ folks wi’ my ill tongue and you just the first mr erchie”  “i have a difficulty in knowing what you mean” said archie  “weel and i’ll tell ye” she said  “it’s just this that i’m feared i’m feared for ye my dear  remember your faither is a hard man reaping where he hasna sowed and gaithering where he hasna strawed  it’s easy speakin’ but mind  ye’ll have to look in the gurly face o’m where it’s ill to look and vain to look for mercy  ye mind me o’ a bonny ship pitten oot into the black and gowsty seas—ye’re a’ safe still sittin’ quait and crackin’ wi’ kirstie in your lown chalmer but whaur will ye be the morn and in whatten horror o’ the fearsome tempest cryin’ on the hills to cover ye”  “why kirstie you’re very enigmatical tonight—and very eloquent” archie put in  “and my dear mr erchie” she continued with a change of voice “ye mauna think that i canna sympathise wi’ ye  ye mauna think that i havena been young mysel’  lang syne when i was a bit lassie no twenty yet—” she paused and sighed  “clean and caller wi’ a fit like the hinney bee” she continned  “i was aye big and buirdly ye maun understand a bonny figure o’ a woman though i say it that suldna—built to rear bairns—braw bairns they suld hae been and grand i would hae likit it but i was young dear wi’ the bonny glint o’ youth in my e’en and little i dreamed i’d ever be tellin’ ye this an auld lanely rudas wife  weel mr erchie there was a lad cam’ courtin’ me as was but naetural  mony had come before and i would nane o’ them  but this yin had a tongue to wile the birds frae the lift and the bees frae the foxglove bells  deary me but it’s lang syne  folk have dee’d sinsyne and been buried and are forgotten and bairns been born and got merrit and got bairns o’ their ain  sinsyne woods have been plantit and have grawn up and are bonny trees and the joes sit in their shadow and sinsyne auld estates have changed hands and there have been wars and rumours of wars on the face of the earth  and here i’m still—like an auld droopit craw—lookin’ on and craikin’  but mr erchie do ye no think that i have mind o’ it a’ still  i was dwalling then in my faither’s house and it’s a curious thing that we were whiles trysted in the deil’s hags  and do ye no think that i have mind of the bonny simmer days the lang miles o’ the bluidred heather the cryin’ of the whaups and the lad and the lassie that was trysted  do ye no think that i mind how the hilly sweetness ran about my hairt  ay mr erchie i ken the way o’ it—fine do i ken the way—how the grace o’ god takes them like paul of tarsus when they think it least and drives the pair o’ them into a land which is like a dream and the world and the folks in’t’ are nae mair than clouds to the puir lassie and heeven nae mair than windlestraes if she can but pleesure him  until tam dee’d—that was my story” she broke off to say “he dee’d and i wasna at the buryin’  but while he was here i could take care o’ mysel’  and can yon puir lassie”  kirstie her eyes shining with unshed tears stretched out her hand towards him appealingly the bright and the dull gold of her hair flashed and smouldered in the coils behind her comely head like the rays of an eternal youth the pure colour had risen in her face and archie was abashed alike by her beauty and her story  he came towards her slowly from the window took up her hand in his and kissed it  “kirstie” he said hoarsely “you have misjudged me sorely  i have always thought of her i wouldna harm her for the universe my woman”  “eh lad and that’s easy sayin’” cried kirstie “but it’s nane sae easy doin’  man do ye no comprehend that it’s god’s wull we should be blendit and glamoured and have nae command over our ain members at a time like that  my bairn” she cried still holding his hand “think o’ the puir lass have pity upon her erchie and o be wise for twa think o’ the risk she rins  i have seen ye and what’s to prevent ithers  i saw ye once in the hags in my ain howl and i was wae to see ye there—in pairt for the omen for i think there’s a weird on the place—and in pairt for pure nakit envy and bitterness o’ hairt  it’s strange ye should forgather there tae  god but yon puir thrawn auld covenanter’s seen a heap o’ human natur since he lookit his last on the musket barrels if he never saw nane afore” she added with a kind of wonder in her eyes  “i swear by my honour i have done her no wrong” said archie  “i swear by my honour and the redemption of my soul that there shall none be done her  i have heard of this before  i have been foolish kirstie not unkind and above all not base”  “there’s my bairn” said kirstie rising  “i’ll can trust ye noo i’ll can gang to my bed wi’ an easy hairt”  and then she saw in a flash how barren had been her triumph  archie had promised to spare the girl and he would keep it but who had promised to spare archie  what was to be the end of it  over a maze of difficulties she glanced and saw at the end of every passage the flinty countenance of hermiston  and a kind of horror fell upon her at what she had done  she wore a tragic mask “erchie the lord peety you dear and peety me  i have buildit on this foundation”—laying her hand heavily on his shoulder—“and buildit hie and pit my hairt in the buildin’ of it  if the hale hypothec were to fa’ i think laddie i would dee  excuse a daft wife that loves ye and that kenned your mither  and for his name’s sake keep yersel’ frae inordinate desires haud your heart in baith your hands carry it canny and laigh dinna send it up like a hairn’s kite into the collieshangic o’ the wunds mind maister erchie dear that this life’s a’ disappointment and a mouthfu’ o’ mools is the appointed end”  “ay but kirstie my woman you’re asking me ower much at last” said archie profoundly moved and lapsing into the broad scots  “ye’re asking what nae man can grant ye what only the lord of heaven can grant ye if he see fit  ay  and can even he  i can promise ye what i shall do and you can depend on that  but how i shall feel—my woman that is long past thinking of”  they were both standing by now opposite each other  the face of archie wore the wretched semblance of a smile hers was convulsed for a moment  “promise me ae thing” she cried in a sharp voice  “promise me ye’ll never do naething without telling me”  “no kirstie i canna promise ye that” he replied  “i have promised enough god kens”  “may the blessing of god lift and rest upon ye dear” she said  “god bless ye my old friend” said he     chapter ix—at the weaver’s stone   it was late in the afternoon when archie drew near by the hill path to the praying weaver’s stone  the hags were in shadow  but still through the gate of the slap the sun shot a last arrow which sped far and straight across the surface of the moss here and there touching and shining on a tussock and lighted at length on the gravestone and the small figure awaiting him there  the emptiness and solitude of the great moors seemed to be concentrated there and kirstie pointed out by that figure of sunshine for the only inhabitant  his first sight of her was thus excruciatingly sad like a glimpse of a world from which all light comfort and society were on the point of vanishing  and the next moment when she had turned her face to him and the quick smile had enlightened it the whole face of nature smiled upon him in her smile of welcome  archie’s slow pace was quickened his legs hasted to her though his heart was hanging back  the girl upon her side drew herself together slowly and stood up expectant she was all languor her face was gone white her arms ached for him her soul was on tiptoes  but he deceived her pausing a few steps away not less white than herself and holding up his hand with a gesture of denial  “no christina not today” he said  “today i have to talk to you seriously  sit ye down please there where you were  please” he repeated  the revulsion of feeling in christina’s heart was violent  to have longed and waited these weary hours for him rehearsing her endearments—to have seen him at last come—to have been ready there breathless wholly passive his to do what he would with—and suddenly to have found herself confronted with a greyfaced harsh schoolmaster—it was too rude a shock  she could have wept but pride withheld her  she sat down on the stone from which she had arisen part with the instinct of obedience part as though she had been thrust there  what was this why was she rejected  had she ceased to please  she stood here offering her wares and he would none of them  and yet they were all his  his to take and keep not his to refuse though  in her quick petulant nature a moment ago on fire with hope thwarted love and wounded vanity wrought the schoolmaster that there is in all men to the despair of all girls and most women was now completely in possession of archie  he had passed a night of sermons a day of reflection he had come wound up to do his duty and the set mouth which in him only betrayed the effort of his will to her seemed the expression of an averted heart  it was the same with his constrained voice and embarrassed utterance and if so—if it was all over—the pang of the thought took away from her the power of thinking  he stood before her some way off  “kirstie there’s been too much of this  we’ve seen too much of each other”  she looked up quickly and her eyes contracted  “there’s no good ever comes of these secret meetings they’re not frank not honest truly and i ought to have seen it  people have begun to talk and it’s not right of me  do you see”  “i see somebody will have been talking to ye” she said sullenly  “they have more than one of them” replied archie  “and whae were they” she cried  “and what kind o’ love do ye ca’ that that’s ready to gang round like a whirligig at folk talking  do ye think they havena talked to me”  “have they indeed” said archie with a quick breath  “that is what i feared  who were they  who has dared—”  archie was on the point of losing his temper  as a matter of fact not any one had talked to christina on the matter and she strenuously repeated her own first question in a panic of selfdefence  “ah well what does it matter” he said  “they were good folk that wished well to us and the great affair is that there are people talking my dear girl we have to be wise  we must not wreck our lives at the outset  they may be long and happy yet and we must see to it kirstie like god’s rational creatures and not like fool children  there is one thing we must see to before all  you’re worth waiting for kirstie worth waiting for a generation it would be enough reward”—and here he remembered the schoolmaster again and very unwisely took to following wisdom  “the first thing that we must see to is that there shall be no scandal about for my father’s sake  that would ruin all do ye no see that”  kirstie was a little pleased there had been some show of warmth of sentiment in what archie had said last  but the dull irritation still persisted in her bosom with the aboriginal instinct having suffered herself she wished to make archie suffer  and besides there had come out the word she had always feared to hear from his lips the name of his father  it is not to be supposed that during so many days with a love avowed between them some reference had not been made to their conjoint future  it had in fact been often touched upon and from the first had been the sore point  kirstie had wilfully closed the eye of thought she would not argue even with herself gallant desperate little heart she had accepted the command of that supreme attraction like the call of fate and marched blindfold on her doom  but archie with his masculine sense of responsibility must reason he must dwell on some future good when the present good was all in all to kirstie he must talk—and talk lamely as necessity drove him—of what was to be  again and again he had touched on marriage again and again been driven back into indistinctness by a memory of lord hermiston  and kirstie had been swift to understand and quick to choke down and smother the understanding swift to leap up in flame at a mention of that hope which spoke volumes to her vanity and her love that she might one day be mrs weir of hermiston swift also to recognise in his stumbling or throttled utterance the deathknell of these expectations and constant poor girl in her largeminded madness to go on and to reck nothing of the future  but these unfinished references these blinks in which his heart spoke and his memory and reason rose up to silence it before the words were well uttered gave her unqualifiable agony  she was raised up and dashed down again bleeding the recurrence of the subject forced her for however short a time to open her eyes on what she did not wish to see and it had invariably ended in another disappointment  so now again at the mere wind of its coming at the mere mention of his father’s name—who might seem indeed to have accompanied them in their whole moorland courtship an awful figure in a wig with an ironical and bitter smile present to guilty consciousness—she fled from it head down  “ye havena told me yet” she said “who was it spoke”  “your aunt for one” said archie  “auntie kirstie” she cried  “and what do i care for my auntie kirstie”  “she cares a great deal for her niece” replied archie in kind reproof  “troth and it’s the first i’ve heard of it” retorted the girl  “the question here is not who it is but what they say what they have noticed” pursued the lucid schoolmaster  “that is what we have to think of in selfdefence”  “auntie kirstie indeed  a bitter thrawn auld maid that’s fomented trouble in the country before i was born and will be doing it still i daur say when i’m deid  it’s in her nature it’s as natural for her as it’s for a sheep to eat”  “pardon me kirstie she was not the only one” interposed archie  “i had two warnings two sermons last night both most kind and considerate  had you been there i promise you you would have grat my dear  and they opened my eyes  i saw we were going a wrong way”  “who was the other one” kirstie demanded  by this time archie was in the condition of a hunted beast  he had come braced and resolute he was to trace out a line of conduct for the pair of them in a few cold convincing sentences he had now been there some time and he was still staggering round the outworks and undergoing what he felt to be a savage crossexamination  “mr frank” she cried  “what nex’ i would like to ken”  “he spoke most kindly and truly”  “what like did he say”  “i am not going to tell you you have nothing to do with that” cried archie startled to find he had admitted so much  “o i have naething to do with it” she repeated springing to her feet “a’body at hermiston’s free to pass their opinions upon me but i have naething to do wi’ it  was this at prayers like  did ye ca’ the grieve into the consultation  little wonder if a’body’s talking when ye make a’body yer confidants  but as you say mr weir—most kindly most considerately most truly i’m sure—i have naething to do with it  and i think i’ll better be going  i’ll be wishing you good evening mr weir”  and she made him a stately curtsey shaking as she did so from head to foot with the barren ecstasy of temper  poor archie stood dumbfounded  she had moved some steps away from him before he recovered the gift of articulate speech  “kirstie” he cried  “o kirstie woman”  there was in his voice a ring of appeal a clang of mere astonishment that showed the schoolmaster was vanquished  she turned round on him  “what do ye kirstie me for” she retorted “what have ye to do wi’ me  gang to your ain freends and deave them”  he could only repeat the appealing “kirstie”  “kirstie indeed” cried the girl her eyes blazing in her white face “my name is miss christina elliott i would have ye to ken and i daur ye to ca’ me out of it  if i canna get love i’ll have respect mr weir i’m come of decent people and i’ll have respect  what have i done that ye should lightly me  what have i done  what have i done o what have i done” and her voice rose upon the third repetition  “i thocht—i thocht—i thocht i was sae happy” and the first sob broke from her like the paroxysm of some mortal sickness  archie ran to her  he took the poor child in his arms and she nestled to his breast as to a mother’s and clasped him in hands that were strong like vices  he felt her whole body shaken by the throes of distress and had pity upon her beyond speech  pity and at the same time a bewildered fear of this explosive engine in his arms whose works he did not understand and yet had been tampering with  there arose from before him the curtains of boyhood and he saw for the first time the ambiguous face of woman as she is  in vain he looked back over the interview he saw not where he had offended  it seemed unprovoked a wilful convulsion of brute nature        editorial note   with the words last printed “a wilful convulsion of brute nature” the romance of weir of hermiston breaks off  they were dictated i believe on the very morning of the writer’s sudden seizure and death weir of hermiston thus remains in the work of stevenson what edwin droid is in the work of dickens or denis duval in that of thackeray or rather it remains relatively more for if each of those fragments holds an honourable place among its author’s writings among stevenson’s the fragment of weir holds certainly the highest  readers may be divided in opinion on the question whether they would or they would not wish to hear more of the intended course of the story and destinies of the characters  to some silence may seem best and that the mind should be left to its own conjectures as to the sequel with the help of such indications as the text affords  i confess that this is the view which has my sympathy  but since others and those almost certainly a majority are anxious to be told all they can and since editors and publishers join in the request i can scarce do otherwise than comply the intended argument then so far as it was known at the time of the writer’s death to his stepdaughter and devoted amanuensis mrs strong was nearly as follows—  archie persists in his good resolution of avoiding further conduct compromising to young kirstie’s good name  taking advantage of the situation thus created and of the girl’s unhappiness and wounded vanity frank innes pursues his purpose of seduction and kirstie though still caring for archie in her heart allows herself to become frank’s victim old kirstie is the first to perceive something amiss with her and believing archie to be the culprit accuses him thus making him aware for the first time that mischief has happened  he does not at once deny the charge but seeks out and questions young kirstie who confesses the truth to him and he still loving her promises to protect and defend her in her trouble  he then has an interview with frank innes on the moor which ends in a quarrel and in archie killing frank beside the weaver’s stone  meanwhile the four black brothers having become aware of their sister’s betrayal are bent on vengeance against archie as her supposed seducer  they are about to close in upon him with this purpose when he is arrested by the officers of the law for the murder of frank he is tried before his own father the lord justiceclerk found guilty and condemned to death  meanwhile the elder kirstie having discovered from the girl how matters really stand informs her nephews of the truth and they in a great revulsion of feeling in archie’s favour determine on an action after the ancient manner of their house  they gather a following and after a great fight break the prison where archie lies confined and rescue him  he and young kirstie thereafter escape to america  but the ordeal of taking part in the trial of his own son has been too much for the lord justiceclerk who dies of the shock  “i do not know” adds the amanuensis “what becomes of old kirstie but that character grew and strengthened so in the writing that i am sure he had some dramatic destiny for her”  the plan of every imaginative work is subject of course to change under the artist’s hand as he carries it out and not merely the character of the elder kirstie but other elements of the design no less might well have deviated from the lines originally traced  it seems certain however that the next stage in the relations of archie and the younger kirstie would have been as above foreshadowed and this conception of the lover’s unconventional chivalry and unshaken devotion to his mistress after her fault is very characteristic of the writer’s mind  the vengeance to be taken on the seducer beside the weaver’s stone is prepared for in the first words of the introduction while the situation and fate of the judge confronting like a brutus but unable to survive the duty of sending his own son to the gallows seem clearly to have been destined to furnish the climax and essential tragedy of the tale  how this last circumstance was to have been brought about within the limits of legal usage and possibility seems hard to conjecture but it was a point to which the author had evidently given careful consideration  mrs strong says simply that the lord justiceclerk like an old roman condemns his son to death but i am assured on the best legal authority of scotland that no judge however powerful either by character or office could have insisted on presiding at the trial of a near kinsman of his own  the lord justiceclerk was head of the criminal justiciary of the country he might have insisted on his right of being present on the bench when his son was tried but he would never have been allowed to preside or to pass sentence  now in a letter of stevenson’s to mr baxter of october 1892 i find him asking for materials in terms which seem to indicate that he knew this quite well—“i wish pitcairn’s ‘criminal trials’ quam primum  also an absolutely correct text of the scots judiciary oath  also in case pitcairn does not come down late enough i wish as full a report as possible of a scots murder trial between 1790–1820  understand the fullest possible  is there any book which would guide me to the following facts  the justiceclerk tries some people capitally on circuit  certain evidence cropping up the charge is transferred to the justiceclerk’s own son  of course in the next trial the justiceclerk is excluded and the case is called before the lord justicegeneral  where would this trial have to be  i fear in edinburgh which would not suit my view  could it be again at the circuit town”  the point was referred to a quondam fellowmember with stevenson of the edinburgh speculative society mr graham murray the present solicitorgeneral for scotland whose reply was to the effect that there would be no difficulty in making the new trial take place at the circuit town that it would have to be held there in spring or autumn before two lords of justiciary and that the lord justicegeneral would have nothing to do with it this title being at the date in question only a nominal one held by a layman which is no longer the case  on this stevenson writes “graham murray’s note re the venue was highly satisfactory and did me all the good in the world”  the terms of his inquiry seem to imply that he intended other persons before archie to have fallen first under suspicion of the murder and also—doubtless in order to make the rescue by the black brothers possible—that he wanted archie to be imprisoned not in edinburgh but in the circuit town  but they do not show how he meant to get over the main difficulty which at the same time he fully recognises  can it have been that lord hermiston’s part was to have been limited to presiding at the first trial where the evidence incriminating archie was unexpectedly brought forward and to directing that the law should take its course  whether the final escape and union of archie and christina would have proved equally essential to the plot may perhaps to some readers seem questionable  they may rather feel that a tragic destiny is foreshadowed from the beginning for all concerned and is inherent in the very conditions of the tale  but on this point and other matters of general criticism connected with it i find an interesting discussion by the author himself in his correspondence  writing to mr j m barrie under date november 1 1892 and criticising that author’s famous story of the little minister stevenson says—  “your descriptions of your dealings with lord rintoul are frightfully unconscientious     the little minister ought to have ended badly we all know it did and we are infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with which you have lied about it  if you had told the truth i for one could never have forgiven you  as you had conceived and written the earlier parts the truth about the end though indisputably true to fact would have been a lie or what is worse a discord in art if you are going to make a book end badly it must end badly from the beginning  now your book began to end well  you let yourself fall in love with and fondle and smile at your puppets  once you had done that your honour was committed—at the cost of truth to life you were bound to save them  it is the blot on richard feverel for instance that it begins to end well and then tricks you and ends ill  but in this case there is worse behind for the ill ending does not inherently issue from the plot—the story had in fact ended well after the great last interview between richard and lucy—and the blind illogical bullet which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with a room into whose open window it comes buzzing  it might have so happened it needed not and unless needs must we have no right to pain our readers  i have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my braxfield story  braxfield—only his name is hermiston—has a son who is condemned to death plainly there is a fine tempting fitness about this—and i meant he was to hang  but on considering my minor characters i saw there were five people who would—in a sense who must—break prison and attempt his rescue  they are capable hardy folks too who might very well succeed  why should they not then  why should not young hermiston escape clear out of the country and be happy if he could with his—but soft  i will not betray my secret nor my heroine   ”  to pass now from the question how the story would have ended to the question how it originated and grew in the writer’s mind  the character of the hero weir of hermiston is avowedly suggested by the historical personality of robert macqueen lord braxfield  this famous judge has been for generations the subject of a hundred edinburgh tales and anecdotes  readers of stevenson’s essay on the raeburn exhibition in virginibus puerisque will remember how he is fascinated by raeburn’s portrait of braxfield even as lockhart had been fascinated by a different portrait of the same worthy sixty years before see peter’s letters to his kinsfolk nor did his interest in the character diminish in later life  again the case of a judge involved by the exigencies of his office in a strong conflict between public duty and private interest or affection was one which had always attracted and exercised stevenson’s imagination  in the days when he and mr henley were collaborating with a view to the stage mr henley once proposed a plot founded on the story of mr justice harbottle in sheridan le fanu’s in a glass darkly in which the wicked judge goes headlong per fas et nefas to his object of getting the husband of his mistress hanged  some time later stevenson and his wife together wrote a play called the hanging judge  in this the title character is tempted for the first time in his life to tamper with the course of justice in order to shield his wife from persecution by a former husband who reappears after being supposed dead  bulwer’s novel of paul clifford with its final situation of the worldlyminded judge sir william brandon learning that the highwayman whom he is in the act of sentencing is his own son and dying of the knowledge was also well known to stevenson and no doubt counted for something in the suggestion of the present story  once more the difficulties often attending the relation of father and son in actual life had pressed heavily on stevenson’s mind and conscience from the days of his youth when in obeying the law of his own nature he had been constrained to disappoint distress and for a time to be much misunderstood by a father whom he justly loved and admired with all his heart  difficulties of this kind he had already handled in a lighter vein once or twice in fiction—as for instance in the story of a lie and in the wrecker—before he grappled with them in the acute and tragic phase in which they occur in the present story  these three elements then the interest of the historical personality of lord braxfield the problems and emotions arising from a violent conflict between duty and nature in a judge and the difficulties due to incompatibility and misunderstanding between father and son lie at the foundations of the present story  to touch on minor matters it is perhaps worth notice as mr henley reminds me that the name of weir had from of old a special significance for stevenson’s imagination from the traditional fame in edinburgh of major weir burned as a warlock together with his sister under circumstances of peculiar atrocity another name that of the episodical personage of mr torrance the minister is borrowed direct from life as indeed are the whole figure and its surroundings—kirkyard kirk and manse—down even to the black thread mittens witness the following passage from a letter of the early seventies—“i’ve been to church and am not depressed—a great step  it was at that beautiful church” of glencorse in the pentlands three miles from his father’s country house at swanston  “it is a little cruciform place with a steep slate roof  the small kirkyard is full of old gravestones one of a frenchman from dunkerque i suppose he died prisoner in the military prison hard by  and one the most pathetic memorial i ever saw a poor schoolslate in a wooden frame with the inscription cut into it evidently by the father’s own hand  in church old mr torrance preached over eighty and a relic of times forgotten with his black thread gloves and mild old face”  a side hint for a particular trait in the character of mrs weir we can trace in some family traditions concerning the writer’s own grandmother who is reported to have valued piety much more than efficiency in her domestic servants  the other women characters seem so far at least as i know to have been pure creation and especially that new and admirable incarnation of the eternal feminine in the elder kirstie  the little that he says about her himself is in a letter written a few days before his death to mr gosse  the allusions are to the various moods and attitudes of people in regard to middle age and are suggested by mr gosse’s volume of poems in russet and silver  “it seems rather funny” he writes “that this matter should come up just now as i am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle age in one of my stories the justiceclerk  the case is that of a woman and i think i am doing her justice  you will be interested i believe to see the difference in our treatments  secreta vitæ the title of one of mr gosse’s poems comes nearer to the case of my poor kirstie”  from the wonderful midnight scene between her and archie we may judge what we have lost in those later scenes where she was to have taxed him with the fault that was not his—to have presently learned his innocence from the lips of his supposed victim—to have then vindicated him to her kinsmen and fired them to the action of his rescue  the scene of the prisonbreaking here planned by stevenson would have gained interest as will already have occurred to readers from comparison with the two famous precedents in scott the porteous mob and the breaking of portanferry jail  the best account of stevenson’s methods of imaginative work is in the following sentences from a letter of his own to mr w craibe angus of glasgow—“i am still ‘a slow study’ and sit for a long while silent on my eggs  unconscious thought there is the only method macerate your subject let it boil slow then take the lid off and look in—and there your stuff is—good or bad”  the several elements above noted having been left to work for many years in his mind it was in the autumn of 1892 that he was moved to “take the lid off and look in”—under the influence it would seem of a special and overmastering wave of that feeling for the romance of scottish scenery and character which was at all times so strong in him and which his exile did so much to intensify  i quote again from his letter to mr barrie on november 1st in that year—“it is a singular thing that i should live here in the south seas under conditions so new and so striking and yet my imagination so continually inhabit the cold old huddle of grey hills from which we come  i have finished david balfour i have another book on the stocks the young chevalier which is to be part in france and part in scotland and to deal with prince charlie about the year 1749 and now what have i done but begun a third which is to be all moorland together and is to have for a centrepiece a figure that i think you will appreciate—that of the immortal braxfield  braxfield himself is my grand premier—or since you are so much involved in the british drama let me say my heavy lead” writing to me at the same date he makes the same announcement more briefly with a list of the characters and an indication of the scene and date of the story  to mr baxter he writes a month later “i have a novel on the stocks to be called the justiceclerk  it is pretty scotch the grand premier is taken from braxfield o by the by send me cockburn’s memorials and some of the story is well queer  the heroine is seduced by one man and finally disappears with the other man who shot him     mind you i expect the justiceclerk to be my masterpiece  my braxfield is already a thing of beauty and a joy for ever and so far as he has gone far my best character”  from the last extract it appears that he had already at this date drafted some of the earlier chapters of the book  he also about the same time composed the dedication to his wife who found it pinned to her bedcurtains one morning on awaking  it was always his habit to keep several books in progress at the same time turning from one to another as the fancy took him and finding relief in the change of labour and for many months after the date of this letter first illness—then a voyage to auckland—then work on the ebbtide on a new tale called st ives which was begun during an attack of influenza and on his projected book of family history—prevented his making any continuous progress with weir  in august 1893 he says he has been recasting the beginning  a year later still only the first four or five chapters had been drafted then in the last weeks of his life he attacked the task again in a sudden heat of inspiration and worked at it ardently and without interruption until the end came  no wonder if during these weeks he was sometimes aware of a tension of the spirit difficult to sustain  “how can i keep this pitch” he is reported to have said after finishing one of the chapters and all the world knows how that frail organism in fact betrayed him in mid effort  the greatness of the loss to his country’s letters can for the first time be fully measured from the foregoing pages  there remains one more point to be mentioned as to the speech and manners of the hanging judge himself  that these are not a whit exaggerated in comparison with what is recorded of his historic prototype lord braxfield is certain  the locus classicus in regard to this personage is in lord cockburn’s memorials of his time  “strong built and dark with rough eyebrows powerful eyes threatening lips and a low growling voice he was like a formidable blacksmith  his accent and dialect were exaggerated scotch his language like his thoughts short strong and conclusive  illiterate and without any taste for any refined enjoyment strength of understanding which gave him power without cultivation only encouraged him to a more contemptuous disdain of all natures less coarse than his own  it may be doubted if he was ever so much in his element as when tauntingly repelling the last despairing claim of a wretched culprit and sending him to botany bay or the gallows with an insulting jest  yet this was not from cruelty for which he was too strong and too jovial but from cherished coarseness” readers nevertheless who are at all acquainted with the social history of scotland will hardly have failed to make the observation that braxfield’s is an extreme case of eighteenthcentury manners as he himself was an eighteenthcentury personage he died in 1799 in his seventyeighth year and that for the date in which the story is cast 1814 such manners are somewhat of an anachronism  during the generation contemporary with the french revolution and the napoleonic wars—or to put it another way the generation that elapsed between the days when scott roamed the country as a high school and university student and those when he settled in the fulness of fame and prosperity at abbotsford—or again the allusions will appeal to readers of the admirable galt during the interval between the first and the last provostry of bailie pawkie in the borough of gudetown or between the earlier and the final ministrations of mr balwhidder in the parish of dalmailing—during this period a great softening had taken place in scottish manners generally and in those of the bar and bench not least “since the death of lord justiceclerk macqueen of braxfield” says lockhart writing about 1817 “the whole exterior of judicial deportment has been quite altered”  a similar criticism may probably hold good on the picture of border life contained in the chapter concerning the four black brothers of cauldstaneslap namely that it rather suggests the ways of an earlier generation nor have i any clue to the reasons which led stevenson to choose this particular date in the year preceding waterloo for a story which in regard to some of its features at least might seem more naturally placed some twentyfive or thirty years before  if the reader seeks further to know whether the scenery of hermiston can be identified with any one special place familiar to the writer’s early experience the answer i think must be in the negative  rather it is distilled from a number of different haunts and associations among the moorlands of southern scotland  in the dedication and in a letter to me he indicates the lammermuirs as the scene of his tragedy  and mrs stevenson his mother tells me that she thinks he was inspired by recollections of a visit paid in boyhood to an uncle living at a remote farmhouse in that district called overshiels in the parish of stow  but though he may have thought of the lammermuirs in the first instance we have already found him drawing his description of the kirk and manse from another haunt of his youth namely glencorse in the pentlands while passages in chapters v and viii point explicitly to a third district that is upper tweeddale with the country stretching thence towards the wells of clyde  with this country also holiday rides and excursions from peebles had made him familiar as a boy and this seems certainly the most natural scene of the story if only from its proximity to the proper home of the elliotts which of course is in the heart of the border especially teviotdale and ettrick  some of the geographical names mentioned are clearly not meant to furnish literal indications  the spango for instance is a water running i believe not into the tweed but into the nith and crossmichael as the name of a town is borrowed from galloway  but it is with the general and essential that the artist deals and questions of strict historical perspective or local definition are beside the mark in considering his work  nor will any reader expect or be grateful for comment in this place on matters which are more properly to the point—on the seizing and penetrating power of the author’s ripened art as exhibited in the foregoing pages the wide range of character and emotion over which he sweeps with so assured a hand his vital poetry of vision and magic of presentment  surely no son of scotland has died leaving with his last breath a worthier tribute to the land he loved
