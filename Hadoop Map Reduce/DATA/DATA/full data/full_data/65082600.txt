 xvi  florence   xvii  high up over the cathedral square  xviii  the marchesa    xix  cleopatra but not anthony     xx  the broken rod    xxi  words     chapter i the blue ball   there was a large brilliant evening star in the early twilight and underfoot the earth was half frozen it was christmas eve also the war was over and there was a sense of relief that was almost a new menace a man felt the violence of the nightmare released now into the general air also there had been another wrangle among the men on the pitbank that evening  aaron sisson was the last man on the little black railwayline climbing the hill home from work he was late because he had attended a meeting of the men on the bank he was secretary to the miners union for his colliery and had heard a good deal of silly wrangling that left him nettled  he strode over a stile crossed two fields strode another stile and was in the long road of colliers dwellings just across was his own house he had built it himself he went through the little gate up past the side of the house to the back there he hung a moment glancing down the dark wintry garden  my fathermy fathers come cried a childs excited voice and two little girls in white pinafores ran out in front of his legs  father shall you set the christmas tree they cried weve got one  afore i have my dinner he answered amiably  set it now set it nowwe got it through fred alton  where is it  the little girls were dragging a rough dark object out of a corner of the passage into the light of the kitchen door  its a beauty exclaimed millicent  yes it is said marjory  i should think so he replied striding over the dark bough he went to the back kitchen to take off his coat  set it now father set it now clamoured the girls  you might as well youve left your dinner so long you might as well do it now before you have it came a womans plangent voice out of the brilliant light of the middle room  aaron sisson had taken off his coat and waistcoat and his cap he stood bareheaded in his shirt and braces contemplating the tree  what am i to put it in he queried he picked up the tree and held it erect by the topmost twig he felt the cold as he stood in the yard coatless and he twitched his shoulders  isnt it a beauty repeated millicent  aylopsided though  put something on you two came the womans high imperative voice from the kitchen  we arent cold protested the girls from the yard  come and put something on insisted the voice the man started off down the path the little girls ran grumbling indoors the sky was clear there was still a crystalline nonluminous light in the under air  aaron rummaged in his shed at the bottom of the garden and found a spade and a box that was suitable then he came out to his neat bare wintry garden the girls flew towards him putting the elastic of their hats under their chins as they ran the tree and the box lay on the frozen earth the air breathed dark frosty electric  hold it up straight he said to millicent as he arranged the tree in the box she stood silent and held the top bough he filled in round the roots  when it was done and pressed in he went for the wheelbarrow the girls were hovering excited round the tree he dropped the barrow and stooped to the box the girls watched him hold back his facethe boughs pricked him  is it very heavy asked millicent  ay he replied with a little grunt then the procession set offthe trundling wheelbarrow the swinging hissing tree the two excited little girls they arrived at the door down went the legs of the wheelbarrow on the yard the man looked at the box  where are you going to have it he called  put it in the back kitchen cried his wife  youd better have it where its going to stop i dont want to hawk it about  put it on the floor against the dresser father put it there urged millicent  you come and put some paper down then called the mother hastily  the two children ran indoors the man stood contemplative in the cold shrugging his uncovered shoulders slightly the open inner door showed a bright linoleum on the floor and the end of a brown sideboard on which stood an aspidistra  again with a wrench aaron sisson lifted the box the tree pricked and stung his wife watched him as he entered staggering with his face averted  mind where you make a lot of dirt she said  he lowered the box with a little jerk on to the spreadout newspaper on the floor soil scattered  sweep it up he said to millicent  his ear was lingering over the sudden clutching hiss of the treeboughs  a stark white incandescent light filled the room and made everything sharp and hard in the open fireplace a hot fire burned red all was scrupulously clean and perfect a baby was cooing in a rockerless wicker cradle by the hearth the mother a slim neat woman with dark hair was sewing a childs frock she put this aside rose and began to take her husbands dinner from the oven  you stopped confabbing long enough tonight she said  yes he answered going to the back kitchen to wash his hands  in a few minutes he came and sat down to his dinner the doors were shut close but there was a draught because the settling of the mines under the house made the doors not fit aaron moved his chair to get out of the draught but he still sat in his shirt and trousers  he was a goodlooking man fair and pleasant about thirtytwo years old he did not talk much but seemed to think about something his wife resumed her sewing she was acutely aware of her husband but he seemed not very much aware of her  what were they on about today then she said  about the throwin  and did they settle anything  theyre going to try itand theyll come out if it isnt satisfactory  the butties wont have it i know she said he gave a short laugh and went on with his meal  the two children were squatted on the floor by the tree they had a wooden box from which they had taken many little newspaper packets which they were spreading out like wares  dont open any we wont open any of them till weve taken them all outand then well undo one in our turns then we sll both undo equal millicent was saying  yes well take them all out first reechoed marjory  and what are they going to do about job arthur freer do they want him a faint smile came on her husbands face  nay i dont know what they wantsome of em want himwhether theyre a majority i dont know  she watched him closely  majority id give em majority they want to get rid of you and make a fool of you and you want to break your heart over it strikes me you need something to break your heart over  he laughed silently  nay he said i sll never break my heart  youll go nearer to it over that than over anything else just because a lot of ignorant monkeys want a monkey of their own sort to do the union work and jabber to them they want to get rid of you and you eat your heart out about it more fool you thats all i saymore fool you if you cared for your wife and children half what you care about your union youd be a lot better pleased in the end but you care about nothing but a lot of ignorant colliers who dont know what they want except its more money just for themselves self self selfthats all it is with themand ignorance  youd rather have self without ignorance he said smiling finely  i would if ive got to have it but what i should like to see is a man that has thought for others and isnt all self and politics  her color had risen her hand trembled with anger as she sewed a blank look had come over the mans face as if he did not hear or heed any more he drank his tea in a long draught wiped his moustache with two fingers and sat looking abstractedly at the children  they had laid all the little packets on the floor and millicent was saying  now ill undo the first and you can have the second ill take this  she unwrapped the bit of newspaper and disclosed a silvery ornament for a christmas tree a frail thing like a silver plum with deep rosy indentations on each side  oh she exclaimed isnt it lovely her fingers cautiously held the long bubble of silver and glowing rose cleaving to it with a curious irritating possession the mans eyes moved away from her the lesser child was fumbling with one of the little packets  oha wail went up from millicent youve taken oneyou didnt wait then her voice changed to a motherly admonition and she began to interfere this is the way to do it look let me help you  but marjory drew back with resentment  dont millicentdont came the childish cry but millicents fingers itched  at length marjory had got out her treasurea little silvery bell with a glass top hanging inside the bell was made of frail glassy substance light as air  oh the bell rang out millicents clanging voice the bell its my bell my bell its mine dont break it marjory dont break it will you  marjory was shaking the bell against her ear but it was dumb it made no sound  youll break it i know you willyoull break it give it me cried millicent and she began to take away the bell marjory set up an expostulation  let her alone said the father  millicent let go as if she had been stung but still her brassy impudent voice persisted  shell break it shell break it its mine  you undo another said the mother politic  millicent began with hasty itching fingers to unclose another package  awaw mother my peacockaw my peacock my green peacock lavishly she hovered over a sinuous greenish bird with wings and tail of spun glass pearly and body of deep electric green  its minemy green peacock its mine because marjorys had one wing off and mine hadnt my green peacock that i love i love it she swung it softly from the little ring on its back then she went to her mother  look mother isnt it a beauty  mind the ring doesnt come out said her mother yes its lovely the girl passed on to her father  look father dont you love it  love it he reechoed ironical over the word love  she stood for some moments trying to force his attention then she went back to her place  marjory had brought forth a golden apple red on one cheek rather garish  oh exclaimed millicent feverishly instantly seized with desire for what she had not got indifferent to what she had her eye ran quickly over the packages she took one  now she exclaimed loudly to attract attention now whats thiswhats this what will this beauty be  with finicky fingers she removed the newspaper marjory watched her wideeyed millicent was selfimportant  the blue ball she cried in a climax of rapture ive got the blue ball  she held it gloating in the cup of her hands it was a little globe of hardened glass of a magnificent full dark blue color she rose and went to her father  it was your blue ball wasnt it father  yes  and you had it when you were a little boy and now i have it when im a little girl  ay he replied drily  and its never been broken all those years  no not yet  and perhaps it never will be broken to this she received no answer  wont it break she persisted cant you break it  yes if you hit it with a hammer he said  aw she cried i dont mean that i mean if you just drop it it wont break if you drop it will it  i dare say it wont  but will it  i shd think not  should i try  she proceeded gingerly to let the blue ball drop it bounced dully on the floorcovering  ohhh she cried catching it up i love it  let me drop it cried marjory and there was a performance of admonition and demonstration from the elder sister  but millicent must go further she became excited  it wont break she said even if you toss it up in the air  she flung it up it fell safely but her fathers brow knitted slightly she tossed it wildly it fell with a little splashing explosion it had smashed it had fallen on the sharp edge of the tiles that protruded under the fender  now what have you done cried the mother  the child stood with her lip between her teeth a look half of pure misery and dismay half of satisfaction on her pretty sharp face  she wanted to break it said the father  no she didnt what do you say that for said the mother and millicent burst into a flood of tears  he rose to look at the fragments that lay splashed on the floor  you must mind the bits he said and pick em all up  he took one of the pieces to examine it it was fine and thin and hard lined with pure silver brilliant he looked at it closely sothis was what it was and this was the end of it he felt the curious soft explosion of its breaking still in his ears he threw his piece in the fire  pick all the bits up he said give over give over dont cry any more the goodnatured tone of his voice quieted the child as he intended it should  he went away into the back kitchen to wash himself as he was bending his head over the sink before the little mirror lathering to shave there came from outside the dissonant voices of boys pouring out the dregs of carolsinging  while shepepepepherds watched  he held his soapy brush suspended for a minute they called this singing his mind flitted back to early carol music then again he heard the vocal violence outside  arent you off there he called out in masculine menace the noise stopped there was a scuffle but the feet returned and the voices resumed almost immediately the door opened boys were heard muttering among themselves millicent had given them a penny feet scraped on the yard then went thudding along the side of the house to the street  to aaron sisson this was home this was christmas the unspeakably familiar the war over nothing was changed yet everything changed the scullery in which he stood was painted green quite fresh very clean the floor was red tiles the washcopper of red bricks was very red the mangle with its putup board was whitescrubbed the american oilcloth on the table had a gay pattern there was a warm fire the water in the boiler hissed faintly and in front of him beneath him as he leaned forward shaving a drop of water fell with strange incalculable rhythm from the bright brass tap into the white enamelled bowl which was now half full of pure quivering water the war was over and everything just the same the acute familiarity of this house which he had built for his marriage twelve years ago the changeless pleasantness of it all seemed unthinkable it prevented his thinking  when he went into the middle room to comb his hair he found the christmas tree sparkling his wife was making pastry at the table the baby was sitting up propped in cushions  father said millicent approaching him with a flat blueandwhite angel of cottonwool and two ends of cottontie the angel at the top  tie it at the top he said looking down  yes at the very topbecause its just come down from the sky  ay my word he laughed and he tied the angel  coming downstairs after changing he went into the icy cold parlour and took his music and a small handbag with this he retreated again to the back kitchen he was still in trousers and shirt and slippers but now it was a clean white shirt and his best black trousers and new pink and white braces he sat under the gasjet of the back kitchen looking through his music then he opened the bag in which were sections of a flute and a piccolo he took out the flute and adjusted it as he sat he was physically aware of the sounds of the night the bubbling of water in the boiler the faint sound of the gas the sudden crying of the baby in the next room then noises outside distant boys shouting distant rags of carols fragments of voices of men the whole country was roused and excited  the little room was hot aaron rose and opened a square ventilator over the copper letting in a stream of cold air which was grateful to him then he cocked his eye over the sheet of music spread out on the table before him he tried his flute and then at last with the odd gesture of a diver taking a plunge he swung his head and began to play a stream of music soft and rich and fluid came out of the flute he played beautifully he moved his head and his raised bare arms with slight intense movements as the delicate music poured out it was sixteenthcentury christmas melody very limpid and delicate  the pure mindless exquisite motion and fluidity of the music delighted him with a strange exasperation there was something tense exasperated to the point of intolerable anger in his goodhumored breast as he played the finelyspun peacemusic the more exquisite the music the more perfectly he produced it in sheer bliss and at the same time the more intense was the maddened exasperation within him  millicent appeared in the room she fidgetted at the sink the music was a bugbear to her because it prevented her from saying what was on her own mind at length it ended her father was turning over the various books and sheets she looked at him quickly seizing her opportunity  are you going out father she said  eh  are you going out she twisted nervously  what do you want to know for  he made no other answer and turned again to the music his eye went down a sheetthen over it againthen more closely over it again  are you persisted the child balancing on one foot  he looked at her and his eyes were angry under knitted brows  what are you bothering about he said  im not botheringi only wanted to know if you were going out she pouted quivering to cry  i expect i am he said quietly  she recovered at once but still with timidity asked  we havent got any candles for the christmas treeshall you buy some because mother isnt going out  candles he repeated settling his music and taking up the piccolo  yesshall you buy us some father shall you  candles he repeated putting the piccolo to his mouth and blowing a few piercing preparatory notes  yes little christmastree candlesblue ones and red ones in boxesshall you father  well seeif i see any  but shall you she insisted desperately she wisely mistrusted his vagueness  but he was looking unheeding at the music then suddenly the piccolo broke forth wild shrill brilliant he was playing mozart the childs face went pale with anger at the sound she turned and went out closing both doors behind her to shut out the noise  the shrill rapid movement of the piccolo music seemed to possess the air it was useless to try to shut it out the man went on playing to himself measured and insistent in the frosty evening the sound carried people passing down the street hesitated listening the neighbours knew it was aaron practising his piccolo he was esteemed a good player was in request at concerts and dances also at swell balls so the vivid piping sound tickled the darkness  he played on till about seven oclock he did not want to go out too soon in spite of the early closing of the public houses he never went with the stream but made a side current of his own his wife said he was contrary when he went into the middle room to put on his collar and tie the two little girls were having their hair brushed the baby was in bed there was a hot smell of mincepies baking in the oven  you wont forget our candles will you father asked millicent with assurance now  ill see he answered  his wife watched him as he put on his overcoat and hat he was welldressed handsomelooking she felt there was a curious glamour about him it made her feel bitter he had an unfair advantagehe was free to go off while she must stay at home with the children  theres no knowing what time youll be home she said  i shant be late he answered  its easy to say so she retorted with some contempt he took his stick and turned towards the door  bring the children some candles for their tree and dont be so selfish she said  all right he said going out  dont say all right if you never mean to do it she cried with sudden anger following him to the door  his figure stood large and shadowy in the darkness  how many do you want he said  a dozen she said and holders too if you can get them she added with barren bitterness  yesall right he turned and melted into the darkness she went indoors worn with a strange and bitter flame  he crossed the fields towards the little town which once more fumed its lights under the night the country ran away rising on his right hand it was no longer a great bank of darkness lights twinkled freely here and there though forlornly now that the wartime restrictions were removed it was no glitter of prewar nights pitheads glittering faroff with electricity neither was it the black gulf of the war darkness instead this forlorn sporadic twinkling  everybody seemed to be out of doors the hollow dark countryside reechoed like a shell with shouts and calls and excited voices restlessness and nervous excitement nervous hilarity were in the air there was a sense of electric surcharge everywhere frictional a neurasthenic haste for excitement  every moment aaron sisson was greeted with goodnightgoodnight aarongoodnight mr sisson people carrying parcels children women thronged home on the dark paths they were all talking loudly declaiming loudly about what they could and could not get and what this or the other had lost  when he got into the main street the only street of shops it was crowded there seemed to have been some violent but quiet contest a subdued fight going on all the afternoon and evening people struggling to buy things to get things money was spent like water there was a frenzy of moneyspending though the necessities of life were in abundance still the people struggled in frenzy for cheese sweets raisins porkstuff even for flowers and holly all of which were scarce and for toys and knickknacks which were sold out there was a wild grumbling but a deep satisfaction in the fight the struggle the same fight and the same satisfaction in the fight was witnessed whenever a tramcar stopped or when it heaved its way into sight then the struggle to mount on board became desperate and savage but stimulating souls surcharged with hostility found now some outlet for their feelings  as he came near the little marketplace he bethought himself of the christmastree candles he did not intend to trouble himself and yet when he glanced in passing into the sweetshop window and saw it bare as a board the very fact that he probably could not buy the things made him hesitate and try  have you got any christmastree candles he asked as he entered the shop  how many do you want  a dozen  cant let you have a dozen you can have two boxesfour in a boxeight sixpence a box  got any holders  holders dont ask havent seen one this year  got any toffee  coughdropstwopence an ouncenothing else left  give me four ounces  he watched her weighing them in the little brass scales  youve not got much of a christmas show he said  dont talk about christmas as far as sweets is concerned they ought to have allowed us six times the quantitytheres plenty of sugar why didnt they we sll have to enjoy ourselves with what weve got we mean to anyhow  ay he said  time we had a bit of enjoyment this christmas they ought to have made things more plentiful  yes he said stuffing his package in his pocket     chapter ii royal oak   the war had killed the little market of the town as he passed the market place on the brow aaron noticed that there were only two miserable stalls but people crowded just the same there was a loud sound of voices mens voices men pressed round the doorways of the publichouses  but he was going to a pub out of town he descended the dark hill a streetlamp here and there shed parsimonious light in the bottoms under the trees it was very dark but a lamp glimmered in front of the royal oak this was a low white house sunk three steps below the highway it was darkened but sounded crowded  opening the door sisson found himself in the stone passage old bob carrying three cans stopped to see who had enteredthen went on into the public bar on the left the bar itself was a sort of little windowsill on the right the pub was a small one in this windowopening stood the landlady drawing and serving to her husband behind the bar was a tiny parlour or den the landladys preserve  oh its you she said bobbing down to look at the newcomer none entered her barparlour unless invited  come in said the landlady there was a peculiar intonation in her complacent voice which showed she had been expecting him a little irritably  he went across into her barparlour it would not hold more than eight or ten people all toldjust the benches along the walls the fire betweenand two little round tables  i began to think you werent coming said the landlady bringing him a whiskey  she was a large stout highcoloured woman with a fine profile probably jewish she had chestnutcoloured eyes quick intelligent her movements were large and slow her voice laconic  im not so late am i asked aaron  yes you are late i should think she looked up at the little clock close on nine  i did some shopping said aaron with a quick smile  did you indeed thats news im sure may we ask what you bought  this he did not like but he had to answer  christmastree candles and toffee  for the little children well youve done well for once i must say i recommend you i didnt think you had so much in you  she sat herself down in her seat at the end of the bench and took up her knitting aaron sat next to her he poured water into his glass and drank  its warm in here he said when he had swallowed the liquor  yes it is you wont want to keep that thick good overcoat on replied the landlady  no he said i think ill take it off  she watched him as he hung up his overcoat he wore black clothes as usual as he reached up to the pegs she could see the muscles of his shoulders and the form of his legs her reddishbrown eyes seemed to burn and her nose that had a subtle beautiful hebraic curve seemed to arch itself she made a little place for him by herself as he returned she carried her head thrown back with dauntless selfsufficiency  there were several colliers in the room talking quietly they were the superior type all favoured by the landlady who loved intellectual discussion opposite by the fire sat a little greenish manevidently an oriental  youre very quiet all at once doctor said the landlady in her slow laconic voice  yesmay i have another whiskey please she rose at once powerfully energetic  oh im sorry she said and she went to the bar  well said the little hindu doctor and how are things going now with the men  the same as ever said aaron  yes said the stately voice of the landlady and im afraid they will always be the same as ever when will they learn wisdom  but what do you call wisdom asked sherardy the hindu he spoke with a little childish lisp  what do i call wisdom repeated the landlady why all acting together for the common good that is wisdom in my idea  yes very well that is so but what do you call the common good replied the little doctor with childish pertinence  ay said aaron with a laugh thats it the miners were all stirring now to take part in the discussion  what do i call the common good repeated the landlady that all people should study the welfare of other people and not only their own  they are not to study their own welfare said the doctor  ah that i did not say replied the landlady let them study their own welfare and that of others also  well then said the doctor what is the welfare of a collier  the welfare of a collier said the landlady is that he shall earn sufficient wages to keep himself and his family comfortable to educate his children and to educate himself for that is what he wants education  ay happen so put in brewitt a big fine goodhumoured collier happen so mrs houseley but what if you havent got much education to speak of  you can always get it she said patronizing  nayim blest if you can its no use tryin to educate a man over fortynot by booklearning that isnt saying hes a fool neither  and what better is them thats got education put in another man what better is the manager or th undermanager than we arependers yaller enough i th face  he is that assented the men in chorus  but because hes yellow in the face as you say mr kirk said the landlady largely that doesnt mean he has no advantages higher than what you have got  ay said kirk he can mae more money than i canthats about a as it comes to  he can make more money said the landlady and when hes made it he knows better how to use it  appen so an awhat does he do more than eat and drink and workan take it out of hisself a sight harder than i do by th looks of himwhats it matter if he eats a bit more or drinks a bit more  no reiterated the landlady he not only eats and drinks he can read and he can converse  me an a said tom kirk and the men burst into a laugh i can readan ive had many a talk an conversation with you in this house mrs houseleyam havin one at this minute seemingly  seemingly you are said the landlady ironically but do you think there would be no difference between your conversation and mr penders if he were here so that i could enjoy his conversation  an what difference would there be asked tom kirk hed go home to his bed just the same  there you are mistaken he would be the better and so should i a great deal better for a little genuine conversation  if its conversation as maes his behind drop said tom kirk an puts th bile in his face said brewitt there was a general laugh  i can see its no use talking about it any further said the landlady lifting her head dangerously  but look here mrs houseley do you really think it makes much difference to a man whether he can hold a serious conversation or not asked the doctor  i do indeed all the difference in the worldto me there is no greater difference than between an educated man and an uneducated man  and where does it come in asked kirk  but wait a bit now said aaron sisson you take an educated mantake pender whats his education for what does he scheme forwhat does he contrive for what does he talk for  for all the purposes of his life replied the landlady  ay an whats the purpose of his life insisted aaron sisson  the purpose of his life repeated the landlady at a loss i should think he knows that best himself  no better than i know itand you know it said aaron  well said the landlady if you know then speak out what is it  to make more money for the firmand so make his own chance of a rise better  the landlady was baffled for some moments then she said  yes and suppose that he does is there any harm in it isnt it his duty to do what he can for himself dont you try to earn all you can  ay said aaron but theres soon a limit to what i can earnits like this when you work it out everything comes to money reckon it as you like its money on both sides its money we live for and money is what our lives is worthnothing else money we live for and money we are when were dead that or nothing an its money as is between the masters and us theres a few educated ones got hold of one end of the rope and all the lot of us hanging on to th other end an we sll go on pulling our guts out time in time out  but theyve got th long end o th rope th masters has said brewitt  for as long as one holds the other will pull concluded aaron sisson philosophically  an im almighty sure o that said kirk there was a little pause  yes thats all there is in the minds of you men said the landlady but what can be done with the money that you never think ofthe education of the children the improvement of conditions  educate the children so that they can lay hold of the long end of the rope instead of the short end said the doctor with a little giggle  ay thats it said brewitt ive pulled at th short end an my lads may do th same  a selfish policy put in the landlady  selfish or not they may do it  till the crack o doom said aaron with a glistening smile  or the crack o th rope said brewitt  yes and then what cried the landlady  then we all drop on our backsides said kirk there was a general laugh and an uneasy silence  all i can say of you men said the landlady is that you have a narrow selfish policyinstead of thinking of the children instead of thinking of improving the world you live in  we hang on british bulldog breed said brewitt there was a general laugh  yes and little wiser than dogs wrangling for a bone said the landlady  are we to let t other side run off wi th bone then while we sit on our stunts an yowl for it asked brewitt  no indeed there can be wisdom in everythingits what you do with the money when youve got it said the landlady thats where the importance lies  its missis as gets it said kirk it doesnt stop wi us ay its the wife as gets it ninety per cent they all concurred  and who should have the money indeed if not your wives they have everything to do with the money what idea have you but to waste it  women waste nothingthey couldnt if they tried said aaron sisson  there was a lull for some minutes the men were all stimulated by drink the landlady kept them going she herself sipped a glass of brandybut slowly she sat near to sissonand the great fierce warmth of her presence enveloped him particularly he loved so to luxuriate like a cat in the presence of a violent woman he knew that tonight she was feeling very nice to hima female glow that came out of her to him sometimes when she put down her knitting or took it up again from the bench beside him her fingers just touched his thigh and the fine electricity ran over his body as if he were a cat tingling at a caress  and yet he was not happynor comfortable there was a hard opposing core in him that neither the whiskey nor the woman could dissolve or soothe tonight it remained hard nay became harder and more deeply antagonistic to his surroundings every moment he recognised it as a secret malady he suffered from this strained unacknowledged opposition to his surroundings a hard core of irrational exhausting withholding of himself irritating because he still wanted to give himself a woman and whiskey these were usually a remedyand music but lately these had begun to fail him no there was something in him that would not give inneither to the whiskey nor the woman nor even the music even in the midst of his best music it sat in the middle of him this invisible black dog and growled and waited never to be cajoled he knew of its presenceand was a little uneasy for of course he wanted to let himself go to feel rosy and loving and all that but at the very thought the black dog showed its teeth  still he kept the beast at baywith all his will he kept himself as it were genial he wanted to melt and be rosy happy  he sipped his whiskey with gratification he luxuriated in the presence of the landlady very confident of the strength of her liking for him he glanced at her profilethat fine throwback of her hostile head wicked in the midst of her benevolence that subtle really very beautiful delicate curve of her nose that moved him exactly like a piece of pure sound but tonight it did not overcome him there was a devilish little cold eye in his brain that was not taken in by what he saw  a terrible obstinacy located itself in him he saw the fine richcoloured secretive face of the hebrew woman so loudly selfrighteous and so dangerous so destructive so lustfuland he waited for his blood to melt with passion for her but not tonight tonight his innermost heart was hard and cold as ice the very danger and lustfulness of her which had so pricked his senses now made him colder he disliked her at her tricks he saw her once too often her and all women bah the love game and the whiskey that was to help in the game he had drowned himself once too often in whiskey and in love now he floated like a corpse in both with a cold hostile eye  and at least half of his inward fume was anger because he could no longer drown nothing would have pleased him better than to feel his senses melting and swimming into oneness with the dark but impossible cold with a white fury inside him he floated wide eyed and apart as a corpse he thought of the gentle love of his first married years and became only whiter and colder set in more intense obstinacy a wave of revulsion lifted him  he became aware that he was deadly antagonistic to the landlady that he disliked his whole circumstances a cold diabolical consciousness detached itself from his state of semiintoxication  is it pretty much the same out there in india he asked of the doctor suddenly  the doctor started and attended to him on his own level  probably he answered it is worse  worse exclaimed aaron sisson hows that  why because in a way the people of india have an easier time even than the people of england because they have no responsibility the british government takes the responsibility and the people have nothing to do except their bit of workand talk perhaps about national rule just for a pastime  they have to earn their living said sisson  yes said the little doctor who had lived for some years among the colliers and become quite familiar with them yes they have to earn their livingand then no more thats why the british government is the worst thing possible for them it is the worst thing possible and not because it is a bad government really it is not a bad government it is a good oneand they know itmuch better than they would make for themselves probably but for that reason it is so very bad  the little oriental laughed a queer sniggering laugh his eyes were very bright dilated completely black he was looking into the iceblue pointed eyes of aaron sisson they were both intoxicatedbut grimly so they looked at each other in elemental difference  the whole room was now attending to this new conversation which they all accepted as serious for aaron was considered a special man a man of peculiar understanding even though as a rule he said little  if it is a good government doctor how can it be so bad for the people said the landlady  the doctors eyes quivered for the fraction of a second as he watched the other man he did not look at the landlady  it would not matter what kind of mess they madeand they would make a mess if they governed themselves the people of india they would probably make the greatest muddle possibleand start killing one another but it wouldnt matter if they exterminated half the population so long as they did it themselves and were responsible for it  again his eyes dilated utterly black to the eyes of the other man and an arch little smile flickered on his face  i think it would matter very much indeed said the landlady they had far better not govern themselves  she was for some reason becoming angry the little greenish doctor emptied his glass and smiled again  but what difference does it make said aaron sisson whether they govern themselves or not they only live till they die either way and he smiled faintly he had not really listened to the doctor the terms british government and bad for the peoplegood for the people made him malevolently angry  the doctor was nonplussed for a moment then he gathered himself together  it matters he said it matterspeople should always be responsible for themselves how can any people be responsible for another race of people and for a race much older than they are and not at all children  aaron sisson watched the others dark face with its utterly exposed eyes he was in a state of semiintoxicated anger and clairvoyance he saw in the black void glistening eyes of the oriental only the same danger the same menace that he saw in the landlady fair wise even benevolent words always the human good speaking and always underneath something hateful something detestable and murderous wise speech and good intentionsthey were invariably maggoty with these secret inclinations to destroy the man in the man whenever he heard anyone holding forth the landlady this doctor the spokesman on the pit bank or when he read the allrighteous newspaper his soul curdled with revulsion as from something foul even the infernal love and goodwill of his wife to hell with goodwill it was more hateful than illwill selfrighteous bullying like poison gas  the landlady looked at the clock  ten minutes to gentlemen she said coldly for she too knew that aaron was spoiled for her for that night  the men began to take their leave shakily the little doctor seemed to evaporate the landlady helped aaron on with his coat she saw the curious whiteness round his nostrils and his eyes the fixed hellish look on his face  youll eat a mincepie in the kitchen with us for luck she said to him detaining him till last  but he turned laughing to her  nay he said i must be getting home  he turned and went straight out of the house watching him the landladys face became yellow with passion and rage  that little poisonous indian viper she said aloud attributing aarons mood to the doctor her husband was noisily bolting the door  outside it was dark and frosty a gang of men lingered in the road near the closed door aaron found himself among them his heart bitterer than steel  the men were dispersing he should take the road home but the devil was in it if he could take a stride in the homeward direction there seemed a wall in front of him he veered but neither could he take a stride in the opposite direction so he was destined to veer round like some sort of weathercock there in the middle of the dark road outside the royal oak  but as he turned he caught sight of a third exit almost opposite was the mouth of shottle lane which led off under trees at right angles to the highroad up to new brunswick colliery he veered towards the offchance of this opening in a delirium of icy fury and plunged away into the dark lane walking slowly on firm legs     chapter iii the lighted tree   it is remarkable how many odd or extraordinary people there are in england we hear continual complaints of the stodgy dullness of the english it would be quite as just to complain of their freakish unusual characters only en masse the metal is all britannia  in an ugly little mining town we find the odd ones just as distinct as anywhere else only it happens that dull people invariably meet dull people and odd individuals always come across odd individuals no matter where they may be so that to each kind society seems all of a piece  at one end of the dark treecovered shottle lane stood the royal oak public house and mrs houseley was certainly an odd woman at the other end of the lane was shottle house where the bricknells lived the bricknells were odd also alfred bricknell the old man was one of the partners in the colliery firm his english was incorrect his accent broad derbyshire and he was not a gentleman in the snobbish sense of the word yet he was welltodo and very stuckup his wife was dead  shottle house stood two hundred yards beyond new brunswick colliery the colliery was imbedded in a plantation whence its burning pithill glowed fumed and stank sulphur in the nostrils of the bricknells even wartime efforts had not put out this refuse fire apart from this shottle house was a pleasant square house rather old with shrubberies and lawns it ended the lane in a dead end only a fieldpath trekked away to the left  on this particular christmas eve alfred bricknell had only two of his children at home of the others one daughter was unhappily married and away in india weeping herself thinner another was nursing her babies in streatham jim the hope of the house and julia now married to robert cunningham had come home for christmas  the party was seated in the drawingroom that the grownup daughters had made very fine during their periods of courtship its walls were hung with fine grey canvas it had a large silvery grey silky carpet and the furniture was covered with dark green silky material into this reticence pieces of futurism omega cushions and vangoghlike pictures exploded their colours such chic would certainly not have been looked for up shottle lane  the old man sat in his high grey armchair very near an enormous coal fire in this house there was no coalrationing the finest coal was arranged to obtain a gigantic glow such as a coalowner may well enjoy a great intense mass of pure red fire at this fire alfred bricknell toasted his tan lambswoollined slippers  he was a large man wearing a loose grey suit and sprawling in the large grey armchair the soft lamplight fell on his clean bald michaelangelo head across which a few pure hairs glittered his chin was sunk on his breast so that his sparse but stronghaired white beard in which every strand stood distinct like spun glass lithe and elastic curved now upwards and inwards in a curious curve returning upon him he seemed to be sunk in stern prophetlike meditation as a matter of fact he was asleep after a heavy meal  across seated on a pouffe on the other side of the fire was a cameolike girl with neat black hair done tight and bright in the french mode she had strangelydrawn eyebrows and her colour was brilliant she was hot leaning back behind the shaft of old marble of the mantelpiece to escape the fire she wore a simple dress of applegreen satin with full sleeves and ample skirt and a tiny bodice of green cloth this was josephine ford the girl jim was engaged to  jim bricknell himself was a tall big fellow of thirtyeight he sat in a chair in front of the fire some distance back and stretched his long legs far in front of him his chin too was sunk on his breast his young forehead was bald and raised in odd wrinkles he had a silent halfgrin on his face a little tipsy a little satyrlike his small moustache was reddish  behind him a round table was covered with cigarettes sweets and bottles it was evident jim bricknell drank beer for choice he wanted to get fatthat was his idea but he couldnt bring it off he was thin though not too thin except to his own thinking  his sister julia was bunched up in a low chair between him and his father she too was a tall stag of a thing but she sat bunched up like a witch she wore a winepurple dress her arms seemed to poke out of the sleeves and she had dragged her brown hair into straight untidy strands yet she had real beauty she was talking to the young man who was not her husband a fair pale fattish young fellow in pincenez and dark clothes this was cyril scott a friend  the only other person stood at the round table pouring out red wine he was a fresh stoutish young englishman in khaki julias husband robert cunningham a lieutenant about to be demobilised when he would become a sculptor once more he drank red wine in large throatfuls and his eyes grew a little moist the room was hot and subdued everyone was silent  i say said robert suddenly from the rearanybody have a drink dont you find it rather hot  is there another bottle of beer there said jim without moving too settled even to stir an eyelid  yesi think there is said robert  thanksdont open it yet murmured jim  have a drink josephine said robert  no thank you said josephine bowing slightly  finding the drinks did not go robert went round with the cigarettes josephine ford looked at the white rolls  thank you she said and taking one suddenly licked her rather full dry red lips with the rapid tip of her tongue it was an odd movement suggesting a snakes flicker she put her cigarette between her lips and waited her movements were very quiet and well bred but perhaps too quiet they had the dangerous impassivity of the bohemian parisian or american rather than english  cigarette julia said robert to his wife  she seemed to start or twitch as if dazed then she looked up at her husband with a queer smile puckering the corners of her eyes he looked at the cigarettes not at her his face had the blunt voluptuous gravity of a young lion a great cat she kept him standing for some moments impassively then suddenly she hung her long delicate fingers over the box in doubt and spasmodically jabbed at the cigarettes clumsily raking one out at last  thank you dearthank you she cried rather high looking up and smiling once more he turned calmly aside offering the cigarettes to scott who refused  oh said julia sucking the end of her cigarette robert is so happy with all the good thingsarent you dear she sang breaking into a hurried laugh we arent used to such luxurious living we arentare we dearno were not such swells as this were not oh robbie isnt it all right isnt it just all right she tailed off into her hurried wild repeated laugh were so happy in a land of plenty arent we dear  do you mean im greedy julia said robert  greedyoh greedyhe asks if hes greedyno youre not greedy robbie youre not greedy i want you to be happy  im quite happy he returned  oh hes happyreallyhes happy oh what an accomplishment oh my word julia puckered her eyes and laughed herself into a nervous twitching silence  robert went round with the matches julia sucked her cigarette  give us a light robbie if you are happy she cried  its coming he answered  josephine smoked with short sharp puffs julia sucked wildly at her light robert returned to his red wine jim bricknell suddenly roused up looked round on the company smiling a little vacuously and showing his odd pointed teeth  wheres the beer he asked in deep tones smiling full into josephines face as if she were going to produce it by some sleight of hand then he wheeled round to the table and was soon pouring beer down his throat as down a pipe then he dropped supine again cyril scott was silently absorbing gin and water  i say said jim from the remote depths of his sprawling isnt there something we could do to while the time away  everybody suddenly laughedit sounded so remote and absurd  what play bridge or poker or something conventional of that sort said josephine in her distinct voice speaking to him as if he were a child  oh damn bridge said jim in his sleepvoice then he began pulling his powerful length together he sat on the edge of his chairseat leaning forward peering into all the faces and grinning  dont look at me like thatso long said josephine in her selfcontained voice you make me uncomfortable she gave an odd little grunt of a laugh and the tip of her tongue went over her lips as she glanced sharply half furtively round the room  i like looking at you said jim his smile becoming more malicious  but you shouldnt when i tell you not she returned  jim twisted round to look at the state of the bottles the father also came awake he sat up  isnt it time he said that you all put away your glasses and cigarettes and thought of bed  jim rolled slowly round towards his father sprawling in the long chair  ah dad he said tonights the night tonights some night dadyou can sleep any time his grin widenedbut there arent many nights to sit herelike thiseh  he was looking up all the time into the face of his father full and nakedly lifting his face to the face of his father and smiling fixedly the father who was perfectly sober except for the contagion from the young people felt a wild tremor go through his heart as he gazed on the face of his boy he rose stiffly  you want to stay he said you want to staywell thenwell then ill leave you but dont be long the old man rose to his full height rather majestic the four younger people also rose respectfullyonly jim lay still prostrate in his chair twisting up his face towards his father  you wont stay long said the old man looking round a little bewildered he was seeking a responsible eye josephine was the only one who had any feeling for him  no we wont stay long mr bricknell she said gravely  good night dad said jim as his father left the room  josephine went to the window she had rather a stiff poupee walk  how is the night she said as if to change the whole feeling in the room she pushed back the thick greysilk curtains why she exclaimed what is that light burning a red light  oh thats only the pitbank on fire said robert who had followed her  how strangewhy is it burning now  it always burns unfortunatelyit is most consistent at it it is the refuse from the mines it has been burning for years in spite of all efforts to the contrary  how very curious may we look at it josephine now turned the handle of the french windows and stepped out  beautiful they heard her voice exclaim from outside  in the room julia laid her hand gently protectively over the hand of cyril scott  josephine and robert are admiring the night together she said smiling with subtle tenderness to him  naturally young people always do these romantic things replied cyril scott he was twentytwo years old so he could afford to be cynical  do theydont you think its nice of them she said gently removing her hand from his his eyes were shining with pleasure  i do i envy them enormously one only needs to be sufficiently naive he said  one does doesnt one cooed julia  i say do you hear the bells said robert poking his head into the room  no dear do you replied julia  bells hear the bells bells exclaimed the halftipsy and selfconscious jim and he rolled in his chair in an explosion of sudden silent laughter showing his mouthful of pointed teeth like a dog then he gradually gathered himself together found his feet smiling fixedly  pretty cool night he said aloud when he felt the air on his almost bald head the darkness smelt of sulphur  josephine and robert had moved out of sight julia was abstracted following them with her eyes with almost supernatural keenness she seemed to catch their voices from the distance  yes josephine wouldnt that be awfully romanticshe suddenly called shrilly  the pair in the distance started  what they heard josephines sharp exclamation  whats thatwhat would be romantic said jim as he lurched up and caught hold of cyril scotts arm  josephine wants to make a great illumination of the grounds of the estate said julia magniloquent  nonoi didnt say it remonstrated josephine  what josephine said explained robert was simply that it would be pretty to put candles on one of the growing trees instead of having a christmastree indoors  oh josephine how sweet of you cried julia  cyril scott giggled  good egg champion idea josey my lass eh what cried jim why not carry it outeh why not most attractive he leaned forward over josephine and grinned  oh no expostulated josephine it all sounds so silly now no let us go indoors and go to bed  no josephine dearno its a lovely idea cried julia lets get candles and lanterns and things  lets grinned jim lets everybodylets  shall we really asked robert shall we illuminate one of the firtrees by the lawn  yes how lovely cried julia ill fetch the candles  the women must put on warm cloaks said robert  they trooped indoors for coats and wraps and candles and lanterns then lighted by a bicycle lamp they trooped off to the shed to twist wire round the candles for holders they clustered round the bench  i say said julia doesnt cyril look like a pilot on a stormy night oh i say and she went into one of her hurried laughs  they all looked at cyril scott who was standing sheepishly in the background in a very large overcoat smoking a large pipe the young man was uncomfortable but assumed a stoic air of philosophic indifference  soon they were busy round a prickly firtree at the end of the lawn jim stood in the background vaguely staring the bicycle lamp sent a beam of strong white light deep into the uncanny foliage heads clustered and hands worked the night above was silent dim there was no wind in the near distance they could hear the panting of some engine at the colliery  shall we light them as we fix them asked robert or save them for one grand rocket at the end  oh as we do them said cyril scott who had lacerated his fingers and wanted to see some reward  a match spluttered one naked little flame sprang alight among the dark foliage the candle burned tremulously naked they all were silent  we ought to do a ritual dance we ought to worship the tree sang julia in her high voice  hold on a minute well have a little more illumination said robert  why yes we want more than one candle said josephine  but julia had dropped the cloak in which she was huddled and with arms slung asunder was sliding waving crouching in a pas seul before the tree looking like an animated bough herself  jim who was hugging his pipe in the background broke into a short harsh cackling laugh  arent we fools he cried what oh gods love arent we fools  nowhy cried josephine amused but resentful  but jim vouchsafed nothing further only stood like a red indian gripping his pipe  the beam of the bicyclelamp moved and fell upon the hands and faces of the young people and penetrated the recesses of the secret trees several little tongues of flame clipped sensitive and ruddy on the naked air sending a faint glow over the needle foliage they gave a strange perpendicular aspiration in the night julia waved slowly in her tree dance jim stood apart with his legs straddled a motionless figure  the party round the tree became absorbed and excited as more ruddy tongues of flame pricked upward from the dark tree pale candles became evident the air was luminous the illumination was becoming complete harmonious  josephine suddenly looked round  whyyy came her long note of alarm  a man in a bowler hat and a black overcoat stood on the edge of the twilight  what is it cried julia  homo sapiens said robert the lieutenant hand the light cyril he played the beam of light full on the intruder a man in a bowler hat with a black overcoat buttoned to his throat a pale dazed blinking face the hat was tilted at a slightly jaunty angle over the left eye the man was wellfeatured he did not speak  did you want anything asked robert from behind the light  aaron sisson blinked trying to see who addressed him to him they were all illusory he did not answer  anything you wanted repeated robert military rather peremptory  jim suddenly doubled himself up and burst into a loud harsh cackle of laughter whoop he went and doubled himself up with laughter whoop whoop he went and fell on the ground and writhed with laughter he was in that state of intoxication when he could find no release from maddening selfconsciousness he knew what he was doing he did it deliberately and yet he was also beside himself in a sort of hysterics he could not help himself in exasperated selfconsciousness  the others all began to laugh unavoidably it was a contagion they laughed helplessly and foolishly only robert was anxious  im afraid hell wake the house he said looking at the doubled up figure of jim writhing on the grass and whooping loudly  or not enough put in cyril scott he twigged jims condition  nono cried josephine weak with laughing in spite of herself noits too longim like to die laughing  jim embraced the earth in his convulsions even robert shook quite weakly with laughter his face was red his eyes full of dancing water yet he managed to articulate  i say you know youll bring the old man down then he went off again into spasms  hu hu whooped jim subsiding hu  he rolled over on to his back and lay silent the others also became weakly silent  whats amiss said aaron sisson breaking this spell  they all began to laugh again except jim who lay on his back looking up at the strange sky  whatre you laughing at repeated aaron  were laughing at the man on the ground replied josephine i think hes drunk a little too much  ay said aaron standing mute and obstinate  did you want anything robert enquired once more  eh aaron looked up me no not me a sort of inertia kept him rooted the young people looked at one another and began to laugh rather embarrassed  another said cyril scott cynically  they wished he would go away there was a pause  what do you reckon stars are asked the sepulchral voice of jim he still lay flat on his back on the grass  josephine went to him and pulled at his coat  get up she said youll take cold get up now were going indoors  what do you reckon stars are he persisted  aaron sisson stood on the edge of the light smilingly staring at the scene like a boy out of his place but stubbornly keeping his ground  get up now said josephine weve had enough but jim would not move  robert went with the bicycle lamp and stood at aarons side  shall i show you a light to the roadyoure off your track he said youre in the grounds of shottle house  i can find my road said aaron thank you  jim suddenly got up and went to peer at the stranger poking his face close to aarons face  righto he replied youre not half a bad sort of chapcheeryo whats your drink  minewhiskey said aaron  come in and have one were the only sober couple in the bunchwhat cried jim  aaron stood unmoving static in everything jim took him by the arm affectionately the stranger looked at the flickering tree with its tiers of lights  a christmas tree he said jerking his head and smiling  thats right old man said jim seeming thoroughly sober now come indoors and have a drink  aaron sisson negatively allowed himself to be led off the others followed in silence leaving the tree to flicker the night through the stranger stumbled at the open windowdoor  mind the step said jim affectionately  they crowded to the fire which was still hot the newcomer looked round vaguely jim took his bowler hat and gave him a chair he sat without looking round a remote abstract look on his face he was very pale and seemedinwardly absorbed  the party threw off their wraps and sat around josephine turned to aaron sisson who sat with a glass of whiskey in his hand rather slack in his chair in his thickish overcoat he did not want to drink his hair was blond quite tidy his mouth and chin handsome but a little obstinate his eyes inscrutable his pallor was not natural to him though he kept the appearance of a smile underneath he was hard and opposed he did not wish to be with these people and yet mechanically he stayed  do you feel quite well josephine asked him  he looked at her quickly  me he said he smiled faintly yes im all right then he dropped his head again and seemed oblivious  tell us your name said jim affectionately  the stranger looked up  my names aaron sisson if its anything to you he said  jim began to grin  its a name i dont know he said then he named all the party present but the stranger hardly heeded though his eyes looked curiously from one to the other slow shrewd clairvoyant  were you on your way home asked robert huffy  the stranger lifted his head and looked at him  home he repeated no the other road he indicated the direction with his head and smiled faintly  beldover inquired robert  yes  he had dropped his head again as if he did not want to look at them  to josephine the pale impassive blankseeming face the blue eyes with the smile which wasnt a smile and the continual dropping of the wellshaped head was curiously affecting she wanted to cry  are you a miner robert asked de haute en bas  no cried josephine she had looked at his hands  mens checkweighman replied aaron he had emptied his glass he put it on the table  have another said jim who was attending fixedly with curious absorption to the stranger  no cried josephine no more  aaron looked at jim then at her and smiled slowly with remote bitterness then he lowered his head again his hands were loosely clasped between his knees  what about the wife said robertthe young lieutenant  what about the wife and kiddies youre a married man arent you  the sardonic look of the stranger rested on the subaltern  yes he said  wont they be expecting you said robert trying to keep his temper and his tone of authority  i expect they will  then youd better be getting along hadnt you  the eyes of the intruder rested all the time on the flushed subaltern the look on aarons face became slowly satirical  oh dry up the army touch said jim contemptuously to robert were all civvies here were all right arent we he said loudly turning to the stranger with a grin that showed his pointed teeth  aaron gave a brief laugh of acknowledgement  how many children have you sang julia from her distance  three  girls or boys  girls  all girls dear little things how old  oldest eightyoungest nine months  so small sang julia with real tenderness nowaaron dropped his head but youre going home to them arent you said josephine in whose eyes the tears had already risen he looked up at her at her tears his face had the same pale perverse smile  not tonight he said  but why youre wrong cried josephine  he dropped his head and became oblivious  well said cyril scott rising at last with a bored exclamation i think ill retire  will you said julia also rising youll find your candle outside  she went out scott bade good night and followed her the four people remained in the room quite silent then robert rose and began to walk about agitated  dont you go back to em have a night out you stop here tonight jim said suddenly in a quiet intimate tone  the stranger turned his head and looked at him considering  yes he said he seemed to be smiling coldly  oh but cried josephine your wife and your children wont they be awfully bothered isnt it awfully unkind to them  she rose in her eagerness he sat turning up his face to her she could not understand his expression  wont you go home to them she said hysterical  not tonight he replied quietly again smiling  youre wrong she cried youre wrong and so she hurried out of the room in tears  erwhat bed do you propose to put him in asked robert rather officerlike  dont propose at all my lad replied jim ironicallyhe did not like robert then to the stranger he said  youll be all right on the couch in my roomits a good couch big enough plenty of rugs his voice was easy and intimate  aaron looked at him and nodded  they had another drink each and at last the two set off rather stumbling upstairs aaron carried his bowler hat with him  robert remained pacing in the drawingroom for some time then he went out to return in a little while he extinguished the lamps and saw that the fire was safe then he went to fasten the windowdoors securely outside he saw the uncanny glimmer of candles across the lawn he had half a mind to go out and extinguish thembut he did not so he went upstairs and the house was quiet faint crumbs of snow were falling outside  when jim woke in the morning aaron had gone only on the floor were two packets of christmastree candles fallen from the strangers pockets he had gone through the drawingroom door as he had come the housemaid said that while she was cleaning the grate in the diningroom she heard someone go into the drawingroom a parlourmaid had even seen someone come out of jims bedroom but they had both thought it was jim himself for he was an unsettled house mate  there was a thin film of snow a lovely christmas morning     chapter iv the pillar of salt   our story will not yet see daylight a few days after christmas aaron sat in the open shed at the bottom of his own garden looking out on the rainy darkness no one knew he was there it was some time after six in the evening  from where he sat he looked straight up the garden to the house the blind was not drawn in the middle kitchen he could see the figures of his wife and one child there was a light also in the upstairs window his wife was gone upstairs again he wondered if she had the baby ill he could see her figure vaguely behind the lace curtains of the bedroom it was like looking at his home through the wrong end of a telescope now the little girls had gone from the middle room only to return in a moment  his attention strayed he watched the light falling from the window of the nextdoor house uneasily he looked along the whole range of houses the street sloped downhill and the backs were open to the fields so he saw a curious succession of lighted windows between which jutted the intermediary back premises scullery and outhouse in dark little blocks it was something like the keyboard of a piano more still like a succession of musical notes for the rectangular planes of light were of different intensities some bright and keen some soft warm like candlelight and there was one surface of pure red light one or two were almost invisible dark green so the long scale of lights seemed to trill across the darkness now bright now dim swelling and sinking the effect was strange  and thus the whole private life of the street was threaded in lights there was a sense of indecent exposure from so many backs he felt himself almost in physical contact with this contiguous stretch of back premises he heard the familiar sound of water gushing from the sink in to the grate the dropping of a pail outside the door the clink of a coal shovel the banging of a door the sound of voices so many houses cheek by jowl so many squirming lives so many back yards back doors giving on to the night it was revolting  away in the street itself a boy was calling the newspaper ning post ning poost it was a long melancholy howl and seemed to epitomise the whole of the dark wet secretive thicklyinhabited night a figure passed the window of aarons own house entered and stood inside the room talking to mrs sisson it was a young woman in a brown mackintosh and a black hat she stood under the incandescent light and her hat nearly knocked the globe next door a man had run out in his shirt sleeves this time a young darkheaded collier running to the gate for a newspaper running bareheaded coatless slippered in the rain he had got his newssheet and was returning and just at that moment the young mans wife came out shading her candle with a lading tin she was going to the coalhouse for some coal her husband passed her on the threshold she could be heard breaking the bits of coal and placing them on the dustpan the light from her candle fell faintly behind her then she went back blown by a swirl of wind but again she was at the door hastily standing her iron shovel against the wall then she shut the back door with a bang these noises seemed to scrape and strike the night  in aarons own house the young person was still talking to mrs sisson millicent came out sheltering a candle with her hand the candle blew out she ran indoors and emerged again her white pinafore fluttering this time she performed her little journey safely he could see the faint glimmer of her candle emerging secretly from the closet  the young person was taking her leave he could hear her sympatheticwellgood night i hope shell be no worse good night mrs sisson she was gonehe heard the windy bang of the streetgate presently millicent emerged again flitting indoors  so he rose to his feet balancing swaying a little before he started into motion as so many colliers do then he moved along the path towards the house in the rain and darkness very slowly edging forwards  suddenly the door opened his wife emerged with a pail he stepped quietly aside on to his side garden among the sweet herbs he could smell rosemary and sage and hyssop a low wall divided his garden from his neighbours he put his hand on it on its wetness ready to drop over should his wife come forward but she only threw the contents of her pail on the garden and retired again she might have seen him had she looked he remained standing where he was listening to the trickle of rain in the waterbutt the hollow countryside lay beyond him sometimes in the windy darkness he could see the red burn of new brunswick bank or the brilliant jewels of light clustered at bestwood colliery away in the dark hollow nearer the glare of the electric powerstation disturbed the night so again the wind swirled the rain across all these hieroglyphs of the countryside familiar to him as his own breast  a motorcar was labouring up the hill his trained ear attended to it unconsciously it stopped with a jar there was a bang of the yardgate a shortish dark figure in a bowler hat passed the window millicent was drawing down the blind it was the doctor the blind was drawn he could see no more  stealthily he began to approach the house he stood by the climbing rose of the porch listening he heard voices upstairs perhaps the children would be downstairs he listened intently voices were upstairs only he quietly opened the door the room was empty save for the baby who was cooing in her cradle he crossed to the hall at the foot of the stairs he could hear the voice of the indian doctor now little girl you must just keep still and warm in bed and not cry for the moon he said de moon just as evermarjory must be ill  so aaron quietly entered the parlour it was a cold clammy room dark he could hear footsteps passing outside on the asphalt pavement below the window and the wind howling with familiar cadence he began feeling for something in the darkness of the musicrack beside the piano he touched and felthe could not find what he wanted perplexed he turned and looked out of the window through the iron railing of the front wall he could see the little motorcar sending its straight beams of light in front of it up the street  he sat down on the sofa by the window the energy had suddenly left all his limbs he sat with his head sunk listening the familiar room the familiar voice of his wife and his childrenhe felt weak as if he were dying he felt weak like a drowning man who acquiesces in the waters his strength was gone he was sinking back he would sink back to it all float henceforth like a drowned man  so he heard voices coming nearer from upstairs feet moving they were coming down  no mrs sisson you neednt worry he heard the voice of the doctor on the stairs if she goes on as she is shell be all right only she must be kept warm and quietwarm and quietthats the chief thing  oh when she has those bouts i cant bear it aaron heard his wifes voice  they were downstairs their feet clickclicked on the tiled passage they had gone into the middle room aaron sat and listened  she wont have any more bouts if she does give her a few drops from the little bottle and raise her up but she wont have any more the doctor said  if she does i sll go off my head i know i shall  no you wont no you wont do anything of the sort you wont go off your head youll keep your head on your shoulders where it ought

thinking of you as much as of her  but i cant bear itall alone this was the beginning of tears there was a dead silencethen a sound of millicent weeping with her mother as a matter of fact the doctor was weeping too for he was an emotional sympathetic soul over forty  never mindnever mindyou arent alone came the doctors matteroffact voice after a loud noseblowing i am here to help you i will do whatever i canwhatever i can  i cant bear it i cant bear it wept the woman  another silence another noseblowing and again the doctor  youll have to bear iti tell you theres nothing else for it youll

added  i had a lettersobsfrom the bank this morning  from de bank  telling me they were sending me so much per month from him as an allowance and that he was quite well but he was travelling  well then why not let him travel you can live  but to leave me alone there was burning indignation in her voice to go off and leave me with every responsibility to leave me with all the burden  well i wouldnt trouble about him arent you better off without him  i am i am she cried fiercely when i got that letter this morning i said may evil befall you you selfish demon and i hope it may   wellwell

wellwell never mind you will be all right dont you bother your hair is beautiful anyhow  what makes me so mad is that he should go off like thatnever a wordcoolly takes his hook i could kill him for it  were you ever happy together  we were all right at first i know i was fond of him but hed kill anythinghe kept himself back always kept himself back couldnt give himself  there was a pause  ah well sighed the doctor marriage is a mystery im glad im not entangled in it  yes to make some womans life a miseryim sure it was death to live with him he seemed to kill everything off inside you he was a man you couldnt quarrel with and get it over quietquiet in his tempers and selfish through and through ive lived with him twelve yearsi know what it is killing you dont know what he was  i think i knew him a fair man yes said the doctor  fair to look attheres a photograph of him in the parlourtaken when he was marriedand one of meyes hes fairhaired  aaron guessed that she was getting a candle to come into the parlour he was tempted to wait and meet themand accept it all again devilishly tempted he was then he thought of her voice and his heart went cold quick as thought he obeyed his first impulse he felt behind the couch on the floor where the curtains fell yesthe bag was there he took it at once in the next breath he stepped out of the room and tiptoed into the passage he retreated to the far end near the street door and stood behind the coats that hung on the hallstand  at that moment his wife came into the passage holding a candle she was redeyed with weeping and looked frail  did you leave the parlour door open she asked of millicent suspiciously  no said millicent from the kitchen  the doctor with his soft oriental tread followed mrs sisson into the parlour aaron saw his wife hold up the candle before his portrait and begin to weep but he knew her the doctor laid his hand softly on her arm and left it there sympathetically nor did he remove it when millicent stole into the room looking very woebegone and important the wife wept silently and the child joined in  yes i know him said the doctor if he thinks he will be happier when hes gone away you must be happier too mrs sisson thats all dont let him triumph over you by making you miserable you enjoy yourself as well youre only a girl  but a tear came from his eye and he blew his nose vigorously on a large white silk handkerchief and began to polish his pince nez then he turned and they all bundled out of the room  the doctor took his departure mrs sisson went almost immediately upstairs and millicent shortly crept after her then aaron who had stood motionless as if turned to a pillar of salt went quietly down the passage and into the living room his face was very pale ghastlylooking he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror over the mantel as he passed and felt weak as if he were really a criminal but his heart did not relax nevertheless so he hurried into the night down the garden climbed the fence into the field and went away across the field in the rain towards the highroad  he felt sick in every fibre he almost hated the little handbag he carried which held his flute and piccolo it seemed a burden just thena millstone round his neck he hated the scene he had leftand he hated the hard inviolable heart that stuck unchanging in his own breast  coming to the highroad he saw a tall luminous tramcar roving along through the rain the trams ran across country from town to town he dared not board because people knew him so he took a side road and walked in a detour for two miles then he came out on the highroad again and waited for a tramcar the rain blew on his face he waited a long time for the last car     chapter v at the opera   a friend had given josephine ford a box at the opera for one evening our story continues by night the box was large and important near the stage josephine and julia were there with robert and jimalso two more men the women sat in the front of the box conspicuously they were both poor they were rather excited but they belonged to a set which looked on social triumphs as a downfall that one allows oneself the two men lilly and struthers were artists the former literary the latter a painter lilly sat by josephine in the front of the box he was her little lion of the evening  few women can sit in the front of a big box on a crowded and fullswing opera night without thrilling and dilating there is an intoxication in being thus thrust forward conspicuous and enhanced right in the eye of the vast crowd that lines the hollow shell of the auditorium thus even josephine and julia leaned their elbows and poised their heads regally looking condescendingly down upon the watchful world they were two poor women having nothing to do with society half bohemians  josephine was an artist in paris she was a friend of a very fashionable dressmaker and decorator master of modern elegance sometimes she designed dresses for him and sometimes she accepted from him a commission to decorate a room usually at her last sou it gave her pleasure to dispose of costly and exquisite things for other people and then be rid of them  this evening her dress was a simple but a marvellously poised thing of black and silver in the words of the correct journal with her tight black bright hair her arched brows her duskyruddy face and her bare shoulders her strange equanimity her long slow slanting looks she looked foreign and frightening clear as a cameo but dark far off julia was the english beauty in a lovely blue dress her hair was becomingly untidy on her low brow her dark blue eyes wandered and got excited her nervous mouth twitched her highpitched singsong voice and her hurried laugh could be heard in the theatre she twisted a beautiful little fan that a dead artist had given her  not being fashionable they were in the box when the overture began the opera was verdiaida if it is impossible to be in an important box at the opera without experiencing the strange intoxication of social preeminence it is just as impossible to be there without some feeling of horror at the sight the stage presents  josephine leaned her elbow and looked down she knew how arresting that proud rather stiff bend of her head was she had some aboriginal american in her blood but as she looked she pursed her mouth the artist in her forgot everything she was filled with disgust the sham egypt of aida hid from her nothing of its shame the singers were all colourwashed deliberately colourwashed to a bright orange tint the men had oblong dabs of black wool under their lower lip the beard of the mighty pharaohs this oblong dab shook and wagged to the singing  the vulgar bodies of the fleshy women were unendurable they all looked such good meat why were their haunches so prominent it was a question josephine could not solve she scanned their really expensive brilliant clothing it was nearly rightnearly splendid it only lacked that last subtlety which the world always lacks the last final clinching which puts calm into a sea of fabric and yet is the opposite pole to machine fixity  but the leading tenor was the chief pain he was large stout swathed in a cummerbund and looked like a eunuch this fattish emasculated look seems common in stage heroeseven the extremely popular the tenor sang bravely his mouth made a large coffinshaped yawning gap in his orange face his little beard fluttered oddly like a tail he turned up his eyes to josephines box as he sangthat being the regulation direction meanwhile his abdomen shook as he caught his breath the flesh of his fat naked arms swayed  josephine looked down with the fixed gravity of a red indian immovable inscrutable it was not till the scene was ended that she lifted her head as if breaking a spell sent the point of her tongue rapidly over her dried lips and looked round into the box her brown eyes expressed shame fear and disgust a curious grimace went over her facea grimace only to be expressed by the exclamation merde but she was mortally afraid of society and its fixed institutions rapidly she scanned the eyes of her friends in the box she rested on the eyes of lilly a dark ugly man  isnt it nasty she said  you shouldnt look so closely he said but he took it calmly easily whilst she felt floods of burning disgust a longing to destroy it all  ohhoho laughed julia its so funnyso funny  of course we are too near said robert  say you admire that pink fondant over there said struthers indicating with his eyebrows a blond large woman in white satin with pink edging who sat in a box opposite on the upper tier  oh the fondantexactlythe fondant yes i admire her immensely isnt she exactly it sang julia  josephine was scanning the auditorium so many myriads of faceslike beads on a beadwork patternall beadwork in different layers she bowed to various acquaintancesmostly americans in uniform whom she had known in paris she smiled to lady cochrane two boxes offlady cochrane had given her the box but she felt rather coldly towards her  the curtain rose the opera wound its slow length along the audience loved it they cheered with mad enthusiasm josephine looked down on the choppy sea of applause white gloves clapping heads shaking the noise was strange and rattling what a curious multiple object a theatreaudience was it seemed to have a million heads a million hands and one monstrous unnatural consciousness the singers appeared before the curtainthe applause rose up like clouds of dust  oh isnt it too wonderful cried julia i am wild with excitement are you all of you  absolutely wild said lilly laconically  where is scott tonight asked struthers  julia turned to him and gave him a long queer look from her dark blue eyes  hes in the country she said rather enigmatic  dont you know hes got a house down in dorset said robert verbally rushing in he wants julia to go down and stay  is she going said lilly  she hasnt decided replied robert  oh whats the objection asked struthers  well none whatsoever as far as can be seen except that she cant make up her mind replied robert  julias got no mind said jim rudely  oh hear the brotherly verdict laughed julia hurriedly  you mean to go down to dorset alone said struthers  why not replied robert answering for her  and stay how long  ohas long as it lasts said robert again  starting with eternity said lilly and working back to a fortnight  and whats the matterlooks bad in the eyes of the world  yesabout that afraid of compromising herself  lilly looked at them  depends what you take the world to mean do you mean us in this box or the crew outside there he jerked his head towards the auditorium  do you think lilly that were the world said robert ironically  oh yes i guess were shipwrecked in this box like robinson crusoes and what we do on our own little island matters to us alone as for the infinite crowds of howling savages outside there in the unspeakable all youve got to do is mind they dont scrap you  but wont they said struthers  not unless you put your head in their hands said lilly  i dont know said jim  but the curtain had risen they hushed him into silence  all through the next scene julia puzzled herself as to whether she should go down to the country and live with scott she had carried on a nervous kind of amour with him based on soul sympathy and emotional excitement but whether to go and live with him she didnt know if she wanted to or not and she couldnt for her life find out she was in that nervous state when desire seems to evaporate the moment fulfilment is offered  when the curtain dropped she turned  you see she said screwing up her eyes i have to think of robert she cut the word in two with an odd little hitch in her voicerobert  my dear julia cant you believe that im tired of being thought of cried robert flushing  julia screwed up her eyes in a slow smile oddly cogitating  well who am i to think of she asked  yourself said lilly  oh yes why yes i never thought of that she gave a hurried little laugh but then its no fun to think about oneself she cried flatly i think about robert and scott she screwed up her eyes and peered oddly at the company  which of them will find you the greatest treat said lilly sarcastically  anyhow interjected robert nervously it will be something new for scott  stale buns for you old boy said jim drily  i dont say so but exclaimed the flushed fullblooded robert who was nothing if not courteous to women  how long ha you been married eh asked jim  six years sang julia sweetly  good god  you see said robert julia cant decide anything for herself she waits for someone else to decide then she puts her spoke in  put it plainly began struthers  but dont you know its no use putting it plainly cried julia  but do you want to be with scott out and out or dont you said lilly  exactly chimed robert thats the question for you to answer julia  i wont answer it she cried why should i and she looked away into the restless hive of the theatre she spoke so wildly that she attracted attention but it half pleased her she stared abstractedly down at the pit  the men looked at one another in some comic consternation  oh damn it all said the long jim rising and stretching himself shes dead nuts on scott shes all over him shed have eloped with him weeks ago if it hadnt been so easy she cant stand it that robert offers to hand her into the taxi  he gave his malevolent grin round the company then went out he did not reappear for the next scene  of course if she loves scott began struthers  julia suddenly turned with wild desperation and cried  i like him tremendouslytremendously he does understand  which we dont said robert  julia smiled her long odd smile in their faces one might almost say she smiled in their teeth  what do you think josephine asked lilly  josephine was leaning froward she started her tongue went rapidly over her lips who i she exclaimed  yes  i think julia should go with scott said josephine shell bother with the idea till shes done it she loves him really  of course she does cried robert  julia with her chin resting on her arms in a position which irritated the neighbouring lady cochrane sincerely was gazing with unseeing eyes down upon the stalls  well then began struthers but the music struck up softly they were all rather bored struthers kept on making small half audible remarkswhich was bad form and displeased josephine the hostess of the evening  when the curtain came down for the end of the act the men got up lillys wife tanny suddenly appeared she had come on after a dinner engagement  would you like tea or anything lilly asked  the women refused the men filtered out on to the crimson and white curving corridor julia josephine and tanny remained in the box tanny was soon hitched on to the conversation in hand  of course she replied one cant decide such a thing like drinking a cup of tea  of course one cant dear tanny said julia  after all one doesnt leave ones husband every day to go and live with another man even if one looks on it as an experiment  its difficult cried julia its difficult i feel they all want to force me to decide its cruel  oh men with their beastly logic their eitherthisorthat stunt they are an awful borebut of course robert cant love you really or hed want to keep you i can see lilly discussing such a thing for me but then you dont love robert either said tanny  i do oh i do tanny i do love him i love him dearly i think hes beautiful roberts beautiful and he needs me and i need him too i need his support yes i do love him  but you like scott better said tanny  only because hehes different sang julia in long tones you see scott has his art his art matters and robertrobert is a dilettante dont you thinkhes dilettante she screwed up her eyes at tanny tanny cogitated  of course i dont think that matters she replied  but it does it matters tremendously dear tanny tremendously  of course tanny sheered off i can see scott has great attractionsa great warmth somewhere  exactly cried julia he understands  and i believe hes a real artist you might even work together you might write his librettos  yesyes julia spoke with a long pondering hiss  it might be awfully nice said tanny rapturously  yesit mightit might pondered julia suddenly she gave herself a shake then she laughed hurriedly as if breaking from her line of thought  and wouldnt robert be an awfully nice lover for josephine oh wouldnt that be splendid she cried with her high laugh  josephine who had been gazing down into the orchestra turned now flushing darkly  but i dont want a lover julia she said hurt  josephine dear dear old josephine dont you really oh yes you doi want one so badly cried julia with her shaking laugh roberts awfully good to me but weve been married six years and it does make a difference doesnt it tanny dear  a great difference said tanny  yes it makes a difference it makes a difference mused julia dear old roberti wouldnt hurt him for worlds i wouldnt do you think it would hurt robert  she screwed up her eyes looking at tanny  perhaps it would do robert good to be hurt a little said tanny hes so wellnourished  yesyesi see what you mean tannypoor old robert oh poor old robert hes so young  he does seem young said tanny one doesnt forgive it  he is young said julia im five years older than he hes only twentyseven poor old robert  robert is young and inexperienced said josephine suddenly turning with anger but i dont know why you talk about him  is he inexperienced josephine dear is he sang julia josephine flushed darkly and turned away  ah hes not so innocent as all that said tanny roughly those young young men who seem so fresh theyre deep enough really theyre far less innocent really than men who are experienced  they are arent they tanny repeated julia softly theyre oldolder than the old man of the seas sometimes arent they incredibly old like little boys who know too mucharent they yes she spoke quietly seriously as if it had struck her  below the orchestra was coming in josephine was watching closely julia became aware of this  do you see anybody we know josephine she asked  josephine started  no she said looking at her friends quickly and furtively  dear old josephine she knows all sorts of people sang julia  at that moment the men returned  have you actually come back exclaimed tanny to them they sat down without answering jim spread himself as far as he could in the narrow space he stared upwards wrinkling his ugly queer face it was evident he was in one of his moods  if only somebody loved me he complained if only somebody loved me i should be all right im going to pieces he sat up and peered into the faces of the women  but we all love you said josephine laughing uneasily why arent you satisfied  im not satisfied im not satisfied murmured jim  would you like to be wrapped in swaddling bands and laid at the breast asked lilly disagreeably  jim opened his mouth in a grin and gazed long and malevolently at his questioner  yes he said then he sprawled his long six foot of limb and body across the box again  you should try loving somebody for a change said tanny youve been loved too often why not try and love somebody  jim eyed her narrowly  i couldnt love you he said in vicious tones  a la bonne heure said tanny  but jim sank his chin on his chest and repeated obstinately  i want to be loved  how many times have you been loved robert asked him it would be rather interesting to know  jim looked at robert long and slow but did not answer  did you ever keep count tanny persisted  jim looked up at her malevolent  i believe i did he replied  forty is the age when a man should begin to reckon up said lilly  jim suddenly sprang to his feet and brandished his fists  ill pitch the lot of you over the bloody rail he said  he glared at them from under his bald wrinkled forehead josephine glanced round she had become a dusky white colour she was afraid of him and she disliked him intensely nowadays  do you recognise anyone in the orchestra she asked  the party in the box had become dead silent they looked down the conductor was at his stand the music began they all remained silent and motionless during the next scene each thinking his own thoughts jim was uncomfortable he wanted to make good he sat with his elbows on his knees grinning slightly looking down at the next interval he stood up suddenly  it is the chapwhat he exclaimed excitedly looking round at his friends  who said tanny  it is he said josephine quietly meeting jims eye  sure he barked  he was leaning forward over the ledge rattling a programme in his hand as if trying to attract attention then he made signals  there you are he exclaimed triumphantly thats the chap  who who they cried  but neither jim nor josephine would vouchsafe an answer  the next was the long interval jim and josephine gazed down at the orchestra the musicians were laying aside their instruments and rising the ugly firecurtain began slowly to descend jim suddenly bolted out  is it that man aaron sisson asked robert  where where cried julia it cant be  but josephines face was closed and silent she did not answer  the whole party moved out on to the crimsoncarpeted gangway groups of people stood about chatting men and women were passing along to pay visits or to find drinks josephines party stared around talking desultorily and at length they perceived jim stalking along leading aaron sisson by the arm jim was grinning the flautist looked unwilling he had a comely appearance in his white shirta certain comely blondness and repose and as much a gentleman as anybody  well cried josephine to him how do you come here  i play the flute he answered as he shook hands  the little crowd stood in the gangway and talked  how wonderful of you to be here cried julia  he laughed  do you think so he answered  yes i doit seems so far from shottle house and christmas eveoh wasnt it exciting cried julia  aaron looked at her but did not answer  weve heard all about you said tanny playfully  oh yes he replied  come said josephine rather irritated we crowd up the gangway and she led the way inside the box  aaron stood and looked down at the dishevelled theatre  you get all the view he said  we do dont we cried julia  more thans good for us said lilly  tell us what you are doing youve got a permanent job asked josephine  yesat present  ah its more interesting for you than at beldover  she had taken her seat he looked down at her dusky young face her voice was always clear and measured  its a change he said smiling  oh it must be more than that she said why you must feel a whole difference its a whole new life  he smiled as if he were laughing at her silently she flushed  but isnt it she persisted  yes it can be he replied  he looked as if he were quietly amused but dissociated none of the people in the box were quite real to him he was not really amused julia found him dull stupid tanny also was offended that he could not perceive her the men remained practically silent  youre a chap i always hoped would turn up again said jim  oh yes replied aaron smiling as if amused  but perhaps he doesnt like us perhaps hes not glad that we turned up said julia leaving her sting  the flautist turned and looked at her  you cant remember us can you she asked  yes he said i can remember you  oh she laughed you are unflattering  he was annoyed he did not know what she was getting at  how are your wife and children she asked spitefully  all right i think  but youve been back to them cried josephine in dismay  he looked at her a slow half smiling look but did not speak  come and have a drink damn the women said jim uncouthly seizing aaron by the arm and dragging him off     chapter vi talk   the party stayed to the end of the interminable opera they had agreed to wait for aaron he was to come around to the vestibule for them after the show they trooped slowly downstairs into the crush of the entrance hall chattering swirling people red carpet palms green against creamandgilt walls small whirlpools of life at the open dark doorways men in opera hats steering decisively aboutit was the old scene but there were no taxisabsolutely no taxis and it was raining fortunately the women had brought shoes they slipped these on jim rocked through the crowd in his tall hat looking for the flautist  at last aaron was foundwearing a bowler hat julia groaned in spirit josephines brow knitted not that anybody cared really but as one must frown at something why not at the bowler hat acquaintances and elegant young men in uniforms insisted on rushing up and bowing and exchanging a few words either with josephine or jim or julia or lilly they were coldly received the party veered out into the night  the women hugged their wraps about them and set off sharply feeling some repugnance for the wet pavements and the crowd they had not far to goonly to jims rooms in adelphi jim was leading aaron holding him by the arm and slightly pinching his muscles it gave him great satisfaction to have between his fingers the armmuscles of a workingman one of the common people the fons et origo of modern life jim was talking rather vaguely about labour and robert smillie and bolshevism he was all for revolution and the triumph of labour  so they arrived mounted a dark stair and entered a large handsome room one of the adams rooms jim had furnished it from heales with striped hangings green and white and yellow and dark purple and with a greenandblack checked carpet and great stripecovered chairs and chesterfield a big gasfire was soon glowing in the handsome old fireplace the panelled room seemed cosy  while jim was handing round drinks and sandwiches and josephine was making tea robert played bach on the pianothe pianola rather the chairs and lounge were in a halfcircle round the fire the party threw off their wraps and sank deep into this expensive comfort of modern bohemia they needed the bach to take away the bad taste that aida had left in their mouths they needed the whiskey and curacao to rouse their spirits they needed the profound comfort in which to sink away from the world all the men except aaron had been through the war in some way or other but here they were in the old setting exactly the old bohemian routine  the bell rang jim went downstairs he returned shortly with a frail elegant womanfashionable rather than bohemian she was cream and auburn irish with a slightlylifted upper lip that gave her a pathetic look she dropped her wrap and sat down by julia taking her hand delicately  how are you darling she asked  yesim happy said julia giving her odd screwedup smile  the pianola stopped they all chatted indiscriminately jim was watching the newcomermrs browningwith a concentrated wolfish grin  i like her he said at last ive seen her before havent ii like her awfully  yes said josephine with a slight grunt of a laugh he wants to be loved  oh cried clariss so do i  then there you are cried tanny  alas no there we arent cried clariss she was beautiful too with her lifted upperlip we both want to be loved and so we miss each other entirely we run on in two parallel lines that can never meet she laughed low and half sad  doesnt she love you said aaron to jim amused indicating josephine i thought you were engaged  her leered jim vindictively glancing at josephine she doesnt love me  is that true asked robert hastily of josephine  why she said yes why should he make me say out here that i dont love him  got you my girl said jim  then its no engagement said robert  listen to the row fools make rushing in said jim maliciously  no the engagement is broken said josephine  world coming to pieces bit by bit said lilly jim was twisting in his chair and looking like a chinese dragon diabolical the room was uneasy  what gives you such a bellyache for love jim said lilly or for being loved why do you want so badly to be loved  because i like it damn you barked jim because im in need of it  none of them quite knew whether they ought to take it as a joke it was just a bit too real to be quite pleasant  why are you such a baby said lilly there you are six foot in length have been a cavalry officer and fought in two wars and you spend your time crying for somebody to love you youre a comic  am i though said jim im losing life im getting thin  you dont look as if you were losing life said lilly  dont i i am though im dying  what of lack of life  thats about it my young cock lifes leaving me  better sing tostis farewell to it  jim who had been sprawling full length in his armchair the centre of interest of all the company suddenly sprang forward and pushed his face grinning in the face of lilly  youre a funny customer you are he said  then he turned round in his chair and saw clariss sitting at the feet of julia with one white arm over her friends knee jim immediately stuck forward his muzzle and gazed at her clariss had loosened her masses of thick auburn hair so that it hung half free her face was creamy pale her upper lip lifted with odd pathos she had roserubies in her ears  i like her said jim whats her name  mrs browning dont be so rude said josephine  browning for gravies any relation of robert  oh yes you ask my husband came the slow plangent voice of clariss  youve got a husband have you  rather havent i juley  yes said julia vaguely and wispily yes dear you have  and two fine children put in robert  no you dont mean it said jim whos your husband anybody  rather came the deep voice of clariss he sees to that  jim stared grinning showing his pointed teeth reaching nearer and nearer to clariss who in her frail scrap of an evening dress amethyst and silver was sitting still in the deep black hearthrug her arm over julias knee taking very little notice of jim although he amused her  i like you awfully i say he repeated  thanks im sure she said  the others were laughing sprawling in their chairs and sipping curacao and taking a sandwich or a cigarette aaron sisson alone sat upright smiling flickeringly josephine watched him and her pointed tongue went from time to time over her lips  but im sure she broke in this isnt very interesting for the others awfully boring dont be silly all the time jim or we must go home  jim looked at her with narrowed eyes he hated her voice she let her eye rest on his for a moment then she put her cigarette to her lips robert was watching them both  josephine took her cigarette from her lips again  tell us about yourself mr sisson she said how do you like being in london  i like london said aaron  where did he live bloomsbury did he know many people nonobody except a man in the orchestra how had he got his job through an agent etc etc  what do you make of the miners said jim suddenly taking a new line  me said sisson i dont make anything of them  do you think theyll make a stand against the government  what for  nationalisation  they might one day  think theyd fight  fight  yes  aaron sat laughing  what have they to fight for  why everything what havent they to fight for cried josephine fiercely freedom liberty and escape from this vile system wont they fight for that  aaron sat smiling slowly shaking his head  nay he said you mustnt ask me what theyll doive only just left them for good theyll do a lot of cavilling  but wont they act cried josephine  act said aaron how act  why defy the government and take things in their own hands said josephine  they might some time said aaron rather indifferent  i wish they would cried josephine my wouldnt i love it if theyd make a bloody revolution  they were all looking now at her her black brows were twitching in her black and silver dress she looked like a symbol of young disaster  must it be bloody josephine said robert  why yes i dont believe in revolutions that arent bloody said josephine wouldnt i love it id go in front with a red flag  it would be rather fun said tanny  wouldnt it cried josephine  oh josey dear cried julia hysterically isnt she a redhot bolsher i should be frightened  no cried josephine i should love it  so should i said jim in a luscious sort of voice what price machineguns at the end of the strand thats a day to live for what  ha ha laughed clariss with her deep laugh wed all bolsh together id give the cheers  i wouldnt mind getting killed id love it in a real fight said josephine  but josephine said robert dont you think weve had enough of that sort of thing in the war dont you think it all works out rather stupid and unsatisfying  ah but a civil war would be different ive no interest in fighting germans but a civil war would be different  thats a fact it would said jim  only rather worse said robert  no i dont agree cried josephine youd feel you were doing something in a civil war  pulling the house down said lilly  yes she cried dont you hate it the house we live inlondonenglandamerica dont you hate them  i dont like them but i cant get much fire in my hatred they pall on me rather said lilly  ay said aaron suddenly stirring in his chair  lilly and he glanced at one another with a look of recognition  still said tanny theres got to be a clearance some day or other  oh drawled clariss im all for a clearance im all for pulling the house down only while it stands i do want central heating and a good cook  may i come to dinner said jim  oh yes youd find it rather domestic  where do you live  rather far out nowamersham  amersham wheres that  oh its on the map  there was a little lull jim gulped down a drink standing at the sideboard he was a tall fine soldierly figure and his face with its little sandy moustache and bald forehead was odd aaron sisson sat watching him unconsciously  hello you said jim have one  aaron shook his head and jim did not press him it saved the drinks  you believe in love dont you said jim sitting down near aaron and grinning at him  love said aaron  love he says mocked jim grinning at the company  what about it then asked aaron  its life love is life said jim fiercely  its a vice like drink said lilly  eh a vice said jim may be for you old bird  more so still for you said lilly  its life its life reiterated jim dont you agree he turned wolfishly to clariss  oh yesevery time she drawled nonchalant  here lets write it down said lilly he found a blue pencil and printed in large letters on the old creamy marble of the mantelpiece panellove is life  julia suddenly rose and flung her arms asunder wildly  oh i hate love i hate it she protested  jim watched her sardonically  look at her he said look at lesbia who hates love  no but perhaps it is a disease perhaps we are all wrong and we cant love properly put in josephine  have another try said jimi know what love is ive thought about it love is the souls respiration  lets have that down said lilly  love is the souls respiration he printed it on the old mantelpiece  jim eyed the letters  its right he said quite right when you love your soul breathes in if you dont breathe in you suffocate  what about breathing out said robert if you dont breathe out you asphyxiate  right you are mock turtle said jim maliciously  breathing out is a bloody revolution said lilly  youve hit the nail on the head said jim solemnly  lets record it then said lilly and with the blue pencil he printed  when you love your soul breathes in  when your soul breathes out its a bloody revolution  i say jim he said you must be busting yourself trying to breathe in  dont you be too clever ive thought about it said jim when im in love i get a great inrush of energy i actually feel it rush inhere he poked his finger on the pit of his stomach its the souls expansion and if i cant get these rushes of energy im dying and i know i am  he spoke the last words with sudden ferocity and desperation  all i know is said tanny you dont look it  i am i am jim protested im dying lifes leaving me  maybe youre choking with love said robert perhaps you have breathed in so much you dont know how to let it go again perhaps your souls got a crick in it with expanding so much  youre a bloody young sucking pig you are said jim  even at that age ive learned my manners replied robert  jim looked round the party then he turned to aaron sisson  what do you make of em eh he said  aaron shook his head and laughed  me he said  but jim did not wait for an answer  ive had enough said tanny suddenly rising i think youre all silly besides its getting late  she said jim rising and pointing luridly to clariss shes love and hes the working people the hope is these two he jerked a thumb at aaron sisson after having indicated mrs browning  oh how awfully interesting its quite a long time since ive been a personificationi suppose youve never been one before said clariss turning to aaron in conclusion  no i dont think i have he answered  i hope personification is rightought to be allegory or something else this from clariss to robert  or a parable clariss laughed the young lieutenant  goodbye said tanny ive been awfully bored  have you grinned jim goodbye better luck next time  wed better look sharp said robert if we want to get the tube  the party hurried through the rainy narrow streets down to the embankment station robert and julia and clariss were going west lilly and his wife were going to hampstead josephine and aaron sisson were going both to bloomsbury  i suppose said robert on the stairsmr sisson will see you to your door josephine he lives your way  theres no need at all said josephine  the four who were going north went down to the low tube level it was nearly the last train the station was half deserted half rowdy several fellows were drunk shouting and crowing down there in the bowels of london after midnight everything seemed horrible and unnatural  how i hate this london said tanny she was half norwegian and had spent a large part of her life in norway before she married lilly  yes so do i said josephine but if one must earn ones living one must stay here i wish i could get back to paris but theres nothing doing for me in francewhen do you go back into the country both of you  friday said lilly  how lovely for youand when will you go to norway tanny  in about a month said tanny  you must be awfully pleased  ohthankfulthankful to get out of england  i know thats how i feel everything is so awfulso dismal and dreary i find it  they crowded into the train men were still yelling like wild beastsothers were asleepsoldiers were singing  have you really broken your engagement with jim shrilled tanny in a high voice as the train roared  yes hes impossible said josephine perfectly hysterical and impossible  and selfish cried tanny  oh terribly cried josephine  come up to hampstead to lunch with us said lilly to aaron  aythank you said aaron  lilly scribbled directions on a card the hot jaded midnight underground rattled on aaron and josephine got down to change trains     chapter vii the dark square garden   josephine had invited aaron sisson to dinner at a restaurant in soho one sunday evening they had a corner to themselves and with a bottle of burgundy she was getting his history from him  his father had been a shaftsinker earning good money but had been killed by a fall down the shaft when aaron was only four years old the widow had opened a shop aaron was her only child she had done well in her shop she had wanted aaron to be a schoolteacher he had served three years apprenticeship then suddenly thrown it up and gone to the pit  but why said josephine  i couldnt tell you i felt more like it  he had a curious quality of an intelligent almost sophisticated mind which had repudiated education on purpose he kept the midland accent in his speech he understood perfectly what a personification wasand an allegory but he preferred to be illiterate  josephine found out what a miners checkweighman was she tried to find out what sort of wife aaron hadbut except that she was the daughter of a publican and was delicate in health she could learn nothing  and do you send her money she asked  ay said aaron the house is mine and i allow her so much a week out of the money in the bank my mother left me a bit over a thousand when she died  you dont mind what i say do you said josephine  no i dont mind he laughed  he had this pleasantseeming courteous manner but he really kept her at a distance in some things he reminded her of robert blond erect nicely built fresh and englishseeming but there was a curious cold distance to him which she could not get across an inward indifference to herperhaps to everything yet his laugh was so handsome  will you tell me why you left your wife and childrendidnt you love them  aaron looked at the odd round dark muzzle of the girl she had had her hair bobbed and it hung in odd dark folds very black over her ears  why i left her he said for no particular reason theyre all right without me  josephine watched his face she saw a pallor of suffering under its freshness and a strange tension in his eyes  but you couldnt leave your little girls for no reason at all  yes i did for no reasonexcept i wanted to have some free room round meto loose myself  you mean you wanted love flashed josephine thinking he said lose  no i wanted fresh air i dont know what i wanted why should i know  but we must know especially when other people will be hurt said she  ah well a breath of fresh air by myself i felt forced to feeli feel if i go back home now i shall be forcedforced to loveor careor something  perhaps you wanted more than your wife could give you she said  perhaps less shes made up her mind she loves me and shes not going to let me off  did you never love her said josephine  oh yes i shall never love anybody else but im damned if i want to be a lover any more to her or to anybody thats the top and bottom of it i dont want to care when care isnt in me and im not going to be forced to it  the fat aproned french waiter was hovering near josephine let him remove the plates and the empty bottle  have more wine she said to aaron  but he refused she liked him because of his deadlevel indifference to his surroundings french waiters and foreign foodhe noticed them in his quick amiablelooking fashionbut he was indifferent josephine was piqued she wanted to pierce this amiable aloofness of his  she ordered coffee and brandies  but you dont want to get away from everything do you i myself feel so lost sometimesso dreadfully alone not in a silly sentimental fashion because men keep telling me they love me dont you know but my life seems alone for some reason  havent you got relations he said  no one now mother is dead nothing nearer than aunts and cousins in america i suppose i shall see them all again one day but they hardly count over here  why dont you get married he said how old are you  im twentyfive how old are you  thirtythree  you might almost be any agei dont know why i dont get married in a way i hate earning my own livingyet i go onand i like my work  what are you doing now  im painting scenery for a new playrather funi enjoy it but i often wonder what will become of me  in what way  she was almost affronted  what becomes of me oh i dont know and it doesnt matter not to anybody but myself  what becomes of anybody anyhow we live till we die what do you want  why i keep saying i want to get married and feel sure of something but i dont knowi feel dreadful sometimesas if every minute would be the last i keep going on and oni dont know what forand it keeps going on and ongoodness knows what its all for  you shouldnt bother yourself he said you should just let it go on and on  but i must bother she said i must think and feel  youve no occasion he said  how she said with a sudden grunting unhappy laugh then she lit a cigarette  no she said what i should really like more than anything would be an end of the world i wish the world would come to an end  he laughed and poured his drops of brandy down his throat  it wont for wishing he said  no thats the awful part of it itll just go on and on doesnt it make you feel youd go mad  he looked at her and shook his head  you see it doesnt concern me he said so long as i can float by myself  but are you satisfied she cried  i like being by myselfi hate feeling and caring and being forced into it i want to be left alone  you arent very polite to your hostess of the evening she said laughing a bit miserably  oh were all right he said you know what i mean  you like your own company do yousometimes i think im nothing when im alone sometimes i think i surely must be nothingnothingness  he shook his head  no he said no i only want to be left alone  not to have anything to do with anybody she queried ironically  not to any extent  she watched himand then she bubbled with a laugh  i think youre funny she said you dont mind  nowhyits just as you see itjim bricknells a rare comic to my eye  oh himno not actually hes selfconscious and selfish and hysterical it isnt a bit funny after a while  i only know what ive seen said aaron youd both of you like a bloody revolution though  yes only when it came he wouldnt be there  would you  yes indeed i would i would give everything to be in it id give heaven and earth for a great big upheavaland then darkness  perhaps youll get it when you die said aaron  oh but i dont want to die and leave all this standing i hate it so  why do you  but dont you  no it doesnt really bother me  it makes me feel i cant live  i cant see that  but you always disagree with one said josephine how do you like lilly what do you think of him  he seems sharp said aaron  but hes more than sharp  oh yes hes got his finger in most pies  and doesnt like the plums in any of them said josephine tartly  what does he do  writesstories and plays  and makes it pay  hardly at allthey want us to go shall we she rose from the table the waiter handed her her cloak and they went out into the blowy dark night she folded her wrap round her and hurried forward with short sharp steps there was a certain parisian chic and mincingness about her even in her walk but underneath a striding savage suggestion as if she could leg it in great strides like some savage squaw  aaron pressed his bowler hat down on his brow  would you rather take a bus she said in a high voice because of the wind  id rather walk  so would i  they hurried across the charing cross road where great buses rolled and rocked crammed with people her heels clicked sharply on the pavement as they walked east they crossed holborn and passed the museum and neither of them said anything  when they came to the corner she held out her hand  look she said dont come any further dont trouble  ill walk round with you unless youd rather not  nobut do you want to bother  its no bother  so they pursued their way through the high wind and turned at last into the old beautiful square it seemed dark and deserted dark like a savage wilderness in the heart of london the wind was roaring in the great bare trees of the centre as if it were some wild dark grove deep in a forgotten land  josephine opened the gate of the square garden with her key and let it slam to behind him  how wonderful the wind is she shrilled shall we listen to it for a minute  she led him across the grass past the shrubs to the big tree in the centre there she climbed up to a seat he sat beside her they sat in silence looking at the darkness rain was blowing in the wind they huddled against the big treetrunk for shelter and watched the scene  beyond the tall shrubs and the high heavy railings the wet street gleamed silently the houses of the square rose like a cliff on this inner dark sea dimly lighted at occasional windows boughs swayed and sang a taxicab swirled round a corner like a cat and purred to a standstill there was a light of an open hall door but all far away it seemed unthinkably far away aaron sat still and watched he was frightened it all seemed so sinister this dark bristling heart of london wind boomed and tore like waves ripping a shingle beach the two white lights of the taxi stared round and departed leaving the coast at the foot of the cliffs deserted faintly spilled with light from the high lamp beyond there on the outer rim a policeman passed solidly  josephine was weeping steadily all the time but inaudibly occasionally she blew her nose and wiped her face but he had not realized she hardly realized herself she sat near the strange man he seemed so still and remoteso fascinating  give me your hand she said to him subduedly  he took her cold hand in his warm living grasp she wept more bitterly he noticed at last  why are you crying he said  i dont know she replied rather matteroffact through her tears  so he let her cry and said no more but sat with her cold hand in his warm easy clasp  youll think me a fool she said i dont know why i cry  you can cry for nothing cant you he said  why yes but its not very sensible  he laughed shortly  sensible he said  you are a strange man she said  but he took no notice  did you ever intend to marry jim bricknell he asked  yes of course  i cant imagine it he said  why not  both were watching blankly the roaring night of midlondon the phantasmagoric old bloomsbury square they were still hand in hand  such as you shouldnt marry he said  but why not i want to  you think you do  yes indeed i do  he did not say any more  why shouldnt i she persisted i dont know  and again he was silent  youve known some life havent you he asked  me why  you seem to  do i im sorry do i seem viciousno im not viciousive seen some life perhapsin paris mostly but not much why do you ask  i wasnt thinking  but what do you mean what are you thinking  nothing nothing  dont be so irritating said she  but he did not answer and she became silent also they sat hand in hand  wont you kiss me came her voice out of the darkness  he waited some moments then his voice sounded gently half mocking half reproachful  nay he said  why not  i dont want to  why not she asked  he laughed but did not reply  she sat perfectly still for some time she had ceased to cry in the darkness her face was set and sullen sometimes a spray of rain blew across it she drew her hand from his and rose to her feet  ill go in now she said  youre not offended are you he asked  no why  they stepped down in the darkness from their perch  i wondered  she strode off for some little way then she turned and said  yes i think it is rather insulting  nay he said not it not it  and he followed her to the gate  she opened with her key and they crossed the road to her door  goodnight she said turning and giving him her hand  youll come and have dinner with meor lunchwill you when shall we make it he asked  well i cant say for certainim very busy just now ill let you know  a policeman shed his light on the pair of them as they stood on the step  all right said aaron dropping back and she hastily opened the big door and entered     chapter viii a punch in the wind   the lillys had a labourers cottage in hampshirepleasant enough they were poor lilly was a little dark thin quick fellow his wife was strong and fair they had known robert and julia for some years but josephine and jim were new acquaintancesfairly new  one day in early spring lilly had a telegram coming to see you arrive 430bricknell he was surprised but he and his wife got the spare room ready and at four oclock lilly went off to the station he was a few minutes late and saw jims tall rather elegant figure stalking down the station path jim had been an officer in the regular army and still spent hours with his tailor but instead of being a soldier he was a sort of socialist and a redhot revolutionary of a very ineffectual sort  good lad he exclaimed as lilly came up thought you wouldnt mind  not at all let me carry your bag jim had a bag and a knapsack  i had an inspiration this morning said jim i suddenly saw that if there was a man in england who could save me it was you  save you from what asked lilly rather abashed  eh and jim stooped grinning at the smaller man  lilly was somewhat puzzled but he had a certain belief in himself as a saviour the two men tramped rather incongruously through the lanes to the cottage  tanny was in the doorway as they came up the garden path  so nice to see you are you all right she said  aone said jim grinning nice of you to have me  oh were awfully pleased  jim dropped his knapsack on the broad sofa  ive brought some food he said  have you thats sensible of you we cant get a great deal here except just at weekends said tanny  jim fished out a pound of sausages and a pot of fish paste  how lovely the sausages said tanny well have them for dinner tonightand well have the other for tea now youd like a wash  but jim had already opened his bag taken off his coat and put on an old one  thanks he said  lilly made the tea and at length all sat down  well how unexpected this isand how nice said tanny  jollyeh said jim  he ate rapidly stuffing his mouth too full  how is everybody asked tanny  all right julias gone with cyril scott cant stand that fellow can you what  yes i think hes rather nice said tanny what will robert do  have a shot at josephine apparently  really is he in love with her i thought so and she likes him too doesnt she said tanny  very likely said jim  i suppose youre jealous laughed tanny  me jim shook his head not a bit like to see the ball kept rolling  what have you been doing lately  been staying a few days with my wife  no really i cant believe it  jim had a french wife who had divorced him and two children now he was paying visits to this wife again purely friendly tanny did most of the talking jim excited her with his way of looking in her face and grinning wolfishly and at the same time asking to be saved  after tea he wanted to send telegrams so lilly took him round to the village postoffice telegrams were a necessary part of his life he had to be suddenly starting off to keep sudden appointments or he felt he was a void in the atmosphere he talked to lilly about social reform and so on jims work in town was merely nominal he spent his time wavering about and going to various meetings philandering and weeping  lilly kept in the back of his mind the saving which james had come to look for he intended to do his best after dinner the three sat cosily round the kitchen fire  but what do you really think will happen to the world lilly asked jim amid much talk  what theres something big coming said jim  where from  watch ireland and watch japantheyre the two poles of the world said jim  i thought russia and america said lilly  eh what russia and america theyll depend on ireland and japan i know it ive had a vision of it ireland on this side and japan on the othertheyll settle it  i dont see how said lilly  i dont see howbut i had a vision of it  what sort of vision  couldnt describe it  but you dont think much of the japanese do you asked lilly  dont i dont i said jim what dont you think theyre wonderful  no i think theyre rather unpleasant  i think the salvation of the world lies with them  funny salvation said lilly i think theyre anything but angels  do you though now thats funny why  looking at them even i knew a russian doctor whod been through the russojapanese war and who had gone a bit cracked he said he saw the japs rush a trench they threw everything away and flung themselves through the russian fire and simply dropped in masses but those that reached the trenches jumped in with bare hands on the russians and tore their faces apart and bit their throats outfairly ripped the faces off the boneit had sent the doctor a bit cracked he said the wounded were awfultheir faces torn off and their throats mangledand dead japs with flesh between the teethgod knows if its true but thats the impression the japanese had made on this man it had affected his mind really  jim watched lilly and smiled as if he were pleased  noreally he said  anyhow theyre more demon than angel i believe said lilly  oh no rawdon but you always exaggerate said tanny  maybe said lilly  i think japanese are fascinatingfascinatingso quick and such force in them  rathereh said jim looking with a quick smile at tanny  i think a japanese lover would be marvellous she laughed riskily  i sd think he would said jim screwing up his eyes  do you hate the normal british as much as i do she asked him  hate them hate them he said with an intimate grin  their beastly virtue said she and i believe theres nobody more vicious underneath  nobody said jim  but youre british yourself said lilly to jim  no im irish familys irishmy mother was a fitzpatrick  anyhow you live in england  because they wont let me go to ireland  the talk drifted jim finished up all the beer and they prepared to go to bed jim was a bit tipsy grinning he asked for bread and cheese to take upstairs  will you have supper said lilly he was surprised because jim had eaten strangely much at dinner  nowheres the loaf and he cut himself about half of it there was no cheese  breadll do said jim  sit down and eat it have cocoa with it said tanny  no i like to have it in my bedroom  you dont eat bread in the night said lilly  i do  what a funny thing to do  the cottage was in darkness the lillys slept soundly jim woke up and chewed bread and slept again in the morning at dawn he rose and went downstairs lilly heard him roaming aboutheard the woman come in to cleanheard them talking so he got up to look after his visitor though it was not seven oclock and the woman was busybut before he went down he heard jim come upstairs again  mrs short was busy in the kitchen when lilly went down  the other gentleman have been down sir said mrs short he asked me where the bread and butter were so i said should i cut him a piece but he wouldnt let me do it i gave him a knife and he took it for himself in the pantry  i say bricknell said lilly at breakfast time why do you eat so much bread  ive got to feed up ive been starved during this damned war  but hunks of bread wont feed you up  gives the stomach something to work at and prevents it grinding on the nerves said jim  but surely you dont want to keep your stomach always full and heavy  i do my boy i do it needs keeping solid im losing life if i dont i tell you im losing life let me put something inside me  i dont believe breads any use  during breakfast jim talked about the future of the world  i reckon christs the finest thing time has ever produced said he and will remain it  but you dont want crucifixions ad infinitum said lilly  what why not  once is enoughand have done  dont you think love and sacrifice are the finest things in life said jim over his bacon  depends what love and what sacrifice said lilly if i really believe in an almighty god i am willing to sacrifice for him that is im willing to yield my own personal interest to the bigger creative interestbut its obvious almighty god isnt mere love  i think it is love and only love said jim i think the greatest joy is sacrificing oneself to love  to someone you love you mean said tanny  no i dont i dont mean someone at all i mean lovelovelove i sacrifice myself to love i reckon thats the highest man is capable of  but you cant sacrifice yourself to an abstract principle said tanny  thats just what you can do and thats the beauty of it who represents the principle doesnt matter christ is the principle of love said jim  but no said tanny it must be more individual it must be somebody you love not abstract love in itself how can you sacrifice yourself to an abstraction  ha i think love and your christ detestable said lillya sheer ignominy  finest thing the world has produced said jim  no a thing which sets itself up to be betrayed no its foul dont you see its the judas principle you really worship judas is the real hero but for judas the whole show would have been manque  oh yes said jim judas was inevitable im not sure that judas wasnt the greatest of the disciplesand jesus knew it im not sure judas wasnt the disciple jesus loved  jesus certainly encouraged him in his judas tricks said tanny  jim grinned knowingly at lilly  then it was a nasty combination and anything which turns on a judas climax is a dirty show to my thinking i think your judas is a rotten dirty worm just a dirty little selfconscious sentimental twister and out of all christianity he is the hero today when people say christ they mean judas they find him luscious on the palate and jesus fostered him said lilly  hes a profound figure is judas its taken two thousand years to begin to understand him said jim pushing the bread and marmalade into his mouth  a traitor is a traitorno need to understand any further and a system which rests all its weight on a piece of treachery makes that treachery not only inevitable but sacred thats why im sick of christianityat any rate this modern christmongery  the finest thing the world has produced or ever will producechrist and judas said jim  not to me said lilly foul combination  it was a lovely morning in early march violets were out and the first wild anemones the sun was quite warm the three were about to take out a picnic lunch lilly however was suffering from jims presence  jolly nice here said jim mind if i stay till saturday  there was a pause lilly felt he was being bullied almost obscenely bullied was he going to agree suddenly he looked up at jim  id rather you went tomorrow he said  tanny who was sitting opposite jim dropped her head in confusion  whats tomorrow said jim  thursday said lilly  thursday repeated jim and he looked up and got lillys eye he wanted to say friday then  yes id rather you went thursday repeated lilly  but rawdon broke in tanny who was suffering she stopped however  we can walk across country with you some way if you like said lilly to jim it was a sort of compromise  fine said jim well do that then  it was lovely sunshine and they wandered through the woods between jim and tanny was a sort of growing rapprochement which got on lillys nerves  what the hell do you take that beastly personal tone for cried lilly at tanny as the three sat under a leafless great beechtree  but im not personal at all am i mr bricknell said tanny  jim watched lilly and grinned pleasedly  why shouldnt you be anyhow he said  yes she retorted why not  not while im here i loathe the slimy creepy personal intimacydont you think mr bricknell that its lovely to be able to talk quite simply to somebody oh its such a relief after most people lilly mimicked his wifes last speech savagely  but i mean it cried tanny it is lovely  dirty messing said lilly angrily  jim watched the dark irascible little man with amusement they rose and went to look for an inn and beer tanny still clung rather stickily to jims side  but it was a lovely day the first of all the days of spring with crocuses and wallflowers in the cottage gardens and white cocks crowing in the quiet hamlet  when they got back in the afternoon to the cottage they found a telegram for jim he let the lillys see itmeet you for a walk on your return journey lois at once tanny wanted to know all about lois lois was a nice girl welltodo middleclass but also an actress and she would do anything jim wanted  i must get a wire to her to meet me tomorrow he said where shall i say  lilly produced the map and they decided on time and station at which lois coming out of london should meet jim then the happy pair could walk along the thames valley spending a night perhaps at marlowe or some such place  off went jim and lilly once more to the postoffice they were quite good friends having so inhospitably fixed the hour of departure lilly wanted to be nice arrived at the postoffice they found it shut halfday closing for the little shop  well said lilly well go to the station  they proceeded to the stationfound the stationmasterwere conducted down to the signalbox lilly naturally hung back from people but jim was hobnob with the stationmaster and the signal man quite officerandmymen kind of thing lilly sat out on the steps of the signalbox rather ashamed while the long telegram was shouted over the telephone to the junction townfirst the young lady and her address then the message meet me x station 340 tomorrow walk back great pleasure jim  anyhow that was done they went home to tea after tea as the evening fell lilly suggested a little stroll in the woods while tanny prepared the dinner jim agreed and they set out the two men wandered through the trees in the dusk till they came to a bank on the farther edge of the wood there they sat down  and there lilly said what he had to say as a matter of fact he said its nothing but love and selfsacrifice which makes you feel yourself losing life  youre wrong only love brings it backand wine if i drink a bottle of burgundy i feel myself restored at the middleright here i feel the energy back again and if i can fall in lovebut its becoming so damned hard  what to fall in love asked lilly  yes  then why not leave off trying what do you want to poke yourself and prod yourself into love for  because im dead without it im dead im dying  only because you force yourself if you drop working yourself up  i shall die i only live when i can fall in love otherwise im dying by inches why man you dont know what it was like i used to get the most grand feelingslike a great rush of force or lighta great rushright here as ive said at the solar plexus and it would come any timeanywhereno matter where i was and then i was all right  all right for whatfor making love  yes man i was  and now you arentoh well leave love alone as any twopenny doctor would tell you  no youre off it there its nothing technical technically i can make love as much as you like its nothing a doctor has any say in its what i feel inside me i feel the life going i know its going i never get those inrushes now unless i drink a jolly lot or if i possibly could fall in love technically im potent all rightoh yes  you should leave yourself and your inrushes alone  but you cant its a sort of ache  then you should stiffen your backbone its your backbone that matters you shouldnt want to abandon yourself you shouldnt want to fling yourself all loose into a womans lap you should stand by yourself and learn to be by yourself why dont you be more like the japanese you talk about quiet aloof little devils they dont bother about being loved they keep themselves taut in their own selvesthere at the bottom of the spinethe devils own power theyve got there  jim mused a bit  think they have he laughed it seemed comic to him  sure look at them why cant you gather yourself there  at the tail  yes hold yourself firm there  jim broke into a cackle of a laugh and rose the two went through the dark woods back to the cottage jim staggered and stumbled like a drunken man or worse like a man with locomotor ataxia as if he had no power in his lower limbs  walk there said lilly finding him the smoothest bit of the dark path but jim stumbled and shambled in a state of nauseous weak relaxation however they reached the cottage and food and beerand tanny piqued with curiosity to know what the men had been saying privately to each other  after dinner they sat once more talking round the fire  lilly sat in a small chair facing the fire the other two in the armchairs on either side the hearth  how nice it will be for you walking with lois towards london tomorrow gushed tanny sentimentally  good god said lilly why the dickens doesnt he walk by himself without wanting a woman always there to hold his hand  dont be so spiteful said tanny you see that you have a woman always there to hold your hand  my hand doesnt need holding snapped lilly  doesnt it more than most mens but youre so beastly ungrateful and mannish because i hold you safe enough all the time you like to pretend youre doing it all yourself  all right dont drag yourself in said lilly detesting his wife at that moment anyhow and he turned to jim its time youd done slobbering yourself over a lot of little women one after the other  why shouldnt i if i like it said jim  yes why not said tanny  because it makes a fool of you look at you stumbling and staggering with no use in your legs id be ashamed if i were you  would you said jim  i would and its nothing but your wanting to be loved which does it a maudlin crying to be loved which makes your knees all go rickety  think thats it said jim  what else is it you havent been here a day but you must telegraph for some female to be ready to hold your hand the moment you go away and before she lets go youll be wiring for another you want to be loved you want to be loveda man of your years its disgusting  i dont see it i believe in love said jim watching and grinning oddly  bah love messing thats what it is it wouldnt matter if it did you no harm but when you stagger and stumble down a road out of sheer sloppy relaxation of your will  at this point jim suddenly sprang from his chair at lilly and gave him two or three hard blows with his fists upon the front of the body then he sat down in his own chair again saying sheepishly  i knew i should have to do it if he said any more  lilly sat motionless as a statue his face like paper one of the blows had caught him rather low so that he was almost winded and could not breathe he sat rigid paralysed as a winded man is but he wouldnt let it be seen with all his will he prevented himself from gasping only through his parted lips he drew tiny gasps controlled nothing revealed to the other two he hated them both far too much  for some minutes there was dead silence whilst lilly silently and viciously fought for his breath tanny opened her eyes wide in a sort of pleased bewilderment and jim turned his face aside and hung his clasped hands between his knees  theres a great silence suddenly said tanny  what is there to say ejaculated lilly rapidly with a spoonful of breath which he managed to compress and control into speech then he sat motionless again concerned with the business of getting back his wind and not letting the other two see  jim jerked in his chair and looked round  it isnt that i dont like the man he said in a rather small voice but i knew if he went on i should have to do it  to lilly rigid and physically preoccupied there sounded a sort of selfconsciousness in jims voice as if the whole thing had been semideliberate he detected the sort of maudlin deliberateness which goes with hysterics and he was colder more icy than ever  tanny looked at lilly puzzled bewildered but still rather pleased as if she demanded an answer none being forthcoming she said  of course you mustnt expect to say all those things without rousing a man  still lilly did not answer jim glanced at him then looked at tanny  it isnt that i dont like him he said slowly i like him better than any man ive ever known i believe he clasped his hands and turned aside his face  judas flashed through lillys mind  again tanny looked for her husbands answer  yes rawdon she said you cant say the things you do without their having an effect you really ask for it you know  its no matter lilly squeezed the words out coldly he wanted to do it and he did it  a dead silence ensued now tanny looked from man to man  i could feel it coming on me said jim  of course said tanny rawdon doesnt know the things he says she was pleased that he had had to pay for them for once  it takes a man a long time to get his breath back after a sharp blow in the wind lilly was managing by degrees the others no doubt attributed his silence to deep or fierce thoughts it was nothing of the kind merely a cold struggle to get his wind back without letting them know he was struggling and a sheer stockstiff hatred of the pair of them  i like the man said jim never liked a man more than i like him he spoke as if with difficulty  the man stuck safely in lillys ears  oh well he managed to say its nothing ive done my talking and had an answer for once  yes rawdy youve had an answer for once usually you dont get an answer you knowand thats why you go so farin the things you say now youll know how you make people feel  quite said lilly  i dont feel anything i dont mind what he says said jim  yes but he ought to know the things he does say said tanny he goes on without considering the person hes talking to this time its come back on him he mustnt say such personal things if hes not going to risk an answer  i dont mind what he says i dont mind a bit said jim  nor do i mind said lilly indifferently i say what i feelyou do as you feeltheres an end of it  a sheepish sort of silence followed this speech it was broken by a sudden laugh from tanny  the things that happen to us she said laughing rather shrilly suddenly like a thunderbolt were all struck into silence  rum game eh said jim grinning  isnt it funny isnt life too funny she looked again at her husband but rawdy you must admit it was your own fault  lillys stiff face did not change  why fault he said looking at her coldly what is there to talk about  usually theres so much she said sarcastically  a few phrases dribbled out of the silence in vain jim tried to get lilly to thaw and in vain tanny gave her digs at her husband lillys stiff inscrutable face did not change he was polite and aloof so they all went to bed  in the morning the walk was to take place as arranged lilly and tanny accompanying jim to the third station across country the morning was lovely the country beautiful lilly liked the countryside and enjoyed the walk but a hardness inside himself never relaxed jim talked a little again about the future of the world and a higher state of christlikeness in man but lilly only laughed then tanny managed to get ahead with jim sticking to his side and talking sympathetic personalities but lilly feeling it from afar ran after them and caught them up they were silent  what was the interesting topic he said cuttingly  nothing at all said tanny nettled why must you interfere  because i intend to said lilly  and the two others fell apart as if severed with a knife jim walked rather sheepishly as if cut out  so they came at last past the canals to the wayside station and at last jims train came they all said goodbye jim and tanny were both waiting for lilly to show some sign of real reconciliation but none came he was cheerful and aloof  goodbye he said to jim hope lois will be there all right third station on goodbye goodbye  youll come to rackham said jim leaning out of the train  we should love to called tanny after the receding train  all right said lilly noncommittal  but he and his wife never saw jim again lilly never intended to see him a devil sat in the little mans breast  you shouldnt play at little jesus coming so near to people wanting to help them was tannys last word     chapter ix lowwater mark   tanny went away to norway to visit her people for the first time for three years lilly did not go he did not want to he came to london and settled in a room over covent garden market the room was high up a fair size and stood at the corner of one of the streets and the market itself looking down on the stalls and the carts and the arcade lilly would climb out of the window and sit for hours watching the behaviour of the great draughthorses which brought the mountains of boxes and vegetables funny halfhuman creatures they seemed so massive and fleshy yet so cockney there was one which could not bear donkeys and which used to stretch out its great teeth like some massive serpent after every poor diminutive ass that came with a costers barrow another great horse could not endure standing it would shake itself and give little starts and back into the heaps of carrots and broccoli whilst the driver went into a frenzy of rage  there was always something to watch one minute it was two great loads of empty crates which in passing had got entangled and reeled leaning to fall disastrously then the drivers cursed and swore and dismounted and stared at their jeopardised loads till a thin fellow was persuaded to scramble up the airy mountains of cages like a monkey and he actually managed to put them to rights great sigh of relief when the vans rocked out of the market  again there was a particular pageboy in buttons with a round and perky behind who nimbly carried a teatray from somewhere to somewhere under the arches beside the market the great brawny porters would tease him and he would stop to give them cheek one afternoon a giant lunged after him the boy darted gracefully among the heaps of vegetables still bearing aloft his teatray like some young bluebuttoned acolyte fleeing before a false god the giant rolled after himwhen alas the acolyte of the teatray slipped among the vegetables and down came the tray then tears and a roar of unfeeling mirth from the giants lilly felt they were going to make it up to him  another afternoon a young swell sauntered persistently among the vegetables and lilly seated in his high little balcony wondered why but at last a taxi and a very expensive female in a sort of silver brocade gown and a great fur shawl and ospreys in her bonnet evidently an assignation yet what could be more conspicuous than this elegant pair picking their way through the cabbageleaves  and then one cold grey afternoon in early april a man in a black overcoat and a bowler hat walking uncertainly lilly had risen and was just retiring out of the chill damp air for some reason he lingered to watch the figure the man was walking east he stepped rather insecurely off the pavement and wavered across the setts between the wheels of the standing vans and suddenly he went down lilly could not see him on the ground but he saw some vanmen go forward and he saw one of them pick up the mans hat  id better go down said lilly to himself  so he began running down the four long flights of stone stairs past the many doors of the multifarious business premises and out into the market a little crowd had gathered and a large policeman was just rowing into the centre of the interest lilly always a hoverer on the edge of public commotions hung now hesitating on the outskirts of the crowd  what is it he said to a rather sniffy messenger boy  drunk said the messenger boy except that in unblushing cockney he pronounced it drank  lilly hung further back on the edge of the little crowd  come on here where d you want to go he heard the hearty tones of the policeman  im all right im all right came the testy drunken answer  all right are yer all right and then somecome on get on your pins  im all right im all right  the voice made lilly peer between the people and sitting on the granite setts being hauled up by a burly policeman he saw our acquaintance aaron very pale in the face and a little dishevelled  like me to tuck the sheets round you shouldnt you fancy yourself snug in bed dont you you wont believe youre right in the way of traffic will you now in covent garden market come on well see to you and the policeman hoisted the bitter and unwilling aaron  lilly was quickly at the centre of the affair unobtrusive like a shadow different from the other people  help him up to my room will you he said to the constable friend of mine  the large constable looked down on the bareheaded wispy unobtrusive lilly with goodhumoured suspicion and incredulity lilly could not have borne it if the policeman had uttered any of this cockney suspicion so he watched him there was a great gulf between the public official and the odd quiet little individualyet lilly had his way  which room said the policeman dubious  lilly pointed quickly round then he said to aaron  were you coming to see me sisson youll come in wont you  aaron nodded rather stupidly and testily his eyes looked angry somebody stuck his hat on his head for him and made him look a fool lilly took it off again and carried it for him he turned and the crowd eased he watched aaron sharply and saw that it was with difficulty he could walk so he caught him by the arm on the other side from the policeman and they crossed the road to the pavement  not so much of this sort of thing these days said the policeman  not so much opportunity said lilly  more than there was though coming back to the old days like working round bit by bit  they had arrived at the stairs aaron stumbled up  steady now steady does it said the policeman steering his charge there was a curious breach of distance between lilly and the constable  at last lilly opened his own door the room was pleasant the fire burned warm the piano stood open the sofa was untidy with cushions and papers books and papers covered the big writing desk beyond the screen made by the bookshelves and the piano were two beds with washstand by one of the large windows the one through which lilly had climbed  the policeman looked round curiously  more cosy here than in the lockup sir he said  lilly laughed he was hastily clearing the sofa  sit on the sofa sisson he said  the policeman lowered his charge with a  right we are then  lilly felt in his pocket and gave the policeman half a crown but he was watching aaron who sat stupidly on the sofa very pale and semiconscious  do you feel ill sisson he said sharply  aaron looked back at him with heavy eyes and shook his head slightly  i believe you are said lilly taking his hand  might be a bit o this flu you know said the policeman  yes said lilly where is there a doctor he added on reflection  the nearest said the policeman and he told him leave a message for you sir  lilly wrote his address on a card then changed his mind  no ill run round myself if necessary he said  and the policeman departed  youll go to bed wont you said lilly to aaron when the door was shut aaron shook his head sulkily  i would if i were you you can stay here till youre all right im alone so it doesnt matter  but aaron had relapsed into semiconsciousness lilly put the big kettle on the gas stove the little kettle on the fire then he hovered in front of the stupefied man he felt uneasy again he took aarons hand and felt the pulse  im sure you arent well you must go to bed he said and he kneeled and unfastened his visitors boots meanwhile the kettle began to boil he put a hotwater bottle into the bed  let us get your overcoat off he said to the stupefied man come along and with coaxing and pulling and pushing he got off the overcoat and coat and waistcoat  at last aaron was undressed and in bed lilly brought him tea with a dim kind of obedience he took the cup and would drink he looked at lilly with heavy eyes  i gave in i gave in to her else i should ha been all right he said  to whom said lilly  i gave in to herand afterwards i cried thinking of lottie and the children i felt my heart break you know and thats what did it i should have been all right if i hadnt given in to her  to whom said lilly  josephine i felt the minute i was loving her id done myself and i had everything came back on me if i hadnt given in to her i should ha kept all right  dont bother now get warm and still  i felt iti felt it go inside me the minute i gave in to her its perhaps killed me  no not it never mind be still be still and youll be all right in the morning  its my own fault for giving in to her if id kept myself back my liver wouldnt have broken inside me and i shouldnt have been sick and i knew  never mind now have you drunk your tea lie down lie down and go to sleep  lilly pushed aaron down in the bed and covered him over then he thrust his hands under the bedclothes and felt his feetstill cold he arranged the water bottle then he put another cover on the bed  aaron lay still rather grey and peakedlooking in a stillness that was not healthy for some time lilly went about stealthily glancing at his patient from time to time then he sat down to read  he was roused after a time by a moaning of troubled breathing and a fretful stirring in the bed he went across aarons eyes were open and dark looking  have a little hot milk said lilly  aaron shook his head faintly not noticing  a little bovril  the same faint shake  then lilly wrote a note for the doctor went into the office on the same landing and got a clerk who would be leaving in a few minutes to call with the note when he came back he found aaron still watching  are you here by yourself asked the sick man  yes my wifes gone to norway  for good  no laughed lilly for a couple of months or so shell come back here unless she joins me in switzerland or somewhere  aaron was still for a while  youve not gone with her he said at length  to see her people no i dont think they want me very badlyand i didnt want very badly to go why should i its better for married people to be separated sometimes  ay said aaron watching the other man with feverdarkened eyes  i hate married people who are two in onestuck together like two jujube lozenges said lilly  me an all i hate em myself said aaron  everybody ought to stand by themselves in the first placemen and women as well they can come together in the second place if they like but nothing is any good unless each one stands alone intrinsically  im with you there said aaron if id kep myself to myself i shouldnt be bad nowthough im not very bad i sll be all right in the morning but i did myself in when i went with another woman i felt myself goas if the bile broke inside me and i was sick  josephine seduced you laughed lilly  ay right enough replied aaron grimly she wont be coming here will she  not unless i ask her  you wont ask her though  no not if you dont want her  i dont  the fever made aaron naive and communicative unlike himself and he knew he was being unlike himself he knew that he was not in proper control of himself so he was unhappy uneasy  ill stop here the night then if you dont mind he said  youll have to said lilly ive sent for the doctor i believe youve got the flu  think i have said aaron frightened  dont be scared laughed lilly  there was a long pause lilly stood at the window looking at the darkening market beneath the streetlamps  i sll have to go to the hospital if i have came aarons voice  no if its only going to be a week or a fortnights business you can stop here ive nothing to do said lilly  theres no occasion for you to saddle yourself with me said aaron dejectedly  you can go to your hospital if you likeor back to your lodgingif you wish to said lilly you can make up your mind when you see how you are in the morning  no use going back to my lodgings said aaron  ill send a telegram to your wife if you like said lilly  aaron was silent dead silent for some time  nay he said at length in a decided voice not if i die for it  lilly remained still and the other man lapsed into a sort of semisleep motionless and abandoned the darkness had fallen over london and away below the lamps were white  lilly lit the greenshaded reading lamp over the desk then he stood and looked at aaron who lay still looking sick rather beautiful the bones of the countenance but the skull too small for such a heavy jaw and rather coarse mouth aaron halfopened his eyes and writhed feverishly as if his limbs could not be in the right place lilly mended the fire and sat down to write then he got up and went downstairs to unfasten the street door so that the doctor could walk up the business people had gone from their various holes all the lower part of the tall house was in darkness  lilly waited and waited he boiled an egg and made himself toast aaron said he might eat the same lilly cooked another egg and took it to the sick man aaron looked at it and pushed it away with nausea he would have some tea so lilly gave him tea  not much fun for you doing this for somebody who is nothing to you said aaron  i shouldnt if you were unsympathetic to me said lilly as it is its happened so and so well let be  what time is it  nearly eight oclock  oh my lord the opera  and aaron got half out of bed but as he sat on the bedside he knew he could not safely get to his feet he remained a picture of dejection  perhaps we ought to let them know said lilly  but aaron blank with stupid misery sat huddled there on the bedside without answering  ill run round with a note said lilly i suppose others have had flu besides you lie down  but aaron stupidly and dejectedly sat huddled on the side of the bed wearing old flannel pyjamas of lillys rather small for him he felt too sick to move  lie down lie down said lilly and keep still while im gone i shant be more than ten minutes  i dont care if i die said aaron  lilly laughed  youre a long way from dying said he or you wouldnt say it  but aaron only looked up at him with queer faroff haggard eyes something like a criminal who is just being executed  lie down said lilly pushing him gently into the bed you wont improve yourself sitting there anyhow  aaron lay down turned away and was quite still lilly quietly left the room on his errand  the doctor did not come until ten oclock and worn out with work when he did come  isnt there a lift in this establishment he said as he groped his way up the stone stairs lilly had heard him and run down to meet him  the doctor poked the thermometer under aarons tongue and felt the pulse then he asked a few questions listened to the heart and breathing  yes its the flu he said curtly nothing to do but to keep warm in bed and not move and take plenty of milk and liquid nourishment ill come round in the morning and give you an injection lungs are all right so far  how long shall i have to be in bed said aaron  ohdepends a week at least  aaron watched him sullenlyand hated him lilly laughed to himself the sick man was like a dog that is ill but which growls from a deep corner and will bite if you put your hand in he was in a state of black depression  lilly settled him down for the night and himself went to bed aaron squirmed with heavy pained limbs the night through and slept and had bad dreams lilly got up to give him drinks the din in the market was terrific before dawn and aaron suffered bitterly  in the morning he was worse the doctor gave him injections against pneumonia  you wouldnt like me to wire to your wife said lilly  no said aaron abruptly you can send me to the hospital im nothing but a piece of carrion  carrion said lilly why  i know it i feel like it  oh thats only the sort of nauseated feeling you get with flu  im only fit to be thrown underground and made an end of i cant stand myself  he had a ghastly grey look of selfrepulsion  its the germ that makes you feel like that said lilly it poisons the system for a time but youll work it off  at evening he was no better the fever was still high yet there were no complicationsexcept that the heart was irregular  the one thing i wonder said lilly is whether you hadnt better be moved out of the noise of the market its fearful for you in the early morning  it makes no difference to me said aaron  the next day he was a little worse if anything the doctor knew there was nothing to be done at evening he gave the patient a calomel pill it was rather strong and aaron had a bad time his burning parched poisoned inside was twisted and torn meanwhile carts banged porters shouted all the hell of the market went on outside away down on the cobble setts but this time the two men did not hear  youll feel better now said lilly after the operation  its done me harm cried aaron fretfully send me to the hospital or youll repent it get rid of me in time  nay said lilly you get better damn it youre only one among a million  again over aarons face went the ghastly grimace of selfrepulsion  my souls gone rotten he said  no said lilly only toxin in the blood  next day the patient seemed worse and the heart more irregular he rested badly so far lilly had got a fair nights rest now aaron was not sleeping and he seemed to struggle in the bed  keep your courage up man said the doctor sharply you give way  aaron looked at him blackly and did not answer  in the night lilly was up time after time aaron would slip down on his back and go semiconscious and then he would awake as if drowning struggling to move mentally shouting aloud yet making no sound for some moments mentally shouting in frenzy but unable to stir or make a sound when at last he got some sort of physical control he cried lift me up lift me up  lilly hurried and lifted him up and he sat panting with a sobbing motion his eyes gloomy and terrified more than ever like a criminal who is just being executed he drank brandy and was laid down on his side  dont let me lie on my back he said terrified no i wont said lilly aaron frowned curiously on his nurse mind you dont let me he said exacting and really terrified  no i wont let you  and now lilly was continually crossing over and pulling aaron on to his side whenever he found him slipped down on his back  in the morning the doctor was puzzled probably it was the toxin in the blood which poisoned the heart there was no pneumonia and yet aaron was clearly growing worse the doctor agreed to send in a nurse for the coming night  whats the matter with you man he said sharply to his patient you give way you give way cant you pull yourself together  but aaron only became more gloomily withheld retracting from life and lilly began to be really troubled he got a friend to sit with the patient in the afternoon whilst he himself went out and arranged to sleep in aarons room at his lodging  the next morning when he came in he found the patient lying as ever in a sort of heap in the bed nurse had had to lift him up and hold him up again and now aaron lay in a sort of semistupor of fear frustrated anger misery and selfrepulsion a sort of interlocked depression  the doctor frowned when he came he talked with the nurse and wrote another prescription then he drew lilly away to the door  whats the matter with the fellow he said cant you rouse his spirit he seems to be sulking himself out of life hell drop out quite suddenly you know if he goes on like this cant you rouse him up  i think it depresses him partly that his bowels wont work it frightens him hes never been ill in his life before said lilly  his bowels wont work if he lets all his spirit go like an animal dying of the sulks said the doctor impatiently he might go off quite suddenlydead before you can turn round  lilly was properly troubled yet he did not quite know what to do it was early afternoon and the sun was shining into the room there were daffodils and anemones in a jar and freezias and violets down below in the market were two stalls of golden and blue flowers gay  the flowers are lovely in the spring sunshine said lilly i wish i were in the country dont you as soon as you are better well go its been a terrible cold wet spring but now its going to be nice do you like being in the country  yes said aaron  he was thinking of his garden he loved it never in his life had he been away from a garden before  make haste and get better and well go  where said aaron  hampshire or berkshire or perhaps youd like to go home would you  aaron lay still and did not answer  perhaps you want to and you dont want to said lilly you can please yourself anyhow  there was no getting anything definite out of the sick manhis soul seemed stuck as if it would not move  suddenly lilly rose and went to the dressingtable  im going to rub you with oil he said im going to rub you as mothers do their babies whose bowels dont work  aaron frowned slightly as he glanced at the dark selfpossessed face of the little man  whats the good of that he said irritably id rather be left alone  then you wont be  quickly he uncovered the blond lower body of his patient and began to rub the abdomen with oil using a slow rhythmic circulating motion a sort of massage for a long time he rubbed finely and steadily then went over the whole of the lower body mindless as if in a sort of incantation he rubbed every speck of the mans lower bodythe abdomen the buttocks the thighs and knees down to the feet rubbed it all warm and glowing with camphorated oil every bit of it chafing the toes swiftly till he was almost exhausted then aaron was covered up again and lilly sat down in fatigue to look at his patient  he saw a change the spark had come back into the sick eyes and the faint trace of a smile faintly luminous into the face aaron was regaining himself but lilly said nothing he watched his patient fall into a proper sleep  and he sat and watched him sleep and he thought to himself i wonder why i do it i wonder why i bother with him jim ought to have taught me my lesson as soon as this mans really better hell punch me in the wind metaphorically if not actually for having interfered with him and tanny would say he was quite right to do it she says i want power over them what if i do they dont care how much power the mob has over them the nation lloyd george and northcliffe and the police and money theyll yield themselves up to that sort of power quickly enough and immolate themselves pro bono publico by the million and whats the bonum publicum but a mob power why cant they submit to a bit of healthy individual authority the fool would die without me just as that fool jim will die in hysterics one day why does he last so long  tannys the same she does nothing really but resist me my authority or my influence or just me at the bottom of her heart she just blindly and persistently opposes me god knows what it is she opposes just me myself she thinks i want her to submit to me so i do in a measure natural to our two selves somewhere she ought to submit to me but they all prefer to kick against the pricks not that they get many pricks i get them damn them all why dont i leave them alone they only grin and feel triumphant when theyve insulted one and punched one in the wind  this aaron will do just the same i like him and he ought to like me and hell be another jim he will like me if he can knock the wind out of me a lot of little stavrogins coming up to whisper affectionately and biting ones ear  but anyhow i can soon see the last of this chap and him the last of all the rest ill be damned for ever if i see their jims and roberts and julias and scotts any more let them dance round their insipid hellbroth thin tack it is  theres a whole world besides this little gang of europeans except dear god that theyve exterminated all the peoples worth knowing i cant do with folk who teem by the billion like the chinese and japs and orientals altogether only vermin teem by the billion higher types breed slower i would have loved the aztecs and the red indians i know they hold the element in life which i am looking forthey had living pride not like the fleabitten asiaticseven niggers are better than asiatics though they are wallowersthe american racesand the south sea islandersthe marquesans the maori blood that was the true blood it wasnt frightened all the rest are craveneuropeans asiatics africanseveryone at his own individual quick craven and cringing only conceited in the mass the mob how i hate them the massbullies the individual judases  well if one will be a jesus he must expect his judas thats why abraham lincoln gets shot a jesus makes a judas inevitable a man should remain himself not try to spread himself over humanity he should pivot himself on his own pride  i suppose really i ought to have packed this aaron off to the hospital instead of which here am i rubbing him with oil to rub the life into him and i know hell bite me like a warmed snake the moment he recovers and tanny will say quite right too i shouldnt have been so intimate no i should have left it to mechanical doctors and nurses  so i should everything to its own and aaron belongs to this little system and jim is waiting to be psychoanalysed and tanny is waiting for her own glorification  all right aaron last time i break my bread for anybody this is so get better my flautist so that i can go away  it was easy for the red indians and the others to take their hook into death they might have stayed a bit longer to help one to defy the white masses  ill make some tea  lilly rose softly and went across to the fire he had to cross a landing to a sort of little lavatory with a sink and a tap for water the clerks peeped out at him from an adjoining office and nodded he nodded and disappeared from their sight as quickly as possible with his kettle his dark eyes were quick his dark hair was untidy there was something silent and withheld about him people could never approach him quite ordinarily  he put on the kettle and quietly set cups and plates on a tray the room was clean and cosy and pleasant he did the cleaning himself and was as efficient and inobtrusive a housewife as any woman while the kettle boiled he sat darning the socks which he had taken off aarons feet when the flautist arrived and which he had washed he preferred that no outsider should see him doing these things yet he preferred also to do them himself so that he should be independent of outside aid  his face was dark and hollow he seemed frail sitting there in the london afternoon darning the black woollen socks his full brow was knitted slightly there was a tension at the same time there was an indomitable stillness about him as it were in the atmosphere about him his hands though small were not very thin he bit off the wool as he finished his darn  as he was making the tea he saw aaron rouse up in bed  ive been to sleep i feel better said the patient turning round to look what the other man was doing and the sight of the water steaming in a jet from the teapot seemed attractive  yes said lilly youve slept for a good two hours  i believe i have said aaron  would you like a little tea  ayand a bit of toast  youre not supposed to have solid food let me take your temperature  the temperature was down to a hundred and lilly in spite of the doctor gave aaron a piece of toast with his tea enjoining him not to mention it to the nurse  in the evening the two men talked  you do everything for yourself then said aaron  yes i prefer it  you like living all alone  i dont know about that i never have lived alone tanny and i have been very much alone in various countries but thats two not one  you miss her then  yes of course i missed her horribly in the cottage when shed first gone i felt my heart was broken but here where weve never been together i dont notice it so much  shell come back said aaron  yes shell come back but id rather meet her abroad than hereand get on a different footing  why  oh i dont know theres something with marriage altogether i think egoisme a deux  whats that mean  egoisme a deux two people one egoism marriage is a selfconscious egoistic state it seems to me  youve got no children said aaron  no tanny wants children badly i dont im thankful we have none  why  i cant quite say i think of them as a burden besides there are such millions and billions of children in the world and we know well enough what sort of millions and billions of people theyll grow up into i dont want to add my quota to the massits against my instinct  ay laughed aaron with a curt acquiescence  tannys furious but then when a woman has got children she thinks the world wags only for them and her nothing else the whole world wags for the sake of the childrenand their sacred mother  ay thats damned true said aaron  and myself im sick of the children stunt children are all right so long as you just take them for what they are young immature things like kittens and halfgrown dogs nuisances sometimes very charming but ill be hanged if i can see anything high and holy about children i should be sorry too it would be so bad for the children young brats tiresome and amusing in turns  when they dont give themselves airs said aaron  yes indeed which they do half the time sacred children and sacred motherhood im absolutely fed stiff by it thats why im thankful i have no children tanny cant come it over me there  its a fact when a womans got her children by god shes a bitch in the manger you can starve while she sits on the hay its useful to keep her pups warm  yes  why you know aaron turned excitedly in the bed they look on a man as if he was nothing but an instrument to get and rear children if you have anything to do with a woman she thinks its because you want to get children by her and im damned if it is i want my own pleasure or nothing and children be damned  ah womenthey must be loved at any price said lilly and if you just dont want to love themand tell them sowhat a crime  a crime said aaron they make a criminal of you them and their children be cursed is my life given me for nothing but to get children and work to bring them up see them all in hell first theyd better die while theyre children if childhoods all that important  i quite agree said lilly if childhood is more important than manhood then why live to be a man at all why not remain an infant  be damned and blasted to women and all their importances cried aaron they want to get you under and children is their chief weapon  men have got to stand up to the fact that manhood is more than childhoodand then force women to admit it said lilly but the rotten whiners theyre all grovelling before a babys napkin and a womans petticoat  its a fact said aaron but he glanced at lilly oddly as if suspiciously and lilly caught the look but he continued  and if they think you try to stand on your legs and walk with the feet of manhood why there isnt a blooming father and lover among them but will do his best to get you down and suffocate youeither with a babys napkin or a womans petticoat  lillys lips were curling he was dark and bitter  ay it is like that said aaron rather subduedly  the mans spirit has gone out of the world men cant move an inch unless they can grovel humbly at the end of the journey  no said aaron watching with keen halfamused eyes  thats why marriage wants readjustingor extendingto get men on to their own legs once more and to give them the adventure again but men wont stick together and fight for it because once a woman has climbed up with her children shell find plenty of grovellers ready to support her and suffocate any defiant spirit and women will sacrifice eleven men fathers husbands brothers and lovers for one babyor for her own female selfconceit  she will that said aaron  and can you find two men to stick together without feeling criminal and without cringing and without betraying one another you cant one is sure to go fawning round some female then they both enjoy giving each other away and doing a new grovel before a woman again  ay said aaron  after which lilly was silent     chapter x the war again   one is a fool said lilly to be lachrymose the thing to do is to get a move on  aaron looked up with a glimpse of a smile the two men were sitting before the fire at the end of a cold wet april day aaron convalescent somewhat chastened in appearance  ay he said rather sourly a move back to guilford street  oh i meant to tell you said lilly i was reading an old baden history they made a law in 1528not a law but a regulationthat if a man forsakes his wife and children as now so often happens the said wife and children are at once to be dispatched after him i thought that would please you does it  yes said aaron briefly  they would have arrived the next day like a forwarded letter  i should have had to get a considerable move on at that rate grinned aaron  oh no you might quite like them here but lilly saw the white frown of determined revulsion on the convalescents face  wouldnt you he asked  aaron shook his head  no he said and it was obvious he objected to the topic what are you going to do about your move on  me said lilly im going to sail away next weekor steam dirtily away on a tramp called the maud allen wing  where to  malta  where from  london dock i fixed up my passage this morning for ten pounds i am cooks assistant signed on  aaron looked at him with a little admiration  you can take a sudden jump cant you he said  the difficulty is to refrain from jumping overboard or anywhere  aaron smoked his pipe slowly  and what good will malta do you he asked envious  heaven knows i shall cross to syracuse and move up italy  sounds as if you were a millionaire  ive got thirtyfive pounds in all the world but something will come along  ive got more than that said aaron  good for you replied lilly  he rose and went to the cupboard taking out a bowl and a basket of potatoes he sat down again paring the potatoes his busy activity annoyed aaron  but whats the good of going to malta shall you be any different in yourself in another place youll be the same there as you are here  how am i here  why youre all the time grinding yourself against something inside you youre never free youre never content you never stop chafing  lilly dipped his potato into the water and cut out the eyes carefully then he cut it in two and dropped it in the clean water of the second bowl he had not expected this criticism  perhaps i dont said he  then whats the use of going somewhere else you wont change yourself  i may in the end said lilly  youll be yourself whether its malta or london said aaron  theres a doom for me laughed lilly the water on the fire was boiling he rose and threw in salt then dropped in the potatoes with little plops there there are lots of mes im not only just one proposition a new place brings out a new thing in a man otherwise youd have stayed in your old place with your family  the man in the middle of you doesnt change said aaron  do you find it so said lilly  ay every time  then whats to be done  nothing as far as i can see you get as much amusement out of life as possible and theres the end of it  all right then ill get the amusement  ay all right then said aaron but there isnt anything wonderful about it you talk as if you were doing something special you arent youre no more than a man who drops into a pub for a drink to liven himself up a bit only you give it a lot of names and make out as if you were looking for the philosophers stone or something like that when youre only killing time like the rest of folks before time kills you  lilly did not answer it was not yet seven oclock but the sky was dark aaron sat in the firelight even the saucepan on the fire was silent darkness silence the firelight in the upper room and the two men together  it isnt quite true said lilly leaning on the mantelpiece and staring down into the fire  where isnt it you talk and you make a man believe youve got something he hasnt got but where is it when it comes to what have you got more than me or jim bricknell only a bigger choice of words it seems to me  lilly was motionless and inscrutable like a shadow  does it aaron he said in a colorless voice  yes what else is there to it aaron sounded testy  why said lilly at last theres something i agree its true what you say about me but theres a bit of something else theres just a bit of something in me i think which isnt a man running into a pub for a drink  and what  the question fell into the twilight like a drop of water falling down a deep shaft into a well  i think a man may come into possession of his own soul at lastas the buddhists teachbut without ceasing to love or even to hate one loves one hatesbut somewhere beyond it all one understands and possesses ones soul in patience and in peace  yes said aaron slowly while you only stand and talk about it but when youve got no chance to talk about itand when youve got to liveyou dont possess your soul neither in patience nor in peace but any devil that likes possesses you and does what it likes with you while you fridge yourself and fray yourself out like a worn rag  i dont care said lilly im learning to possess my soul in patience and in peace and i know it and it isnt a negative nirvana either and if tanny possesses her own soul in patience and peace as welland if in this we understand each other at lastthen there we are together and apart at the same time and free of each other and eternally inseparable i have my nirvanaand i have it all to myself but more than that it coincides with her nirvana  ah yes said aaron but i dont understand all that wordsplitting  i do though you learn to be quite alone and possess your own soul in isolationand at the same time to be perfectly with someone elsethats all i ask  sort of sit on a mountain top back to back with somebody else like a couple of idols  nobecause it isnt a case of sittingor a case of back to back its what you get to after a lot of fighting and a lot of sensual fulfilment and it never does away with the fighting and with the sensual passion it flowers on top of them and it would never flower save on top of them  what wouldnt  the possessing ones own souland the being together with someone else in silence beyond speech  and youve got them  ive got a bit of the real quietness inside me  so has a dog on a mat  so i believe too  or a man in a pub  which i dont believe  you prefer the dog  maybe  there was silence for a few moments  and im the man in the pub said aaron  you arent the dog on the mat anyhow  and youre the idol on the mountain top worshipping yourself  you talk to me like a woman aaron  how do you talk to me do you think  how do i  are the potatoes done  lilly turned quickly aside and switched on the electric light everything changed aaron sat still before the fire irritated lilly went about preparing the supper  the room was pleasant at night two tall dark screens hid the two beds in front the piano was littered with music the desk littered with papers lilly went out on to the landing and set the chops to grill on the gas stove hastily he put a small table on the hearthrug spread it with a blueandwhite cloth set plates and glasses aaron did not move it was not his nature to concern himself with domestic mattersand lilly did it best alone  the two men had an almost uncanny understanding of one anotherlike brothers they came from the same district from the same class each might have been born into the others circumstance like brothers there was a profound hostility between them but hostility is not antipathy  lillys skilful housewifery always irritated aaron it was so selfsufficient but most irritating of all was the little mans unconscious assumption of priority lilly was actually unaware that he assumed this quiet predominance over others he mashed the potatoes he heated the plates he warmed the red wine he whisked eggs into the milk pudding and served his visitor like a housemaid but none of this detracted from the silent assurance with which he bore himself and with which he seemed to domineer over his acquaintance  at last the meal was ready lilly drew the curtains switched off the central light put the greenshaded electric lamp on the table and the two men drew up to the meal it was good food well cooked and hot certainly lillys hands were no longer clean but it was clean dirt as he said  aaron sat in the low armchair at table so his face was below in the full light lilly sat high on a small chair so that his face was in the green shadow aaron was handsome and always had that peculiar welldressed look of his type lilly was indifferent to his own appearance and his collar was a rag  so the two men ate in silence they had been together alone for a fortnight only but it was like a small eternity aaron was well nowonly he suffered from the depression and the sort of fear that follows influenza  when are you going he asked irritably looking up at lilly whose face hovered in that green shadow above and worried him  one day next week theyll send me a telegram not later than thursday  youre looking forward to going the question was half bitter  yes i want to get a new tune out of myself  had enough of this  yes  a flush of anger came on aarons face  youre easily on and easily off he said rather insulting  am i said lilly what makes you think so  circumstances replied aaron sourly  to which there was no answer the host cleared away the plates and put the pudding on the table he pushed the bowl to aaron  i suppose i shall never see you again once youve gone said aaron  its your choice i will leave you an address  after this the pudding was eaten in silence  besides aaron said lilly drinking his last sip of wine what do you care whether you see me again or not what do you care whether you see anybody again or not you want to be amused and now youre irritated because you think i am not going to amuse you any more and you dont know who is going to amuse you i admit its a dilemma but its a hedonistic dilemma of the commonest sort  i dont know hedonistic and supposing i am as you sayare you any different  no im not very different but i always persuade myself theres a bit of difference do you know what josephine ford confessed to me shes had her lovers enough there isnt any such thing as love lilly she said men are simply afraid to be alone that is absolutely all there is in it fear of being alone  what by that said aaron  you agree  yes on the whole  so do ion the whole and then i asked her what about woman and then she said with a woman it wasnt fear it was just boredom a woman is like a violinist any fiddle any instrument rather than empty hands and no tune going  yeswhat i said before getting as much amusement out of life as possible said aaron  you amuse meand ill amuse you  yesjust about that  all right aaron said lilly im not going to amuse you or try to amuse you any more  going to try somebody else and malta  malta anyhow  oh and somebody elsein the next five minutes  yesthat also  goodbye and good luck to you  goodbye and good luck to you aaron  with which lilly went aside to wash the dishes aaron sat alone under the zone of light turning over a score of pelleas though the noise of london was around them it was far below and in the room was a deep silence each of the men seemed invested in his own silence  aaron suddenly took his flute and began trying little passages from the opera on his knee he had not played since his illness the noise came out a little tremulous but low and sweet lilly came forward with a plate and a cloth in his hand  aarons rod is putting forth again he said smiling  what said aaron looking up  i said aarons rod is putting forth again  what rod  your flute for the moment  its got to put forth my bread and butter  is that all the buds its going to have  what else  naythats for you to show what flowers do you imagine came out of the rod of mosess brother  scarlet runners i should think if hed got to live on them  scarlet enough ill bet  aaron turned unnoticing back to his music lilly finished the wiping of the dishes then took a book and sat on the other side of the table  its all one to you then said aaron suddenly whether we ever see one another again  not a bit said lilly looking up over his spectacles i very much wish there might be something that held us together  then if you wish it why isnt there  you might wish your flute to put out scarletrunner flowers at the joints  ayi might and it would be all the same  the moment of silence that followed was extraordinary in its hostility  oh we shall run across one another again some time said aaron  sure said lilly more than that ill write you an address that will always find me and when you write i will answer you  he took a bit of paper and scribbled an address aaron folded it and put it into his waistcoat pocket it was an italian address  but how can i live in italy he said you can shift about im tied to a job  youwith your budding rod your fluteand your charmyou can always do as you like  my what  your flute and your charm  what charm  just your own dont pretend you dont know youve got it i dont really like charm myself too much of a trick about it but whether or not youve got it  its news to me  not it  fact it is  ha somebody will always take a fancy to you and you can live on that as well as on anything else  why do you always speak so despisingly  why shouldnt i  have you any right to despise another man  when did it go by rights  no not with you  you answer me like a woman aaron  again there was a space of silence and again it was aaron who at last broke it  were in different positions you and me he said  how  you can live by your writingbut ive got to have a job  is that all said lilly  ay and plenty youve got the advantage of me  quite said lilly but why i was a dirtynosed little boy when you were a cleannosed little boy and i always had more patches on my breeches than you neat patches too my poor mother so whats the good of talking about advantages you had the start and at this very moment you could buy me up lock stock and barrel so dont feel hard done by its a lie  youve got your freedom  i make it and i take it  circumstances make it for you  as you like  you dont do a man justice said aaron  does a man care  he might  then hes no man  thanks again old fellow  welcome said lilly grimacing  again aaron looked at him baffled almost with hatred lilly grimaced at the blank wall opposite and seemed to ruminate then he went back to his book and no sooner had he forgotten aaron reading the fantasies of a certain leo frobenius than aaron must stride in again  you cant say there isnt a difference between your position and mine he said pertinently  lilly looked darkly over his spectacles  no by god he said i should be in a poor way otherwise  you cant say you havent the advantageyour job gives you the advantage  all right then leave it out with my job and leave me alone  thats your way of dodging it  my dear aaron i agree with you perfectly there is no difference between us save the fictitious advantage given to me by my job save for my jobwhich is to write liesaaron and i are two identical little men in one and the same little boat shall we leave it at that now  yes said aaron thats about it  let us shake hands on itand go to bed my dear chap you are just recovering from influenza and look paler than i like  you mean you want to be rid of me said aaron  yes i do mean that said lilly  ay said aaron  and after a few minutes more staring at the score of pelleas he rose put the score away on the piano laid his flute beside it and retired behind the screen in silence the strange dim noise of london sounding from below lilly read on about the kabyles his soul had the faculty of divesting itself of the moment and seeking further deeper interests these old africans and atlantis strange strange wisdom of the kabyles old old dark africa and the world before the flood how jealous aaron seemed the child of a jealous god a jealous god could any race be anything but despicable with such an antecedent  but no persistent as a jealous god himself aaron reappeared in his pyjamas and seated himself in his chair  what is the difference then between you and me lilly he said  havent we shaken hands on ita difference of jobs  you dont believe that though do you  nay now i reckon youre trespassing  why am i i know you dont believe it  what do i believe then said lilly  you believe you know something better than meand that you are something better than me dont you  do you believe it  what  that i am something better than you and that i know something better  no because i dont see it said aaron  then if you dont see it it isnt there so go to bed and sleep the sleep of the just and the convalescent i am not to be badgered any more  am i badgering you said aaron  indeed you are  so im in the wrong again  once more my dear  youre a godalmighty in your way you know  so long as im not in anybody elses wayanyhow youd be much better sleeping the sleep of the just and im going out for a minute or two dont catch cold there with nothing on  i want to catch the post he added rising  aaron looked up at him quickly but almost before there was time to speak lilly had slipped into his hat and coat seized his letters and gone  it was a rainy night lilly turned down king street to walk to charing cross he liked being out of doors he liked to post his letters at charing cross post office he did not want to talk to aaron any more he was glad to be alone  he walked quickly down villiers street to the river to see it flowing blackly towards the sea it had an endless fascination for him never failed to soothe him and give him a sense of liberty he liked the night the dark rain the river and even the traffic he enjoyed the sense of friction he got from the streaming of people who meant nothing to him it was like a fox slipping alert among unsuspecting cattle  when he got back he saw in the distance the lights of a taxi standing outside the building where he lived and heard a thumping and hallooing he hurried forward  it was a man called herbertson  oh why there you are exclaimed herbertson as lilly drew near can i come up and have a chat  ive got that man whos had flu i should think he is gone to bed  oh the disappointment was plain well look here ill just come up for a couple of minutes he laid his hand on lillys arm i heard you were going away where are you going  malta  malta oh i know malta very well well now itll be all right if i come up for a minute im not going to see much more of you apparently he turned quickly to the taxi what is it on the clock  the taxi was paid the two men went upstairs aaron was in bed but he called as lilly entered the room  hullo said lilly not asleep captain herbertson has come in for a minute  hope i shant disturb you said captain herbertson laying down his stick and gloves and his cap he was in uniform he was one of the few surviving officers of the guards a man of about fortyfive goodlooking getting rather stout he settled himself in the chair where aaron had sat hitching up his trousers the gold identity plate with its gold chain fell conspicuously over his wrist  been to rosemary he said rotten play you knowbut passes the time awfully well oh i quite enjoyed it  lilly offered him sauternethe only thing in the house  oh yes how awfully nice yes thanks i shall love it can i have it with soda thanks do you know i think thats the very best drink in the tropics sweet white wine with soda yeswell wellnow why are you going away  for a change said lilly  youre quite right one needs a change now the damned thing is all over as soon as i get out of khaki i shall be off malta yes ive been in malta several times i think valletta is quite enjoyable particularly in winter with the opera oherhows your wife all right yesglad to see her people again bound to be oh by the way i met jim bricknell sends you a message hoping youll go down and staydown at captain binghams place in surrey you know awfully queer lot down there not my sort no you wont go down no i shouldnt not the right sort of people  herbertson rattled away rather spasmodic he had been through the very front hell of the warand like every man who had he had the war at the back of his mind like an obsession but in the meantime he skirmished  yes i was on guard one day when the queen gave one of her teaparties to the blind awful affair but the children are awfully nice children prince of wales awfully nice almost too nice prince henry smart boy toooh a smart boy queen mary poured the tea and i handed round bread and butter she told me i made a very good waiter i said thank you madam but i like the children very different from the battenbergs oh he wrinkled his nose i cant stand the battenbergs  mount battens said lilly  yes awful mistake changing the royal name they were guelfs why not remain it why ill tell you what battenberg did he was in the guards too  the talk flowed on about royalty and the guards buckingham palace and st james  rather a nice story about queen victoria man named joyce something or other often used to dine at the palace and he was an awfully good imitatorreally clever you know used to imitate the queen mr joyce she said i hear your imitation is very amusing will you do it for us now and let us see what it is like oh no madam im afraid i couldnt do it now im afraid im not in the humour but she would have him do it and it was really awfully funny he had to do it you know what he did he used to take a tablenapkin and put it on with one corner over his forehead and the rest hanging down behind like her veil thing and then he sent for the kettlelid he always had the kettlelid for that little crown of hers and then he impersonated her but he was awfully goodso clever mr joyce she said we are not amused please leave the room yes that is exactly what she said we are not amusedplease leave the room i like the we dont you and he a man of sixty or so however he left the room and for a fortnight or so he wasnt invitedwasnt she wonderfulqueen victoria  and so by light transitions to the prince of wales at the front and thus into the trenches and then herbertson was on the subject he was obsessed by he had come unconsciously for this and this only to talk war to lilly or at lilly for the latter listened and watched and said nothing as a man at night helplessly takes a taxi to find some woman some prostitute herbertson had almost unthinkingly got into a taxi and come battering at the door in covent garden only to talk war to lilly whom he knew very little but it was a driving instinctto come and get it off his chest  and on and on he talked over his wine and soda he was not conceitedhe was not showing offfar from it it was the same thing here in this officer as it was with the privates and the same with this englishman as with a frenchman or a german or an italian lilly had sat in a cowshed listening to a youth in the north country he had sat on the cornstraw that the oxen had been treading out in calabria under the moon he had sat in a farmkitchen with a german prisoner and every time it was the same thing the same hot blind anguished voice of a man who has seen too much experienced too much and doesnt know where to turn none of the glamour of returned heroes none of the romance of war only a hot blind mesmerised voice going on and on mesmerised by a vision that the soul cannot bear  in this officer of course there was a lightness and an appearance of bright diffidence and humour but underneath it all was the same as in the common men of all the combatant nations the hot seared burn of unbearable experience which did not heal nor cool and whose irritation was not to be relieved the experience gradually cooled on top but only with a surface crust the soul did not heal did not recover  i used to be awfully frightened laughed herbertson now you say lilly youd never have stood it but you would youre nervousand it was just the nervous ones that did stand it when nearly all our officers were gone we had a man come outa man called margeritson from indiabig merchant people out there they all said he was no goodnot a bit of goodnervous chap no good at all but when you had to get out of the trench and go for the germans he was perfectperfectit all came to him then at the crisis and he was perfect  some things frighten one man and some another now shells would never frighten me but i couldnt stand bombs you could tell the difference between our machines and the germans ours was a steady noisedrrrrrrrrbut theirs was heavy drrrrrururrrrruru my word that got on my nerves  no i was never hit the nearest thing was when i was knocked down by an exploding shellseveral times thatyou know when you shout like mad for the men to come and dig you out under all the earth and my word you do feel frightened then herbertson laughed with a twinkling motion to lilly but between his brows there was a tension like madness  and a funny thing you knowhow you dont notice things inlet me see1916 the german guns were a lot better than ours ours were old and when theyre old you cant tell where theyll hit whether theyll go beyond the mark or whether theyll fall short well this day our guns were firing short and killing our own men wed had the order to charge and were running forward and i suddenly felt hot water spurting on my neck he put his hand to the back of his neck and glanced round apprehensively it was a chap called innesoh an awfully decent sortpeople were in the argentine hed been calling out to me as we were running and i was just answering when i felt this hot water on my neck and saw him running past me with no headhed got no head and he went running past me i dont know how far but a long way blood you knowyeswell  oh i hated chelseai loathed chelseachelsea was purgatory to me i had a corporal called wallacehe was a fine chapoh he was a fine chapsix foot twoand about twentyfour years old he was my standback oh i hated chelsea and parades and drills you know when its drill and youre giving orders you forget what order youve just givenin front of the palace there the crowd dont noticebut its awful for you and you know you darent look round to see what the men are doing but wallace was splendid he was just behind me and id hear him quite quiet you know its right wheel sir always perfect always perfectyeswell  you know you dont get killed if you dont think you will now i never thought i should get killed and i never knew a man get killed if he hadnt been thinking he would i said to wallace id rather be out here at the front than at chelsea i hated chelseai cant tell you how much oh no sir he said id rather be at chelsea than here id rather be at chelsea there isnt hell like this at chelsea wed had orders that we were to go back to the real camp the next day never mind wallace i said we shall be out of this hellonearth tomorrow and he took my hand we werent much for showing feeling or anything in the guards but he took my hand and we climbed out to chargepoor fellow he was killed herbertson dropped his head and for some moments seemed to go unconscious as if struck then he lifted his face and went on in the same animated chatty fashion you see he had a presentiment im sure he had a presentiment none of the men got killed unless they had a presentimentlike that you know  herbertson nodded keenly at lilly with his sharp twinkling yet obsessed eyes lilly wondered why he made the presentiment responsible for the deathwhich he obviously didand not vice versa herbertson implied every time that youd never get killed if you could keep yourself from having a presentiment perhaps there was something in it perhaps the soul issues its own ticket of death when it can stand no more surely life controls life and not accident  its a funny thing what shock will do we had a sergeant and he shouted to me both his feet were offboth his feet clean at the ankle i gave him morphia you know officers arent allowed to use the needlemight give the man blood poisoning you give those tabloids they say they act in a few minutes but they dont its a quarter of an hour and nothing is more demoralising than when you have a man wounded you know and crying out well this man i gave him the morphia before he got over the stunning you know so he didnt feel the pain well they carried him in i always used to like to look after my men so i went next morning and i found he hadnt been removed to the clearing station i got hold of the doctor and i said look here why hasnt this man been taken to the clearing station i used to get excited but after some years theyd got used to me dont get excited herbertson the mans dying but i said hes just been talking to me as strong as you are and he hadhed talk as strong and well as you or me then go quiet for a bit i said i gave him the morphia before he came round from the stunning so hed felt nothing but in two hours he was dead the doctor says that the shock does it like that sometimes you can do nothing for them nothing vital is injuredand yet the life is broken in them nothing can be donefunny thingmust be something in the brain  its obviously not the brain said lilly its deeper than the brain  deeper said herbertson nodding  funny thing where life is we had a lieutenant you know we all buried our own dead well he looked as if he was asleep most of the chaps looked like that herbertson closed his eyes and laid his face aside like a man asleep and dead peacefully you very rarely see a man dead with any other look on his faceyou know the other look and he clenched his teeth with a sudden momentaneous ghastly distortionwell youd never have known this chap was dead he had a wound herein the back of the headand a bit of blood on his handand nothing else nothing well i said wed give him a decent burial he lay there waitingand theyd wrapped him in a filthy blanketyou know well i said he should have a proper blanket hed been dead lying there a day and a half you know so i went and got a blanket a beautiful blanket out of his private kithis people were scotch wellknown familyand i got the pins you know ready to pin him up properly for the scots guards to bury him and i thought hed be stiff you see but when i took him by the arms to lift him on he sat up it gave me an awful shock why hes alive i said but they said he was dead i couldnt believe it it gave me an awful shock he was as flexible as you or me and looked as if he was asleep you couldnt believe he was dead but we pinned him up in his blanket it was an awful shock to me i couldnt believe a man could be like that after hed been dead two days  the germans were wonderful with the machine gunsits a wicked thing a machine gun but they couldnt touch us with the bayonet every time the men came back they had bayonet practice and they got awfully good you know when you thrust at the germanssoif you miss him you bring your rifle back sharp with a round swing so that the butt comes up and hits up under the jaw its one movement following on with the stab you see if you miss him it was too quick for thembut bayonet charge was worst you know because your man cries out when you catch him when you get him you know thats what does you  no oh no this was no war like other wars all the machinery of it no you couldnt stand it but for the men the men are wonderful you know theyll be wiped out no its your men who keep you going if youre an officer but therell never be another war like this because the germans are the only people who could make a war like thisand i dont think theyll ever do it again do you  oh they were wonderful the germans they were amazing it was incredible what they invented and did we had to learn from them in the first two years but they were too methodical thats why they lost the war they were too methodical theyd fire their guns every ten minutesregular think of it of course we knew when to run and when to lie down you got so that you knew almost exactly what theyd doif youd been out long enough and then you could time what you wanted to do yourselves  they were a lot more nervous than we were at the last they sent up enough light at night from their trenchesyou know those things that burst in the air like electric lightwe had none of that to dothey did it all for uslit up everything they were more nervous than we were  it was nearly two oclock when herbertson left lilly depressed remained before the fire aaron got out of bed and came uneasily to the fire  it gives me the bellyache that damned war he said  so it does me said lilly all unreal  real enough for those that had to go through it  no least of all for them said lilly sullenly not as real as a bad dream why the hell dont they wake up and realise it  thats a fact said aaron theyre hypnotised by it  and they want to hypnotise me and i wont be hypnotised the war was a lie and is a lie and will go on being a lie till somebody busts it  it was a factyou cant bust that you cant bust the fact that it happened  yes you can it never happened it never happened to me no more than my dreams happen my dreams dont happen they only seem  but the war did happen right enough smiled aaron palely  no it didnt not to me or to any man in his own self it took place in the automatic sphere like dreams do but the actual man in every man was just absentasleepor druggedinertdreamlogged thats it  you tell em so said aaron  i do but its no good because they wont wake up now evenperhaps never theyll all kill themselves in their sleep  they wouldnt be any better if they did wake up and be themselvesthat is supposing they are asleep which i cant see they are what they areand theyre all alikeand never very different from what they are now  lilly stared at aaron with black eyes  do you believe in them less than i do aaron he asked slowly  i dont even want to believe in them  but in yourself lilly was almost wistfuland aaron uneasy  i dont know that ive any more right to believe in myself than in them he replied lilly watched and pondered  no he said thats not truei knew the war was false humanly quite false i always knew it was false the germans were false we were false everybody was false  and not you asked aaron shrewishly  there was a wakeful selfpossessed bit of me which knew that the war and all that horrible movement was false for me and so i wasnt going to be dragged in the germans could have shot my mother or me or what they liked i wouldnt have joined the war i would like to kill my enemy but become a bit of that huge obscene machine they called the war that i never would no not if i died ten deaths and had eleven mothers violated but i would like to kill my enemy oh yes more than one enemy but not as a unit in a vast obscene mechanism that never no never  poor lilly was too earnest and vehement aaron made a fine nose it seemed to him like a lot of words and a bit of wriggling out of a hole  well he said youve got men and nations and youve got the machines of warso how are you going to get out of it league of nations  damn all leagues damn all masses and groups anyhow all i want is to get myself out of their horrible heap to get out of the swarm the swarm to me is nightmare and nullityhorrible helpless writhing in a dream i want to get myself awake out of it allall that massconsciousness all that massactivityits the most horrible nightmare to me no man is awake and himself no man who was awake and in possession of himself would use poison gases no man his own awake self would scorn such a thing its only when the ghastly mobsleep the dream helplessness of the masspsyche overcomes him that he becomes completely base and obscene  hawell said aaron its the wideawake ones that invent the poison gas and use it where should we be without it  lilly started went stiff and hostile  do you mean that aaron he said looking into aarons face with a hard inflexible look  aaron turned aside half sheepishly  thats how it looks on the face of it isnt it he said  look here my friend its too late for you to be talking to me about the face of things if thats how you feel put your things on and follow herbertson yesgo out of my room i dont put up with the face of things here  aaron looked at him in cold amazement  itll do tomorrow morning wont it he asked rather mocking  yes said lilly coldly but please go tomorrow morning  oh ill go all right said aaron everybodys got to agree with youthats your price  but lilly did not answer aaron turned into bed his satirical smile under his nose somewhat surprised however at this sudden turn of affairs  as he was just going to sleep dismissing the matter lilly came once more to his bedside and said in a hard voice  im not going to pretend to have friends on the face of things no and i dont have friends who dont fundamentally agree with me a friend means one who is at one with me in matters of life and death and if youre at one with all the rest then youre their friend not mine so be their friend and please leave me in the morning you owe me nothing you have nothing more to do with me i have had enough of these friendships where i pay the piper and the mob calls the tune  let me tell you moreover your heroic herbertsons lost us more than ever they won a brave ant is a damned cowardly individual your heroic officers are a sad sight afterwards when they come home bah your herbertson the only justification for war is what we learn from it and what have they learntwhy did so many of them have presentiments as he called it because they could feel inside them there was nothing to come after there was no lifecourage only deathcourage nothing beyond this hellonly death or lovelanguishing  what could they have seen anyhow said aaron  its not what you see actually its the kind of spirit you keep inside you the life spirit when wallace had presentiments herbertson being officer should have said none of that wallace you and i weve got to live and make life smokeinstead of which he let wallace be killed and his own heart be broken always the deathchoice and we wont we simply will not face the world as weve made it and our own souls as we find them and take the responsibility well never get anywhere till we stand up man to man and face everything out and break the old forms but never let our own pride and courage of life be broken  lilly broke off and went silently to bed aaron turned over to sleep rather resenting the sound of so many words what difference did it make anyhow in the morning however when he saw the other mans pale closed rather haughty face he realised that something had happened lilly was courteous and even affable but with a curious cold space between him and aaron breakfast passed and aaron knew that he must leave there was something in lillys bearing which just showed him the door in some surprise and confusion and in some anger not unmingled with humorous irony he put his things in his bag he put on his hat and coat lilly was seated rather stiffly writing  well said aaron i suppose we shall meet again  oh sure to said lilly rising from his chair we are sure to run across one another  when are you going asked aaron  in a few days time  oh well ill run in and see you before you go shall i  yes do  lilly escorted his guest to the top of the stairs shook hands and then returned into his own room closing the door on himself  aaron did not find his friend at home when he called he took it rather as a slap in the face but then he knew quite well that lilly had made a certain call on his aarons soul a call which he aaron did not at all intend to obey if in return the soulcaller chose to shut his streetdoor in the face of the worldfriendwell let it be quits he was not sure whether he felt superior to his unworldly enemy or not he rather thought he did     chapter xi more pillar of salt   the opera season ended aaron was invited by cyril scott to join a group of musical people in a village by the sea he accepted and spent a pleasant month it pleased the young men musicallyinclined and bohemian by profession to patronise the flautist whom they declared marvellous bohemians with welltodo parents they could already afford to squander a little spasmodic and selfgratifying patronage and aaron did not mind being patronised he had nothing else to do  but the party broke up early in september the flautist was detained a few days at a country house for the amusement of the guests then he left for london  in london he found himself at a loose end a certain fretful dislike of the patronage of indifferent young men younger than himself and a certain distaste for regular work in the orchestra made him look round he wanted something else he wanted to disappear again qualms and emotions concerning his abandoned family overcame him the early delicate autumn affected him he took a train to the midlands  and again just after dark he strolled with his little bag across the field which lay at the end of his garden it had been mown and the grass was already growing long he stood and looked at the line of back windows lighted once more he smelled the scents of autumn phlox and moist old vegetation and corn in sheaf a nostalgia which was half at least revulsion affected him the place the home at once fascinated and revolted him  sitting in his shed he scrutinised his garden carefully in the starlight there were two rows of beans rather disshevelled near at hand the marrow plants sprawled from their old bed he could detect the perfume of a few carnations he wondered who it was had planted the garden during his long absence anyhow there it was planted and fruited and waning into autumn  the blind was not drawn it was eight oclock the children were going to bed aaron waited in his shed his bowels stirred with violent but only halfadmitted emotions there was his wife slim and graceful holding a little mug to the babys mouth and the baby was drinking she looked lonely wild emotions attacked his heart there was going to be a wild and emotional reconciliation  was there it seemed like something fearful and imminent a passion arose in him a craving for the violent emotional reconciliation he waited impatiently for the children to be gone to bed gnawed with restless desire  he heard the clock strike nine then halfpast from the village behind the children would be asleep his wife was sitting sewing some little frock he went lingering down the garden path stooping to lift the fallen carnations to see how they were there were many flowers but small he broke one off then threw it away the golden rod was out even in the little lawn there were asters as of old  his wife started to listen hearing his step he was filled with a violent conflict of tenderness like a sickness he hesitated tapping at the door and entered his wife started to her feet at bay  what have you come for was her involuntary ejaculation  but he with the familiar odd jerk of his head towards the garden asked with a faint smile  who planted the garden  and he felt himself dropping into the twang of the vernacular which he had discarded  lottie only stood and stared at him objectively she did not think to answer he took his hat off and put it on the dresser again the familiar act maddened her  what have you come for she cried again with a voice full of hate or perhaps it was fear and doubt and even hope as well he heard only hate  this time he turned to look at her the old dagger was drawn in her  i wonder he said myself  then she recovered herself and with trembling hand picked up her sewing again but she still stood at bay beyond the table she said nothing he feeling tired sat down on the chair nearest the door but he reached for his hat and kept it on his knee she as she stood there unnaturally went on with her sewing there was silence for some time curious sensations and emotions went through the mans frame seeming to destroy him they were like electric shocks which he felt she emitted against him and an old sickness came in him again he had forgotten it it was the sickness of the unrecognised and incomprehensible strain between him and her  after a time she put down her sewing and sat again in her chair  do you know how vilely youve treated me she said staring across the space at him he averted his face  yet he answered not without irony  i suppose so  and why she cried i should like to know why  he did not answer the way she rushed in made him go vague  justify yourself say why youve been so vile to me say what you had against me she demanded  what i had against her he mused to himself and he wondered that she used the past tense he made no answer  accuse me she insisted say what ive done to make you treat me like this say it you must think it hard enough  nay he said i dont think it  this speech by which he merely meant that he did not trouble to formulate any injuries he had against her puzzled her  dont come pretending you love me now its too late she said with contempt yet perhaps also hope  you might wait till i start pretending he said  this enraged her  you vile creature she exclaimed go what have you come for  to look at you he said sarcastically  after a few minutes she began to cry sobbing violently into her apron and again his bowels stirred and boiled  what have i done what have i done i dont know what ive done that he should be like this to me she sobbed into her apron it was childish and perhaps true at least it was true from the childish part of her nature he sat gloomy and uneasy  she took the apron from her tearstained face and looked at him it was true in her moments of roused exposure she was a beautiful womana beautiful woman at this moment with her flushed tearstained wilful distress she was beautiful  tell me she challenged tell me tell me what ive done tell me what you have against me tell me  watching like a lynx she saw the puzzled hurt look in his face telling isnt so easyespecially when the trouble goes too deep for conscious comprehension he couldnt tell what he had against her and he had not the slightest intention of doing what she would have liked him to do starting to pile up detailed grievances he knew the detailed grievances were nothing in themselves  you cant she cried vindictively you cant you cant find anything real to bring against me though youd like to youd like to be able to accuse me of something but you cant because you know there isnt anything  she watched him watched and he sat in the chair near the door without moving  youre unnatural thats what you are she cried youre unnatural youre not a man you havent got a mans feelings youre nasty and cold and unnatural and youre a coward youre a coward you run away from me without telling me what youve got against me  when youve had enough you go away and you dont care what you do he said epigrammatic  she paused a moment  enough of what she said what have you had enough of of me and your children its a nice manly thing to say havent i loved you havent i loved you for twelve years and worked and slaved for you and tried to keep you right heaven knows where youd have been but for me evil as you are at the bottom youre evil thats what it isand weak youre too weak to love a woman and give her what she wants too weak unmanly and cowardly he runs away  no wonder he said  no she cried it is no wonder with a nature like yours weak and unnatural and evil it is no wonder  she became quietand then started to cry again into her apron aaron waited he felt physically weak  and who knows what youve been doing all these months she wept who knows all the vile things youve been doing and youre the father of my childrenthe father of my little girlsand who knows what vile things hes guilty of all these months  i shouldnt let my imagination run away with me he answered ive been playing the flute in the orchestra of one of the theatres in london  ha she cried its more than that dont think im going to believe you i know you with your smoothsounding lies youre a liar as you know and i know youve been doing other things besides play a flute in an orchestra youas if i dont know you and then coming crawling back to me with your lies and your pretense dont think im taken in  i should be sorry he said  coming crawling back to me and expecting to be forgiven she went on but noi dont forgiveand i cant forgivenevernot as long as i live shall i forgive what youve done to me  you can wait till youre asked anyhow he said  and you can wait she said and you shall wait she took up her sewing and stitched steadily as if calmly anyone glancing in would have imagined a quiet domestic hearth at that moment he too feeling physically weak remained silent feeling his soul absent from the scene  again she suddenly burst into tears weeping bitterly  and the children she sobbed rocking herself with grief and chagrin what have i been able to say to the childrenwhat have i been able to tell them  what have you told them he asked coldly  i told them youd gone away to work she sobbed laying her head on her arms on the table what else could i tell them i couldnt tell them the vile truth about their father i couldnt tell them how evil you are she sobbed and moaned  he wondered what exactly the vile truth would have been had she started to tell it and he began to feel coldly and cynically that among all her distress there was a luxuriating in the violent emotions of the scene in hand and the situation altogether  then again she became quiet and picked up her sewing she stitched quietly wistfully for some time then she looked up at hima long look of reproach and sombre accusation and wifely tenderness he turned his face aside  you know youve been wrong to me dont you she said half wistfully half menacing  he felt her wistfulness and her menace tearing him in his bowels and loins  you do know dont you she insisted still with the wistful appeal and the veiled threat  you do or you would answer she said youve still got enough thats right in you for you to know  she waited he sat still as if drawn by hot wires  then she slipped across to him put her arms round him sank on her knees at his side and sank her face against his thigh  say you know how wrong you are say you know how cruel youve been to me she pleaded but under her female pleading and appeal he felt the iron of her threat  you do know it she murmured looking up into his face as she crouched by his knee you do know it i can see in your eyes that you know it and why have you come back to me if you dont know it why have you come back to me tell me her arms gave him a sharp compulsory little clutch round the waist tell me tell me she murmured with all her appeal liquid in her throat  but him it half overcame and at the same time horrified he had a certain horror of her the strange liquid sound of her appeal seemed to him like the swaying of a serpent which mesmerises the fated fluttering helpless bird she clasped her arms round him she drew him to her she half roused his passion at the same time she coldly horrified and repelled him he had not the faintest feeling at the moment of his own wrong but she wanted to win his own selfbetrayal out of him he could see himself as the fascinated victim falling to this cajoling awful woman the wife of his bosom but as well he had a soul outside himself which looked on the whole scene with cold revulsion and which was as unchangeable as time  no he said i dont feel wrong  you do she said giving him a sharp admonitory clutch you do only youre silly and obstinate babyish and silly and obstinate an obstinate little boyyou do feel wrong and you are wrong and youve got to say it  but quietly he disengaged himself and got to his feet his face pale and set obstinate as she said he put his hat on and took his little bag she watched him curiously still crouching by his chair  ill go he said putting his hand on the latch  suddenly she sprang to her feet and clutched him by the shirtneck her hand inside his soft collar half strangling him  you villain she said and her face was transfigured with passion as he had never seen it before horrible you villain she said thickly what have you come here for  his soul went black as he looked at her he broke her hand away from his shirt collar bursting the studholes she recoiled in silence and in one black unconscious movement he was gone down the garden and over the fence and across the country swallowed in a black unconsciousness  she realising sank upon the hearthrug and lay there curled upon herself she was defeated but she too would never yield she lay quite motionless for some time then she got up feeling the draught on the floor she closed the door and drew down the blind then she looked at her wrist which he had gripped and which pained her then she went to the mirror and looked for a long time at her white strained determined face come life come death she too would never yield and she realised now that he would never yield  she was faint with weariness and would be glad to get to bed and sleep  aaron meanwhile had walked across the country and was looking for a place to rest he found a cornfield with a halfbuilt stack and sheaves in stook ten to one some tramp would have found the stack he threw a dozen sheaves together and lay down looking at the stars in the september sky he too would never yield the illusion of love was gone for ever love was a battle in which each party strove for the mastery of the others soul so far man had yielded the mastery to woman now he was fighting for it back again and too late for the woman would never yield  but whether woman yielded or not he would keep the mastery of his own soul and conscience and actions he would never yield himself up to her judgment again he would hold himself forever beyond her jurisdiction  henceforth life single not life double  he looked at the sky and thanked the universe for the blessedness of being alone in the universe to be alone to be oneself not to be driven or violated into something which is not oneself surely it is better than anything he thought of lottie and knew how much more truly herself she was when she was alone with no man to distort her and he was thankful for the division between them such scenes as the last were too horrible and unreal  as for future unions too soon to think about it let there be clean and pure division first perfected singleness that is the only way to final living unison through sheer finished singleness     chapter xii novara   having no job for the autumn aaron fidgetted in london he played at some concerts and some private shows he was one of an odd quartette for example which went to play to lady artemis hooper when she lay in bed after her famous escapade of falling through the window of her taxicab aaron had that curious knack which belongs to some people of getting into the swim without knowing he was doing it lady artemis thought his flute lovely and had him again to play for her aaron looked at her and she at him she as she reclined there in bed in a sort of halflight well madeup smoking her cigarettes and talking in a rather raucous voice making her slightly rasping witty comments to the other men in the roomof course there were other men the audiencewas a shock to the flautist this was the bride of the moment curious how raucous her voice sounded out of the cigarette smoke yet he liked herthe reckless note of the modern social freebooter in himself was a touch of the same quality  do you love playing she asked him  yes he said with that shadow of irony which seemed like a smile on his face  live for it so to speak she said  i make my living by it he said  but thats not really how you take it she said he eyed her she watched him over her cigarette it was a personal moment  i dont think about it he said  im sure you dont you wouldnt be so good if you did youre awfully lucky you know to be able to pour yourself down your flute  you think i go down easy he laughed  ah she replied flicking her cigarette broadcast thats the point what should you say jimmy she turned to one of the men he screwed his eyeglass nervously and stiffened himself to look at her  ii shouldnt like to say offhand came the smallvoiced selfconscious answer and jimmy bridled himself and glanced at aaron  do you find it a tight squeeze then she said turning to aaron once more  no i cant say that he answered what of me goes down goes down easy enough its what doesnt go down  and how much is that she asked eying him  a good bit maybe he said  slops over so to speak she retorted sarcastically and which do you enjoy more trickling down your flute or slopping over on to the lap of mother earthof miss more probably  depends he said  having got him a few steps too far upon the personal ground she left him to get off by himself  so he found london got on his nerves he felt it rubbed him the wrong way he was flattered of course by his own successand felt at the same time irritated by it this state of mind was by no means acceptable wherever he was he liked to be given tacitly the first placeor a place among the first among the musical people he frequented he found himself on a callow kind of equality with everybody even the stars and aristocrats at one moment and a backstairs outsider the next it was all just as the moment demanded there was a certain excitement in slithering up and down the social scale one minute chatting in a personal teteatete with the most famous or notorious of the society beauties and the next walking in the rain with his flute in a bag to his grubby lodging in bloomsbury only the excitement roused all the savage sarcasm that lay at the bottom of his soul and which burned there like an unhealthy bile  therefore he determined to clear outto disappear he had a letter from lilly from novara lilly was drifting about aaron wrote to novara and asked if he should come to italy having no money to speak of come if you want to bring your flute and if youve no money put on a good suit of clothes and a big black hat and play outside the best cafe in any italian town and youll collect enough to get on with  it was a sporting chance aaron packed his bag and got a passport and wrote to lilly to say he would join him as invited at sir william franks he hoped lillys answer would arrive before he left london but it didnt  therefore behold our hero alighting at novara two hours late on a wet dark evening he hoped lilly would be there but nobody with some slight dismay he faced the big crowded station the stream of people carried him automatically through the barrier a porter having seized his bag and volleyed various unintelligible questions at him aaron understood not one word so he just wandered after the blue blouse of the porter  the porter deposited the bag on the steps of the station front fired off more questions and gesticulated into the halfilluminated space of darkness outside the station aaron decided it meant a cab so he nodded and said yes but there were no cabs so once more the bluebloused porter slung the big bag and the little bag on the strap over his shoulder and they plunged into the night towards some lights and a sort of theatre place  one carriage stood there in the rainyes and it was free  keb yesorrightsir wheto where you go sir william franks yes i know long way gogo long way sir william franks  the cabman spattered his few words of english aaron gave the porter an english shilling the porter let the coin lie in the middle of his palm as if it were a live beetle and darted to the light of the carriage to examine the beast exclaiming volubly the cabman wild with interest peered down from the box into the palm of the porter and carried on an impassioned dialogue aaron stood with one foot on the step  what you givehe one franc asked the driver  a shilling said aaron  one sheeling yes i know that one sheeling englishand the driver went off into impassioned exclamations in torinese the porter still muttering and holding his hand as if the coin might sting him filtered away  orright he knowsheelingorright english moneys eh yes he know you get up sir  and away went aaron under the hood of the carriage clattering down the wide darkness of novara over a bridge apparently past huge rainwet statues and through more rainy halflit streets  they stopped at last outside a sort of park wall with trees above the big gates were just beyond  sir william franksthere in a mixture of italian and english the driver told aaron to get down and ring the bell on the right aaron got down and in the darkness was able to read the name on the plate  how much said aaron to the driver  ten franc said the fat driver  but it was his turn now to screw down and scrutinise the pink tenshilling note he waved it in his hand  not good eh not good moneys  yes said aaron rather indignantly good english money ten shillings better than ten francs a good deal betterbetter  goodyou say ten sheeling the driver muttered and muttered as if dissatisfied but as a matter of fact he stowed the note in his waistcoat pocket with considerable satisfaction looked at aaron curiously and drove away  aaron stood there in the dark outside the big gates and wished himself somewhere else however he rang the bell there was a huge barking of dogs on the other side presently a light switched on and a woman followed by a man appeared cautiously in the halfopened doorway  sir william franks said aaron  si signore  and aaron stepped with his two bags inside the gate huge dogs jumped round he stood in the darkness under the trees at the foot of the park the woman fastened the gateaaron saw a doorand through an uncurtained window a man writing at a deskrather like the clerk in an hotel office he was going with his two bags to the open door when the woman stopped him and began talking to him in italian it was evident he must not go on so he put down the bags the man stood a few yards away watchfully  aaron looked down at the woman and tried to make out something of what she was saying but could not the dogs still barked spasmodically drops fell from the tall dark trees that rose overhead  is mr lilly here mr lilly he asked  signor lillee no signore  and off the woman went in italian but it was evident lilly was not at the house aaron wished more than ever he had not come but had gone to an hotel  he made out that the woman was asking him for his namemeester meester she kept saying with a note of interrogation  sisson mr sisson said aaron who was becoming impatient and he found a visiting card to give her she seemed appeasedsaid something about telephoneand left him standing  the rain had ceased but big drops were shaken from the dark high trees through the uncurtained window he saw the man at the desk reach the telephone there was a long pause at length the woman came back and motioned to him to go upup the drive which curved and disappeared under the dark trees  go up there said aaron pointing  that was evidently the intention so he picked up his bags and strode forward from out of the circle of electric light up the curved drive in the darkness it was a steep incline he saw trees and the grass slopes there was a tang of snow in the air  suddenly up ahead a brilliant light switched on he continued uphill through the trees along the path towards it and at length emerged at the foot of a great flight of steps above which was a wide glass entrance and an italian manservant in white gloves hovering as if on the brink  aaron emerged from the drive and climbed the steps the manservant came down two steps and took the little bag then he ushered aaron and the big bag into a large pillared hall with thick turkish carpet on the floor and handsome appointments it was spacious comfortable and warm but somewhat pretentious rather like the imposing hall into which the heroine suddenly enters on the film  aaron dropped his heavy bag with relief and stood there hat in hand in his damp overcoat in the circle of light looking vaguely at the yellow marble pillars the gilded arches above the shadowy distances and the great stairs the butler disappearedreappeared in another momentand through an open doorway came the host sir william was a small clean old man with a thin white beard and a courtly deportment wearing a black velvet dinner jacket faced with purple silk  how do you do mr sisson you come straight from england  sir william held out his hand courteously and benevolently smiling an old mans smile of hospitality  mr lilly has gone away said aaron  yes he left us several days ago  aaron hesitated  you didnt expect me then  yes oh yes yes oh yes very glad to see youwell now come in and have some dinner  at this moment lady franks appearedshort rather plump but erect and definite in a black silk dress and pearls round her throat  how do you do we are just at dinner she said you havent eaten nowell thenwould you like a bath now or  it was evident the franks had dispensed much hospitality much of it charitable aaron felt it  no he said ill wash my hands and come straight in shall i  yes perhaps that would be better  im afraid i am a nuisance  not at allbeppe and she gave instructions in italian  another footman appeared and took the big bag aaron took the little one this time they climbed the broad turning stairs crossed another handsome lounge gilt and ormolu and yellow silk chairs and scattered copies of the graphic or of country life then they disappeared through a doorway into a much narrower flight of stairs man can so rarely keep it up all the way the grandeur  two black and white chambermaids appeared aaron found himself in a blue silk bedroom and a footman unstrapping his bag which he did not want unstrapped next minute he was beckoned and allured by the italian servants down the corridor and presented to the handsome spacious bathroom which was warm and creamycoloured and glittering with massive silver and mysterious with uptodate conveniences there he was left to his own devices and felt like a small boy finding out how it works for even the mere turning on of the taps was a problem in silver mechanics  in spite of all the splendours and the elaborated convenience he washed himself in good hot water and wished he were having a bath chiefly because of the wardrobe of marvellous turkish towels then he clicked his way back to his bedroom changed his shirt and combed his hair in the blue silk bedroom with the greuze picture and felt a little dim and superficial surprise he had fallen into country house parties before but never into quite such a plushy sense of riches he felt he ought to have his breath taken away but alas the cinema has taken our breath away so often investing us in all the splendours of the splendidest american millionaire or all the heroics and marvels of the somme or the north pole that life has now no magnate richer than we no hero nobler than we have been on the film connu connu everything life has to offer is known to us couldnt be known better from the film  so aaron tied his tie in front of a big venice mirror and nothing was a surprise to him he found a footman hovering to escort him to the diningrooma real italian footman uneasy because miladys dinner was unsettled he entered the rather small diningroom and saw the people at table  he was told various names bowed to a young slim woman with big blue eyes and dark hair like a photograph then to a smaller rather colourless young woman with a large nose then to a stout rubicund bald colonel and to a tall thin oxfordlooking major with a black patch over his eyeboth these men in khaki finally to a goodlooking wellnourished young man in a dinnerjacket and he sat down to his soup on his hostess left hand the colonel sat on her right and was confidential little sir william with his hair and his beard white like spun glass his manner very courteous and animated the purple facings of his velvet jacket very impressive sat at the far end of the table jesting with the ladies and showing his teeth in an old mans smile a little bit affected but pleasant wishing everybody to be happy  aaron ate his soup trying to catch up miladys own confidential italian butler fidelity itself hovered quivering near spiritually helping the newcomer to catch up two nice little entree dishes specially prepared for aaron to take the place of the bygone fish and vol auvents of the proper dinner testified to the courtesy and charity of his hostess  well eating rapidly he had more or less caught up by the time the sweets came so he swallowed a glass of wine and looked round his hostess with her pearls and her diamond star in her grey hair was speaking of lilly and then of music to him  i hear you are a musician thats what i should have been if i had had my way  what instrument asked aaron  oh the piano yours is the flute mr lilly says i think the flute can be so attractive but i feel of course you have more range with the piano i love the pianoand orchestra  at that moment the colonel and hostessduties distracted her but she came back in snatches she was a woman who reminded him a little of queen victoria so assured in her own room a large part of her attention always given to the successful issue of her duties the remainder at the disposal of her guests it was an oldfashioned not unpleasant feeling like retrospect but she had beautiful big smooth emeralds and sapphires on her fingers money what a curious thing it is aaron noticed the deference of all the guests at table a touch of obsequiousness before the money and the host and hostess accepted the deference nay expected it as their due yet both sir william and lady franks knew that it was only money and success they had both a certain afterthought knowing dimly that the game was but a game and that they were the helpless leaders in the game they had a certain basic ordinariness which prevented their making any great hits and which kept them disillusioned all the while they remembered their poor and insignificant days  and i hear you were playing in the orchestra at covent garden we came back from london last week i enjoyed beechams operas so much  which do you like best said aaron  oh the russian i think ivan it is such fine music  i find ivan artificial  do you oh i dont think so no i dont think you can say that  aaron wondered at her assurance she seemed to put him just a tiny bit in his place even in an opinion on music money gave her that right too curiousthe only authority left and he deferred to her opinion that is to her money he did it almost deliberately yeswhat did he believe in besides money what does any man he looked at the black patch over the majors eye what had he given his eye forthe nations money well and very necessary too otherwise we might be where the wretched austrians are instead of whichhow smooth his hostess sapphires  of course i myself prefer moussorgsky said aaron i think he is a greater artist but perhaps it is just personal preference  yes boris is wonderful oh some of the scenes in boris  and even more kovantchina said aaron i wish we could go back to melody pure and simple yet i find kovantchina which is all mass music practically gives me more satisfaction than any other opera  do you really i shouldnt say so oh nobut you cant mean that you would like all music to go back to melody pure and simple just a flutejust a pipe oh mr sisson you are bigoted for your instrument i just live in harmonychords chords she struck imaginary chords on the white damask and her sapphires swam blue but at the same time she was watching to see if sir william had still got beside his plate the white medicine cachet which he must swallow at every meal because if so she must remind him to swallow it however at that very moment he put it on his tongue so that she could turn her attention again to aaron and the imaginary chord on the white damask the thing she just lived in but the rubicund bald colonel more rubicund after wine most rubicund now the marsala was going snatched her attention with a burly homage to her femininity and shared his fear with her with a boyish gallantry  when the women had gone up sir william came near and put his hand on aarons shoulder it was evident the charm was beginning to work sir william was a selfmade man and not in the least a snob he liked the fundamental ordinariness in aaron the commonness of the common man  well now mr sisson we are very glad to see you very glad indeed i count mr lilly one of the most interesting men it has ever been my good fortune to know and so for your own sake and for mr lillys sake we are very glad to see you arthur my boy give mr sisson some marsalaand take some yourself  thank you sir said the wellnourished young man in nice evening clothes youll take another glass yourself sir  yes i will i will i will drink a glass with mr sisson major where are you wandering off to come and take a glass with us my boy  thanks sir william drawled the young major with the black patch  now coloneli hope you are in good health and spirits  never better sir william never better  im very glad to hear it very glad indeed try my marsalai think it is quite good port is beyond us for the momentfor the moment  and the old man sipped his brown wine and smiled again he made quite a handsome picture but he was frail  and where are you bound mr sisson towards rome  i came to meet lilly said aaron  ah but lilly has fled over the borders by this time never was such a man for crossing frontiers wonderful person to be able to do it  where has he gone said aaron  i think to geneva for the moment but he certainly talked of venice you yourself have no definite goal  no  ah you have not come to italy to practice your art  i shall have to practice it or elseno i havent come for that  ah you will have to practice it ah yes we are all under the necessity to eat and you have a family in england am i not right  quite ive got a family depending on me  yes then you must practice your art you must practice your art wellshall we join the ladies coffee will no doubt be served  will you take my arm sir said the wellnourished arthur  thank you thank you the old man motioned him away  so they went upstairs to where the three women were sitting in the library round the fire chattering not very interested the entry of sir william at once made a stir  the girl in white with the biggish nose fluttered round him she was arthurs wife the girl in soft blue spread herself on the couch she was the young majors wife and she had a blue band round her hair the colonel hovered stout and fidgetty round lady franks and the liqueur stand he and the major were both in khakibelonging to the service on duty in italy still  coffee appearedand sir william doled out creme de menthe there was no conversationonly tedious words the little party was just commonplace and dullboring yet sir william the selfmade man was a study and the young oxfordlike major with his english diffidence and his one dark pensive baffled eye was only waiting to be earnest poor devil  the girl in white had been a sort of companion to lady franks so that arthur was more or less a soninlaw in this capacity he acted aaron strayed round uneasily looking at the books bought but not read and at the big pictures above it was arthur who fetched out the little boxes containing the orders conferred on sir william for his warwork and perhaps more for the many thousands of pounds he had spent on his warwork  there were three orders one british and quite important a large silver star for the breast one italian smaller and silver and gold and one from the state of ruritania in silver and redandgreen enamel smaller than the others  come now william said lady franks you must try them all on you must try them all on together and let us see how you look  the little frail old man with his strange old mans blue eyes and his old mans perpetual laugh swelled out his chest and said  what am i to appear in all my vanities and he laughed shortly  of course you are we want to see you said the white girl  indeed we do we shouldnt mind all appearing in such vanitieswhat lady franks boomed the colonel  i should think not replied his hostess when a man has honours conferred on him it shows a poor spirit if he isnt proud of them  of course i am proud of them said sir william well then come and have them pinned on i think its wonderful to have got so much in one lifetimewonderful said lady franks  oh sir william is a wonderful man said the colonel wellwe wont say so before him but let us look at him in his orders  arthur always ready on these occasions had taken the large and shining british star from its box and drew near to sir william who stood swelling his chest pleased proud and a little wistful  this one first sir said arthur  sir william stood very still half tremulous like a man undergoing an operation  and it goes just herethe level of the heart this is where it goes and carefully he pinned the large radiating ornament on the black velvet dinnerjacket of the old man  that is the firstand very becoming said lady franks  oh very becoming very becoming said the tall wife of the majorshe was a handsome young woman of the tall frail type  do you think so my dear said the old man with his eternal smile the curious smile of old people when they are dead  not only becoming sir said the major bending his tall slim figure forwards but a reassuring sign that a nation knows how to distinguish her valuable men  quite said lady franks i think it is a very great honour to have got it the king was most gracious too now the other that goes beside itthe italian  sir william stood there undergoing the operation of the pinningon the italian star being somewhat smaller than the british there was a slight question as to where exactly it should be placed however arthur decided it and the old man stood before the company with his two stars on his breast  and now the ruritanian said lady franks eagerly  that doesnt go on the same level with the others lady franks said arthur that goes much lower downabout here  are you sure said lady franks doesnt it go more here  no no no no not at all here isnt it so sybil  yes i think so said sybil  old sir william stood quite silent his breast prepared peering over the facings of his coat to see where the star was going the colonel was called in and though he knew nothing about it he agreed with arthur who apparently did know something so the star was pinned quite low down sir william peeping down exclaimed  well that is most curious now i wear an order over the pit of my stomach i think that is very curious a curious place to wear an order  stand up stand up and let us look said lady franks there now isnt it handsome and isnt it a great deal of honour for one man could he have expected so much in one lifetime i call it wonderful come and look at yourself dearand she led him to a mirror  whats more all thoroughly deserved said arthur  i should think so said the colonel fidgetting  ah yes nobody has deserved them better cooed sybil  nor on more humane and generous grounds said the major sotto voce  the effort to save life indeed returned the majors young wife splendid  sir william stood naively before the mirror and looked at his three stars on his black velvet dinnerjacket  almost directly over the pit of my stomach he said i hope that is not a decoration for my greedy appetite and he laughed at the young women  i assure you it is in position sir said arthur absolutely correct i will read it out to you later  arent you satisfied arent you a proud man isnt it wonderful said lady franks why what more could a man want from life he could never expect so much  yes my dear i am a proud man three countries have honoured me there was a little breathless pause  and not more than they ought to have done said sybil  well well i shall have my head turned let me return to my own humble self i am too much in the stars at the moment  sir william turned to arthur to have his decorations removed aaron standing in the background felt the whole scene strange childish a little touching and lady franks was so obviously trying to console her husband to console the frail excitable old man with his honours but why console him did he need consolation and did she it was evident that only the hardmoney woman in her put any price on the decorations  aaron came forward and examined the orders one after the other just metal playthings of curious shiny silver and gilt and enamel heavy the british onebut only like some heavy buckle a piece of metal merely when one turned it over somebody dropped the italian cross and there was a moment of horror but the lump of metal took no hurt queer to see the things stowed in their boxes again aaron had always imagined these mysterious decorations as shining by nature on the breasts of heroes pinnedon pieces of metal were a considerable comedown  the orders were put away the party sat round the fire in the comfortable library the men sipping more creme de menthe since nothing else offered and the couple of hours in front promising the tedium of smalltalk of tedious people who had really nothing to say and no particular originality in saying it  aaron however had reckoned without his host sir william sat upright in his chair with all the determination of a frail old man who insists on being level with the young the new guest sat in a lower chair smoking that curious glimmer on his face which made him so attractive and which only meant that he was looking on the whole scene from the outside as it were from beyond a fence sir william came almost directly to the attack  and so mr sisson you have no definite purpose in coming to italy  no none said aaron i wanted to join lilly  but when you had joined him  oh nothingstay here a time in this country if i could earn my keep  ahearn your keep so you hope to earn your keep here may i ask how  by my flute  italy is a poor country  i dont want much  you have a family to provide for  they are provided forfor a couple of years  oh indeed is that so  the old man got out of aaron the detailed account of his circumstanceshow he had left so much money to be paid over to his wife and had received only a small amount for himself  i see you are like lillyyou trust to providence said sir william  providence or fate said aaron  lilly calls it providence said sir william for my own part i always advise providence plus a banking account i have every belief in providence plus a banking account providence and no banking account i have observed to be almost invariably fatal lilly and i have argued it he believes in casting his bread upon the waters i sincerely hope he wont have to cast himself after his bread one of these days providence with a banking account believe in providence once you have secured enough to live on i should consider it disastrous to believe in providence before one can never be sure of providence  what can you be sure of then said aaron  well in moderation i can believe in a little hard cash and in my own ability to earn a little hard cash  perhaps lilly believes in his own ability too  no not so because he will never directly work to earn money he worksand works quite well i am told but only as the spirit moves him and never with any eye to the market now i call that tempting providence myself the spirit may move him in quite an opposite direction to the marketthen where is lilly i have put it to him more than once  the spirit generally does move him dead against the market said aaron but he manages to scrape along  in a state of jeopardy all the time in a state of jeopardy said the old man his whole existence and that of his wife is completely precarious i found in my youth the spirit moved me to various things which would have left me and my wife starving so i realised in time this was no good i took my spirit in hand therefore and made him pull the cart which mankind is riding in i harnessed him to the work of productive labour and so he brought me my reward  yes said aaron but every man according to his belief  i dont see said sir william how a man can believe in a providence unless he sets himself definitely to the work of earning his daily bread and making provision for future needs thats what providence means to memaking provision for oneself and ones family now mr lillyand you yourselfyou say you believe in a providence that does not compel you to earn your daily bread and make provision i confess myself i cannot see it and lilly has never been able to convince me  i dont believe in a kindhearted providence said aaron and i dont believe lilly does but i believe in chance i believe if i go my own way without tying my nose to a job chance will always throw something in my way enough to get along with  but on what do you base such a very unwarrantable belief  i just feel like that  and if you are ever quite without successand nothing to fall back on  i can work at something  in case of illness for example  i can go to a hospitalor die  dear me however you are more logical than lilly he seems to believe that he has the invisiblecall it providence if you willon his side and that this invisible will never leave him in the lurch or let him down so long as he sticks to his own side of the bargain and never works for his own ends i dont quite see how he works certainly he seems to me a man who squanders a great deal of talent unworthily yet for some reason or other he calls this true genuine activity and has a contempt for actual work by which a man makes provision for his years and for his family in the end he will have to fall back on charity but when i say so he denies it and says that in the end we the men who work and make provision will have to fall back on him well all i can say is that so far he is in far greater danger of having to fall back on me than i on him  the old man sat back in his chair with a little laugh of triumph but it smote almost devilishly on aarons ears and for the first time in his life he felt that there existed a necessity for taking sides  i dont suppose he will do much falling back he said  well he is young yet you are both young you are squandering your youth i am an old man and i see the end  what end sir william  charityand povertyand some not very congenial job as you call it to put bread in your mouth no no i would not like to trust myself to your providence or to your chance though i admit your chance is a sounder proposition than lillys providence you speculate with your life and your talent i admit the nature which is a born speculator after all with your flute you will speculate in other peoples taste for luxury as a man may speculate in theatres or trains de luxe you are the speculator that may be your way of wisdom but lilly does not even speculate i cannot see his point i cannot see his point i cannot see his point yet i have the greatest admiration for his mentality  the old man had fired up during this conversationand all the others in the room had gone silent lady franks was palpably uneasy she alone knew how frail the old man wasfrailer by far than his years she alone knew what fear of his own age what fear of death haunted him now fear of his own nonexistence his own old age was an agony to him worse than an agony a horror he wanted to be youngto live to live and he was old he was breaking up the glistening youth of aaron the impetuousness of lilly fascinated him and both these men seemed calmly to contradict his own wealth and honours  lady franks tried to turn off the conversation to the trickles of normal chitchat the colonel was horribly boredso were all the womenarthur was indifferent only the young major was implicated troubled in his earnest and philosophic spirit  what i cant see he said is the place that others have in your scheme  is isnt a scheme said aaron  well then your way of life isnt it pretty selfish to marry a woman and then expect her to live on very little indeed and that always precarious just because you happen to believe in providence or in chance which i think worse what i dont see is where others come in what would the world be like if everybody lived that way  other people can please themselves said aaron  no they cantbecause you take first choice it seems to me supposing your wifeor lillys wifeasks for security and for provision as sir william says surely she has a right to it  if ive no right to it myselfand i have no right to it if i dont want itthen what right has she  every right i should say all the more since you are improvident  then she must manage her rights for herself its no good her foisting her rights on to me  isnt that pure selfishness  it may be i shall send my wife money as long as ive money to send  and supposing you have none  then i cant send itand she must look out for herself  i call that almost criminal selfishness  i cant help it  the conversation with the young major broke off  it is certainly a good thing for society that men like you and mr lilly are not common said sir william laughing  becoming commoner every day youll find interjaculated the colonel  indeed indeed well may we ask you another question mr sisson i hope you dont object to our catechism  no nor your judgment afterwards said aaron grinning  then upon what grounds did you abandon your family i know it is a tender subject but lilly spoke of it to us and as far i could see  there were no grounds said aaron no there werent i just left them  mere caprice  if its a caprice to be begottenand a caprice to be bornand a caprice to diethen that was a caprice for it was the same  like birth or death i dont follow  it happened to me as birth happened to me onceand death will happen it was a sort of death too or a sort of birth but as undeniable as either and without any more grounds  the old tremulous man and the young man were watching one another  a natural event said sir william  a natural event said aaron  not that you loved any other woman  god save me from it  you just left off loving  not even that i went away  what from  from it all  from the woman in particular  oh yes yes yes that  and you couldnt go back  aaron shook his head  yet you can give no reasons  not any reasons that would be any good it wasnt a question of reasons it was a question of her and me and what must be what makes a child be born out of its mother to the pain and trouble of both of them i dont know  but that is a natural process  so is thisor nothing  no interposed the major because birth is a universal processand yours is a specific almost unique event  well unique or not it so came about i didnt ever leave off loving hernot as far as i know i left her as i shall leave the earth when i diebecause it has to be  do you know what i think it is mr sisson put in lady franks i think you are just in a wicked state of mind just that mr lilly too and you must be very careful or some great misfortune will happen to you  it may said aaron  and it will mark my word it will  you almost wish it might as a judgment on me smiled aaron  oh no indeed i should only be too sorry but i feel it will unless you are careful  ill be careful then  yes and you cant be too careful  you make me frightened  i would like to make you very frightened indeed so that you went back humbly to your wife and family  it would have to be a big fright then i assure you  ah you are really heartless it makes me angry  she turned angrily aside  well well well well life life young men are a new thing to me said sir william shaking his head well well what do you say to whiskey and soda colonel  why delighted sir william said the colonel bouncing up  a nightcap and then we retire said lady franks  aaron sat thinking he knew sir william liked him and that lady franks didnt one day he might have to seek help from sir william so he had better placate milady wrinkling the fine half mischievous smile on his face and trading on his charm he turned to his hostess  you wouldnt mind lady franks if i said nasty things about my wife and found a lot of fault with her what makes you angry is that i know it is not a bit more her fault than mine that we come apart it cant be helped  oh yes indeed i disapprove of your way of looking at things altogether it seems to me altogether cold and unmanly and inhuman thank goodness my experience of a man has been different  we cant all be alike can we and if i dont choose to let you see me crying that doesnt prove ive never had a bad half hour does it ive had manyay and a many  then why are you so wrong so wrong in your behaviour  i suppose ive got to have my bout out and when its out i can alter  then i hope youve almost had your bout out she said  so do i said he with a halfrepentant halfdepressed look on his attractive face the corners of his mouth grimaced slightly under his moustache  the best thing you can do is to go straight back to england and to her  perhaps id better ask her if she wants me first he said drily  yes you might do that too and lady franks felt she was quite getting on with her work of reform and the restoring of woman to her natural throne best not go too fast either  say when shouted the colonel who was manipulating the syphon  when said aaron  the men stood up to their drinks  will you be leaving in the morning mr sisson asked lady franks  may i stay till monday morning said aaron they were at saturday evening  certainly and you will take breakfast in your room we all do at what time half past eight  thank you very much  then at half past eight the man will bring it in goodnight  once more in his blue silk bedroom aaron grimaced to himself and stood in the middle of the room grimacing his hostess admonitions were like vitriol in his ears he looked out of the window through the darkness of trees the lights of a city below italy the air was cold with snow he came back into his soft warm room luxurious it was and luxurious the deep warm bed  he was still asleep when the man came noiselessly in with the tray and it was morning aaron woke and sat up he felt that the deep warm bed and the soft warm room had made him sleep too well robbed him of his night like a narcotic he preferred to be more uncomfortable and more aware of the flight of the dark hours it seemed numbing  the footman in his grey housejacket was neat and italian and sympathising he gave goodmorning in italianthen softly arranged the little table by the bedside and put out the toast and coffee and butter and boiled egg and honey with silver and delicate china aaron watched the soft catlike motions of the man the dark eyes glanced once at the blond man leaning on his elbow on the pillow aarons face had that watchful halfamused expression the man said something in italian aaron shook his head laughed and said  tell me in english  the man went softly to the window curtains and motioned them with his hand  yes do said aaron  so the man drew the buffcoloured silk curtains and aaron sitting in bed could see away beyond red roofs of a town and in the further heaven great snowy mountains  the alps he said in surprise  gli alpisi signore the man bowed gathered up aarons clothes and silently retired  aaron watched through the window it was a frosty morning at the end of september with a clear blue morningsky alpine and the watchful snowstreaked mountain tops bunched in the distance as if waiting there they were hovering round circling waiting they reminded him of marvellous striped skypanthers circling round a great camp the redroofed city aaron looked and looked again in the near distance under the house elmtree tops were yellowing he felt himself changing inside his skin  so he turned away to his coffee and eggs a little silver eggcup with a curious little frill round it honey in a frail iridescent glass bowl goldiridescent the charm of delicate and fine things he smiled half mockingly to himself two instincts played in him the one an instinct for fine delicate things he had attractive hands the other an inclination to throw the dainty little table with all its niceties out of the window it evoked a sort of devil in him  he took his bath the man had brought back his things he dressed and went downstairs no one in the lounge he went down to the ground floor no one in the big hall with its pillars of yellow marble and its gold arches its enormous dark blueyred carpet he stood before the great glass doors some red flowers still were blooming in the tubs on the steps handsome and beautiful chrysanthemums in the wide portico beyond yellow leaves were already falling on the green grass and the neat drive everywhere was silent and empty he climbed the wide stairs sat in the long upper lounge where the papers were he wanted his hat and coat and did not know where to find them the windows looked on to a terraced garden the hill rising steeply behind the house he wanted to go out  so he opened more doors and in a long drawingroom came upon five or six manservants all in the grey housejackets all cleanshaven neat with neat black hair all with dusters or brushes or feather brooms and all frolicking chattering playing like so many monkeys they were all of the same neat smallish size they were all laughing they rolled back a great rug as if it were some football game one flew at the curtains and they merely looked at aaron and went on chattering and laughing and dusting  surprised and feeling that he trespassed he stood at the window a moment looking out the noise went on behind him so he turned smiling and asked for his hat pointing to his head they knew at once what he wanted one of the fellows beckoned him away down to the hall and to the long cupboard place where hats and coats and sticks were hung there was his hat he put it on while the man chattered to him pleasantly and unintelligibly and opened for him the back door into the garden     chapter xiii wie es ihnen gefaellt   the fresh morning air comes startling after a central heated house so aaron found it he felt himself dashing up the steps into the garden like a bird dashing out of a trap where it has been caught that warm and luxurious house heaven bless us we who want to save civilisation we had better make up our minds what of it we want to save the kernel may be all well and good but there is precious little kernel to a lot of woolly stuffing and poisonous rind  the gardens to sir williams place were not imposing and still rather warneglected but the pools of water lay smooth in the bright air the flowers showed their colour beside the walks many birds dashed about rather bewildered having crossed the alps in their migration southwards aaron noted with gratification a certain big magnificence a certain reckless powerfulness in the stillblossoming harshcoloured autumn flowers distinct satisfaction he derived from it  he wandered upwards up the succeeding flights of step till he came to the upper rough hedge and saw the wild copse on the hillcrest just above passing through a space in the hedge he climbed the steep last bit of sir williams lane it was a little vineyard with small vines and yellowing leaves everywhere the place looked neglectedbut as if man had just begun to tackle it once more  at the very top by the wild hedge where spindleberries hung pink seats were placed and from here the view was very beautiful the hill dropped steep beneath him a river wound on the near side of the city crossed by a white bridge the city lay close clustered ruddy on the plains glittering in the clear air with its flat roofs and domes and square towers strangely nakedseeming in the clear clean air and massive in the further nearness snowstreaked mountains the tigerlike alps tigers prowling between the north and the south and this beautiful city lying nearest exposed the snowwind brushed her this morning like the icy whiskers of a tiger and clear in the light lay novara wide fearless violent novara beautiful the perfect air the perfect and unblemished alpsky and like the first southern flower novara  aaron sat watching in silence only the uneasy birds rustled he watched the city and the winding river the bridges and the imminent alps he was on the south side on the other side of the time barrier his old sleepy english nature was startled in its sleep he felt like a man who knows it is time to wake up and who doesnt want to wake up to face the responsibility of another sort of day  to open his darkest eyes and wake up to a new responsibility wake up and enter on the responsibility of a new self in himself ach the horror of responsibility he had all his life slept and shelved the burden and he wanted to go on sleeping it was so hateful to have to get a new grip on his own bowels a new hard recklessness into his heart a new and responsible consciousness into his mind and soul he felt some finger prodding prodding prodding him awake out of the sleep of pathos and tragedy and spasmodic passion and he wriggled unwilling oh most unwilling to undertake the new business  in fact he ran away again he gave a last look at the town and its whitefanged mountains and descended through the garden round the way of the kitchen garden and garage and stables and pecking chickens back to the house again in the hall still no one he went upstairs to the long lounge there sat the rubicund bald boylike colonel reading the graphic aaron sat down opposite him and made a feeble attempt at conversation but the colonel wasnt having any it was evident he didnt care for the fellowmr aaron that is aaron therefore dried up and began to sit him out with the aid of the queen came a servant however and said that the signor colonello was called up from the hospital on the telephone the colonel once departed aaron fled again this time out of the front doors and down the steep little park to the gates  huge dogs and little dogs came bounding forward out of the lodge came the woman with the keys smiling very pleasantly this morning so he was in the street the wide road led him inevitably to the big bridge with the violent physical stone statuegroups men and women were moving about and he noticed for the first time the littleness and the momentaneousness of the italians in the street perhaps it was the wideness of the bridge and the subsequent big open boulevard but there it was the people seemed little upright brisk figures moving in a certain isolation like tiny figures on a big stage and he felt himself moving in the space between all the northern cosiness gone he was set down with a space round him  little trams flitted down the boulevard in the bright sweet light the barbers shops were all busy half the novarese at that moment ambushed in lather full in the public gaze a shave is nothing if not a public act in the south at the little outdoor tables of the cafes a very few drinkers sat before empty coffeecups most of the shops were shut it was too soon after the war for life to be flowing very fast the feeling of emptiness of neglect of lack of supplies was evident everywhere  aaron strolled on surprised himself at his gallant feeling of liberty a feeling of bravado and almost swaggering carelessness which is italys best gift to an englishman he had crossed the dividing line and the values of life though ostensibly and verbally the same were dynamically different alas however the verbal and the ostensible the accursed mechanical ideal gains day by day over the spontaneous lifedynamic so that italy becomes as ideabound and as automatic as england just a business proposition  coming to the station he went inside there he saw a moneychanging window which was open so he planked down a fivepound note and got twohundredandten lire here was a start at a bookstall he saw a man buy a big timetable with a large railway map in it he immediately bought the same then he retired to a corner to get his whereabouts  in the morning he must move where he looked on the map the map seemed to offer two alternatives milan and genoa he chose milan because of its musical associations and its cathedral milano then strolling and still strolling he found the boards announcing arrivals and departures as far as he could make out the train for milan left at 900 in the morning  so much achieved he left the big desolating caravanserai of the station soldiers were camped in every corner lying in heaps asleep in their greygreen uniform he was surprised at their sturdy limbs and uniformly short stature for the first time he saw the cockfeathers of the bersaglieri there seemed a new lifequality everywhere many worlds not one world but alas the one world triumphing more and more over the many worlds the big oneness swallowing up the many small diversities in its insatiable gnawing appetite leaving a dreary sameness throughout the world that means at last complete sterility  aaron however was too new to the strangeness he had no eye for the horrible sameness that was spreading like a disease over italy from england and the north he plunged into the space in front of the station and took a new wide boulevard to his surprise he ran towards a big and overanimated statue that stood resolutely with its back to the magnificent snowdomes of the wild alps wolves in the street could not have startled him more than those magnificent fiercegleaming mountains of snow at the streetend beyond the statue he stood and wondered and never thought to look who the gentleman was then he turned right round and began to walk home  luncheon was at one oclock it was halfpast twelve when he rang at the lodge gates he climbed through the leaves of the little park on a sidepath rather reluctantly towards the house in the hall lady franks was discussing with arthur a fat pekinese who did not seem very well she was sure the servants did not obey her orders concerning the pekinese bitch arthur who was more than indifferent assured her they did but she seemed to think that the whole of the male human race was in league against the miserable specimen of a shedog she almost cried thinking her queenie might by some chance meet with perhaps a harsh word or look queenie apparently fattened on the secret detestation of the male human species  i cant bear to think that a dumb creature might be illtreated she said to aaron thank goodness the italians are better than they used to be  are they better than they used to be  oh much they have learnt it from us  she then enquired if her guest had slept and if he were rested from his journey aaron into whose face the faint snowwind and the sun had brought a glow replied that he had slept well and enjoyed the morning thank you whereupon lady franks knitted her brows and said sir william had had such a bad night he had not been able to sleep and had got up and walked about the room the least excitement and she dreaded a breakdown he must have absolute calm and restfulness  theres one for you and your jawing last night aaron my boy said our hero to himself  i thought sir william seemed so full of life and energy he said aloud  ah did you no he wants to be but he cant do it hes very much upset this morning i have been very anxious about him  i am sorry to hear that  lady franks departed to some duty aaron sat alone before the fire it was a huge fireplace like a dark chamber shut in by tall finelywrought iron gates behind these iron gates of curly iron the logs burned and flickered like leopards slumbering and lifting their heads within their cage aaron wondered who was the keeper of the savage element who it was that would open the iron grille and throw on another log like meat to the lions to be sure the fire was only to be looked at like wild beasts in the zoo for the house was warm from roof to floor it was strange to see the blue air of sunlight outside the yellowedged leaves falling in the wind the red flowers shaking  the gong sounded softly through the house the colonel came in heartily from the garden but did not speak to aaron the major and his wife came pallid down the stairs lady franks appeared talking domesticsecretarial business with the wife of arthur arthur wellnourished and half at home called down the stairs and then sir william descended old and frail now in the morning shaken still he approached aaron heartily and asked him how he did and how he had spent his morning the old man who had made a fortune how he expected homage and how he got it homage like most things is just a convention and a social trick aaron found himself paying homage too to the old man who had made a fortune but also exacting a certain deference in return from the old man who had made a fortune getting it too on what grounds youth maybe but mostly scorn for fortunes and fortunemaking did he scorn fortunes and fortunemaking not he otherwise whence this homage for the old man with much money aaron like everybody else was rather paralysed by a million sterling personified in one old man paralysed fascinated overcome all those three only having no final control over his own makeup he could not drive himself into the moneymaking or even into the moneyhaving habit and he had just wit enough to threaten sir williams golden king with his own ivory queen and knights of wilful life and sir william quaked  well and how have you spent your morning asked the host  i went first to look at the garden  ah not much to see now they have been beautiful with flowers once but for two and a half years the house has been a hospital for officersand even tents in the park and gardenas many as two hundred wounded and sick at a time we are only just returning to civil life and flowers need time yesyesbritish officersfor two and a half years but did you go up now to the belvedere  to the topwhere the vines are i never expected the mountains  you never expected the mountains pray why not they are always there  but i was never there before i never knew they were there round the town i didnt expect it like that  ah so you found our city impressive  very ah very a new world to me i feel ive come out of myself  yes it is a wonderful sighta wonderful sight but you have not been into the town  yes i saw the men being shaved and all the soldiers at the station and a statue and mountains behind it oh ive had a full morning  a full morning that is good that is good the old man looked again at the younger man and seemed to get life from him to live in him vicariously  come said the hostess luncheon  aaron sat again on his hostess left hand the colonel was more affable now it was mealtime sir william was again in a good humour chaffing the young ladies with an old mans gallantry but now he insisted on drawing aaron into the play and aaron did not want to be drawn he did not one bit want to chaffer gallantries with the young women between him and sir william there was a curious rivalryunconscious on both sides the old knight had devoted an energetic adventurous almost an artistic nature to the making of his fortune and the developing of later philanthropies he had no children aaron was devoting a similar nature to anything but fortunemaking and philanthropy the one held life to be a storingup of produce and a conservation of energy the other held life to be a sheer spending of energy and a storingup of nothing but experience there they were in opposition the old man and the young sir william kept calling aaron into the chaffer at the other end of the table and aaron kept on refusing to join he hated long distance answers anyhow and in his mood of the moment he hated the young women he had a conversation with arthur about statues concerning which aaron knew nothing and arthur less than nothing then lady franks turned the conversation to the soldiers at the station and said how sir william had equipped resthuts for the italian privates near the station but that such was the jealousy and spite of the italian red crossor some such body locallythat sir williams huts had been left emptystanding unusedwhile the men had slept on the stone floor of the station night after night in icy winter there was evidently much bitter feeling as a result of sir williams philanthropy apparently even the honey of lavish charity had turned to gall in the italian mouth at least the official mouth which gall had been spat back at the charitable much to his pain it is in truth a difficult world particularly when you have another race to deal with after which came the beefolives  oh said lady franks i had such a dreadful dream last night such a dreadful dream it upset me so much i have not been able to get over it all day  what was it said aaron tell it and break it  why said his hostess i dreamed i was asleep in my roomjust as i actually wasand that it was night yet with a terrible sort of light like the dead light before dawn so that one could see and my maid giuseppina came running into my room saying signora signora si alza subito signora vengono suand i said chi chi sono chi vengono chii novaresi i novaresi vengono su vengono quii got out of bed and went to the window and there they were in the dead light rushing up to the house through the trees it was so awful i havent been able to forget it all day  tell me what the words are in english said aaron  why she said get up get upthe novaresi the people of novara are coming upvengono suthey are coming upthe novara peopleworkpeople i cant forget it it was so real i cant believe it didnt actually happen  ah said aaron it will never happen i know that whatever one foresees and feels has happened never happens in real life it sort of works itself off through the imagining of it  well it was almost more real to me than real life said his hostess  then it will never happen in real life he said  luncheon passed and coffee the party began to disperselady franks to answer more letters with the aid of arthurs wifesome to sleep some to walk aaron escaped once more through the big gates this time he turned his back on the town and the mountains and climbed up the hill into the country so he went between the banks and the bushes watching for unknown plants and shrubs hearing the birds feeling the influence of a new soil at the top of the hill he saw over into vineyards and a new strange valley with a winding river and jumbled entangled hills strange wild country so near the town it seemed to keep an almost virgin wildnessyet he saw the white houses dotted here and there  just below him was a peasant house and on a little loggia in the sun two peasants in white shirtsleeves and black sunday suits were sitting drinking wine and talking talking peasant youths in black hats their sweethearts in dark stuff dresses wearing no hat but a black silk or a white silk scarf passed slowly along the little road just below the ridge none looked up to see aaron sitting there alone from some hidden place somebody was playing an accordion a jerky sound in the still afternoon and away beyond lay the unchanging mysterious valley and the infolding mysterious hills of italy  returning back again another way he lost himself at the foot of the hill in new and deserted suburb streetsunfinished streets of seemingly unfinished houses then a sort of boulevard where bourgeois families were taking the sunday afternoon walk stout papas stout pallid mamas in rather cheap black fur little girls very much dressed and long lads in short socks and round sailor caps ribbons fluttering alien they felt alien alien as a bourgeois crowd always does but particularly a foreign sundaybest bourgeois crowd aaron wandered and wandered finding the tram terminus and trying blank unfinished street after street he had a great disinclination to ask his way  at last he recognised the bank and the little stream of water that ran along the street side so he was back in time for tea a hospital nurse was there and two other strange women arthur played the part of host sir william came in from a walk with the dogs but retired to his room without taking tea  and so the evening fell aaron sat in the hall at some distance from the fire which burned behind its wrought iron gates he was tired now with all his impressions and dispirited he thought of his wife and children at home of the churchbells ringing so loudly across the field beyond his garden end of the darkclad people trailing unevenly across the two paths one to the left one to the right forking their way towards the houses of the town to church or to chapel mostly to chapel at this hour he himself would be dressed in his best clothes tying his bow ready to go out to the public house and his wife would be resenting his holiday departure whilst she was left fastened to the children  rather tired and dispirited in this alien place he wondered if he wished himself back but the moment he actually realised himself at home and felt the tension of barrenness which it meant felt the curious and deadly opposition of his wifes will against his own nature the almost nauseating ache which it amounted to he pulled himself together and rejoiced again in his new surroundings her will her will her terrible implacable cunning will what was there in the female will so diabolical he asked himself that it could press like a flat sheet of iron against a man all the time the female will he realised now that he had a horror of it it was flat and inflexible as a sheet of iron but also it was cunning as a snake that could sing treacherous songs  of two people at a deadlock he always reminded himself there is not one only wholly at fault both must be at fault having a detached and logical soul he never let himself forget this truth take lottie he had loved her he had never loved any other woman if he had had his other affairsit was out of spite or defiance or curiosity they meant nothing he and lottie had loved one another and the love had developed almost at once into a kind of combat lottie had been the only child of headstrong welltodo parents he also had been the only child of his widowed mother well then both he and lottie had been brought up to consider themselves the first in whatsoever company they found themselves during the early months of the marriage he had of course continued the spoiling of the young wife but this never altered the fact that by his very nature he considered himself as first and almost as single in any relationship first and single he felt and as such he bore himself it had taken him years to realise that lottie also felt herself first and single under all her whimsicalness and fretfulness was a conviction as firm as steel that she as woman was the centre of creation the man was but an adjunct she as woman and particularly as mother was the first great source of life and being and also of culture the man was but the instrument and the finisher she was the source and the substance  sure enough lottie had never formulated this belief inside herself but it was formulated for her in the whole world it is the substantial and professed belief of the whole white world she did but inevitably represent what the whole world around her asserted the lifecentrality of woman woman the lifebearer the lifesource  nearly all men agree to the assertion practically all men even while demanding their selfish rights as superior males tacitly agree to the fact of the sacred lifebearing priority of woman tacitly they yield the worship to that which is female tacitly they conspire to agree that all that is productive all that is fine and sensitive and most essentially noble is woman this in their productive and religious souls they believe and however much they may react against the belief loathing their women running to prostitutes or beer or anything out of reaction against this great and ignominious dogma of the sacred priority of women still they do but profane the god they worship profaning woman they still inversely worship her  but in aaron was planted another seed he did not know it he started off on the good old tack of worshipping his woman while his heart was honest and profaning her in his fits of temper and revolt but he made a bad show born in him was a spirit which could not worship woman no and would not could not and would not it was not in him in early days he tried to pretend it was in him but through his plaintive and homagerendering love of a young husband was always for the woman discernible the arrogance of selfunyielding male he never yielded himself never all his mad loving was only an effort afterwards he was as devilishly unyielded as ever and it was an instinct in her that her man must yield to her so that she should envelop him yielding in her allbeneficent love she was quite sure that her love was allbeneficent of this no shadow of doubt she was quite sure that the highest her man could ever know or ever reach was to be perfectly enveloped in her allbeneficent love this was her idea of marriage she held it not as an idea but as a profound impulse and instinct an instinct developed in her by the age in which she lived all that was deepest and most sacred in he feeling centred in this belief  and he outraged her oh from the first day and the first night she felt he outraged her true for some time she had been taken in by his manifest love but though you can deceive the conscious mind you can never deceive the deep unconscious instinct she could never understand whence arose in her almost from the first days of marriage with him her terrible paroxysms of hatred for him she was in love with him ah heaven how maddeningly she was in love with him a certain unseizable beauty that was his and which fascinated her as a snake a bird but in revulsion how she hated him how she abhorred him how she despised and shuddered at him he seemed a horrible thing to her  and then again oh god the agony of her desire for him the agony of her long long desire for him he was a passionate lover he gave her ostensibly all she asked for he withheld from her nothing no experience no degree of intimacy she was his initiate or he hers  and yet oh horror for a woman he withheld everything from her he withheld the very centre of himself for a long time she never realised she was dazed and maddened only but as months of married experience passed into years of married torment she began to understand it was that after their most tremendous and it seemed to her heavenrending passionyea when for her every veil seemed rent and a terrible and sacred creative darkness covered the earththenafter all this wonder and miraclein crept a poisonous grey snake of disillusionment a poisonous grey snake of disillusion that bit her to madness so that she really was a mad woman demented  why why he never gave himself he never came to her really he withheld himself yes in those supreme and sacred times which for her were the whole culmination of life and being the ecstasy of unspeakable passional conjunction he was not really hers he was withheld he withheld the central core of himself like the devil and hellfiend he was he cheated and made play with her tremendous passional soul her sacred sex passion most sacred of all things for a woman all the time some central part of him stood apart from her aside looking on  oh agony and horror for a passionate fiercehearted woman she who loved him she who loved him to madness she who would have died for him she who did die with him many terrible and magnificent connubial deaths in his arms her husband  her husband how bitter the word grew to her her husband and him never once given given wholly to her her husbandand in all the frenzied finality of desire she never fully possessed him not once no not once as time went on she learned it for inevitable not once  and then how she hated him cheated foiled betrayed forced to love him or to hate him never able to be at peace near him nor away from him poor lottie no wonder she was as a mad woman she was strictly as a woman demented after the birth of her second child for all her instinct all her impulse all her desire and above all all her will was to possess her man in very fulness once just once and once and for all once just once and it would be once and for all  but never never not once never not for one single solitary second was it not enough to send a woman mad was it not enough to make her demented yes and mad she was she made his life a hell for him she bit him to the bone with her frenzy of rage chagrin and agony she drove him mad too mad so that he beat her mad so that he longed to kill her but even in his greatest rages it was the same he never finally lost himself he remained somewhere in the centre in possession of himself she sometimes wished he would kill her or that she would kill him neither event happened  and neither of them understood what was happening how should they they were both dazed horrified and mortified he took to leaving her alone as much as was possible but when he had to come home there was her terrible will like a flat cold snake coiled round his soul and squeezing him to death yes she did not relent she was a good wife and mother all her duties she fulfilled but she was not one to yield he must yield that was written in eternal letters on the iron tablet of her will he must yield she the woman the mother of his children how should she ever even think to yield it was unthinkable he the man the weak the false the treacherous the halfhearted it was he who must yield was not hers the divine will and the divine right ha she would be less than woman if she ever capitulated abandoned her divine responsibility as woman no he must yield  so he was unfaithful to her piling reproach after reproach upon himself he added adultery to his brutality and this was the beginning of the end she was more than maddened but he began to grow silent unresponsive as if he did not hear her he was unfaithful to her and oh in such a low way such shame such shame but he only smiled carelessly now and asked her what she wanted she had asked for all she got that he reiterated and that was all he would do  terrible was that she found even his smile of insolent indifference halfbeautiful oh bitter chain to bear but she summoned up all her strange womans will she fought against his fascination the fascination he exerted over her with fearful efforts of will she fought against it and mastered it and then suddenly horror and agony of it up it would rush in her again her unbearable desire for him the longing for his contact his quality of beauty  that was a cross hard to bear yet even that she bore and schooled herself into a fretful petulant manner of indifference her odd whimsical petulance hid a will which he and he alone knew to be stronger than steel strong as a diabolical cold grey snake that presses and presses and cannotrelax nay cannot relax she became the same as he even in her moments of most passionate desire for him the cold and snakelike tension of her will never relaxed and the cold snakelike eye of her intention never closed  so till it reached a deadlock each will was wound tense and so fixed fixed there was neither any relaxing or any increase of pressure fixed hard like a numbness a grip that was solidifying and turning to stone  he realised somehow that at this terrible passive game of fixed tension she would beat him her fixed female soul her woundup female will would solidify into stonewhereas his must break in him something must break it was a cold and fatal deadlock profitless a lifeautomatism of fixed tension that suddenly in him did break his will flew loose in a recoil a recoil away from her he left her as inevitably as a broken spring flies out from its hold  not that he was broken he would not do her even that credit he had only flown loose from the old centrefixture his will was still entire and unabated only he did not know he did not understand he swung wildly about from place to place as if he were broken  then suddenly on this sunday evening in the strange country he realised something about himself he realised that he had never intended to yield himself fully to her or to anything that he did not intend ever to yield himself up entirely to her or to anything that his very being pivoted on the fact of his isolate selfresponsibility aloneness his intrinsic and central aloneness was the very centre of his being break it and he broke his being break this central aloneness and he broke everything it was the great temptation to yield himself and it was the final sacrilege anyhow it was something which from his profoundest soul he did not intend to do by the innermost isolation and singleness of his own soul he would abide though the skies fell on top of one another and seven heavens collapsed  vaguely he realised this and vaguely he realised that this had been the root cause of his strife with lottie lottie the only person who had mattered at all to him in all the world save perhaps his mother and his mother had not mattered no not onehalf nor onefifth what lottie had mattered so it was there was for him only her significant in the universe and between him and her matters were as they were  he coldly and terribly hated her for a moment then no more there was no solution it was a situation without a solution but at any rate it was now a defined situation he could rest in peace  thoughts something in this manner ran through aarons subconscious mind as he sat still in the strange house he could not have fired it all off at any listener as these pages are fired off at any chance reader nevertheless there it was risen to half consciousness in him all his life he had hated knowing what he felt he had wilfully if not consciously kept a gulf between his passional soul and his open mind in his mind was pinned up a nice description of himself and a description of lottie sort of authentic passports to be used in the conscious world these authentic passports selfdescribing nose short mouth normal etc he had insisted that they should do all the duty of the man himself this readymade and very banal idea of himself as a really quite nice individual eyes blue nose short mouth normal chin normal this he had insisted was really himself it was his conscious mask  now at last after years of struggle he seemed suddenly to have dropped his mask on the floor and broken it his authentic selfdescribing passport his complete and satisfactory idea of himself suddenly became a rag of paper ridiculous what on earth did it matter if he was nice or not if his chin was normal or abnormal  his mask his idea of himself dropped and was broken to bits there he sat now maskless and invisible that was how he strictly felt invisible and undefined rather like wells invisible man he had no longer a mask to present to people he was present and invisible they could not really think anything about him because they could not really see him what did they see when they looked at him lady franks for example he neither knew nor cared he only knew he was invisible to himself and everybody and that all thinking about what he was like was only a silly game of mrs mackenzies dead  so there the old aaron sisson was as if painfully transmuted as the invisible man when he underwent his transmutations now he was gone and no longer to be seen his visibility lost for ever  and then what sitting there as an invisible presence the preconceived world melted also and was gone lady franks sir william all the guests they talked and maneuvered with their visible personalities manipulating the masks of themselves and underneath there was something invisible and dyingsomething fading wilting the essential plasm of themselves their invisible being  well now and what next having in some curious manner tumbled from the tree of modern knowledge and cracked and rolled out from the shell of the preconceived idea of himself like some dark nightlustrous chestnut from the green ostensibility of the burr he lay as it were exposed but invisible on the floor knowing but making no conceptions knowing but having no idea now that he was finally unmasked and exposed the accepted idea of himself cracked and rolled aside like a broken chestnutburr the mask split and shattered he was at last quiet and free he had dreaded exposure and behold we cannot be exposed for we are invisible we cannot be exposed to the looks of others for our very being is nightlustrous and unseeable like the invisible man we are only revealed through our clothes and our masks  in his own powerful but subconscious fashion aaron realized this he was a musician and hence even his deepest ideas were not wordideas his very thoughts were not composed of words and ideal concepts they too his thoughts and his ideas were dark and invisible as electric vibrations are invisible no matter how many words they may purport if i as a worduser must translate his deep conscious vibrations into finite words that is my own business i do but make a translation of the man he would speak in music i speak with words  the inaudible music of his conscious soul conveyed his meaning in him quite as clearly as i convey it in words probably much more clearly but in his own mode only and it was in his own mode only he realised what i must put into words these words are my own affair his mind was music  dont grumble at me then gentle reader and swear at me that this damned fellow wasnt half clever enough to think all these smart things and realise all these finedrawnout subtleties you are quite right he wasnt yet it all resolved itself in him as i say and it is for you to prove that it didnt  in his now silent maskless state of wordless comprehension he knew that he had never wanted to surrender himself utterly to lottie nor to his mother nor to anybody the last extreme of selfabandon in love was for him an act of false behaviour his own nature inside him fated him not to take this last false step over the edge of the abyss of selflessness even if he wanted to he could not he might struggle on the edge of the precipice like an assassin struggling with his own soul but he could not conquer for according to all the current prejudice and impulse in one direction he too had believed that the final achievement the consummation of human life was this flinging oneself over the precipice down the bottomless pit of love now he realised that love even in its intensest was only an attribute of the human soul one of its incomprehensible gestures and to fling down the whole soul in one gesture of finality in love was as much a criminal suicide as to jump off a churchtower or a mountainpeak let a man give himself as much as he liked in love to seven thousand extremities he must never give himself away the more generous and the more passionate a soul the more it gives itself but the more absolute remains the law that it shall never give itself away give thyself but give thyself not away that is the lesson written at the end of the long strange lane of love  the idee fixe of today is that every individual shall not only give himself but shall achieve the last glory of giving himself away and since this takes twoyou cant even make a present of yourself unless youve got somebody to receive the present since this last extradivine act takes two people to perform it youve got to take into count not only your giver but your receiver who is going to be the giver and who the receiver  why of course in our longdrawnout christian day man is given and woman is recipient man is the gift woman the receiver this is the sacrament we live by the holy communion we live for that man gives himself to woman in an utter and sacred abandon all all all himself given and taken woman eternal woman she is the communicant she receives the sacramental body and spirit of the man and when shes got it according to her passionate and alltoosacred desire completely when she possesses her man at last finally and ultimately without blemish or reservation in the perfection of the sacrament then also poor woman the blood and the body of which she has partaken become insipid or nauseous to her she is driven mad by the endless meal of the marriage sacrament poisoned by the sacred communion which was her goal and her souls ambition  we have pushed a process into a goal the aim of any process is not the perpetuation of that process but the completion thereof love is a process of the incomprehensible human soul love also incomprehensible but still only a process the process should work to a completion not to some horror of intensification and extremity wherein the soul and body ultimately perish the completion of the process of love is the arrival at a state of simple pure selfpossession for man and woman only that which isnt exciting enough for us sensationalists we prefer abysses and maudlin selfabandon and selfsacrifice the degeneration into a sort of slime and merge  perhaps truly the process of love is never accomplished but it moves in great stages and at the end of each stage a true goal where the soul possesses itself in simple and generous singleness without this love is a disease  so aaron crossing a certain borderline and finding himself alone completely accepted his loneliness or singleness as a fulfilment a state of fulfilment the long fight with lottie had driven him at last to himself so that he was quiet as a thing which has its root deep in life and has lost its anxiety as for considering the lily it is not a matter of consideration the lily toils and spins hard enough in her own way but without that strain and that anxiety with which we try to weave ourselves a life the lily is liferooted lifecentral she cannot worry she is life itself a little delicate fountain playing creatively for as long or as short a time as may be and unable to be anxious she may be sad or sorry if the north wind blows but even then anxious she cannot be whether her fountain play or cease to play from out the cold damp earth she cannot be anxious she may only be glad or sorry and continue her way she is perfectly herself whatever befall even if frosts cut her off happy lily never to be saddled with an idee fixe never to be in the grip of a monomania for happiness or love or fulfilment it is not laisser aller it is liferootedness it is being by oneself lifeliving like the muchmooted lily one toils one spins one strives just as the lily does but like her taking ones own lifeway amidst everything and taking ones own lifeway alone love too but there also taking ones way alone happily alone in all the wonders of communion swept up on the winds but never swept away from ones very self two eagles in midair maybe like whitmans dalliance of eagles two eagles in midair grappling whirling coming to their intensification of loveoneness there in midair in midair the love consummation but all the time each lifted on its own wings each bearing itself up on its own wings at every moment of the midair love consummation that is the splendid loveway              the party was festive at dinnertime the women in their finest dresses new flowers on the table the best wine going it was sunday evening aaron too was dressedand lady franks in black lace and pearls was almost gay there were quails for dinner the colonel was quite happy an air of conviviality gathered round the table during the course of the meal  i hope said aaron that we shall have some music tonight  i want so much to hear your flute said his hostess  and i your piano he said  i am very weakvery out of practise i tremble at the thought of playing before a musician but you must not be too critical  oh said aaron i am not a man to be afraid of  well we will see said lady franks but i am afraid of music itself  yes said aaron i think it is risky  risky i dont see that music risky bach beethoven no i dont agree on the contrary i think it is most elevatingmost morally inspiring no i tremble before it because it is so wonderful and elevating  i often find it makes me feel diabolical said he  that is your misfortune i am sure said lady franks please do take anotherbut perhaps you dont like mushrooms  aaron quite liked mushrooms and helped himself to the entree  but perhaps said she you are too modern you dont care for bach or beethoven or chopindear chopin  i find them all quite as modern as i am  is that so yes for myself i am quite oldfashionedthough i can appreciate strauss and stravinsky as well some things but my old thingsah i dont think the moderns are so fine they are not so deep they havent fathomed life so deeply lady franks sighed faintly  they dont care for depths said aaron  no they havent the capacity but i like big deep music oh i love orchestra but my instrument is the piano i like the great masters bach beethoven they have such faith you were talking of faithbelieving that things would work out well for you in the end beethoven inspires that in me too  he makes you feel that all will be well with you at last  yes he does he makes me feel faith in my personal destiny and i do feel that there is something in ones special fate i feel that i myself have a special kind of fate that will always look after me  and you can trust to it  yes i can it always turns out right i think something has gone wrongand then it always turns out right why when we were in londonwhen we were at lunch one morning it suddenly struck me havent i left my fur cloak somewhere it was rather cold so i had taken it with me and then never put it on and i hadnt brought it home i had left it somewhere but whether in a taxi or in a shop or in a little show of pictures i had been to i couldnt remember i could not remember and i thought to myself have i lost my cloak i went round to everywhere i could think of notrace of it but i didnt give it up something prompted me not to give it up quite distinctly i felt something telling me that i should get it back so i called at scotland yard and gave the information well two days later i had a notice from scotland yard so i went and there was my cloak i had it back and that has happened to me almost every time i almost always get my things back and i always feel that something looks after me do you know almost takes care of me  but do you mean when you lose thingsor in your life  i mean when i lose thingsor when i want to get something i wanti am very nearly always successful and i always feel there is some sort of higher power which does it for me  finds your cloak for you  yes wasnt it extraordinary i felt when i saw my cloak in scotland yard there i knew i should recover you and i always feel as i say that there is some higher power which helps me do you feel the same  no not that way worse luck i lost a batch of music a month ago which didnt belong to meand which i couldnt replace but i never could recover it though im sure nobody wanted it  how very unfortunate whereas my fur cloak was just the thing that gets stolen most  i wished some power would trace my music but apparently we arent all gifted alike with guardian angels  apparently not and that is how i regard it almost as a gift you know that my fairy godmother gave me in my cradle  for always recovering your property  yesand succeeding in my undertakings  im afraid i had no fairy godmother  welli think i had and very glad i am of it  why yes said aaron looking at his hostess  so the dinner sailed merrily on  but does beethoven make you feel said aaron as an afterthought in the same waythat you will always find the things you have lost  yeshe makes me feel the same faith that what i lose will be returned to me just as i found my cloak and that if i enter into an undertaking it will be successful  and your life has been always successful  yesalmost always we have succeeded with almost everything  why yes said aaron looking at her again  but even so he could see a good deal of hard wornness under her satisfaction she had had her suffering sure enough but none the less she was in the main satisfied she sat there a good hostess and expected the homage due to her success and of course she got it aaron himself did his little share of shoelicking and swallowed the taste of bootpolish with a grimace knowing what he was about  the dinner wound gaily to an end the ladies retired sir william left his seat of honour at the end of the table and came and sat next to aaron summoning the other three men to cluster near  now colonel said the host send round the bottle  with a flourish of the elbow and shoulder the colonel sent on the port actually port in those bleak postwar days  well mr sisson said sir william we will drink to your kind providence providing of course that we shall give no offence by so doing  no sir no sir the providence belonged to mr lilly mr sisson put his money on kindly fortune i believe said arthur who rosy and fresh with wine looked as if he would make a marvelous bonne bouchee for a finelydiscriminating cannibal  ah yes indeed a much more ingratiating lady to lift our glasses to mr sissons kindly fortune fortuna gentilissima well mr sisson and may your lady fortune ever smile on you  sir william lifted his glass with an odd little smirk some touch of a strange prim old satyr lurking in his oddly inclined head nay more than satyr that curious rather terrible iron demon that has fought with the world and wrung wealth from it and which knows all about it the devilish spirit of iron itself and iron machines so with his strange old smile showing his teeth rather terribly the old knight glowered sightlessly over his glass at aaron then he drank the strange careful oldmans gesture in drinking  but said aaron if fortune is a female  fortune fortune why fortune is a lady what do you say major  she has all the airs of one sir william said the major with the wistful grimness of his age and culture and the young fellow stared like a crucified cyclops from his one eye the black shutter being over the other  and all the graces capped sir william delighted with himself  oh quite said the major for some all the airs and for others all the graces  faint heart neer won fair lady my boy said sir william not that your heart is faint on the contraryas we know and your country knows but with lady fortune you need another kind of stout heartoh quite another kind  i believe it sir and the kind of stout heart which i am afraid i havent got said the major  what said the old man show the white feather before youve tackled the lady fill the majors glass colonel i am quite sure we will none of us ever say die  not likely not if we know it said the colonel stretching himself heartily inside his tunic he was becoming ruddier than the cherry all he cared about at the moment was his gay little port glass but the majors young cheek was hollow and sallow his one eye terribly pathetic  and you mr sisson said sir william mean to carry all before you by taking no thought for the morrow well now we can only wish you success  i dont want to carry all before me said aaron i should be sorry i want to walk past most of it  can you tell us where to i am intrigued as sybil says to know where you will walk to come now enlighten us  nowhere i suppose  but is that satisfactory can you find it satisfactory  is it even true said the major isnt it quite as positive an act to walk away from a situation as to walk towards it  my dear boy you cant merely walk away from a situation believe that if you walk away from rome you walk into the maremma or into the alban hills or into the seabut you walk into something now if i am going to walk away from rome i prefer to choose my direction and therefore my destination  but you cant said the major  what cant you  choose either your direction or your destination the major was obstinate  really said sir william i have not found it so i have not found it so i have had to keep myself hard at work all my life choosing between this or that  and we said the major have no choice except between this or nothing  really i am afraid said sir william i am afraid i am too oldor too youngwhich shall i sayto understand  too young sir said arthur sweetly the child was always father to the man i believe  i confess the major makes me feel childish said the old man the choice between this or nothing is a puzzler to me can you help me out mr sisson what do you make of this thisornothing business i can understand neckornothing  i prefer the nothing part of it to the this part of it said aaron grinning  colonel said the old man throw a little light on this nothingness  no sir william said the colonel i am all right as i am  as a matter of fact so are we all perfectly aone said arthur  aaron broke into a laugh  thats the top and bottom of it he laughed flushed with wine and handsome were all as right as ninepence only its rather nice to talk  there said sir william were all as right as ninepence were all as right ninepence so there well leave it before the major has time to say he is twopence short laughing his strange old soundless laugh sir william rose and made a little bow come up and join the ladies in a minute or two he said arthur opened the door for him and he left the room  the four men were silent for a momentthen the colonel whipped up the decanter and filled his glass then he stood up and clinked glasses with aaron like a real old sport  luck to you he said  thanks said aaron  youre going in the morning said arthur  yes said aaron  what train said arthur  eightforty  ohthen we shant see you again wellbest of luck  best of luck echoed the colonel  same to you said aaron and they all peered over their glasses and quite loved one another for a rosy minute  i should like to know though said the hollowcheeked young major with the black flap over his eye whether you do really mean you are all rightthat it is all right with youor whether you only say so to get away from the responsibility  i mean i dont really carei dont a damnlet the devil take it all  the devil doesnt want it either said the major  then let him leave it i dont care one single little curse about it all  be damned what is there to care about said the colonel  ay what said aaron  its all the same whether you care or dont care so i say its much easier not to care said arthur  of course it is said the colonel gaily  and i think so too said aaron  right you are were all as right as ninepencewhat good old sport heres yours cried the colonel  we shall have to be going up said arthur wise in his generation  as they went into the hall arthur suddenly put one arm round aarons waist and one arm round the colonels and the three did a sudden little barndance towards the stairs arthur was feeling himself quite let loose again back in his old regimental mess  approaching the foot of the stairs he let go again he was in that rosy condition when unitedwestand but unfortunately it is a complicated job to climb the stairs in unison the whole lot tends to fall backwards arthur therefore rosy plump looking so good to eat stood still a moment in order to find his own neatlyslippered feet having found them he proceeded to put them carefully one before the other and to his enchantment found that this procedure was carrying him magically up the stairs the colonel like a drowning man clutched feebly for the straw of the great stairrailand missed it he would have gone under but that aarons hand gripped his arm so orientating once more like a fragile tendril he reached again for the banister rail and got it after which lifting his feet as if they were little packets of sand tied to his trouser buttons he manipulated his way upwards aaron was in that pleasant state when he saw what everybody else was doing and was unconscious of what he did himself whilst tall gaunt erect like a murdered hamlet resurrected in khaki with the terrible black shutter over his eye the young major came last  arthur was making a stern fight for his composure his whole future depended on it but do what he would he could not get the flushed pleased messhappy look off his face the colonel oh awful man did a sort of plump rolypolycakewalk like a fat boy right to the very door of that santumsanctorum the library aaron was inwardly convulsed even the major laughed  but arthur stiffened himself militarily and cleared his throat all four started to compose themselves like actors going on the stage outside that library door and then arthur softly almost wistfully opened and held the door for the others to pass the colonel slunk meekly in and sat in a chair in the background the major stalked in expressionless and hovered towards the sofa where his wife sat  there was a rather coldwaterdownyourback feeling in the library the ladies had been waiting for coffee sir william was waiting too therefore in a little tension half silent the coffee was handed round lady franks was discussing something with arthurs wife arthurs wife was in a cream lace dress and looking what is called lovely the majors wife was in amethyst chiffon with darkred roses and was looking blindingly beautiful the colonel was looking into his coffeecup as wistfully as if it contained the illusion of tawny port the major was looking into space as if there and there alone etc arthur was looking for something which lady franks had asked for and which he was much too flushed to find sir william was looking at aaron and preparing for another coeur a coeur  well he said i doubt if you will care for milan it is one of the least italian of all the towns in my opinion venice of course is a thing apart i cannot stand myself that miserable specimen the modern roman he has most of the vices of the old romans and none of the virtues the most congenial town perhaps for a stranger is florence but it has a very bad climate  lady franks rose significantly and left the room accompanied by arthurs wife aaron knew silently that he was summoned to follow his hostess had her eye on him this evening but always postponing his obedience to the cool commands of women he remained talking with his host in the library and sipping creme de menthe came the ripple of the pianoforte from the open doorway down at the further end of the room lady franks was playing in the large drawingroom and the ripple of the music contained in it the hard insistence of the little womans will coldly and decidedly she intended there should be no more unsettling conversations for the old sir william aaron was to come forthwith into the drawing room which aaron plainly understoodand so he didnt go no he didnt go though the pianoforte rippled and swelled in volume no and he didnt go even when lady franks left off playing and came into the library again there he sat talking with sir william let us do credit to lady franks willpower and admit that the talk was quite empty and distractednone of the depths and skirmishes of the previous occasions none the less the talk continued lady franks retired discomfited to her piano again she would never break in upon her lord  so now aaron relented he became more and more distracted sir william wandered away like some restless hunted soul the colonel still sat in his chair nursing his last drop of creme de menthe resentfully he did not care for the green toffeestuff arthur was busy the major lay sprawled in the last stages of everything on the sofa holding his wifes hand and the music came pathetically through the open foldingdoors of course she played with feelingit went without saying aarons soul felt rather tired but she had a touch of discrimination also  he rose and went to the drawingroom it was a large vacantseeming empire sort of drawingroom with yellow silk chairs along the walls and yellow silk panels upon the walls and a huge vasty crystal chandelier hanging from a farawayabove ceiling lady franks sat at a large black bechstein piano at one end of this vacant yellow stateroom she sat a little plump elderly lady in black lace for all the world like queen victoria in max beerbohms drawing of alfred tennyson reading to her victorian majesty with space before her arthurs wife was bending over some music in a remote corner of the big room  aaron seated himself on one of the chairs by the wall to listen certainly it was a beautiful instrument and certainly in her way she loved it but aaron remembered an anthem in which he had taken part as a boy                       his eye is on the sparrow                     so i know he watches me   for a long time he had failed to catch the word sparrow and had heard                       his eye is on the spyhole                     so i know he watches me   which was just how it had all seemed to him as a boy  now as ever he felt the eye was on the spyhole there sat the woman playing music but her inward eye was on the spyhole of her vital affairsher domestic arrangements her control of her household guests and husband included the other eye was left for the music dont you know  sir william appeared hovering in the doorway not at all liking the defection of mr aaron then he retreated he seemed not to care for music the majors wife hoveredfelt it her duty to aude or play audienceand entered seating herself in a breath of lilac and amethyst again at the near distance the major after a certain beating about the bush followed and sat wrapt in dim contemplation near his wife arthur luckily was still busy with something  aaron of course made proper musical remarks in the intervalsarthurs wife sorted out more pieces arthur appearedand then the colonel the colonel tiptoed beautifully across the wide blank space of the empire room and seated himself on a chair rather in the distance with his back to the wall facing aaron when lady franks finished her piece to everybodys amazement the colonel clapped gaily to himself and said bravo as if at a cafe chantant looking round for his glass but there was no glass so he crossed his neatlykhakied legs and looked rapt again  lady franks started with a vivace schumann piece everybody listened in sanctified silence trying to seem to like it when suddenly our colonel began to spring and bounce in his chair slinging his loose leg with a kind of rapture up and down in the air and capering upon his posterior doing a sittingdown jig to the schumann vivace arthur who had seated himself at the farthest extremity of the room winked with wild bliss at aaron the major tried to look as if he noticed nothing and only succeeded in looking agonised his wife studied the point of her silver shoe minutely and peeped through her hair at the performance aaron grimly chuckled and loved the colonel with real tenderness  and the game went on while the vivace lasted up and down bounced the plump colonel on his chair kicking with his bright blackpatent toe higher and higher getting quite enthusiastic over his jig rosy and unabashed he was worthy of the great nation he belonged to the broadseated empire chair showed no signs of giving way let him enjoy himself away there across the yellow sahara of this silkpanelled salon aaron felt quite cheered up  well now he thought to himself this man is in entire command of a very important branch of the british service in italy we are a great race still  but lady franks must have twigged her playing went rather stiff she came to the end of the vivace movement and abandoned her piece  i always prefer schumann in his vivace moods said aaron  do you said lady franks oh i dont know  it was now the turn of arthurs wife to sing arthur seemed to get further away if it was possible for he was at the remotest remote end of the room near the gallery doors the colonel became quiet pensive the majors wife eyed the young woman in white lace and seemed not to care for lace arthur seemed to be trying to push himself backwards through the wall lady franks switched on more lights into the vast and voluminous crystal chandelier which hung like some glorycloud above the rooms centre and arthurs wife sang sweet little french songs and ye banks and braes and caro mio ben which goes without saying and so on she had quite a nice voice and was quite adequately trained which is enough said aaron had all his nerves on edge  then he had to play the flute arthur strolled upstairs with him arminarm where he went to fetch his instrument  i find music in the home rather a strain you know said arthur  cruel strain i quite agree said aaron  i dont mind it so much in the theatreor even a concertwhere there are a lot of other people to take the edge off but after a good dinner  its medicine said aaron  well you know it really is to me it affects my inside aaron laughed and then in the yellow drawingroom blew into his pipe and played he knew so well that arthur the major the majors wife the colonel and sir william thought it merely an intolerable bore however he played his hostess even accompanied him in a mozart bit     chapter xiv xx settembre   aaron was awakened in the morning by the soft entrance of the butler with the tray it was just seven oclock lady franks household was punctual as the sun itself  but our hero roused himself with a wrench the very act of lifting himself from the pillow was like a fight this morning why he recognized his own wrench the pain with which he struggled under the necessity to move why shouldnt he want to move why not because he didnt want the day in frontthe plunge into a strange country towards nowhere with no aim in view true he said that ultimately he wanted to join lilly but this was hardly more than a sop an excuse for his own irrational behaviour he was breaking loose from one connection after another and what for why break every tie snap snap snap went the bonds and ligatures which bound him to the life that had formed him the people he had loved or liked he found all his affections snapping off all the ties which united him with his own people coming asunder and why in gods name why what was there instead  there was nothingness there was just himself and blank nothingness he had perhaps a faint sense of lilly ahead of him an impulse in that direction or else merely an illusion he could not persuade himself that he was seeking for love for any kind of unison or communion he knew well enough that the thought of any loving any sort of real coming together between himself and anybody or anything was just objectionable to him nohe was not moving towards anything he was moving almost violently away from everything and that was what he wanted only that only let him not run into any sort of embrace with anything or anybodythis was what he asked let no new connection be made between himself and anything on earth let all old connections break this was his craving  yet he struggled under it this morning as under the lid of a tomb the terrible sudden weight of inertia he knew the tray stood ready by the bed he knew the automobile would be at the door at eight oclock for lady franks had said so and he half divined that the servant had also said so yet there he lay in a kind of paralysis in this bed he seemed for the moment to have lost his will why go forward into more nothingness away from all that he knew all he was accustomed to and all he belonged to  however with a click he sat up and the very instant he had poured his coffee from the little silver coffeepot into his delicate cup he was ready for anything and everything the sense of silent adventure took him the exhilarated feeling that he was fulfilling his own inward destiny pleasant to taste was the coffee the bread the honeydelicious  the man brought his clothes and again informed him that the automobile would be at the door at eight oclock or at least so he made out  i can walk said aaron  milady ha comandato lautomobile said the man softly  it was evident that if milady had ordered it so it must be  so aaron left the stillsleeping house and got into the soft and luxurious car as he dropped through the park he wondered that sir william and lady franks should be so kind to him a complete stranger but so it was there he sat in their car he wondered also as he ran over the bridge and into the city whether this softrunning automobile would ever rouse the socialistic bile of the workpeople for the first time in his life as he sat among the snug cushions he realised what it might be to be rich and uneasy uneasy even if not afraid lurking there inside an expensive carwell it wasnt much of a sensation anyhow and riches were stuffy like wadded upholstery on everything he was glad to get out into the fresh air of the common crowd he was glad to be in the bleak notverybusy station he was glad to be part of common life for the very atmosphere of riches seems to be stuffed and wadded never any real reaction it was terrible as if ones very body shoulders and arms were upholstered and made cushiony ugh but he was glad to shake off himself the atmosphere of wealth and motorcars to get out of it all it was like getting out of quilted clothes  well thought aaron if this is all it amounts to to be rich you can have riches they talk about money being power but the only sort of power it has over me is to bring on a kind of numbness which i fairly hate no wonder rich people dont seem to be really alive  the relief of escaping quite took away his selfconscious embarrassment at the station he carried his own bags bought a thirdclass ticket and got into the train for milan without caring one straw for the comments or the looks of the porters  it began to rain the rain ran across the great plain of north italy aaron sat in his woodseated carriage and smoked his pipe in silence looking at the thick short lombards opposite him without heeding them he paid hardly any outward attention to his surroundings but sat involved in himself  in milan he had been advised to go to the hotel britannia because it was not expensive and english people went there so he took a carriage drove round the green space in front of milan station and away into the town the streets were busy but only halfheartedly so  it must be confessed that every new move he made was rather an effort even he himself wondered why he was struggling with foreign porters and foreign cabmen being talked at and not understanding a word but there he was so he went on with it  the hotel was small and congenial the hotel porter answered in english aaron was given a little room with a tiny balcony looking on to a quiet street so he had a home of his own once more he washed and then counted his money thirtyseven pounds he had and no more he stood on the balcony and looked at the people going by below life seems to be moving so quick when one looks down on it from above  across the road was a large stone house with its green shutters all closed but from the flagpole under the eaves over the central window of the uppermost floorthe house was four storeys highwaved the italian flag in the melancholy damp air aaron looked at itthe red white and green tricolour with the white cross of savoy in the centre it hung damp and still and there seemed a curious vacancy in the citysomething empty and depressing in the great human centre not that there was really a lack of people but the spirit of the town seemed depressed and empty it was a national holiday the italian flag was hanging from almost every housefront  it was about three oclock in the afternoon aaron sat in the restaurant of the hotel drinking tea for he was rather tired and looking through the thin curtains at the little square outside where people passed little groups of dark aimlessseeming men a little bit poorer lookingperhaps rather shorter in staturebut very much like the people in any other town yet the feeling of the city was so different from that of london there seemed a curious emptiness the rain had ceased but the pavements were still wet there was a tension  suddenly there was a noise of two shots fired in rapid succession aaron turned startled to look into the quiet piazza and to his amazement the pavements were empty not a soul was in sight two minutes before the place was busy with passersby and a newspaper man selling the corriere and little carriages rattling through now as if by magic nobody nothing it was as if they had all melted into thin air  the waiter too was peeping behind the curtain a carriage came trotting into the squarean odd man took his way alonethe traffic began to stir once more and people reappeared as suddenly as they had disappeared then the waiter ran hastily and furtively out and craned his neck peering round the square he spoke with two youthsrather loutish youths then he returned to his duty in the hotel restaurant  what was it what were the shots aaron asked him  ohsomebody shooting at a dog said the man negligently  at a dog said aaron with round eyes  he finished his tea and went out into the town his hotel was not far from the cathedral square passing through the arcade he came in sight of the famous cathedral with its numerous spines pricking into the afternoon air he was not as impressed as he should have been and yet there was something in the northern citythis big square with all the trams threading through the little yellow continental trams and the spiny bulk of the great cathedral like a greypurple seaurchin with many spines on the one side the ornamental grassplots and flower beds on the other the big shops going all along the further strands all round and the endless restless nervous drift of a north italian crowd so nervous so twitchy nervous and twitchy as the slipping past of the little yellow tramcars it all affected him with a sense of strangeness nervousness and approaching winter it struck him the people were afraid of themselves afraid of their own souls and that which was in their own souls  turning up the broad steps of the cathedral he entered the famous building the sky had cleared and the freshened light shone coloured in living tablets round the wonderful towering rosehearted dusk of the great church at some altars lights flickered uneasily at some unseen side altar mass was going on and a strange ragged music fluttered out on the incensedusk of the great and lofty interior which was all shadow all shadow hung round with jewel tablets of light particularly beautiful the great east bay above the great altar and all the time over the bigpatterned marble floor the faint click and rustle of feet coming and going coming and going like shallow uneasy water rustled back and forth in a trough a white dog trotted pale through the underdusk over the pale bigpatterned floor aaron came to the side altar where mass was going on candles ruddily wavering there was a small cluster of kneeling womena ragged handful of onlooking menand people wandering up and wandering away young women with neatly dressed black hair and shawls but without hats fine young women in very high heels young men with nothing to do ragged men with nothing to do all strayed faintly clicking over the slabbed floor and glanced at the flickering altar where the whitesurpliced boys were curtseying and the whiteandgold priest bowing his hands over his breast in the candlelight all strayed glanced lingered and strayed away again as if the spectacle were not sufficiently holding the bell chimed for the elevation of the host but the thin trickle of people trickled the same uneasily over the slabbed floor of the vastlyupreaching shadowfoliaged cathedral  the smell of incense in his nostrils aaron went out again by a side door and began to walk along the pavements of the cathedral square looking at the shops some were closed and had little notices pinned on them some were open and seemed halfstocked with halfelegant things men were carrying newspapers in the cafes a few men were seated drinking vermouth in the doorway of the restaurants waiters stood inert looking out on the streets the curious hearteating ennui of the big town on a holiday came over our hero he felt he must get out whatever happened he could not bear it  so he went back to his hotel and up to his room it was still only five oclock and he did not know what to do with himself he lay down on the bed and looked at the painting on his bedroom ceiling it was a terrible business in reckitts blue and browny gold with awful heraldic beasts rather wormwriggly displayed in a blue field  as he lay thinking of nothing and feeling nothing except a certain weariness or dreariness or tension or godknowswhat he heard a loud hoarse noise of humanity in the distance something frightening rising he went on to his little balcony it was a sort of procession or march of men here and there a red flag fluttering from a mans fist there had been a big meeting and this was the issue the procession was irregular but powerful men four abreast they emerged irregularly from the small piazza to the street calling and vociferating they stopped before a shop and clotted into a crowd shouting becoming vicious over the shopdoor hung a tricolour a national flag the shop was closed but the men began to knock at the door they were all workmen some in railway mens caps mostly in black felt hats some wore red cotton neckties they lifted their faces to the national flag and as they shouted and gesticulated aaron could see their strong teeth in their jaws there was something frightening in their lean strong italian jaws something inhuman and possessedlooking in their foreign southernshaped faces so much more formed and demonlooking than northern faces they had a demonlike set purpose and the noise of their voices was like a jarring of steel weapons aaron wondered what they wanted there were no womenall mena strange male slashing sound vicious it wasthe head of the procession swirling like a little pool the thick wedge of the procession beyond flecked with red flags  a window opened above the shop and a frowstylooking man yellowpale was quickly and nervously hauling in the national flag there were shouts of derision and mockerya great overtone of acrid derisionthe flag and its owner ignominiously disappeared and the procession moved on almost every shop had a flag flying and every one of these flags now disappeared quickly or slowly sooner or later in obedience to the command of the vicious derisive crowd that marched and clotted slowly down the street having its own way  only one flag remained flyingthe big tricolour that floated from the top storey of the house opposite aarons hotel the ground floor of this house consisted of shoppremisesnow closed there was no sign of any occupant the flag floated inert aloft  the whole crowd had come to a stop immediately below the hotel and all were now looking up at the green and white and red tricolour which stirred damply in the early evening light from under the broad eaves of the house opposite aaron looked at the long flag which drooped almost unmoved from the eavesshadow and he half expected it to furl itself up of its own accord in obedience to the will of the masses then he looked down at the packed black shoulders of the mob below and at the curious clustering pattern of a sea of black hats he could hardly see anything but hats and shoulders uneasily moving like boiling pitch away beneath him but the shouts began to come up hotter and hotter there had been a great ringing of a doorbell and battering on the shopdoor the crowdthe swollen head of the processiontalked and shouted occupying the centre of the street but leaving the pavement clear a woman in a white blouse appeared in the shopdoor she came out and looked up at the flag and shook her head and gesticulated with her hands it was evidently not her flagshe had nothing to do with it the leaders again turned to the large housedoor and began to ring all the bells and to knock with their knuckles but no goodthere was no answer they looked up again at the flag voices rose ragged and ironical the woman explained something again apparently there was nobody at home in the upper floorsall entrance was lockedthere was no caretaker nobody owned the flag there it hung under the broad eaves of the strong stone house and didnt even know that it was guilty the woman went back into her shop and drew down the iron shutter from inside  the crowd nonplussed now began to argue and shout and whistle the voices rose in pitch and derision steam was getting up there hung the flag the procession crowded forward and filled the street in a mass below all the rest of the street was empty and shut up and still hung the showy rag red and white and green up aloft  suddenly there was a lullthen shouts halfencouraging halfderisive and aaron saw a smallishblack figure of a youth fairhaired not more than seventeen years old clinging like a monkey to the front of the house and by the help of the heavy drainpipe and the stonework ornamentation climbing up to the stone ledge that ran under groundfloor windows up like a sudden cat on to the projecting footing he did not stop there but continued his race like some frantic lizard running up the great wallfront working away from the noise below as if in sheer fright it was one unending wriggling movement sheer up the front of the impassive heavy stone house  the flag hung from a pole under one of the windows of the top storeythe third floor up went the wriggling figure of the possessed youth the cries of the crowd below were now wild ragged ejaculations of excitement and encouragement the youth seemed to be lifted up almost magically on the intense upreaching excitement of the massed men below he passed the ledge of the first floor like a lizard he wriggled up and passed the ledge or coping of the second floor and there he was like an upwardclimbing shadow scrambling on to the coping of the third floor the crowd was for a second electrically still as the boy rose there erect cleaving to the wall with the tips of his fingers  but he did not hesitate for one breath he was on his feet and running along the narrow coping that went across the house under the third floor windows running there on that narrow footing away above the street straight to the flag he had got ithe had clutched it in his hand a handful of it exactly like a great flame rose the simultaneous yell of the crowd as the boy jerked and got the flag loose he had torn it down a tremendous prolonged yell touched with a snarl of triumph and searing like a puff of flame sounded as the boy remained for one moment with the flag in his hand looking down at the crowd below his face was odd and elated and still then with the slightest gesture he threw the flag from him and aaron watched the gaudy remnant falling towards the many faces whilst the noise of yelling rose up unheard  there was a great clutch and hiss in the crowd the boy still stood unmoved holding by one hand behind him looking down from above from his dangerous elevation in a sort of abstraction  and the next thing aaron was conscious of was the sound of trumpets a sudden startling challenge of trumpets and out of nowhere a sudden rush of greygreen carabinieri battering the crowd wildly with truncheons it was so sudden that aaron heard nothing any more he only saw  in utmost amazement he saw the greenygrey uniformed carabinieri rushing thick and wild and indiscriminate on the crowd a sudden new excited crowd in uniforms attacking the black crowd beating them wildly with truncheons there was a seething moment in the street below and almost instantaneously the original crowd burst into a terror of frenzy the mob broke as if something had exploded inside it a few blackhatted men fought furiously to get themselves free of the hated soldiers in the confusion bunches of men staggered reeled fell and were struggling among the legs of their comrades and of the carabinieri but the bulk of the crowd just burst and fledin every direction like drops of water they seemed to fly up at the very walls themselves they darted into any entry any doorway they sprang up the walls and clambered into the groundfloor windows they sprang up the walls on to windowledges and then jumped down again and ranclambering wriggling darting running in every direction some cut blood on their faces terror or frenzy of flight in their hearts not so much terror as the frenzy of running away in a breath the street was empty  and all the time there above on the stone coping stood the longfaced fairhaired boy while four stout carabinieri in the street below stood with uplifted revolvers and covered him shouting that if he moved they would shoot so there he stood still looking down still holding with his left hand behind him covered by the four revolvers he was not so much afraid as twitchily selfconscious because of his false position  meanwhile down below the crowd had dispersedmelted momentaneously the carabinieri were busy arresting the men who had fallen and been trodden underfoot or who had foolishly let themselves be taken perhaps half a dozen men half a dozen prisoners less rather than more the sergeant ordered these to be secured between soldiers and last of all the youth up above still covered by the revolvers was ordered to come down he turned quite quietly and quite humbly cautiously picked his way along the coping towards the drainpipe he reached this pipe and began in humiliation to climb down it was a real climb down  once in the street he was surrounded by the grey uniforms the soldiers formed up the sergeant gave the order and away they marched the dejected youth a prisoner between them  then were heard a few scattered yells of derision and protest a few shouts of anger and derision against the carabinieri there were once more gangs of men and groups of youths along the street they sent up an occasional shout but always over their shoulders and pretending it was not they who shouted they were all cowed and hangdog once more and made not the slightest effort to save the youth nevertheless they prowled and watched ready for the next time  so away went the prisoner and the greygreen soldiers and the street was left to the little gangs and groups of hangdog discontented men all thoroughly out of countenance the scene was ended  aaron looked round dazed and then for the first time he noticed on the next balcony to his own two young men young gentlemen he would have said the one was tall and handsome and wellcoloured might be italian but the other with his pale thin face and his rimless monocle in his eye he was surely an englishman he was surely one of the young officers shattered by the war a look of strange arch birdlike pleasure was on his face at this moment if one could imagine the gleaming smile of a white owl over the events that had just passed this was the impression produced on aaron by the face of the young man with the monocle the other youth the ruddy handsome one had knitted his brows in mock distress and was glancing with a look of shrewd curiosity at aaron and with a look of almost selfsatisfied excitement first to one end of the street then to the other  but imagine angus its all over he said laying his hand on the arm of the monocled young man and making great eyesnot without a shrewd glance in aarons direction  did you see him fall replied angus with another strange gleam  yes but was he hurt  i dont know i should think so he fell right back out of that on to those stones  but how perfectly awful did you ever see anything like it  no its one of the funniest things i ever did see i saw nothing quite like it even in the war  here aaron withdrew into his room his mind and soul were in a whirl he sat down in his chair and did not move again for a great while when he did move he took his flute and played he knew not what but strange strange his soul passed into his instrument or passed half into his instrument there was a big residue left to go bitter or to ferment into gold old wine of wisdom  he did not notice the dinner gong and only the arrival of the chambermaid to put the washtable in order sent him down to the restaurant the first thing he saw as he entered was the two young englishmen seated at a table in a corner just behind him their hair was brushed straight back from their foreheads making the sweep of the head bright and impeccable and leaving both the young faces clear as if in cameo angus had laid his monocle on the table and was looking round the room with wide lightblue eyes looking hard like some birdcreature and seeming to see nothing he had evidently been very ill was still very ill his cheeks and even his jaw seemed shrunken almost withered he forgot his dinner or he did not care for it probably the latter  what do you think francis he said of making a plan to see florence and sienna and orvieto on the way down instead of going straight to rome he spoke in precise particularlyenunciated words in a publicschool manner but with a strong twang of south wales  why angus came the graceful voice of francis i thought we had settled to go straight through via pisa francis was graceful in everythingin his tall elegant figure in the poses of his handsome head in the modulation of his voice  yes but i see we can go either wayeither pisa or florence and i thought it might be nice to look at florence and sienna and orvieto i believe theyre very lovely came the soft precise voice of angus ending in a touch of odd emotion on the words very lovely as if it were a new experience to him to be using them  im sure theyre marvellous im quite sure theyre marvellously beautiful said francis in his assured elegant way well then angussuppose we do that thenwhen shall we start  angus was the nervous insister francis was quite occupied with his own thoughts and calculations and curiosity for he was very curious not to say inquisitive and at the present moment he had a new subject to ponder  this new subject was aaron who sat with his back to our new couple and who with his fine sharp ears caught every word that they said aarons back was broad enough and his shoulders square and his head rather small and fairish and wellshapedand francis was intrigued he wanted to know was the man english he looked so englishyet he might behe might perhaps be danish scandinavian or dutch therefore the elegant young man watched and listened with all his ears  the waiter who had brought aaron his soup now came very free and easy to ask for further orders  what would you like to drink wine chianti or white wine or beerthe oldfashioned sir was dropped it is too oldfashioned now since the war  what should i drink said aaron whose acquaintance with wines was not very large  halflitre of chianti that is very good said the waiter with the air of a man who knew only too well how to bring up his betters and train them in the way they should go  all right said aaron  the welcome sound of these two magic words all right was what the waiter most desired all right yes all right this is the pith the marrow the sum and essence of the english language to a southerner of course it is not all right it is orryeand one word at that the blow that would be given to most foreign waiters if they were forced to realize that the famous orye was really composed of two words and spelt all right would be too cruel perhaps  half litre chianti orye said the waiter and well let him say it  english whispered francis melodramatically in the ear of angus i thought so the flautist  angus put in his monocle and stared at the oblivious shoulders of aaron without apparently seeing anything yes obviously english said angus pursing like a bird  oh but i heard him whispered francis emphatically quite said angus but quite inoffensive  oh but angus my dearhes the flautist dont you remember the divine bit of scriabin at least i believe it was scriabinbut perfectly divine i adore the flute above all things and francis placed his hand on angus arm and rolled his eyeslay this to the credit of a bottle of lacrimae cristi if you like  yes so do i said angus again looking archly through the monocle and seeing nothing i wonder what hes doing here  dont you think we might ask him said francis in a vehement whisper after all we are the only three english people in the place  for the moment apparently we are said angus but the english are all over the place wherever you go like bits of orange peel in the street dont forget that francesco  no angus i dont the point is his flute is perfectly divineand he seems quite attractive in himself dont you think so  oh quite said angus whose observations had got no further than the black cloth of the back of aarons jacket that there was a man inside he had not yet paused to consider  quite a musician said francis  the hired sort said angus most probably  but he playshe plays most marvellously that you cant get away from angus  i quite agree said angus  well then dont you think we might hear him again dont you think we might get him to play for usbut i should love it more than anything  yes i should too said angus you might ask him to coffee and a liqueur  i should like tomost awfully but do you think i might  oh yes he wont mind being offered a coffee and liqueur we can give him something decentwheres the waiter angus lifted his pinched ugly bare face and looked round with weird command for the waiter the waiter having not much to do and feeling ready to draw these two weird young birds allowed himself to be summoned  wheres the wine list what liqueurs have you got demanded angus abruptly  the waiter rattled off a list beginning with strega and ending with cherry brandy  grand marnier said angus and leave the bottle  then he looked with arch triumph at francis like a wicked bird francis bit his finger moodily and glowered with handsome darkblue uncertain eyes at mr aaron who was just surveying the frutte which consisted of two rather old pomegranates and various pale yellow apples with a sprinkling of withered dried figs at the moment they all looked like a natura morta arrangement  but do you think i might said francis moodily angus pursed his lips with a reckless brightness  why not i see no reason why you shouldnt he said whereupon francis cleared his throat disposed of his serviette and rose to his feet slowly but gracefully then he composed himself and took on the air he wished to assume at the moment it was a nice degage air half naive and half enthusiastic then he crossed to aarons table and stood on one lounging hip gracefully and bent forward in a confidential manner and said  do excuse me but i must ask you if it was you we heard playing the flute so perfectly wonderfully just before dinner  the voice was confidential and ingratiating aaron relieved from the worlds stress and seeing life anew in the rosy glow of half a litre of good old chiantithe war was so near but gone bylooked up at the dark blue ingenuous welladapted eyes of our friend francis and smiling said  yes i saw you on the balcony as well  oh did you notice us plunged francis but wasnt it an extraordinary affair  very said aaron i couldnt make it out could you  oh cried francis i never try its all much too new and complicated for mebut perhaps you know italy  no i dont said aaron  neither do we and we feel rather stunned we had only just arrivedand thenoh francis put up his hand to his comely brow and rolled his eyes i feel perfectly overwhelmed with it still  he here allowed himself to sink friendlily into the vacant chair opposite aarons  yes i thought it was a bit exciting said aaron i wonder what will become of him  of the one who climbed for the flag you mean nobut wasnt it perfectly marvellous oh incredible quite incredibleand then your flute to finish it all oh i felt it only wanted thati havent got over it yet but your playing was marvellous really marvellous do you know i cant forget it you are a professional musician of course  if you mean i play for a living said aaron i have played in orchestras in london  of course of course i knew you must be a professional but dont you give private recitals too  no i never have  oh cried francis catching his breath i cant believe it but you play marvellously oh i just loved it it simply swept me away after that scene in the street it seemed to sum it all up you know  did it said aaron rather grimly  but wont you come and have coffee with us at our table said francis we should like it most awfully if you would  yes thank you said aaron halfrising  but you havent had your dessert said francis laying a fatherly detaining hand on the arm of the other man aaron looked at the detaining hand  the dessert isnt much to stop for he said i can take with me what i want and he picked out a handful of dried figs  the two went across to angus table  were going to take coffee together said francis complacently playing the host with a suave assurance that was rather amusing and charming in him  yes im very glad said angus let us give the show away he was being wilfully nice but he was quite glad to be able to be so nice anything to have a bit of life going especially a bit of pleased life he looked at aarons comely winewarmed face with gratification  have a grand marnier he said i dont know how bad it is everything is bad now they lay it down to the war as well it used to be quite a decent drink what the war had got to do with bad liqueurs i dont know  aaron sat down in a chair at their table  but let us introduce ourselves said francis i am francisor really franz dekkerand this is angus guest my friend  and my name is aaron sisson  what what did you say said francis leaning forward he too had sharp ears  aaron sisson  aaron sisson oh but how amusing what a nice name  no better than yours is it  mine franz dekker oh much more amusing i think said francis archly  oh well its a matter of opinion youre the double decker not me  the double decker said francis archly why what do you mean he rolled his eyes significantly but may i introduce my friend angus guest  youve introduced me already francesco said angus  so sorry said francis  guest said aaron  francis suddenly began to laugh  may he not be guest he asked fatherly  very likely said aaron not that i was ever good at guessing  francis tilted his eyebrows fortunately the waiter arrived with the coffee  tell me said francis will you have your coffee black or with milk he was determined to restore a tone of sobriety  the coffee was sipped in sober solemnity  is music your line as well then asked aaron  no were painters were going to work in rome  to earn your living  not yet  the amount of discretion modesty and reserve which francis put into these two syllables gave aaron to think that he had two real young swells to deal with  no continued francis i was only just down from oxford when the war cameand angus had been about ten months at the sladebut i have always paintedso now we are going to work really hard in rome to make up for lost timeoh one has lost so much time in the war and such precious time i dont know if ever one will even be able to make it up again francis tilted his handsome eyebrows and put his head on one side with a wisedistressed look  no said angus one will never be able to make it up what is more one will never be able to start again where one left off were shattered old men now in one sense and in another sense were just prewar babies  the speech was uttered with an odd abruptness and didacticism which made aaron open his eyes angus had that peculiar manner he seemed to be haranguing himself in the circle of his own thoughts not addressing himself to his listener  so his listener listened on the outside edge of the young fellows crowded thoughts francis put on a distressed air and let his attention wander angus pursed his lips and his eyes were stretched wide with a kind of pleasure like a wicked owl which has just joyfully hooted an ill omen  tell me said francis to aaron where were you all the time during the war  i was doing my job said aaron which led to his explaining his origins  really so your music is quite new but how interesting cried francis  aaron explained further  and so the war hardly affected you but what did you feel about it privately  i didnt feel much i didnt know what to feel other folks did such a lot of feeling i thought id better keep my mouth shut  yes quite said angus everybody had such a lot of feelings on somebody elses behalf that nobody ever had time to realise what they felt themselves i know i was like that the feelings all came on to me from the outside like flies settling on meat before i knew where i was i was eaten up with a swarm of feelings and i found myself in the trenches god knows what for and ever since then ive been trying to get out of my swarm of feelings which buzz in and out of me and have nothing to do with me i realised it in hospital its exactly like trying to get out of a swarm of nasty dirty flies and every one you kill makes you sick but doesnt make the swarm any less  again angus pursed and bridled and looked like a pleased wicked white owl then he polished his monocle on a very choice silk handkerchief and fixed it unseeing in his left eye  but francis was not interested in his friends experiences for francis had had a job in the war officewhereas angus was a warhero with shattered nerves and let him depreciate his own experiences as much as he liked the young man with the monocle kept tight hold on his prestige as a war hero only for himself though he by no means insisted that anyone else should be warbitten  francis was one of those men who like women can set up the sympathetic flow and make a fellow give himself away without realising what he is doing so there sat our friend aaron amusingly unbosoming himself of all his history and experiences drawn out by the arch subtle attentiveness of the handsome francis angus listened too with pleased amusedness on his pale emaciated face pursing his shrunken jaw and aaron sipped various glasses of the liqueur and told all his tale as if it was a comedy a comedy it seemed too at that hour and a comedy no doubt it was but mixed like most things in this life mixed  it was quite late before this seance broke up and the waiter itching to get rid of the fellows  well now said francis as he rose from the table and settled his elegant waist resting on one hip as usual we shall see you in the morning i hope you say you are going to venice why have you some engagement in venice  no said aaron i only was going to look for a friendrawdon lilly  rawdon lilly why is he in venice oh ive heard such a lot about him i should like so much to meet him but i heard he was in germany  i dont know where he is  angus didnt we hear that lilly was in germany  yes in munich being psychoanalysed i believe it was  aaron looked rather blank  but have you anything to take you to venice its such a bad climate in the winter why not come with us to florence said francis  aaron wavered he really did not know what to do  think about it said francis laying his hand on aarons arm think about it tonight and well meet in the morning at what time  any time said aaron  well say eleven well meet in the lounge here at eleven will that suit you all right then its so awfully nice meeting you that marvellous fluteand think about florence but do come dont disappoint us  the two young men went elegantly upstairs     chapter xv a railway journey   the next day but one the three set off for florence aaron had made an excursion from milan with the two young heroes and dined with them subsequently at the most expensive restaurant in the town then they had all gone homeand had sat in the young mens bedroom drinking tea whilst aaron played the flute francis was really musical and enchanted angus enjoyed the novelty and the moderate patronage he was able to confer and aaron felt amused and pleased and hoped he was paying for his treat  so behold them setting off for florence in the early morning angus and francis had firstclass tickets aaron took a thirdclass  come and have lunch with us on the train said angus ill order three places and we can lunch together  oh i can buy a bit of food at the station said aaron  no come and lunch with us it will be much nicer and we shall enjoy it as well said angus  of course ever so much nicer of course cried francis yes why not indeed why should you hesitate  all right then said aaron not without some feeling of constraint  so they separated the young men settled themselves amidst the red plush and crochetwork looking with their hair plastered smoothly back quite as first class as you could wish creating quite the right impression on the porters and the travelling italians aaron went to his thirdclass further up the train  well then au revoir till luncheon cried francis  the train was fairly full in the third and second classes however aaron got his seat and the porter brought on his bags after disposing of the young mens luggage aaron gave the tip uneasily he always hated tippingit seemed humiliating both ways and the airy aplomb of the two young cavaliers as they settled down among the red plush and the obsequiousness and said well then au revoir till luncheon was peculiarly unsettling though they did not intend it so  the porter thinks im their servanttheir valet said aaron to himself and a curious halfamused halfcontemptuous look flickered on his face it annoyed him the falsity occasioned by the difference in the price of the tickets was really humiliating aaron had lived long enough to know that as far as manhood and intellect wentnay even educationhe was not the inferior of the two young gentlemen he knew quite well that as far as intrinsic nature went they did not imagine him an inferior rather the contrary they had rather an exaggerated respect for him and his lifepower and even his origin and yetthey had the inestimable cash advantageand they were going to keep it they knew it was nothing more than an artificial cash superiority but they gripped it all the more intensely they were the upper middle classes they were eton and oxford and they were going to hang on to their privileges in these days it is a fool who abdicates before hes forced to and therefore  well thenau revoir till luncheon  they were being so awfully nice and inwardly they were not condescending but socially they just had to be the world is made like that it wasnt their own private fault it was no fault at all it was just the mode in which they were educated the style of their living and as we know le style cest lhomme  angus came of very wealthy iron people near merthyr already he had a very fair income of his own as soon as the lawbusiness concerning his fathers and his grandfathers will was settled he would be well off and he knew it and valued himself accordingly francis was the son of a highlyesteemed barrister and politician of sydney and in his day would inherit his fathers latelywon baronetcy but francis had not very much money and was much more classflexible than angus angus had been born in a house with a park and of awful hardwilled moneybound people francis came of a much more adventurous loose excitable family he had the colonial newness and adaptability he knew for his own part that class superiority was just a trick nowadays still it was a trick that paid and a trick he was going to play as long as it did pay  while aaron sat a little pale at the gills immobile ruminating these matters a not very pleasant look about his noseend he heard a voice  oh there you are i thought id better come and see so that we can fetch you at lunch timeyouve got a seat are you quite comfortable is there anything i could get you why youre in a nonsmokerbut that doesnt matter everybody will smoke are you sure you have everything oh but wait just one moment  it was francis long and elegant with his straight shoulders and his coat buttoned to show his waist and his face so wellformed and so modern so modern altogether his voice was pleasantly modulated and never hurried he now looked as if a thought had struck him he put a finger to his brow and hastened back to his own carriage in a minute he returned with a new london literary magazine  something to readi shall have to flysee you at lunch and he had turned and elegantly hastened but not too fast back to his carriage the porter was holding the door for him so francis looked pleasantly hurried but by no means rushed oh dear no he took his time it was not for him to bolt and scramble like a mere italian  the people in aarons carriage had watched the apparition of the elegant youth intently for them he was a being from another sphereno doubt a young milordo with power wealth and glamorous life behind him which was just what francis intended to convey so handsomeso very very impressive in all his elegant calm showiness he made such a bella figura it was just what the italians loved those in the first class regions thought he might even be an italian he was so attractive  the train in motion the many italian eyes in the carriage studied aaron he too was goodlooking but by no means as fascinating as the young milordo not half as sympathetic no good at all at playing a role probably a servant of the young signori  aaron stared out of the window and played the one single british role left to him that of ignoring his neighbours isolating himself in their midst and minding his own business upon this insular trick our greatness and our predominance dependssuch as it is yes they might look at him they might think him a servant or what they liked but he was inaccessible to them he isolated himself upon himself and there remained  it was a lovely day a lovely lovely day of early autumn over the great plain of lombardy a magnificent blue sky glowed like midsummer the sun shone strong the great plain with its great stripes of cultivationwithout hedges or boundarieshow beautiful it was sometimes he saw oxen ploughing sometimes oh so beautiful teams of eight or ten even of twelve pale great soft oxen in procession ploughing the dark velvety earth a driver with a great whip at their head a man far behind holding the ploughshafts beautiful the soft soft plunging motion of oxen moving forwards beautiful the strange snaky lifting of the muzzles the swaying of the sharp horns and the soft soft crawling motion of a team of oxen so invisible almost yet so inevitable now and again straight canals of water flashed blue now and again the great lines of greysilvery poplars rose and made avenues or lovely grey airy quadrangles across the plain their top boughs were spangled with gold and green leaf sometimes the vineleaves were gold and red a patterning and the great square farmhomesteads white redroofed with their outbuildings stood naked amid the lands without screen or softening there was something big and exposed about it all no more the cosy english ambushed life no longer the cosy littleness of the landscape a bignessand nothing to shelter the unshrinking spirit it was all exposed exposed to the sweep of plain to the high strong sky and to human gaze a kind of boldness an indifference aaron was impressed and fascinated he looked with new interest at the italians in the carriage with himfor this same boldness and indifference and exposed gesture and he found it in them too and again it fascinated him it seemed so much bigger as if the walls of life had fallen nay the walls of english life will have to fall  sitting there in the thirdclass carriage he became happy again the presence of his fellowpassengers was not so hampering as in england in england everybody seems held tight and gripped nothing is left free every passenger seems like a parcel holding his string as fast as he can about him lest one corner of the wrapper should come undone and reveal what is inside and every other passenger is forced by the public will to hold himself as tightbound also which in the end becomes a sort of selfconscious madness  but here in the third class carriage there was no tight string round every man they were not all trussed with selfconscious string as tight as capons they had a sufficient amount of callousness and indifference and natural equanimity true one of them spat continually on the floor in large spits and another sat with his boots all unlaced and his collar off and various important buttons undone they did not seem to care if bits of themselves did show through the gaps in the wrapping aaron wincedbut he preferred it to english tightness he was pleased he was happy with the italians he thought how generous and natural they were  so the towns passed by and the hours and he seemed at last to have got outside himself and his old conditions it seemed like a great escape there was magic again in lifereal magic was it illusion or was it genuine he thought it was genuine and opened his soul a if there was no danger  lunchtime came francis summoned aaron down the rocking tram the three men had a table to themselves and all felt they were enjoying themselves very much indeed of course francis and angus made a great impression again but in the dining car were mostly middleclass welltodo italians and these did not look upon our two young heroes as two young wonders no rather with some criticism and some classenvy but they were impressed oh they were impressed how should they not be when our young gentlemen had such an air aaron was conscious all the time that the fellowdiners were being properly impressed by the flower of civilisation and the salt of the earth namely young welltodo englishmen and he had a faint premonition based on experience perhaps that fellowpassengers in the end never forgive the man who has impressed them mankind loves being impressed it asks to be impressed it almost forces those whom it can force to play a role and to make an impression and afterwards never forgives  when the train ran into bologna station they were still in the restaurant car nor did they go at once to their seats angus had paid the bill there was threequartersofanhours wait in bologna  you may as well come down and sit with us said francis weve got nobody in our carriage so why shouldnt we all stay together during the wait you kept your own seat i suppose  no he had forgotten so when he went to look for it it was occupied by a stout man who was just taking off his collar and wrapping a white kerchief round his neck the third class carriages were packed for those were early days after the war while men still had prewar notions and were poor ten months would steal imperceptibly by and the mysterious revolution would be effected then the second class and the first class would be packed indescribably packed crowded on all great trains and the third class carriages lo and behold would be comparatively empty oh marvellous days of bankruptcy when nobody will condescend to travel third  however these were still modest sombre months immediately after the peace so a large man with a fat neck and a white kerchief and his collar over his knee sat in aarons seat aaron looked at the man and at his own luggage overhead the fat man saw him looking and stared back then stared also at the luggage overhead and with his almost invisible northitalian gesture said much plainer than words would have said it go to hell im here and im going to stop here  there was something insolent and unbearable about the lookand about the rocky fixity of the large man he sat as if he had insolently taken root in his seat aaron flushed slightly francis and angus strolled along the train outside for the corridor was already blocked with the mad bologna rush and the baggage belonging they joined aaron as he stood on the platform  but where is your seat cried francis peering into the packed and jammed compartments of the third class  that mans sitting in it  which cried francis indignant  the fat one therewith the collar on his knee  but it was your seat  francis gorge rose in indignation he mounted into the corridor and in the doorway of the compartment he bridled like an angry horse rearing bridling his head poising himself on one hip he stared fixedly at the man with the collar on his knee then at the baggage aloft he looked down at the fat man as a bird looks down from the eaves of a house but the man looked back with a solid rocklike impudence before which an englishman quails a jeering immovable insolence with a sneer round the nose and a solidseated posterior  but said francis in englishnone of them had any italian yet but said francis turning round to aaron that was your seat and he flung his long forefinger in the direction of the fat mans thighs  yes said aaron  and hes taken it cried francis in indignation  and knows it too said aaron  but and francis looked round imperiously as if to summon his bodyguard but bodyguards are no longer forthcoming and trainguards are far from satisfactory the fat man sat on with a sneergrin very faint but very effective round his nose and a solidlyplanted posterior he quite enjoyed the pantomime of the young foreigners the other passengers said something to him and he answered laconic then they all had the faint sneergrin round their noses a woman in the corner grinned jeeringly straight in francis face his charm failed entirely this time and as for his commandingness that was ineffectual indeed rage came up in him  oh wellsomething must be done said he decisively but didnt you put something in the seat to reserve it  only that new statesmanbut hes moved it  the man still sat with the invisible sneergrin on his face and that peculiar and immovable plant of his italian posterior  maiscette place etait reservee said francis moving to the direct attack  the man turned aside and ignored him utterlythen said something to the men opposite and they all began to show their teeth in a grin  francis was not so easily foiled he touched the man on the arm the man looked round threateningly as if he had been struck  cette place est reserveepar ce monsieur said francis with hauteur though still in an explanatory tone and pointing to aaron  the italian looked him not in the eyes but between the eyes and sneered full in his face then he looked with contempt at aaron and then he said in italian that there was room for such snobs in the first class and that they had not any right to come occupying the place of honest men in the third  gia gia barked the other passengers in the carriage  loro possono andare prima classaprima classa said the woman in the corner in a very high voice as if talking to deaf people and pointing to aarons luggage then along the train to the first class carriages  ce posto la said one of the men shrugging his shoulders  there was a jeering quality in the hard insolence which made francis go very red and augus very white angus stared like a deathshead behind his monocle with deathblue eyes  oh never mind come along to the first class ill pay the difference we shall be much better all together get the luggage down francis it wouldnt be possible to travel with this lot even if he gave up the seat theres plenty of room in our carriageand ill pay the extra said angus  he knew there was one solutionand only onemoney  but francis bit his finger he felt almost beside himselfand quite powerless for he knew the guard of the train would jeer too it is not so easy to interfere with honest thirdclass bolognesi in bologna station even if they have taken another mans seat powerless his brow knitted and looking just like mephistopheles with his high forehead and slightly arched nose mephistopheles in a rage he hauled down aarons bag and handed it to angus so they transferred themselves to the firstclass carriage while the fat man and his party in the thirdclass watched in jeering triumphant silence solid planted immovable in static triumph  so aaron sat with the others amid the red plush whilst the train began its long slow climb of the apennines stinking sulphurous through tunnels innumerable wonderful the steep slopes the great chestnut woods and then the great distances glimpsed between the heights firenzuola away and beneath turneresque hills far off built of heavenbloom not of earth it was cold at the summitstation ice and snow in the air fierce our travellers shrank into the carriage again and wrapped themselves round  then the train began its long slither downhill still through a whole necklace of tunnels which fortunately no longer stank so down and down till the plain appears in sight once more the arno valley but then began the inevitable hitch that always happens in italian travel the train began to hesitateto falter to a halt whistling shrilly as if in protest whistling pippippip in expostulation as it stood forlorn among the fields then stealing forward again and stealthily making pace gathering speed till it had got up a regular spurt then suddenly the brakes came on with a jerk more faltering to a halt more whistling and pippippipping as the engine stood jingling with impatience after which another creak and splash and another choking off so on till they landed in prato station and there they sat a fellow passenger told them there was an hour to wait here an hour something had happened up the line  then i propose we make tea said angus beaming  why not of course let us make tea and i will look for water  so aaron and francis went to the restaurant bar and filled the little pan at the tap angus got down the red picnic case of which he was so fond and spread out the various arrangements on the floor of the coupe he soon had the spiritlamp burning the water heating francis proposed that he and aaron should dash into prato and see what could be bought whilst the tea was in preparation so off they went leaving angus like a busy old wizard manipulating his arrangements on the floor of the carriage his monocle beaming with bliss the one fat fellowpassenger with a lurid striped rug over his knees watched with acute interest everybody who passed the doorway stood to contemplate the scene with pleasure officials came and studied the situation with appreciation then francis and aaron returned with a large supply of roast chestnuts piping hot and hard dried plums and good dried figs and rather stale rusks they found the water just boiling angus just throwing in the teaegg and the fellowpassenger just poking his nose right in he was so thrilled  nothing pleased angus so much as thus pitching camp in the midst of civilisation the scrubby newspaper packets of chestnuts plums figs and rusks were spread out francis flew for salt to the man at the bar and came back with a little paper of rocksalt the brown tea was dispensed in the silverfitted glasses from the immortal luncheoncase and the picnic was in full swing angus being in the height of his happiness now sat on the seat crosslegged with his feet under him in the authentic buddha fashion and on his face the queer rapt alert look half a smile also somewhat buddhistic holding his glass of brown tea in his hand he was as rapt and immobile as if he really were in a mystic state yet it was only his delight in the teaparty the fellowpassenger peered at the tea and said in broken french was it good in equally fragmentary french francis said very good and offered the fat passenger some he however held up his hand in protest as if to say not for any money would he swallow the hotwatery stuff and he pulled out a flask of wine but a handful of chestnuts he accepted  the trainconductor ticketcollector and the heavy green soldier who protected them swung open the door and stared attentively the fellow passenger addressed himself to these newcomers and they all began to smile goodnaturedly then the fellowpassengerhe was stout and fifty and had a brilliant striped rug always over his kneespointed out the buddhalike position of angus and the three instarers smiled again and so the fellowpassenger thought he must try too so he put aside his rug and lifted his feet from the floor and took his toes in his hands and tried to bring his legs up and his feet under him but his knees were fat his trousers in the direst extreme of peril and he could no more manage it than if he had tried to swallow himself so he desisted suddenly rather scared whilst the three bunched and official heads in the doorway laughed and jested at him showing their teeth and teasing him but on our gypsy party they turned their eyes with admiration they loved the novelty and the fun and on the thin elegant angus in his new london clothes they looked really puzzled as he sat there immobile gleaming through his monocle like some buddha going wicked perched crosslegged and ecstatic on the red velvet seat they marvelled that the lower half of him could so double up like a footrule so they stared till they had seen enough when they suddenly said buon appetito withdrew their heads and shoulders slammed the door and departed  then the train set off alsoand shortly after six arrived in florence it was debated what should aaron do in florence the young men had engaged a room at bertolinis hotel on the lungarno bertolinis was not expensivebut aaron knew that his friends would not long endure hotel life however he went along with the other two trusting to find a cheaper place on the morrow  it was growing quite dark as they drove to the hotel but still was light enough to show the river rustling the ponte vecchio spanning its little storeys across the flood on its low heavy piers and some sort of magic of the darkening varied houses facing on the other side of the stream of course they were all enchanted  i knew said francis we should love it  aaron was told he could have a little back room and pension terms for fifteen lire a day if he stayed at least fifteen days the exchange was then at fortyfive so fifteen lire meant just sixshillingsandsix pence a day without extras extras meant wine tea butter and light it was decided he should look for something cheaper next day  by the tone of the young men he now gathered that they would prefer it if he took himself off to a cheaper place they wished to be on their own  well then said francis you will be in to lunch here wont you then well see you at lunch  it was as if both the young men had drawn in their feelers now they were afraid of finding the new man an incubus they wanted to wash their hands of him aarons brow darkened                perhaps it was right your love to dissemble               but why did you kick me down stairs   then morning found him out early before his friends had arisen it was sunny again the magic of florence at once overcame him and he forgot the bore of limited means and hotel costs he went straight out of the hotel door across the road and leaned on the river parapet there ran the arno not such a flood after all but a green stream with shoals of pebbles in its course across and in the delicate shadow of the early sun stood the opposite lungarno the old flat houses pink or white or grey stone with their green shutters some closed some opened it had a flowery effect the skyline irregular against the morning light to the right the delicate trinita bridge to the left the old bridge with its little shops over the river beyond towards the sun glimpses of green skybloomed country tuscany  there was a noise and clatter of traffic boys pushing handbarrows over the cobblestones slow bullocks stepping side by side and shouldering one another affectionately drawing a load of country produce then horses in great brilliant scarlet cloths like vivid palls slowly pulling the long narrow carts of the district and men huhuingand people calling all the sharp clattering morning noise of florence  oh angus do come and look oh so lovely  glancing up he saw the elegant figure of francis in fine colouredsilk pyjamas perched on a small upper balcony turning away from the river towards the bedroom again his hand lifted to his lips as if to catch there his cry of delight the whole pose was classic and effective and very amusing how the italians would love it  aaron slipped back across the road and walked away under the houses towards the ponte vecchio he passed the bridgeand passed the uffiziwatching the green hills opposite and san miniato then he noticed the overdramatic group of statuary in the piazza mentanamale and physical and melodramaticand then the corner house it was a big old florentine house with many green shutters and wide eaves there was a notice plate by the doorpension nardini  he came to a full stop he stared at the noticeplate stared at the glass door and turning round stared at the overpathetic dead soldier on the arm of his overheroic pistolfiring comrade mentanaand the date aaron wondered what and where mentana was then at last he summoned his energy opened the glass door and mounted the first stairs  he waited some time before anybody appeared then a maidservant  can i have a room said aaron  the bewildered wildeyed servant maid opened a door and showed him into a heavilygilt heavilyplush drawingroom with a great deal of frantic grandeur about it there he sat and cooled his heels for half an hour arrived at length a stout young ladyhandsome with big darkblue italian eyesbut anaemic and too stout  oh she said as she entered not knowing what else to say  goodmorning said aaron awkwardly  oh goodmorning english yes oh i am so sorry to keep you you know to make you wait so long i was upstairs you know with a lady will you sit  can i have a room said aaron  a room yes you can  what terms  terms oh why ten francs a day you know pensionif you stayhow long will you stay  at least a month i expect  a month oh yes yes ten francs a day  for everything  everything yes everything coffee bread honey or jam in the morning lunch at halfpast twelve tea in the drawingroom halfpast four dinner at halfpast seven all very nice and a warm room with the sunwould you like to see  so aaron was led up the big rambling old house to the top floorthen along a long old corridorand at last into a big bedroom with two beds and a red tiled floora little dreary as everbut the sun just beginning to come in and a lovely view on to the river towards the ponte vecchio and at the hills with their pines and villas and verdure opposite  here he would settle the signorina would send a man for his bags at half past two in the afternoon  at luncheon aaron found the two friends and told them of his move  how very nice for you ten francs a daybut that is nothing i am so pleased youve found something and when will you be moving in said francis  at halfpast two  oh so soon yes just as wellbut we shall see you from time to time of course what did you say the address was oh yesjust near the awful statue very well we can look you up any timeand you will find us here leave a message if we should happen not to be inweve got lots of engagements     chapter xvi florence   the very afternoon after aarons arrival in florence the sky became dark the wind cold and rain began steadily to fall he sat in his big bleak room above the river and watched the pale green water fused with yellow the manythreaded streams fuse into one as swiftly the surface flood came down from the hills across the dark green hills looked darker in the wet the umbrella pines held up in vain above the villas but away below on the lungarno traffic rattled as ever  aaron went down at five oclock to tea and found himself alone next a group of women mostly swedes or danish or dutch drinking a peculiar brown herbbrew which tasted like nothing else on earth and eating two thick bits of darkish bread smeared with a brown smear which hoped it was jam but hoped in vain unhappily he sat in the gilt and red massively ornate room while the foreign women eyed him oh bitter to be a male under such circumstances  he escaped as soon as possible back to his faroff regions lonely and cheerless away above but he rather liked the faroff remoteness in the big old florentine house he did not mind the peculiar dark uncosy dreariness it was not really dreary only indifferent indifferent to comfort indifferent to all homeliness and cosiness the overbig furniture trying to be impressive but never to be pretty or bright or cheerful there it stood ugly and apart and there let it standneither did he mind the lack of fire the cold sombreness of his big bedroom at home in england the bright grate and the ruddy fire the thick hearthrug and the mans armchair these had been inevitable and now he was glad to get away from it all he was glad not to have a cosy hearth and his own armchair he was glad to feel the cold and to breathe the unwarmed air he preferred the italian way of no fires no heating if the day was cold he was willing to be cold too if it was dark he was willing to be dark the cosy brightness of a real homeit had stifled him till he felt his lungs would burst the horrors of real domesticity no the italian brutal way was better  so he put his overcoat over his knee and studied some music he had bought in milan some pergolesi and the scarlatti he liked and some corelli he preferred frail sensitive abstract music with not much feeling in it but a certain limpidity and purity night fell as he sat reading the scores he would have liked to try certain pieces on his flute but his flute was too sensitive it winced from the new strange surroundings and would not blossom  dinner sounded at lastat eight oclock or something after he had to learn to expect the meals always forty minutes late down he went down the long dark lonely corridors and staircases the dining room was right downstairs but he had a little table to himself near the door the elderly women were at some little distance the only other men were agostmo the unshapely waiter and an italian duke with wife and child and nurse the family sitting all together at a table halfway down the room and utterly preoccupied with a little yellow dog  however the food was good enough and sufficient and the waiter and the maidservant cheerful and bustling everything felt happygolucky and informal there was no particular atmosphere nobody put on any airs because nobody in the nardini took any notice if they did the little ducal dog yapped the ducal son shouted the waiter dropped half a dozen spoons the old women knitted during the waits and all went off so badly that it was quite pleasant yes aaron preferred it to bertolinis which was trying to be efficient and correct though not making any strenuous effort still bertolinis was much more up to the scratch there was the tension of proper standards whereas here at nardinis nothing mattered very much  it was november when he got up to his faroff room again aaron felt almost as if he were in a castle with the drawbridge drawn up through the open window came the sound of the swelling arno as it rushed and rustled along over its gravelshoals lights spangled the opposite side traffic sounded deep below the room was not really cold for the summer sun so soaks into these thick old buildings that it takes a month or two of winter to soak it outthe rain still fell  in the morning it was still november and the dawn came slowly and through the open window was the sound of the rivers rushing but the traffic started before dawn with a bang and a rattle of carts and a bang and jingle of tramcars over the notdistant bridge oh noisy florence at halfpast seven aaron rang for his coffee and got it at a few minutes past eight the signorina had told him to take his coffee in bed  rain was still falling but towards nine oclock it lifted and he decided to go out a wet wet world carriages going by with huge wet shiny umbrellas black and with many points erected to cover the driver and the tail of the horse and the boxseat the hood of the carriage covered the fare clatterclatter through the rain peasants with long wagons and slow oxen and palegreen huge umbrellas erected for the driver to walk beneath men tripping along in cloaks shawls umbrellas anything quite unconcerned a man loading gravel in the riverbed in spite of the wet and innumerable bells ringing but innumerable bells the great soft trembling of the cathedral bell felt in all the air  anyhow it was a new world aaron went along close to the tall thick houses following his nose and suddenly he caught sight of the long slim neck of the palazzo vecchio up above in the air and in another minute he was passing between massive buildings out into the piazza della signoria there he stood still and looked round him in real surprise and real joy the flat empty square with its stone paving was all wet the great buildings rose dark the dark sheer front of the palazzo vecchio went up like a cliff to the battlements and the slim tower soared dark and hawklike crested high above and at the foot of the cliff stood the great naked david white and stripped in the wet white against the dark warmdark cliff of the buildingand near the heavy naked men of bandinelli  the first thing he had seen as he turned into the square was the back of one of these bandinelli statues a great naked man of marble with a heavy back and strong naked flanks over which the water was trickling and then to come immediately upon the david so much whiter glistening skinwhite in the wet standing a little forward and shrinking  he may be ugly too naturalistic too big and anything else you like but the david in the piazza della signoria there under the dark great palace in the position michelangelo chose for him there standing forward stripped and exposed and eternally halfshrinking halfwishing to expose himself he is the genius of florence the adolescent the white selfconscious physical adolescent enormous in keeping with the stark grim enormous palace which is dark and bare as he is white and bare and behind the big lumpy bandinelli men are in keeping too they may be uglybut they are there in their place and they have their own lumpy reality and this morning in the rain standing unbroken with the water trickling down their flanks and along the inner side of their great thighs they were real enough representing the undaunted physical nature of the heavier florentines  aaron looked and looked at the three great naked men david so much white and standing forward selfconscious then at the great splendid front of the palazzo vecchio and at the fountain splashing water upon its wet wet figures and the distant equestrian statue and the stoneflagged space of the grim square and he felt that here he was in one of the worlds living centres here in the piazza della signoria the sense of having arrivedof having reached a perfect centre of the human world this he had  and so satisfied he turned round to look at the bronze perseus which rose just above him benvenuto cellinis dark hero looked female with his plump hips and his waist female and rather insignificant graceful and rather vulgar the clownish bandinellis were somehow more to the pointthen all the statuary in the loggia but that is a mistake it looks too much like the yard of a monumental mason  the great naked men in the rain under the darkgrey november sky in the dark strong inviolable square the wonderful hawkhead of the old palace the physical selfconscious adolescent michelangelos david shrinking and exposing himself with his white slack limbs florence passionate fearless florence had spoken herself outaaron was fascinated by the piazza della signoria he never went into the town nor returned from it to his lodging without contriving to pass through the square and he never passed through it without satisfaction here men had been at their intensest most naked pitch here at the end of the old world and the beginning of the new since then always rather puling and apologetic  aaron felt a new self a new lifeurge rising inside himself florence seemed to start a new man in him it was a town of men on friday morning so early he heard the traffic early he watched the rather low twowheeled traps of the peasants spanking recklessly over the bridge coming in to town and then when he went out he found the piazza della signoria packed with men but all all men and all farmers landowners and landworkers the curious finenosed tuscan farmers with their halfsardonic ambercoloured eyes their curious individuality their clothes worn so easy and reckless their hats with the personal twist their curious full oval cheeks their tendency to be too fat to have a belly and heavy limbs their closesitting dark hair and above all their sharp almost acrid mocking expression the silent curl of the nose the eternal challenge the rockbottom unbelief and the subtle fearlessness the dangerous subtle neverdying fearlessness and the acrid unbelief but men men a town of men in spite of everything the one manly quality undying acrid fearlessness the eternal challenge of the unquenched human soul perhaps too acrid and challenging today when there is nothing left to challenge but menwho existed without apology and without justification men who would neither justify themselves nor apologize for themselves just men the rarest thing left in our sweet christendom  altogether aaron was pleased with himself for being in florence those were early days after the war when as yet very few foreigners had returned and the place had the native sombreness and intensity so that our friend did not mind being alone  the third day however francis called on him there was a tap at the bedroom door and the young man entered all eyes of curiosity  oh there you are he cried flinging his hand and twisting his waist and then laying his hand on his breast such a long way up to you but miles well how are you are you quite all right here you are im so gladweve been so rushed seeing people that we havent had a minute but not a minute people people people isnt it amazing how many there are and how many one knows and gets to know but amazing endless acquaintancesoh and such quaint people here so odd so more than odd oh extraordinary francis chuckled to himself over the extraordinariness then he seated himself gracefully at aarons table oh music what corelli so interesting so very clever these people werent theycorelli and the younger scarlatti and all that crowd here he closed the score again but nowlook do you want to know anybody here or dont you ive told them about you and of course theyre dying to meet you and hear you play but i thought it best not to mention anything aboutabout your being hardup and all that i said you were just here on a visit you see with this kind of people im sure its much the best not to let them start off by thinking you will need them at allor that you might need them why give yourself away anyhow just meet them and take them for what theyre worthand then you can see if they like to give you an engagement to play at some show or otherwell you can decide when the time comes whether you will accept much better that these kind of people shouldnt get it into their heads at once that they can hire your services it doesnt do they havent enough discrimination for that much best make rather a favour of it than sort of ask them to hire youdont you agree perhaps im wrong  aaron sat and listened and wondered at the wisdom and the genuine kindness of the young beau and more still he wondered at the profound social disillusionment this handsome collie dog was something of a social wolf half showing his fangs at the moment but with genuine kindheartedness for another wolf aaron was touched  yes i think thats the best way he said  you do yes so do i oh they are such queer people why is it do you think that english people abroad go so very queerso ultraenglishincredibleand at the same time so perfectly impossible but impossible pathological i assure youand as for their sexual behaviouroh dear dont mention it i assure you it doesnt bear mentionand all quite flagrant quite unabashedunder the cover of this fanatical englishness but i couldnt begin to tell you all the things its just incredible  aaron wondered how on earth francis had been able to discover and bear witness to so much that was incredible in a bare two days but a little gossip and an addition of lurid imagination will carry you anywhere  well now said francis what are you doing today  aaron was not doing anything in particular  then will you come and have dinner with us  francis fixed up the time and the placea small restaurant at the other end of the town then he leaned out of the window  fascinating place oh fascinating place he said soliloquy and youve got a superb view almost better than ours i thinkwell then halfpast seven were meeting a few other people mostly residents or people staying some time were not inviting them just dropping in you knowa little restaurant we shall see you then well then a rivederci till this eveningso glad you like florence im simply loving itrevelling and the picturesoh  the party that evening consisted all of men francis and angus and a writer james argyle and little algy constable and tiny louis mee and deaf walter rosen they all snapped and rattled at one another and were rather spiteful but rather amusing francis and angus had to leave early they had another appointment and james argyle got quite tipsy and said to aaron  but my boy dont let yourself be led astray by the talk of such people as algy beware of them my boy if youve a soul to save if youve a soul to save and he swallowed the remains of his litre  algys nose trembled a little and his eyes blinked and if youve a soul to lose he said i would warn you very earnestly against argyle whereupon algy shut one eye and opened the other so wide that aaron was almost scared quite right my boy ha ha never a truer thing said hahaha argyle laughed his mephistophelian tipsy laugh theyll teach you to save never was such a lot of ripe old savers save their old trouserbuttons go to them if you want to learn to save oh yes i advise it seriously youll lose nothingnot even a reputationyou may lose a soul of course but thats a detail among such a hoard of banknotes and trouserbuttons haha whats a soul to them  what is it to you is perhaps the more pertinent question said algy flapping his eyelids like some crazy owl it is you who specialise in the matter of soul and we who are in need of enlightenment  yes very true you are you are in need of enlightenment a set of benighted wise virgins hahaha thats good thatbenighted wise virgins what argyle put his red face near to aarons and made a moue narrowing his eyes quizzically as he peered up from under his level grey eyebrows sit in the dark to save the lampoiland all no good to themwhen the bridegroom cometh haha good that good my boythe bridegroom he giggled to himself what about the bridegroom algy my boy eh what about him better trim your wick old man if its not too late  we were talking of souls not wicks argyle said algy  same thing upon my soul it all amounts to the same thing wheres the soul in a man that hasnt got a bedfellowehanswer me that cant be done you know might as well ask a virgin chicken to lay you an egg  then there ought to be a good deal of it about said algy  of what of soul there ought to be a good deal of soul aboutah because theres a good deal of you meanah i wish it were so i wish it were so but believe me theres far more damned chastity in the world than anything else even in this towncall it chastity if you like i see nothing in it but sterility it takes a rat to praise long tails impotence set up the praise of chastitybelieve me or notbut thats the bottom of it the virtue is made out of the necessityhahahalike them like them haha saving their souls why theyd save the waste matter of their bodies if they could grieves them to part with itha haha  there was a pause argyle was in his cups which left no more to be said algy quivering and angry looked disconcertingly round the room as if he were quite calm and collected the deaf jewish rosen was smiling down his nose and saying what was that last i didnt catch that last cupping his ear with his hand in the frantic hope that someone would answer no one paid any heed  i shall be going said algy looking round then to aaron he said you play the flute i hear may we hear you some time  yes said aaron noncommittal  well look herecome to tea tomorrow i shall have some friends and del torre will play the piano come to tea tomorrow will you  thank you i will  and perhaps youll bring your flute along  dont you do any such thing my boy make them entertain you for oncetheyre always squeezing an entertainment out of somebody and argyle desperately emptied the remains of algys wine into his own glass whilst algy stood as if listening to something far off and blinking terribly  anyhow he said at length youll come wont you and bring the flute if you feel like it  dont you take that flute my boy persisted argyle dont think of such a thing if they want a concert let them buy their tickets and go to the teatro diana or to marchesa del torres saturday morning she can afford to treat them algy looked at argyle and blinked well he said i hope youll get home all right argyle  thank you for your courtesy algy wont you lend me your arm  as algy was small and frail somewhat shaky and as argyle was a finely built heavy man of fifty or more the slap was unkind  afraid i cant tonight goodnight  algy departed so did little mee who had sat with a little delighted disapproval on his tiny birdlike face without saying anything and even the jew rosen put away his deafmachine and began awkwardly to take his leave his long nose was smiling to itself complacently at all the things argyle had been saying  when he too had gone argyle arched his brows at aaron saying  oh my dear fellow what a lot they arelittle meelooking like an innocent little boy hes over seventy if hes a day well over seventy well you dont believe me ask his motherask his mother shes ninetyfive old lady of ninetyfive argyle even laughed himself at his own preposterousness  and then algyalgys not a fool you know oh he can be most entertaining most witty and amusing but hes out of place here he should be in kensington dandling round the ladies drawing rooms and making his mots theyre rich you know the pair of them little mee used to boast that he lived on elevenandthreepence a week had to poor chap but then what does a white mouse like that need makes a heavy meal on a cheeseparing luck you knowbut of course hes come into money as well rich as croesus and still lives on nineteenandtwopence a week though its nearly double of course what it used to be no wonder he looks anxious they disapprove of meoh quite right quite right from their own point of view where would their money be otherwise it wouldnt last long if i laid hands on it he made a devilish quizzing face but you know they get on my nerves little old maids you know little old maids im sure im surprised at their patience with mebut when people are patient with you you want to spit gall at them dont you hahaha poor old algydid i lay it on him tonight or did i miss him  i think you got him said aaron  hell never forgive me depend on it hell never forgive me haha i like to be unforgiven it adds zest to ones intercourse with people to know that theyll never forgive one hahaha little old maids who do their knitting with their tongues poor old algyhe drops his stitches now hahahamust be eighty i should say  aaron laughed he had never met a man like argyle beforeand he could not help being charmed the other man had a certain wicked whimsicality that was very attractive when levelled against someone else and not against oneself he must have been very handsome in his day with his natural dignity and his cleanshaven strong square face but now his face was all red and softened and inflamed his eyes had gone small and wicked under his bushy grey brows still he had a presence and his grey hair almost gone white was still handsome  and what are you going to do in florence asked argyle  aaron explained  well said argyle make what you can out of them and then go go before they have time to do the dirty on you if they think you want anything from them theyll treat you like a dog like a dog oh theyre very frightened of anybody who wants anything of them frightened to death i see nothing of themlive by myselfsee nobody cant stand it you know their silly little teapartiessimply cant stand it no i live aloneand shall die aloneat least i sincerely hope so i should be sorry to have any of them hanging round  the restaurant was empty the pale malarial waiterhe had of course contracted malaria during the warwas looking purple round the eyes but argyle callously sat on aaron therefore rose to his feet  oh im coming im coming said argyle  he got unsteadily to his feet the waiter helped him on with his coat and he put a disreputablelooking little curly hat on his head then he took his stick  dont look at my appearance my dear fellow said argyle i am frayed at the wristslook here he showed the cuffs of his overcoat just frayed through ive got a trunkful of clothes in london if only somebody would bring it out to meready then avanti  and so they passed out into the still rainy street argyle lived in the very centre of the town in the cathedral square aaron left him at his hotel door  but come and see me said argyle call for me at twelve oclockor just before twelveand let us have luncheon together what is that all rightyes come just before twelvewhentomorrow tomorrow morning will you come tomorrow  aaron said he would on monday  monday eh you say monday very well then dont you forget now dont you forget for ive a memory like a vice i shant forgetjust before twelve then and come right up im right under the roof in paradise as the porter always says siamo nel paradiso but hes a cretin as near paradise as i care for for its devilish hot in summer and damned cold in winter dont you forget nowmonday twelve oclock  and argyle pinched aarons arm fast then went unsteadily up the steps to his hotel door  the next day at algys there was a crowd algy had a very pleasant flat indeed kept more scrupulously neat and finicking than ever any womans flat was kept so today with its bowls of flowers and its pictures and books and old furniture and algy very nicely dressed fluttering and blinking and making really a charming host it was all very delightful to the little mob of visitors they were a curious lot it is true everybody rather exceptional which though it may be startling is so very much better fun than everybody all alike aaron talked to an old old italian elegant in sidecurls who peeled off his grey gloves and studied his formalities with a delightful midvictorian dash and told stories about a plaint which lady surry had against lord marsh and was quite incomprehensible out rolled the english words like plums out of a burst bag and all completely unintelligible but the old beau was supremely satisfied he loved talking english and holding his listeners spellbound  next to aaron on the sofa sat the marchesa del torre an american woman from the southern states who had lived most of her life in europe she was about forty years of age handsome welldressed and quiet in the buzz of the teaparty it was evident she was one of algys lionesses now she sat by aaron eating nothing but taking a cup of tea and keeping still she seemed sador not well perhaps her eyes were heavy but she was very carefully made up and very well dressed though simply and sitting there fullbosomed rather sad remoteseeming she suggested to aaron a modern cleopatra brooding anthonyless  her husband the marchese was a little intense italian in a colonels grey uniform cavalry leather gaiters he had blue eyes his hair was cut very short his head looked hard and rather military he would have been taken for an austrian officer or even a german had it not been for the peculiar italian sprightliness and touch of grimace in his mobile countenance he was rather like a gnomenot ugly but odd  now he came and stood opposite to signor di lanti and quizzed him in italian but it was evident in quizzing the old buck the little marchese was hovering near his wife in earshot algy came up with cigarettes and she at once began to smoke with that peculiar heavy intensity of a nervous woman  aaron did not say anythingdid not know what to say he was peculiarly conscious of the woman sitting next to him her arm near his she smoked heavily in silence as if abstracted a sort of cloud on her level dark brows her hair was dark but a softish brown not black and her skin was fair her bosom would be whitewhy aaron should have had this thought he could not for the life of him say  manfredi her husband rolled his blue eyes and grimaced as he laughed at old lanti but it was obvious that his attention was diverted sideways towards his wife aaron who was tired of nursing a teacup placed in on a table and resumed his seat in silence but suddenly the little marchese whipped out his cigarettecase and making a little bow presented it to aaron saying  wont you smoke  thank you said aaron  turkish that sidevirginia thereyou see  thank you turkish said aaron  the little officer in his dovegrey and yellow uniform snapped his box shut again and presented a light  you are new in florence he said as he presented the match  four days said aaron  and i hear you are musical  i play the fluteno more  ah yesbut then you play it as an artist not as an accomplishment  but how do you know laughed aaron  i was told soand i believe it  thats nice of you anyhowbut you are a musician too  yeswe are both musiciansmy wife and i  manfredi looked at his wife she flicked the ash off her cigarette  what sort said aaron  why how do you mean what sort we are dilettanti i suppose  nowhat is your instrument the piano  yesthe pianoforte and my wife sings but we are very much out of practice i have been at the war four years and we have had our home in paris my wife was in paris she did not wish to stay in italy alone and soyou seeeverything goes  but you will begin again  yes we have begun already we have music on saturday mornings next saturday a string quartette and violin solos by a young florentine womana friendvery good indeed daughter of our professor tortoli who composesas you may know  yes said aaron  would you care to come and hear  awfully nice if you would suddenly said the wife quite simply as if she had merely been tired and not talking before  i should like to very much  do come then  while they were making the arrangements algy came up in his blandest manner  now marchesamight we hope for a song  noi dont sing any more came the slow contralto reply  oh but you cant mean you say that deliberately  yes quite deliberately she threw away her cigarette and opened her little gold case to take another  but what can have brought you to such a disastrous decision  i cant say she replied with a little laugh the war probably  oh but dont let the war deprive us of this as of everything else  cant be helped she said i have no choice in the matter the bird has flown she spoke with a certain heavy languor  you mean the bird of your voice oh but that is quite impossible one can hear it calling out of the leaves every time you speak  im afraid you cant get him to do any more than call out of the leaves  butbutpardon meis it because you dont intend there should be any more song is that your intention  that i couldnt say said the marchesa smoking smoking  yes said manfredi at the present time it is because she will notnot because she cannot it is her will as you say  dear me dear me said algy but this is really another disaster added to the war listbutbutwill none of us ever be able to persuade you he smiled half cajoling half pathetic with a prodigious flapping of his eyes  i dont know said she that will be as it must be  then cant we say it must be song once more  to this sally she merely laughed and pressed out her halfsmoked cigarette  how very disappointing how very cruel ofof fateand the warandand all the sum total of evils said algy  perhaps here the little and piquant host turned to aaron  perhaps mr sisson your flute might call out the bird of song as thrushes call each other into challenge you know dont you think that is very probable  i have no idea said aaron  but you marchesa wont you give us hope that it might be so  ive no idea either said she but i should very much like to hear mr sissons flute its an instrument i like extremely  there now you see you may work the miracle mr sisson wont you play to us  im afraid i didnt bring my flute along said aaron i didnt want to arrive with a little bag  quite said algy what a pity it wouldnt go in your pocket  not music and all said aaron  dear me what a comble of disappointment i never felt so strongly marchesa that the old life and the old world had collapsedreallyi shall soon have to try to give up being cheerful at all  dont do that said the marchesa it isnt worth the effort  ah im glad you find it so then i have hope  she merely smiled indifferent  the teaparty began to break upaaron found himself going down the stairs with the marchesa and her husband they descended all three in silence husband and wife in front once outside the door the husband asked  how shall we go home dear tram or carriage it was evident he was economical  walk she said glancing over her shoulder at aaron we are all going the same way i believe  aaron said where he lived they were just across the river and so all three proceeded to walk through the town  you are sure it wont be too much for youtoo far said the little officer taking his wifes arm solicitously she was taller than he but he was a spirited fellow  no i feel like walking  so long as you dont have to pay for it afterwards  aaron gathered that she was not well yet she did not look illunless it were nerves she had that peculiar heavy remote quality of preoccupation and neurosis  the streets of florence were very full this sunday evening almost impassable crowded particularly with gangs of greygreen soldiers the three made their way brokenly and with difficulty the italian was in a constant state of returning salutes the greygreen sturdy unsoldierly soldiers looked at the woman as she passed  i am sure you had better take a carriage said manfredi  noi dont mind it  do you feel at home in florence aaron asked her  yesas much as anywhere oh yesquite at home  do you like it as well as anywhere he asked  yesfor a time paris for the most part  never america  no never america i came when i was quite a little girl to europemadridconstantinopleparis i hardly knew america at all  aaron remembered that francis had told him the marchesas father had been ambassador to paris  so you feel you have no country of your own  i have italy i am italian now you know  aaron wondered why she spoke so muted so numbed manfredi seemed really attached to herand she to him they were so simple with one another  they came towards the bridge where they should part  wont you come and have a cocktail she said  now said aaron  yes this is the right time for a cocktail what time is it manfredi  half past six do come and have one with us said the italian we always take one about this time  aaron continued with them over the bridge they had the first floor of an old palazzo opposite a little way up the hill a manservant opened the door  if only it will be warm she said the apartment is almost impossible to keep warm we will sit in the little room  aaron found himself in a quite warm room with shaded lights and a mixture of old italian stiffness and deep soft modern comfort the marchesa went away to take off her wraps and the marchese chatted with aaron the little officer was amiable and kind and it was evident he liked his guest  would you like to see the room where we have music he said it is a fine room for the purposewe used before the war to have music every saturday morning from ten to twelve and all friends might come usually we had fifteen or twenty people now we are starting again i myself enjoy it so much i am afraid my wife isnt so enthusiastic as she used to be i wish something would rouse her up you know the war seemed to take her life away here in florence are so many amateurs very good indeed we can have very good chambermusic indeed i hope it will cheer her up and make her quite herself again i was away for such long periods at the frontand it was not good for her to be alonei am hoping now all will be better  so saying the little odd officer switched on the lights of the long salon it was a handsome room in the italian mode of the empire periodbeautiful old faded tapestry panelsreddishand some ormolu furnitureand other things mixed inrather conglomerate but pleasing all the more pleasing it was big not too empty and seemed to belong to human life not to show and shutupedness the host was happy showing it  of course the flat in paris is more luxurious than this he said but i prefer this i prefer it here there was a certain wistfulness as he looked round then began to switch off the lights  they returned to the little salotta the marchesa was seated in a low chair she wore a very thin white blouse that showed her arms and her throat she was a fullbreasted softskinned woman though not stout  make the cocktails then manfredi she said do you find this room very cold she asked of aaron  not a bit cold he said  the stove goes all the time she said but without much effect  you wear such thin clothes he said  ah no the stove should give heat enough do sit down will you smoke there are cigarettesand cigars if you prefer them  no ive got my own thanks  she took her own cigarette from her gold case  it is a fine room for music the big room said he  yes quite would you like to play for us some time do you think  do you want me to i mean does it interest you  whatthe flute  nomusic altogether  music altogether well i used to love it nowim not sure manfredi lives for it almost  for that and nothing else asked aaron  no no no no other things as well  but you dont like it much any more  i dont know perhaps i dont im not sure  you dont look forward to the saturday mornings he asked  perhaps i dontbut for manfredis sake of course i do but for his sake more than my own i admit and i think he knows it  a crowd of people in ones house said aaron  yes the people but its not only that its the music itselfi think i cant stand it any more i dont know  too emotional too much feeling for you  yes perhaps but no what i cant stand is chords you know harmonies a number of sounds all sounding together it just makes me ill it makes me feel so sick  whatdo you want discordsdissonances  nothey are nearly as bad no its just when any number of musical notes different notes come together harmonies or discords even a single chord struck on the piano it makes me feel sick i just feel as if i should retch isnt it strange of course i dont tell manfredi it would be too cruel to him it would cut his life in two  but then why do you have the musicthe saturdaysthen  oh i just keep out of the way as much as possible im sure you feel there is something wrong with me that i take it as i do she added as if anxious but half ironical  noi was just wonderingi believe i feel something the same myself i know orchestra makes me blind with hate or i dont know what but i want to throw bombs  there now it does that to me too only now it has fairly got me down and i feel nothing but helpless nausea you know like when you are seasick  her darkblue heavy hauntedlooking eyes were resting on him as if she hoped for something he watched her face steadily a curious intelligence flickering on his own  yes he said i understand it and i know at the bottom im like that but i keep myself from realising dont you know else perhaps where should i be because i make my life and my living at it as well  at music do you but how bad for you but perhaps the flute is different i have a feeling that it is i can think of one single pipenoteyes i can think of it quite quite calmly and i cant even think of the piano or of the violin with its tremolo or of orchestra or of a string quartetteor even a military bandi cant think of it without a shudder i can only bear drumandfife isnt it crazy of mebut from the other from what we call music proper ive endured too much but bring your flute one day bring it will you and let me hear it quite alone quite quite alone i think it might do me an awful lot of good i do really i can imagine it she closed her eyes and her strange singsong lapsing voice came to an end she spoke almost like one in a tranceor a sleepwalker  ive got it now in my overcoat pocket he said if you like  have you yes she was never hurried always slow and resonant so that the echoes of her voice seemed to linger yesdo get it do get it and play in the other roomquitequite without accompaniment doand try me  and you will tell me what you feel  yes  aaron went out to his overcoat when he returned with his flute which he was screwing together manfredi had come with the tray and the three cocktails the marchesa took her glass  listen manfredi she said mr sisson is going to play quite alone in the sala and i am going to sit here and listen  very well said manfredi drink your cocktail first are you going to play without music  yes said aaron  ill just put on the lights for you  noleave it dark enough light will come in from here  sure said manfredi  yes  the little soldier was an intruder at the moment both the others felt it so but they bore him no grudge they knew it was they who were exceptional not he aaron swallowed his drink and looked towards the door  sit down manfredi sit still said the marchesa  wont you let me try some accompaniment said the soldier  no i shall just play a little thing from memory said aaron  sit down dear sit down said the marchesa to her husband  he seated himself obediently the flash of bright yellow on the grey of his uniform seemed to make him like a chaffinch or a gnome  aaron retired to the other room and waited awhile to get back the spell which connected him with the woman and gave the two of them this strange isolation beyond the bounds of life as it seemed  he caught it again and there in the darkness of the big room he put his flute to his lips and began to play it was a clear sharp lilted runandfall of notes not a tune in any sense of the word and yet a melody a bright quick sound of pure animation a bright quick animate noise running and pausing it was like a birds singing in that it had no human emotion or passion or intention or meaninga ripple and poise of animate sound but it was unlike a birds singing in that the notes followed clear and single one after the other in their subtle gallop a nightingale is rather like thata wild sound to read all the human pathos into nightingales singing is nonsense a wild savage nonhuman lurch and squander of sound beautiful but entirely unaesthetic  what aaron was playing was not of his own invention it was a bit of mediaeval phrasing written for the pipe and the viol it made the piano seem a ponderous nervewracking steamroller of noise and the violin as we know it a hateful wiredrawn nervetorturer  after a little while when he entered the smaller room again the marchesa looked full into his face  good she said good  and a gleam almost of happiness seemed to light her up she seemed like one who had been kept in a horrible enchanted castlefor years and years oh a horrible enchanted castle with wet walls of emotions and ponderous chains of feelings and a ghastly atmosphere of mustbe she felt she had seen through the opening door a crack of sunshine and thin pure light outside air outside beyond this dank and beastly dungeon of feelings and moral necessity ughshe shuddered convulsively at what had been she looked at her little husband chains of necessity all round him a little jailor yet she was fond of him if only he would throw away the castle keys he was a little gnome what did he clutch the castlekeys so tight for  aaron looked at her he knew that they understood one another he and she without any moral necessity or any other necessity outsidethey had got outside the castle of socalled human life outside the horrible stinking human castle of life a bit of true limpid freedom just a glimpse  charming said the marchese truly charming but what was it you played  aaron told him  but truly delightful i say wont you play for us one of these saturdays and wont you let me take the accompaniment i should be charmed charmed if you would  all right said aaron  do drink another cocktail said his hostess  he did so and then he rose to leave  will you stay to dinner said the marchesa we have two people comingtwo italian relatives of my husband but  no aaron declined to stay to dinner  then wont you come onlet me seeon wednesday do come on wednesday we are alone and do bring the flute come at halfpast six as today will you yes  aaron promisedand then he found himself in the street it was halfpast seven instead of returning straight home he crossed the ponte vecchio and walked straight into the crowd the night was fine now he had his overcoat over his arm and in a sort of trance or frenzy whirled away by his evenings experience and by the woman he strode swiftly forward hardly heeding anything but rushing blindly on through all the crowd carried away by his own feelings as much as if he had been alone and all these many people merely trees  leaving the piazza vittorio emmanuele a gang of soldiers suddenly rushed round him buffeting him in one direction whilst another gang swinging round the corner threw him back helpless again into the midst of the first gang for some moments he struggled among the rude brutal little mob of greygreen coarse uniforms that smelt so strong of soldiers then irritated he found himself free again shaking himself and passing on towards the cathedral irritated he now put on his overcoat and buttoned it to the throat closing himself in as it were from the brutal insolence of the sunday night mob of men before he had been walking through them in a rush of naked feeling all exposed to their tender mercies he now gathered himself together  as he was going home suddenly just as he was passing the bargello he stopped he stopped and put his hand to his breast pocket his lettercase was gone he had been robbed it was as if lightning ran through him at that moment as if a fluid electricity rushed down his limbs through the sluice of his knees and out at his feet leaving him standing there almost unconscious for a moment unconscious and superconscious he stood there he had been robbed they had put their hand in his breast and robbed him if they had stabbed him it could hardly have had a greater effect on him  and he had known it he had known it when the soldiers jostled him so evilly they robbed him and he knew it he had known it as if it were fate even as if it were fated beforehand  feeling quite weak and faint as if he had really been struck by some evil electric fluid he walked on and as soon as he began to walk he began to reason perhaps his lettercase was in his other coat perhaps he had not had it with him at all perhaps he was feeling all this just for nothing perhaps it was all folly  he hurried forward he wanted to make sure he wanted relief it was as if the power of evil had suddenly seized him and thrown him and he wanted to say it was not so that he had imagined it all conjured it up he did not want to admit the power of evilparticularly at that moment for surely a very ugly evil spirit had struck him in the midst of that gang of italian soldiers he knew itit had pierced him it had got him  but he wanted to say it was not so reaching the house he hastened upwards to his faroff lonely room through the dark corridors once in his own apartment he shut the door and switched on the light a sensation like fear at his heart then he searched his other pockets he looked everywhere in vain  in vain truly enough for he knew the thing was stolen he had known it all along the soldiers had deliberately plotted had deliberately rushed him and taken his purse they must have watched him previously they must have grinned and jeered at him  he sat down in a chair to recover from the shock the pocketbook contained four hundred francs three onepound notes and various letters and private effects well these were lost but it was not so much the loss as the assault on his person that caused him to feel so stricken he felt the jeering gibing blows they had given as they jostled him  and now he sat weak in every limb and said to himself yesand if i hadnt rushed along so full of feeling if i hadnt exposed myself if i hadnt got worked up with the marchesa and then rushed all kindled through the streets without reserve it would never have happened i gave myself away and there was someone ready to snatch what i gave i gave myself away it is my own fault i should have been on my guard i should be always on my guard always always with god and the devil both i should be on my guard godly or devilish i should hold fast to my reserve and keep on the watch and if i dont i deserve what i get  but still he sat in his chair in his bedroom dazed one part of his soul was saying emphatically it serves you right it is nothing but right it serves everybody right who rushes enkindled through the street and trusts implicitly in mankind and in the lifespirit as if mankind and the lifespirit were a playground for enkindled individuals it serves you right you have paid about twelve pounds sterling for your lesson fool you might have known beforehand and then you neednt have paid at all you can ill afford twelve pounds sterling you fool but since paid you have then mind mind the lesson is learned never again never expose yourself again never again absolute trust it is a blasphemy against life is absolute trust has a wild creature ever absolute trust it minds itself sleeping or waking it is on its guard and so must you be or youll go under sleeping or waking man or woman god or the devil keep your guard over yourself keep your guard over yourself lest worse befall you no man is robbed unless he incites a robber no man is murdered unless he attracts a murderer then be not robbed it lies within your own power and be not murdered or if you are you deserve it keep your guard over yourself now always and forever yes against god quite as hard as against the devil hes fully as dangerous to you  thus thinking not in his mind but in his soul his active living soul he gathered his equanimity once more and accepted the fact so he rose and tidied himself for dinner his face was now set and still his heart also was stilland fearless because its sentinel was stationed stationed stationed for ever  and aaron never forgot after this it became essential to him to feel that the sentinel stood guard in his own heart he felt a strange unease the moment he was off his guard asleep or awake in the midst of the deepest passion or the suddenest love or in the throes of greatest excitement or bewilderment somewhere some corner of himself was awake to the fact that the sentinel of the soul must not sleep no never not for one instant     chapter xvii high up over the cathedral square   aaron and lilly sat in argyles little loggia high up under the eaves of the small hotel a sort of long atticterrace just under the roof where no one would have suspected it it was level with the grey conical roof of the baptistery here sat aaron and lilly in the afternoon in the last of the lovely autumn sunshine below the square was already cold in shadow the pink and white and green baptistery rose lanternshaped as from some seashore cool cold and wan now the sun was gone black figures innumerable black figures curious because they were all on end up on endaaron could not say why he expected them to be horizontallittle black figures upon end like fishes that swim on their tails wiggled endlessly across the piazza little carriages on natural allfours rattled tinily across the yellow little tramcars like dogs slipped round the corner the balcony was so high up that the sound was ineffectual the upper space above the houses was nearer than the undercurrents of the noisy town sunlight lovely full sunlight lingered warm and still on the balcony it caught the facade of the cathedral sideways like the tips of a flower and sideways lit up the stem of giottos tower like a lily stem or a long lovely pale pink and white and green pistil of the lily of the cathedral florence the flowery town firenzefiorenzethe flowery town the red lilies the fiorentini the flowersouled flowers with good roots in the mud and muck as should be and fearless blossoms in air like the cathedral and the tower and the david  i love it said lilly i love this place i love the cathedral and the tower i love its pinkness and its paleness the gothic souls find fault with it and say it is gimcrack and tawdry and cheap but i love it it is delicate and rosy and the dark stripes are as they should be like the tiger marks on a pink lily its a lily not a rose a pinky white lily with dark tigery marks and heavy too in its own substance earthsubstance risen from earth into the air and never forgetting the dark blackfierce earthi reckon here men for a moment were themselves as a plant in flower is for the moment completely itself then it goes off as florence has gone off no flowers now but it has flowered and i dont see why a race should be like an aloe tree flower once and die why should it why not flower again why not  if its going to it will said aaron our deciding about it wont alter it  the decision is part of the business  here they were interrupted by argyle who put his head through one of the windows he had flecks of lather on his reddened face  do you think youre wise now he said to sit in that sun  in november laughed lilly  always fear the sun when theres an r in the month said argyle always fear it r or no r i say im frightened of it ive been in the south i know what it is i tell you im frightened of it but if you think you can stand itwell  it wont last much longer anyhow said lilly  too long for me my boy im a shady bird in all senses of the word in all senses of the wordnow are you comfortable what have another cushion a rug for your knees youre quite sure now well wait just one moment till the waiter brings up a syphon and you shall have a whiskey and soda preciousoh yes very precious these dayslike drinking gold thirtyfive lire a bottle my boy argyle pulled a long face and made a noise with his lips but i had this bottle given me and luckily youve come while theres a drop left very glad you have very glad you have  here he poked a little table through the window and put a bottle and two glasses one a toothglass upon it then he withdrew again to finish shaving the waiter presently hobbled up with the syphon and third glass argyle pushed his head through the window that was only a little higher than the balcony he was soon neatly shaved and was brushing his hair  go ahead my boys go ahead with that whiskey he said  well wait for you said lilly  no no dont think of it however if you will i shall be one minute onlyone minute only ill put on the water for the tea now oh damned bad methylated spirit they sell now and six francs a litre six francs a litre i dont know what im going to do the air i breathe costs money nowadaysjust one moment and ill be with you just one moment  in a very little while he came from the tiny attic bedroom through the tiniest cupboard of a sittingroom under the eaves where his books were and where he had hung his old red india tapestriesor silk embroideriesand he emerged there up above the world on the loggia  now thensiamo nel paradiso eh paradisal enough for you is it  the devil looking over lincoln said lilly laughing glancing up into argyles face  the devil looking over florence would feel sad said argyle the place is fast growing respectableoh piety makes the devil chuckle but respectability my boy argues a serious diminution of spunk and when the spunk diminishes weellits enough to make the most sturdy devil look sick what no doubt about it no doubt whateverthere he had just finished settling his tie and buttoning his waistcoat how do i look eh presentableive just had this suit turned clever little tailor across the way there but he charged me a hundred and twenty francs argyle pulled a face and made the little trumping noise with his lips howevernot bad is ithe had to let in a bit at the back of the waistcoat and a gusset my boy a gussetin the trousers back seems ive grown in the arsal region well well might do worseis it all right  lilly eyed the suit  very nice very nice indeed such a good cloth that makes all the difference  oh my dear fellow all the difference this suit is eleven years oldeleven years old but beautiful english clothbefore the war before the war  it looks quite wonderfully expensive and smart now said lilly  expensive and smart eh hahaha well it cost me a hundred and twenty francs to have it turned and i found that expensive enough well now come here argyles voice took on a new gay cheer a whiskey and soda lilly say when oh nonsense nonsense youre going to have double that youre no lily of the valley here remember not with me not likely siamo nel paradiso remember  but why should we drink your whiskey tea would do for us just as well  not likely not likely when i have the pleasure of your company my boy we drink a glass of something unless i am utterly stripped say when aaron  when said aaron  argyle at last seated himself heavily in a small chair the sun had left the loggia but was glowing still on giottos tower and the top of the cathedral facade and on the remoter great redtiled dome  look at my little red monthly rose said argyle wonderful little fellow i wouldnt have anything happen to him for the world oh a bacchic little chap i made pasquale wear a wreath of them on his hair very becoming they were veryoh ive had a charming show of flowers wonderful creatures sunflowers are they got up and put their heads over the balcony looking down on the square below oh great fun great funyes i had a charming show of flowers charmingzinnias petunias ranunculus sunflowers white stocksoh charming look at that bit of honeysuckle you see the berries where his flowers were delicious scent i assure you  under the little balcony wall argyle had put square redtiled pots all round and in these still bloomed a few pansies and asters whilst in a corner a monthly rose hung flowers like round blooddrops argyle was as tidy and scrupulous in his tiny rooms and his balcony as if he were a firstrate seaman on a yacht lilly remarked on this  do you see signs of the old maid coming out in me oh i dont doubt it i dont doubt it we all end that way age makes old maids of us all and tanny is all right you say bring her to see me why didnt she come today  you know you dont like people unless you expect them  oh but my dear fellowyou and tanny youd be welcome if you came at my busiest moment of course you would id be glad to see you if you interrupted me at any crucial momenti am alone now till august then we shall go away together somewhere but you and tanny why theres the world and theres lilly thats how i put it my boy  all right argylehoflichkeiten  what gar keine hoflichkeiten wahrhaftiger kerl bin ichwhen am i going to see tanny when are you coming to dine with me  after youve dined with ussay the day after tomorrow  right you are delighted let me look if that waters boiling he got up and poked half himself inside the bedroom not yet damned filthy methylated spirit they sell  look said lilly theres del torre  like some sort of midge in that damned greyandyellow uniform i cant stand it i tell you i cant stand the sight of any more of these uniforms like a blight on the human landscape like a blight like greenflies on rosetrees smotherflies europes got the smotherfly in these infernal shoddy militarists  del torres coming out of it as soon as he can said lilly  i should think so too  i like him myselfvery much look hes seen us he wants to come up argyle  what in that uniform ill see him in his grandmothers crinoline first  dont be fanatical its bad taste let him come up a minute  not for my sake but for yours he shall argyle stood at the parapet of the balcony and waved his arm yes come up he said come up you little mistkaferwhat the americans call a bug come up and be damned  of course del torre was too far off to hear this exhortation lilly also waved to himand watched him pass into the doorway far below  ill rinse one of these glasses for him said argyle  the marcheses step was heard on the stone stairs then his knock  come in come in cried argyle from the bedroom where he was rinsing the glass the marchese entered grinning with his curious half courteous greeting go throughgo through cried argyle go on to the loggiaand mind your head good heavens mind your head in that doorway  the marchese just missed the top of the doorway as he climbed the abrupt steps on to the loggiathere he greeted lilly and aaron with hearty handshakes  very glad to see youvery glad indeed he cried grinning with excited courtesy and pleasure and covering lillys hand with both his own gloved hands when did you come to florence  there was a little explanation argyle shoved the last chairit was a luggage stoolthrough the window  all i can do for you in the way of a chair he said  ah that is all right said the marchese well it is very nice up hereand very nice company of the very best the very best in florence  the highest anyhow said argyle grimly as he entered with the glass have a whiskey and soda del torre its the bottom of the bottle as you see  the bottom of the bottle then i start with the tailend yes he stretched his blue eyes so that the whites showed all round and grinned a wide gnomelike grin  you made that start long ago my dear fellow dont play the ingenue with me you know it wont work say when my man say when  yes when said del torre when did i make that start then  at some unmentionably young age chickens such as you soon learn to cheep  chickens such as i soon learn to cheap repeated del torre pleased with the verbal play what is cheap please what is to cheap  cheep cheep squeaked argyle making a face at the little italian who was perched on one strap of the luggagestool its what chickens say when theyre poking their little noses into new adventuresnaughty ones  are chickens naughty oh i thought they could only be good  featherless chickens like yourself my boy  oh as for featherlessthen there is no saying what they will do and here the marchese turned away from argyle with the inevitable question to lilly  well and how long will you stay in florence  lilly did not know but he was not leaving immediately  good then you will come and see us at once  argyle rose once more and went to make the tea he shoved a lump of cakeor rather panetone good currant loafthrough the window with a knife to cut it  help yourselves to the panetone he said eat it up the tea is coming at once youll have to drink it in your glasses theres only one old cup  the marchese cut the cake and offered pieces the two men took and ate  so you have already found mr sisson said del torre to lilly  ran straight into him in the via nazionale said lilly  oh one always runs into everybody in florence we are all already acquainted also with the flute that is a great pleasure  so i thinkdoes your wife like it too  very much indeed she is quite eprise i too shall have to learn to play it  and run the risk of spoiling the shape of your mouthlike alcibiades  is there a risk yes then i shant play it my mouth is too beautifulbut mr sisson has not spoilt his mouth  not yet said lilly give him time  is he also afraidlike alcibiades  are you aaron said lilly  what  afraid of spoiling your beauty by screwing your mouth to the flute  i look a fool do i when im playing said aaron  only the least little bit in the world said lilly the way you prance your head you know like a horse  ah well said aaron ive nothing to lose  and were you surprised lilly to find your friend here asked del torre  i ought to have been but i wasnt really  then you expected him  no it came naturally thoughbut why did you come aaron what exactly brought you  accident said aaron  ah no no there is no such thing as accident said the italian a man is drawn by his fate where he goes  you are right said argyle who came now with the teapot a man is drawnor driven driven ive found it ah my dear fellow what is life but a search for a friend a search for a friendthat sums it up  or a lover said the marchese grinning  same thing same thing my hair is whitebut that is the sum of my whole experience the search for a friend there was something at once real and sentimental in argyles tone  and never finding said lilly laughing  oh what would you often finding often finding and losing of coursea lifes history give me your glass miserable tea but nobody has sent me any from england  and you will go on till you die argyle said lilly always seeking a friendand always a new one  if i lose the friend ive got ah my dear fellow in that case i shall go on seeking i hope so i assure you something will be very wrong with me if ever i sit friendless and make no search  but argyle there is a time to leave off  to leave off what to leave off what  having friends or a friend rather or seeking to have one  oh no not at all my friend not at all only death can make an end of that my friend only death and i should say not even death not even death ends a mans search for a friend that is my belief you may hang me for it but i shall never alter  nay said lilly there is a time to love and a time to leave off loving  all i can say to that is that my time to leave off hasnt come yet said argyle with obstinate feeling  ah yes it has it is only a habit and an idea you stick to  indeed it is no such thing indeed it is no such thing it is a profound desire and necessity and what is more a belief  an obstinate persistency you mean said lilly  well call it so if it pleases you it is by no means so to me there was a brief pause the sun had left the cathedral dome and the tower the sky was full of light the square swimming in shadow  but can a man live said the marchese without having something he lives for something he wishes for or longs for and tries that he may get  impossible completely impossible said argyle man is a seeker and except as such he has no significance no importance  he bores me with his seeking said lilly he should learn to possess himselfto be himselfand keep still  ay perhaps so said aaron only  but my dear boy believe me a man is never himself save in the supreme state of love or perhaps hate too which amounts to the same thing never really himselfapart from this he is a tramdriver or a moneyshoveller or an ideamachine only in the state of love is he really a man and really himself i say so because i know said argyle  ah yes that is one side of the truth it is quite true also but it is just as true to say that a man is never less himself than in the supreme state of love never less himself than then  maybe maybe but what could be better what could be better than to lose oneself with someone you love entirely and so find yourself ah my dear fellow that is my creed that is my creed and you cant shake me in it never in that never in that  yes argyle said lilly i know youre an obstinate loveapostle  i am i am and i have certain standards my boy and certain ideals which i never transgress never transgress and never abandon  all right then you are an incurable lovemaker  pray god i am said argyle  yes said the marchese perhaps we are all so what else do you give would you have us make money or do you give the centre of your spirit to your work how is it to be  i dont vitally care either about money or my work or lilly faltered  or what then  or anything i dont really care about anything except that  you dont care about anything but what is that for a life cried the marchese with a hollow mockery  what do you care for asked lilly  me i care for several things i care for my wife i care for love and i care to be loved and i care for some pleasures and i care for music and i care for italy  you are well off for cares said lilly  and you seem to me so very poor said del torre  i should say soif he cares for nothing interjaculated argyle then he clapped lilly on the shoulder with a laugh ha ha habut he only says it to tease us he cried shaking lillys shoulder he cares more than we do for his own way of loving come along dont try and take us in we are old birds old birds said argyle but at that moment he seemed a bit doddering  a man cant live said the italian without an object  welland that object said lilly  wellit may be many things mostly it is two thingslove and money but it may be many things ambition patriotism science artmany things but it is some objective something outside the self perhaps many things outside the self  i have had only one objective all my life said argyle and that was love for that i have spent my life  and the lives of a number of other people too said lilly  admitted oh admitted it takes two to make love unless youre a miserable  dont you think said aaron turning to lilly that however you try to get away from it if youre not after money and cant fit yourself into a jobyouve got to youve got to try and find something elsesomebody elsesomebody you cant really be alone  no matter how many mistakes youve madeyou cant really be alone asked lilly  you can be alone for a minute you can be alone just in that minute when youve broken free and you feel heart thankful to be alone because the other thing wasnt to be borne but you cant keep on being alone no matter how many tunes youve broken free and feel thank god to be alone nothing on earth is so good as to breathe fresh air and be alone no matter how many times youve felt thisit wears off every time and you begin to look againand you begin to roam round and even if you wont admit it to yourself still you are seekingseeking arent you arent you yourself seeking  oh thats another matter put in argyle lilly is happily married and on the shelf with such a fine woman as tanny i should think sorather but his is an exceptional nature and an exceptional case as for me i made a hell of my marriage and i swear it nearly sent me to hell but i didnt forswear love when i forswore marriage and woman not by any means  are you not seeking any more lilly asked the marchese do you seek nothing  we married men who havent left our wives are we supposed to seek anything said lilly arent we perfectly satisfied and in bliss with the wonderful women who honour us as wives  ah yes yes said the marchese but now we are not speaking to the world now we try to speak of that which we have in our centre of our hearts  and what have we there said lilly  wellshall i say we have unrest we have another need we have something that hurts and eats us yes eats us inside do i speak the truth  yes but what is the something  i dont know i dont know but it is something in love i think it is love itself which gnaws us inside like a cancer said the italian  but why should it is that the nature of love said lilly  i dont know truly i dont knowbut perhaps it is in the nature of lovei dont knowbut i tell you i love my wifeshe is very dear to me i admire her i trust her i believe her she is to me much more than any woman more even than my motherand so i am very happy i am very happy she is very happy in our love and our marriagebut wait nothing has changedthe love has not changed it is the sameand yet we are not happy no we are not happy i know she is not happy i know i am not  why should you be said lilly  yesand it is not even happiness said the marchese screwing up his face in a painful effort of confession it is not even happiness no i do not ask to be happy why should i it is childishbut there is for both of us i know it something which bites us which eats us within and drives us drives us somewhere we dont know where but it drives us and eats away the lifeand yet we love each other and we must not separatedo you know what i mean do you understand me at all in what i say i speak what is true  yes i understand im in the same dilemma myselfbut what i want to hear is why you think it is so why is it  shall i say what i think yes and you can tell me if it is foolish to youshall i tell you well because a woman she now first wants the man and he must go to her because he is wanted do you understandyou knowsupposing i go to a womansupposing she is my wifeand i go to her yes with my blood all ready because it is i who want then she puts me off then she says not now not now i am tired i am not well i do not feel like it she puts me offtill i am angry or sorry or whatever i ambut till my blood has gone down again you understand and i dont want her any more and then she puts her arms round me and caresses me and makes love to metill she rouses me once more so and so she rouses meand so i come to her and i love her it is very good very good but it was she who began it was her initiative you knowi do not think in all my life my wife has loved me from my initiative you know she will yield to mebecause i insist or because she wants to be a good submissive wife who loves me so she will yield to me but ah what is it you know what is it a woman who allows me and who has no answer it is something worse than nothingworse than nothing and so it makes me very discontented and unbelievingif i say to her she says it is not truenot at all true then she says all she wants is that i should desire her that i should love her and desire her but even that is putting her will first and if i come to her so if i come to her of my own desire then she puts me off she puts me off or she only allows me to come to her even now it is the same after ten years as it was at first but now i know and for many years i did not know  the little man was intense his face was strained his blue eyes so stretched that they showed the whites all round he gazed into lillys face  but does it matter said lilly slowly in which of you the desire initiates isnt the result the same  it matters it matters cried the marchese  oh my dear fellow how much it matters interrupted argyle sagely  ay said aaron  the marchese looked from one to the other of them  it matters he cried it matters life or death it used to be that desire started in the man and the woman answered it used to be so for a long time in italy for this reason the women were kept away from the men for this reason our catholic religion tried to keep the young girls in convents and innocent before marriage so that with their minds they should not know and should not start this terrible thing this womans desire over a man beforehand this desire which starts in a womans head when she knows and which takes a man for her use for her service this is eve ah i hate eve i hate her when she knows and when she wills i hate her when she will make of me that which serves her desireshe may love me she may be soft and kind to me she may give her life for me but why only because i am hers i am that thing which does her most intimate service she can see no other in me and i may be no other to her  then why not let it be so and be satisfied said lilly  because i cannot i cannot i would but i cannot the borghesiathe citizensthe bourgeoisie they are the ones who can oh yes the bourgeoisie the shopkeepers these serve their wives so and their wives love them they are the marital maquereauxthe husbandmaquereau you know their wives are so stout and happy and they dote on their husbands and always betray them so it is with the bourgeoise she loves her husband so much and is always seeking to betray him or she is a madame bovary seeking for a scandal but the bourgeois husband he goes on being the same he is the horse and she the driver and when she says geeup you knowthen he comes ready like a hired maquereau only he feels so good like a good little boy at her breast and then there are the nice little children and so they keep the world goingbut for me he spat suddenly and with frenzy on the floor  you are quite right my boy said argyle you are quite right theyve got the start of us the women and weve got to canter when they say geeup ioh i went through it all but i broke the shafts and smashed the matrimonial cart i can tell you and i didnt care whether i smashed her up along with it or not i didnt care one single bit i assure youand here i am and she is dead and buried these dozen years wellwell life you know life and women oh they are the very hottest hell once they get the start of you theres nothing they wont do to you once theyve got you nothing they wont do to you especially if they love you then you may as well give up the ghost or smash the cart behind you and her in it otherwise she will just harry you into submission and make a dog of you and cuckold you under your nose and youll submit oh youll submit and go on calling her my darling or else if you wont submit shell do for you your only chance is to smash the shafts and the whole matrimonial cart or shell do for you for a woman has an uncanny hellish strengthshes a shebear and a wolf is a woman when shes got the start of you oh its a terrible experience if youre not a bourgeois and not one of the knucklingunder moneymaking sort  knucklingunder sort yes that is it said the marchese  but cant there be a balancing of wills said lilly  my dear boy the balance lies in that that when one goes up the other goes down one acts the other takes it is the only way in loveand the women are nowadays the active party oh yes not a shadow of doubt about it they take the initiative and the man plays up thats how it is the man just plays upnice manly proceeding what cried argyle  but why cant man accept it as the natural order of things said lilly science makes it the natural order  all my  to science said argyle no man with one drop of real spunk in him can stand it long  yes yes yes cried the italian most men want it so most men want only that a woman shall want them and they shall then play up to her when she has roused them most men want only this that a woman shall choose one man out to be her man and he shall worship her and come up when she shall provoke him otherwise he is to keep still and the woman she is quite sure of her part she must be loved and adored and above all obeyed particularly in her sex desire there she must not be thwarted or she becomes a devil and if she is obeyed she becomes a misunderstood woman with nerves looking round for the next man whom she can bring under so it is  well said lilly and then what  nay interrupted aaron but do you think its true what he says have you found it like that youre married has your experience been different or the same  what was yours asked lilly  mine was the same mine was the same if ever it was said aaron  and mine was extremely similar said argyle with a grimace  and yours lilly asked the marchese anxiously  not very different said lilly  ah cried del torre jerking up erect as if he had found something  and whats your way out aaron asked him  im not outso i wont holloa said lilly but del torre puts it bestwhat do you say is the way out del torre  the way out is that it should change that the man should be the asker and the woman the answerer it must change  but it doesnt prrr argyle made his trumpeting noise  does it asked lilly of the marchese  no i think it does not  and will it ever again  perhaps never  and then what  then why then man seeks a pisaller then he seeks something which will give him answer and which will not only draw him draw him with a terrible sexual willso he seeks young girls who know nothing and so cannot force him he thinks he will possess them while they are young and they will be soft and responding to his wishesbut in this too he is mistaken because now a baby of one year if it be a female is like a woman of forty so is its will made up so it will force a man  and so young girls are no good even as a pisaller  no goodbecause they are all modern women every one a modern woman not one who isnt  terrible thing the modern woman put in argyle  and then  then man seeks other forms of loves always seeking the loving response you know of one gentler and tenderer than himself who will wait till the man desires and then will answer with full lovebut it is all pisaller you know  not by any means my boy cried argyle  and then a man naturally loves his own wife too even if it is not bearable to love her  or one leaves her like aaron said lilly  and seeks another woman so said the marchese  does he seek another woman said lilly do you aaron  i dont want to said aaron buti cant stand by myself in the middle of the world and in the middle of people and know i am quite by myself and nowhere to go and nothing to hold on to i can for a day or twobut then it becomes unbearable as well you get frightened you feel you might go funnyas you would if you stood on this balcony wall with all the space beneath you  cant one be alonequite alone said lilly  but noit is absurd like saint simeon stylites on a pillar but it is absurd cried the italian  i dont mean like simeon stylites i mean cant one live with ones wife and be fond of her and with ones friends and enjoy their company and with the world and everything pleasantly and yet know that one is alone essentially at the very core of me alone eternally alone and choosing to be alone not sentimental or lonely alone choosing to be alone because by ones own nature one is alone the being with another person is secondary said lilly  one is alone said argyle in all but love in all but love my dear fellow and then i agree with you  no said lilly in love most intensely of all alone  completely incomprehensible said argyle amounts to nothing  one man is but a part how can he be so alone said the marchese  in so far as he is a single individual soul he is aloneipso facto in so far as i am i and only i am i and i am only i in so far i am inevitably and eternally alone and it is my last blessedness to know it and to accept it and to live with this as the core of my selfknowledge  my dear boy you are becoming metaphysical and that is as bad as softening of the brain said argyle  all right said lilly  and said the marchese it may be so by reason but in the heart can the heart ever beat quite alone plop plopcan the heart beat quite alone alone in all the atmosphere all the space of the universe plop plop plopquite alone in all the space a slow smile came over the italians face it is impossible it may eat against the heart of other men in anger all in pressure against the others it may beat hard like iron saying it is independent but this is only beating against the heart of mankind not alonebut either with or against the heart of mankind or the heart of someone mother wife friend childrenso must the heart of every man beat it is so  it beats alone in its own silence said lilly  the italian shook his head  wed better be going inside anyhow said argyle some of you will be taking cold  aaron said lilly is it true for you  nearly said aaron looking into the quiet halfamused yet frightening eyes of the other man or it has been  a miss is as good as a mile laughed lilly rising and picking up his chair to take it indoors and the laughter of his voice was so like a simple deliberate amiability that aarons heart really stood still for a second he knew that lilly was aloneas far as he aaron was concerned lilly was aloneand out of his isolation came his words indifferent as to whether they came or not and he left his friends utterly to their own choice utterly to their own choice aaron felt that lilly was there existing in life yet neither asking for connection nor preventing any connection he was present he was the real centre of the group and yet he asked nothing of them and he imposed nothing he left each to himself and he himself remained just himself neither more nor less and there was a finality about it which was at once maddening and fascinating aaron felt angry as if he were half insulted by the other mans placing the gift of friendship or connection so quietly back in the givers hands lilly would receive no gift of friendship in equality neither would he violently refuse it he let it lie unmarked and yet at the same time aaron knew that he could depend on the other man for help nay almost for life itselfso long as it entailed no breaking of the intrinsic isolation of lillys soul but this condition was also hateful and there was also a great fascination in it     chapter xviii the marchesa   so aaron dined with the marchesa and manfredi he was quite startled when his hostess came in she seemed like somebody else she seemed like a demon her hair on her brows her terrible modern elegance she wore a wonderful gown of thin blue velvet of a lovely colour with some kind of gauzy goldthreaded filament down the sides it was terribly modern short and showed her legs and her shoulders and breast and all her beautiful white arms round her throat was a collar of darkblue sapphires her hair was done low almost to the brows and heavy like an aubrey beardsley drawing she was most carefully made upyet with that touch of exaggeration lips slightly too red which was quite intentional and which frightened aaron he thought her wonderful and sinister she affected him with a touch of horror she sat down opposite him and her beautifully shapen legs in frail goldish stockings seemed to glisten metallic naked thrust from out of the wonderful wonderful skin like periwinkleblue velvet she had tapestry shoes blue and gold and almost one could see her toes metallic naked the goldthreaded gauze slipped at her side aaron could not help watching the nakedseeming arch of her foot it was as if she were dusted with dark golddust upon her marvellous nudity  she must have seen his face seen that he was ebloui  you brought the flute she said in that toneless melancholy unstriving voice of hers her voice alone was the same direct and bare and quiet  yes  perhaps i shall sing later on if youll accompany me will you  i thought you hated accompaniments  oh nonot just unison i dont mean accompaniment i mean unison i dont know how it will be but will you try  yes ill try  manfredi is just bringing the cocktails do you think youd prefer orange in yours  ill have mine as you have yours  i dont take orange in mine wont you smoke  the strange naked remoteseeming voice and then the beautiful firm limbs thrust out in that dress and nakedly dusky as with golddust her beautiful womans legs slightly glistening duskily his one abiding instinct was to touch them to kiss them he had never known a woman to exercise such power over him it was a bare occult force something he could not cope with  manfredi came in with the little tray he was still in uniform  hello cried the little italian glad to see youwell everything all right glad to hear it how is the cocktail nan  yes she said all right  one drop too much peach eh  no all right  ah and the little officer seated himself stretching his gaitered legs as if gaily he had a curious smiling look on his face that aaron thought also diabolicaland almost handsome suddenly the odd laughing satanic beauty of the little man was visible  well and what have you been doing with yourself said he what did you do yesterday  yesterday said aaron i went to the uffizi  to the uffizi well and what did you think of it  very fine  i think it is i think it is what pictures did you look at  i was with dekker we looked at most i believe  and what do you remember best  i remember botticellis venus on the shell  yes yes said manfredi i like her but i like others better you thought her a pretty woman yes  nonot particularly pretty but i like her body and i like the fresh air i like the fresh air the summer seaair all through itthrough her as well  and her face asked the marchesa with a slow ironic smile  yesshes a bit babyfaced said aaron  trying to be more innocent than her own commonsense will let her said the marchesa  i dont agree with you nan said her husband i think it is just that wistfulness and innocence which makes her the true venus the true modern venus she chooses not to know too much and that is her attraction dont you agree aaron excuse me but everybody speaks of you as aaron it seems to come naturally most people speak of me as manfredi too because it is easier perhaps than del torre so if you find it easier use it do you mind that i call you aaron  not at all i hate misters always  yes so do i i like one name only  the little officer seemed very winning and delightful to aaron this eveningand aaron began to like him extremely but the dominating consciousness in the room was the womans  do you agree mr sisson said the marchesa do you agree that the mockinnocence and the shamwistfulness of botticellis venus are her great charms  i dont think she is at all charming as a person said aaron as a particular woman she makes no impression on me at all but as a pictureand the fresh air particularly the fresh air she doesnt seem so much a woman you know as the kind of outofdoors morningfeelings at the seaside  quite a sort of seascape of a woman with a perfectly sham innocence are you as keen on innocence as manfredi is  innocence said aaron its the sort of thing i dont have much feeling about  ah i know you laughed the soldier wickedly you are the sort of man who wants to be anthony to cleopatra haha  aaron winced as if struck then he too smiled flattered yet he felt he had been struck did he want to be anthony to cleopatra without knowing he was watching the marchesa and she was looking away but knew he was watching her and at last she turned her eyes to his with a slow dark smile full of pain and fuller still of knowledge a strange dark silent look of knowledge she gave him from so far away it seemed and he felt all the bonds that held him melting away his eyes remained fixed and gloomy but with his mouth he smiled back at her and he was terrified he knew he was sulking towards hersulking towards her and he was terrified but at the back of his mind also he knew there was lilly whom he might depend on and also he wanted to sink towards her the flesh and blood of him simply melted out in desire towards her cost what may he must come to her and yet he knew at the same time that cost what may he must keep the power to recover himself from her he must have his cake and eat it  and she became cleopatra to him age cannot wither nor custom stale to his instinctive unwilled fancy she was cleopatra  they went in to dinner and he sat on her right hand it was a smallish table with a very few daisyflowers everything rather frail and sparse the food the samenothing very heavy all rather exquisite they drank hock and he was aware of her beautiful arms and her bosom her lowcrowded thick hair parted in the centre the sapphires on her throat the heavy rings on her fingers and the paint on her lips the fard something deep deep at the bottom of him hovered upon her cleaved to her yet he was as if sightless in a stupor who was she what was she he had lost all his grasp only he sat there with his face turned to hers or to her all the time and she talked to him but she never looked at him  indeed she said little it was the husband who talked his manner towards aaron was almost caressive and aaron liked it the woman was silent mostly and seemed remote and aaron felt his life ebb towards her he felt the marvellousness the rich beauty of her arms and breast and the thought of her golddusted smooth limbs beneath the table made him feel almost an idiot  the second wine was a goldcoloured moselle very soft and rich and beautiful she drank this with pleasure as one who understands and for dessert there was a dish of cacchithat orangecoloured pulpy japanese fruitpersimmons aaron had never eaten these before soft almost slimy of a wonderful colour and of a flavour that had sunk from harsh astringency down to that first decaysweetness which is all autumnrich the marchese loved them and scooped them out with his spoon but she ate none  aaron did not know what they talked about what was said if someone had taken his mind away altogether and left him with nothing but a body and a spinal consciousness it would have been the same  but at coffee the talk turned to manfredis duties he would not be free from the army for some time yet on the morrow for example he had to be out and away before it was day he said he hated it and wanted to be a free man once more but it seemed to aaron he would be a very bored man once he was free and then they drifted on to talk of the palazzo in which was their apartment  weve got such a fine terraceyou can see it from your house where you are said manfredi have you noticed it  no said aaron  near that tuft of palmtrees dont you know  no said aaron  let us go out and show it him said the marchesa  manfredi fetched her a cloak and they went through various doors then up some steps the terrace was broad and open it looked straight across the river at the opposite lungarno and there was the thinnecked tower of the palazzo vecchio and the great dome of the cathedral in the distance in shadowbulk in the coldaired night of stars little trams were running brilliant over the flat new bridge on the right and from a garden just below rose a tuft of palmtrees  you see said the marchesa coming and standing close to aaron so that she just touched him you can know the terrace just by these palm trees and you are in the nardini just across there are you on the top floor you said  yes the top floorone of the middle windows i think  one that is always open nowand the others are shut i have noticed it not connecting it with you  yes my window is always open  she was leaning very slightly against him as he stood and he knew with the same kind of inevitability with which he knew he would one day die that he would be the lover of this woman nay that he was her lover already  dont take cold said manfredi  she turned at once indoors aaron caught a faint whiff of perfume from the little orange trees in tubs round the wall  will you get the flute she said as they entered  and will you sing he answered  play first she said  he did as she wished as the other night he went into the big musicroom to play and the stream of sound came out with the quick wild imperiousness of the pipe it had an immediate effect on her she seemed to relax the peculiar druglike tension which was upon her at all ordinary times she seemed to go still and yielding her red mouth looked as if it might moan with relief she sat with her chin dropped on her breast listening and she did not move but she sat softly breathing rather quick like one who has been hurt and is soothed a certain womanly naturalness seemed to soften her  and the music of the flute came quick rather brilliant like a callnote or like a long quick message half command to her it was like a pure male voiceas a blackbirds when he calls a pure male voice not only calling but telling her something telling her something and soothing her soul to sleep it was like the firemusic putting brunnhilde to sleep but the pipe did not flicker and sink it seemed to cause a natural relaxation in her soul a peace perhaps it was more like waking to a sweet morning awakening after a night of tormented painful tense sleep perhaps more like that  when aaron came in she looked at him with a gentle fresh smile that seemed to make the fard on her face look like a curious tiredness which now she might recover from and as the last time it was difficult for her to identify this man with the voice of the flute it was rather difficult except that perhaps between his brows was something of a doubt and in his bearing an aloofness that made her dread he might go away and not come back she could see it in him that he might go away and not come back  she said nothing to him only just smiled and the look of knowledge in her eyes seemed for the moment to be contained in another look a look of faith and at last happiness aarons heart stood still no in her moments mood of faith and at last peace lifetrust he was perhaps more terrified of her than in her previous sinister elegance his spirit started and shrank what was she going to ask of him  i am so anxious that you should come to play one saturday morning said manfredi with an accompaniment you know i should like so much to hear you with piano accompaniment  very well said aaron  will you really come and will you practise with me so that i can accompany you said manfredi eagerly  yes i will said aaron  oh good oh good look here come in on friday morning and let us both look through the music  if mr sisson plays for the public said the marchesa he must not do it for charity he must have the proper fee  no i dont want it said aaron  but you must earn money mustnt you said she  i must said aaron but i can do it somewhere else  no if you play for the public you must have your earnings when you play for me it is different  of course said manfredi every man must have his wage i have mine from the italian government  after a while aaron asked the marchesa if she would sing  shall i she said  yes do  then i will sing alone first to let you see what you think of iti shall be like trilbyi wont say like yvette guilbert because i darent so i will be like trilby and sing a little french song though not malbrouck and without a svengali to keep me in tune  she went near the door and stood with heir hands by her side there was something wistful almost pathetic now in her elegance                       derriere chez mon pere                       vole vole mon coeur vole                      derriere chez mon pere                      il y a un pommier doux                        tout doux et iou                         et iou tout doux                         il y a unpommier doux                       trois belles princesses                       vole vole mon coeur vole                      trois belles princesses                      sont assis dessous                       tout doux et iou                        et iou tout doux                        sont asses dessous   she had a beautiful strong sweet voice but it was faltering stumbling and sometimes it seemed to drop almost to speech after three verses she faltered to an end bitterly chagrined  no she said its no good i cant sing and she dropped in her chair  a lovely little tune said aaron havent you got the music  she rose not answering and found him a little book  what do the words mean he asked her  she told him and then he took his flute  you dont mind if i play it do you he said  so he played the tune it was so simple and he seemed to catch the lilt and the timbre of her voice  come and sing it while i play he said  i cant sing she said shaking her head rather bitterly  but let us try said he disappointed  i know i cant she said but she rose  he remained sitting at the little table the book propped up under the reading lamp she stood at a little distance unhappy  ive always been like that she said i could never sing music unless i had a thing drilled into me and then it wasnt singing any more  but aaron wasnt heeding his flute was at his mouth he was watching her he sounded the note but she did not begin she was twisting her handkerchief so he played the melody alone at the end of the verse he looked up at her again and a half mocking smile played in his eyes again he sounded the note a challenge and this time as at his bidding she began to sing the flute instantly swung with a lovely soft firmness into the song and she wavered only for a minute or two then her soul and her voice got free and she sangshe sang as she wanted to sing as she had always wanted to sing without that awful scotch that impediment inside her own soul which prevented her  she sang free with the flute gliding along with her and oh how beautiful it was for her how beautiful it was to sing the little song in the sweetness of her own spirit how sweet it was to move pure and unhampered at last in the music the lovely ease and lilt of her own soul in its motion through the music she wasnt aware of the flute she didnt know there was anything except her own pure lovely songdrift her soul seemed to breathe as a butterfly breathes as it rests on a leaf and slowly breathes its wings for the first time for the first time her soul drew its own deep breath all her life the breath had caught halfway and now she breathed full deep to the deepest extent of her being  and oh it was so wonderful she was dazed the song ended she stood with a dazed happy face like one just coming awake and the fard on her face seemed like the old nightcrust the bad sleep new and luminous she looked out and she looked at aaron with a proud smile  bravo nan that was what you wanted said her husband  it was wasnt it she said turning a wondering glowing face to him  his face looked strange and withered and gnomelike at the moment  she went and sat in her chair quite silent as if in a trance the two men also sat quite still and in the silence a little drama played itself between the three of which they knew definitely nothing but manfredi knew that aaron had done what he himself never could do for this woman and yet the woman was his own woman not aarons and so he was displaced aaron sitting there glowed with a sort of triumph he had performed a little miracle and felt himself a little wonderworker to whom reverence was due and as in a dream the woman sat feeling what a joy it was to float and move like a swan in the high air flying upon the wings of her own spirit she was as a swan which never before could get its wings quite open and so which never could get up into the open where alone it can sing for swans and storks make their music only when they are high high up in the air then they can give sound to their strange spirits and so she  aaron and manfredi kept their faces averted from one another and hardly spoke to one another it was as if two invisible hands pushed their faces apart away averted and aarons face glimmered with a little triumph and a little grimace of obstinacy and the italians face looked old rather monkeylike and of a deep almost stonebare bitterness the woman looked wondering from one man to the otherwondering the glimmer of the open flower the wonderlook still lasted and aaron said in his heart what a goodly woman what a woman to taste and enjoy ah what a woman to enjoy and was it not his privilege had he not gained it  his manhood or rather his maleness rose powerfully in him in a sort of mastery he felt his own power he felt suddenly his own virile title to strength and reward suddenly and newly flushed with his own male superpower he was going to have his reward the woman was his reward so it was in him and he cast it over in his mind he wanted herha didnt he but the husband sat there like a soapstone chinese monkey greyishgreen so it would have to be another time  he rose therefore and took his leave  but youll let us do that again wont you said she  when you tell me ill come said he  then ill tell you soon said she  so he left and went home to his own place and there to his own remote room as he laid his flute on the table he looked at it and smiled he remembered that lilly had called it aarons rod  so you blossom do youand thorn as well said he  for such a long time he had been gripped inside himself and withheld for such a long time it had been hard and unyielding so hard and unyielding he had wanted nothing his desire had kept itself back fast back for such a long time his desire for woman had withheld itself hard and resistant all his deep desirous blood had been locked he had wanted nobody and nothing and it had been hard to live so without desire without any movement of passionate love only gripped back in recoil that was an experience to endure  and now came his desire back but strong fierce as iron like the strength of an eagle with the lightning in its talons something to glory in something overweening the powerful male passion arrogant royal joves thunderbolt aarons black rod of power blossoming again with red florentine lilies and fierce thorns he moved about in the splendour of his own male lightning invested in the thunder of the male passionpower he had got it back the male godliness the male godhead  so he slept and dreamed violent dreams of strange black strife something like the streetriot in milan but more terrible in the morning however he cared nothing about his dreams as soon as it was really light he rose and opened his window wide it was a grey slow morning but he saw neither the morning nor the river nor the woman walking on the gravel riverbed with her goose nor the green hill up to san miniato he watched the tuft of palmtrees and the terrace beside it he could just distinguish the terrace clearly among the green of foliage so he stood at his window for a full hour and did not move motionless planted he stood and watched that terrace across above the arno but like a statue  after an hour or so he looked at his watch it was nine oclock so he rang for his coffee and meanwhile still stood watching the terrace on the hill he felt his turn had come the phoenix had risen in fire again out of the ashes  therefore at ten oclock he went over the bridge he wrote on the back of his card a request would she please let him have the little book of songs that he might practise them over the manservant went and came back with the request that aaron should wait so aaron entered while the man took his hat  the manservant spoke only french and spanish no english he was a spaniard with greyish hair and stooping shoulders and dark muteseeming eyes he spoke as little as possible the marchesa had inherited him from her father  aaron sat in the little sittingroom and waited after a rather long time the marchesa came inwearing a white thin blouse and a blue skirt she was hardly made up at all she had an odd pleased yet brooding look on her face as she gave aaron her hand something brooded between her brows and her voice was strange with a strange secret undertone that he could not understand he looked up at her and his face was bright and his knees as he sat were like the knees of the gods  you wanted the book of chansons she said  i wanted to learn your tunes he replied  yes lookhere it is and she brought him the little yellow book it was just a handbook with melody and words only no accompaniment so she stood offering him the book but waiting as if for something else and standing as if with another meaning  he opened the leaves at random  but i ought to know which ones you sing said he rising and standing by her side with the open book  yes she said looking over his arm he turned the pages one by one trois jeunes tambours said she yes that yes en passant par la lorraine aupres de ma blonde oh i like that one so much he stood and went over the tune in his mind  would you like me to play it he said  very much said she  so he got his flute propped up the book against a vase and played the tune whilst she hummed it fragmentarily but as he played he felt that he did not cast the spell over her there was no connection she was in some mysterious way withstanding him she was withstanding him and his male superpower and his thunderbolt desire she was in some indescribable way throwing cold water over his phoenix newly risen from the ashes of its nest in flames  he realised that she did not want him to play she did not want him to look at the songs so he put the book away and turned round rather baffled not quite sure what was happening yet feeling she was withstanding him he glanced at her face it was inscrutable it was her cleopatra face once more yet with something new and warm in it he could not understand it what was it in her face that puzzled him almost angered him but she could not rob him of his male power she could not divest him of his concentrated force  wont you take off your coat she said looking at him with strange large dark eyes a strange woman he could not understand her yet as he sat down again having removed his overcoat he felt her looking at his limbs his physical body and this went against him he did not want it yet quite fixed in him too was the desire for her her beautiful white arms her whole soft white body and such desire he would not contradict nor allow to be contradicted it was his will also her whole soft white bodyto possess it in its entirety its fulness  what have you to do this morning she asked him  nothing he said have you he lifted his head and looked at her  nothing at all said she  and then they sat in silence he with his head dropped then again he looked at her  shall we be lovers he said  she sat with her face averted and did not answer his heart struck heavily but he did not relax  shall we be lovers came his voice once more with the faintest touch of irony  her face gradually grew dusky and he wondered very much to see it  yes said she still not looking at him if you wish  i do wish he said and all the time he sat with his eyes fixed on her face and she sat with her face averted  now he said and where  again she was silent for some moments as if struggling with herself then she looked at hima long strange dark look incomprehensible and which he did not like  you dont want emotions you dont want me to say things do you he said  a faint ironic smile came on her face  i know what all that is worth she said with curious calm equanimity no i want none of that  then  but now she sat gazing on him with wide heavy incomprehensible eyes it annoyed him  what do you want to see in me he asked with a smile looking steadily back again  and now she turned aside her face once more and once more the dusky colour came in her cheek he waited  shall i go away he said at length  would you rather she said keeping her face averted  no he said  then again she was silent  where shall i come to you he said  she paused a moment still then answered  ill go to my room  i dont know which it is he said  ill show it you she said  and then i shall come to you in ten minutes in ten minutes he reiterated  so she rose and led the way out of the little salon he walked with her to the door of her room bowed his head as she looked at him holding the door handle and then he turned and went back to the drawingroom glancing at his watch  in the drawingroom he stood quite still with his feet apart and waited he stood with his hands behind him and his feet apart quite motionless planted and firm so the minutes went by unheeded he looked at his watch the ten minutes were just up he had heard footsteps and doors so he decided to give her another five minutes he wished to be quite sure that she had had her own time for her own movements  then at the end of the five minutes he went straight to her room entered and locked the door behind him she was lying in bed with her back to him  he found her strange not as he had imagined her not powerful as he had imagined her strange in his arms she seemed almost small and childish whilst in daily life she looked a full womanly woman strange the naked way she clung to him almost like a sister a younger sister or like a child it filled him with a curious wonder almost a bewilderment in the dark sightlessness of passion she seemed almost like a clinging child in his arms and yet like a child who in some deep and essential way mocked him in some strange and incomprehensible way as a girlchild blindly obstinate in her deepest nature she was against him he felt she was not his woman through him went the feeling this is not my woman  when after a long sleep he awoke and came fully to himself with that click of awakeness which is the end the first shades were closing on the afternoon he got up and reached for his watch  quarter past four he said  her eyes stretched wide with surprise as she looked at him but she said nothing the same strange and wide perhaps insatiable childlike curiosity was in her eyes as she watched him he dressed very quickly and her eyes were wide and she said no single word  but when he was dressed and bent over her to say goodbye she put her arms round him that seemed such frail and childish arms now yet withal so deadly in power her soft arms round his neck her tangle of hair over his face and yet even as he kissed her he felt her deadly he wanted to be gone he wanted to get out of her arms and her clinging and her tangle of hair and her curiosity and her strange and hateful power  youll come again well be like this again she whispered  and it was hard for him to realise that this was that other woman who had sat so silently on the sofa so darkly and reservedly at the tea at algys  yes i will goodbye now and he kissed her and walked straight out of the room quickly he took his coat and his hat quickly and left the house in his nostrils was still the scent with which the bed linen was faintly scentedhe did not know what it was but now he wiped his face and his mouth to wipe it away  he had eaten nothing since coffee that morning and was hungry faintfeeling and his face and his mind felt withered curiously he felt blasted as if blighted by some electricity and he knew he knew quite well he was only in possession of a tithe of his natural faculties and in his male spirit he felt himself hating her hating her deeply damnably but he said to himself no i wont hate her i wont hate her  so he went on over the ponte vecchio where the jewellers windows on the bridge were already blazing with light on into the town he wanted to eat something so he decided to go to a shop he knew where one could stand and eat good tiny rolls split into truffle or salami sandwiches and drink marsala so one after the other he ate little truffle rolls and drank a few glasses of marsala and then he did not know what to do he did not want to eat any more he had had what he wanted his hunger had been more nervous than sensual  so he went into the street it was just growing dark and the town was lighting up he felt curiously blazed as if some flame or electric power had gone through him and withered his vital tissue blazed as if some kind of electric flame had run over him and withered him his brain felt withered his mind had only one of its manysighted eyes left open and unscorched so many of the eyes of his mind were scorched now and sightless  yet a restlessness was in his nerves what should he do he remembered he had a letter in his pocket from sir william franks sir william had still teased him about his fate and his providence in which he aaron was supposed to trust i shall be very glad to hear from you and to know how your benevolent providenceor was yours a fatehas treated you since we saw you  so aaron turned away and walked to the post office there he took paper and sat down at one of the tables in the writing room and wrote his answer it was very strange writing thus when most of his minds eyes were scorched and it seemed he could hardly see to hold the pen to drive it straight across the paper yet write he must and most of his faculties being quenched or blasted for the moment he wrote perhaps his greatest or his innermost truthi dont want my fate or my providence to treat me well i dont want kindness or love i dont believe in harmony and people loving one another i believe in the fight and in nothing else i believe in the fight which is in everything and if it is a question of women i believe in the fight of love even if it blinds me and if it is a question of the world i believe in fighting it and in having it hate me even if it breaks my legs i want the world to hate me because i cant bear the thought that it might love me for of all things love is the most deadly to me and especially from such a repulsive world as i think this is  well here was a letter for a poor old man to receive but in the dryness of his withered mind aaron got it out of himself when a man writes a letter to himself it is a pity to post it to somebody else perhaps the same is true of a book  his letter written however he stamped it and sealed it and put it in the box that made it final then he turned towards home one fact remained unbroken in the debris of his consciousness that in the town was lilly and that when he needed he could go to lilly also that in the world was lottie his wife and that against lottie his heart burned with a deep deep almost unreachable bitternesslike a deep burn on his deepest soul lottie and like a fate which he resented yet which steadied him lilly  he went home and lay on his bed he had enough selfcommand to hear the gong and go down to dinner white and abstractlooking he sat and ate his dinner and then thank god he could go to bed alone in his own cold bed alone thank god to be alone in the night for this he was unspeakably thankful     chapter xix cleopatra but not anthony   aaron awoke in the morning feeling better but still only a part himself the night alone had restored him and the need to be alone still was his greatest need he felt an intense resentment against the marchesa he felt that somehow she had given him a scorpion and his instinct was to hate her and yet he avoided hating her he remembered lillyand the saying that one must possess oneself and be alone in possession of oneself and somehow under the influence of lilly he refused to follow the reflex of his own passion he refused to hate the marchesa he did like her he did esteem her and after all she too was struggling with her fate he had a genuine sympathy with her nay he was not going to hate her  but he could not see her he could not bear the thought that she might call and see him so he took the tram to settignano and walked away all day into the country having bread and sausage in his pocket he sat for long hours among the cypress trees of tuscany and never had any trees seemed so like ghosts like soft strange pregnant presences he lay and watched tall cypresses breathing and communicating faintly moving and as it were walking in the small wind and his soul seemed to leave him and to go far away far back perhaps to where life was all different and time passed otherwise than time passes now as in clairvoyance he perceived it that our life is only a fragment of the shell of life that there has been and will be life human life such as we do not begin to conceive much that is life has passed away from men leaving us all mere bits in the dark mindful silence and inflection of the cypress trees lost races lost language lost human ways of feeling and of knowing men have known as we can no more know have felt as we can no more feel great liferealities gone into the darkness but the cypresses commemorate in the afternoon aaron felt the cypresses rising dark about him like so many high visitants from an old lost lost subtle world where men had the wonder of demons about them the aura of demons such as still clings to the cypresses in tuscany  all day he did not make up his mind what he was going to do his first impulse was never to see her again and this was his intention all day but as he went home in the tram he softened and thought nay that would not be fair for how had she treated him otherwise than generously  she had been generous and the other thing that he felt blasted afterwards which was his experience that was fate and not her fault so he must see her again he must not act like a churl but he would tell herhe would tell her that he was a married man and that though he had left his wife and though he had no dogma of fidelity still the years of marriage had made a married man of him and any other woman than his wife was a strange woman to him a violation i will tell her he said to himself that at the bottom of my heart i love lottie still and that i cant help it i believe that is true it isnt love perhaps but it is marriage i am married to lottie and that means i cant be married to another woman it isnt my nature and perhaps i cant bear to live with lottie now because i am married and not in love when a man is married he is not in love a husband is not a lover lilly told me that and i know its true now lilly told me that a husband cannot be a lover and a lover cannot be a husband and that women will only have lovers now and never a husband well i am a husband if i am anything and i shall never be a lover again not while i live no not to anybody i havent it in me im a husband and so it is finished with me as a lover i cant be a lover any more just as i cant be aged twenty any more i am a man now not an adolescent and to my sorrow i am a husband to a woman who wants a lover always a lover but all women want lovers and i cant be it any more i dont want to i have finished that finished for ever unless i become senile  therefore next day he gathered up his courage he would not have had courage unless he had known that he was not alone the other man was in the town and from this fact he derived his strength the fact that lilly was there so at teatime he went over the river and rang at her door yes she was at home and she had other visitors she was wearing a beautiful soft afternoon dress again of a blue like chicoryflowers a pale warm blue and she had cornflowers in her belt heaven knows where she had got them  she greeted aaron with some of the childish shyness he could tell that she was glad he had come and that she had wondered at his not coming sooner she introduced him to her visitors two young ladies and one old lady and one elderly italian count the conversation was mostly in french or italian so aaron was rather out of it  however the visitors left fairly early so aaron stayed them out when they had gone he asked  where is manfredi  he will come in soon at about seven oclock  then there was a silence again  you are dressed fine today he said to her  am i she smiled  he was never able to make out quite what she felt what she was feeling but she had a quiet little air of proprietorship in him which he did not like  you will stay to dinner tonight wont you she said  nonot tonight he said and then awkwardly he added you know i think it is better if we are friendsnot lovers you knowi dont feel free i feel my wife i suppose somewhere inside me and i cant help it  she bent her head and was silent for some moments then she lifted her face and looked at him oddly  yes she said i am sure you love your wife  the reply rather staggered himand to tell the truth annoyed him  well he said i dont know about love but when one has been married for ten yearsand i did love herthensome sort of bond or something grows i think some sort of connection grows between us you know and it isnt natural quite to break itdo you know what i mean  she paused a moment then very softly almost gently she said  yes i do i know so well what you mean  he was really surprised at her soft acquiescence what did she mean  but we can be friends cant we he said  yes i hope so why yes goodness yes i should be sorry if we couldnt be friends  after which speech he felt that everything was all righteverything was aone and when manfredi came home the first sound he heard was the flute and his wifes singing  im so glad youve come his wife said to him shall we go into the sala and have real music will you play  i should love to replied the husband  behold them then in the big drawingroom and aaron and the marchese practising together and the marchesa singing an italian folksong while her husband accompanied her on the pianoforte but her singing was rather strained and forced still they were quite a little family and it seemed quite nice as soon as she could the marchesa left the two men together whilst she sat apart aaron and manfredi went through old italian and old german music tried one thing and then another and seemed quite like brothers they arranged a piece which they should play together on a saturday morning eight days hence  the next day saturday aaron went to one of the del torre music mornings there was a string quartetteand a violin soloistand the marchese at the piano the audience some dozen or fourteen friends sat at the near end of the room or in the smaller salotta whilst the musicians performed at the further end of the room the lillys were there both tanny and her husband but apart from these aaron knew nobody and felt uncomfortable the marchesa gave her guests little sandwiches and glasses of wine or marsala or vermouth as they chose and she was quite the hostess the wellbred and very simple but still the conventional hostess aaron did not like it and he could see that lilly too was unhappy in fact the little man bolted the moment he could dragging after him the indignant tanny who was so looking forward to the excellent little sandwiches but nolilly just rudely bolted aaron followed as soon as he could  will you come to dinner tomorrow evening said his hostess to him as he was leaving and he agreed he had really resented seeing her as a conventional hostess attending so charmingly to all the other people and treating him so merely as one of the guests among many others so that when at the last moment she quietly invited him to dinner next day he was flattered and accepted at once  the next day was sundaythe seventh day after his coming together with the marchesawhich had taken place on the monday and already he was feeling much less dramatic in his decision to keep himself apart from her to be merely friends already the memory of the last time was fanning up in him not as a warning but as a terrible incitement again the naked desire was getting hold of him with that peculiar brutal powerfulness which startled him and also pleased him  so that by the time sunday morning came his recoil had exhausted itself and he was ready again eager again but more wary this time he sat in his room alone in the morning playing his flute playing over from memory the tunes she loved and imagining how he and she would get into unison in the evening his flute his aarons rod would blossom once again with splendid scarlet flowers the red florentine lilies it was curious the passion he had for her just unalloyed desire and nothing else something he had not known in his life before previously there had been always some personal quality some sort of personal tenderness but here none she did not seem to want it she seemed to hate it indeed no all he felt was stark naked desire without a single pretension true enough his last experience had been a warning to him his desire and himself likewise had broken rather disastrously under the proving but not finally broken he was ready again and with all the sheer powerful insolence of desire he looked forward to the evening for he almost expected manfredi would not be there the officer had said something about having to go to padua on the saturday afternoon  so aaron went skipping off to his appointment at seven oclock judge of his chagrin then when he found already seated in the salotta an elderly quite wellknown very cultured and very wellconnected english authoress she was charming in her white hair and dress of soft white wool and white lace with a long chain of filigree gold beads like bubbles she was charming in her oldfashioned manner too as if the world were still safe and stable like a garden in which delightful culture and choice ideas bloomed safe from wind and weather alas never was aaron more conscious of the crude collapse in the world than when he listened to this animated youngseeming lady from the safe days of the seventies all the old culture and choice ideas seemed like blowing bubbles and dear old corinna wade she seemed to be blowing bubbles still as she sat there so charming in her soft white dress and talked with her bright animation about the influence of woman in parliament and the influence of woman in the periclean day aaron listened spellbound watching the bubbles float round his head and almost hearing them go pop  to complete the party arrived an elderly litterateur who was more proud of his notveryimportant social standing than of his literature in fact he was one of those english snobs of the old order living abroad perfectly well dressed for the evening his grey hair and his prim face was the most welldressed thing to be met in north italy  oh so glad to see you mr french i didnt know you were in florence again you make that journey from venice so often i wonder you dont get tired of it cried corinna wade  no he said so long as duty to england calls me to florence i shall come to florence but i can live in no town but venice  no i suppose you cant well there is something special about venice having no streets and no carriages and moving about in a gondola i suppose it is all much more soothing  much less nerveracking yes and then there is a quality in the whole life of course i see few english people in veniceonly the old venetian families as a rule  ah yes that must be very interesting they are very exclusive still the venetian noblesse said miss wade  oh very exclusive said mr french that is one of the charms venice is really altogether exclusive it excludes the world really and defies time and modern movement yes in spite of the steamers on the canal and the tourists  that is so that is so venice is a strange backwater and the old families are very proud still in these democratic days they have a great opinion of themselves i am told  well said mr french perhaps you know the rhyme                       veneziano gran signore                      padovano buon dotore                      vicenzese mangia il gatto                      veronese tutto matto  how very amusing said miss wade veneziana gran signore the venetian is a great gentleman yes i know they are all convinced of it really how very amusing in these advanced days to be born a venetian is to be born a great gentleman but this outdoes divine right of king  to be born a venetian gentleman is to be born a great gentleman said mr french rather fussily  you seriously think so said miss wade well now what do you base your opinion on  mr french gave various bases for his opinion  yesinteresting very interesting rather like the byzantineslingering on into far other ages anna comnena always charmed me very much how she despised the flower of the northeven tancred and so the lingering venetian families and you in your palazzo on the grand canal you are a northern barbarian civilised into the old venetian signoria but how very romantic a situation  it was really amusing to see the old maid how she skirmished and hit out gaily like an old jaunty free lance and to see the old bachelor how prim he was and nervy and fussy and precious like an old maid  but need we say that mr aaron felt very much out of it he sat and listened with a sardonic small smile on his face and a sardonic gleam in his blue eyes that looked so very blue on such an occasion he made the two elderly people uncomfortable with his silence his democratic silence miss wade might have said  however miss wade lived out towards galuzzo so she rose early to catch her tram and mr french gallantly and properly rose to accompany her to see her safe on board which left aaron and the marchesa alone  what time is manfredi coming back said he  tomorrow replied she  there was a pause  why do you have those people he asked  who  those two who were here this evening  miss wade and mr frenchoh i like miss wade so very much she is so refreshing  those old people said aaron they licked the sugar off the pill and go on as if everything was toffee and weve got to swallow the pill its easy to be refreshing  no dont say anything against her i like her so much  and him  mr frenchwell hes perhaps a little like the princess who felt the pea through three featherbeds but he can be quite witty and an excellent conversationalist too oh yes i like him quite well  matter of taste said aaron  they had not much to say to one another the time passed in the pauses he looked at his watch  i shall have to go he said  wont you stay she said in a small muted voice  stay all night he said  wont you  yes he said quietly did he not feel the strength of his desire on him  after which she said no more only she offered him whiskey and soda which he accepted  go then he said to her and ill come to youshall i come in fifteen minutes  she looked at him with strange slow dark eyes and he could not understand  yes she said and she went  and again this night as before she seemed strangely small and clinging in his arms and this night he felt his passion drawn from him as if a long live nerve were drawn out from his body a long live thread of electric fire a long living nerve finely extracted from him from the very roots of his soul a long fine discharge of pure bluish fire from the core of his soul it was an excruciating but also an intensely gratifying sensation  this night he slept with a deeper obliviousness than before but ah as it grew towards morning how he wished he could be alone  they must stay together till the day was light and she seemed to love clinging to him and curling strangely on his breast he could never reconcile it with her who was a hostess entertaining her guests how could she now in a sort of little ecstasy curl herself and nestle herself on his aarons breast tangling his face all over with her hair he verily believed that this was what she really wanted of him to curl herself on his naked breast to make herself small small to feel his arms around her while he himself was remote silent in some way inaccessible this seemed almost to make her beside herself with gratification but why why was it because he was one of her own race and she as it were crept right home to him  he did not know he only knew it had nothing to do with him and that save out of complaisance he did not want it it simply blasted his own central life it simply blighted him  and she clung to him closer strange she was afraid of him afraid of him as of a fetish fetish afraid and fetishfascinated or was her fear only a delightful game of cat and mouse or was the fear genuine and the delight the greater a sort of sacrilege the fear and the dangerous sacrilegious power over that which she feared  in some way she was not afraid of him at all in some other way she used him as a mere magic implement used him with the most amazing priestesscraft himself the individual man which he was this she treated with an indifference that was startling to him  he forgot perhaps that this was how he had treated her his famous desire for her what had it been but this same attempt to strike a magic fire out of her for his own ecstasy they were playing the same game of fire in him however there was all the time something hard and reckless and defiant which stood apart she was absolutely gone in her own incantations she was absolutely gone like a priestess utterly involved in her terrible rites and he was part of the ritual only god and victim in one god and victim all the time god and victim when his aloof soul realised amid the welter of incantation how he was being usednot as himself but as something quite differentgod and victimthen he dilated with intense surprise and his remote soul stood up tall and knew itself alone he didnt want it not at all he knew he was apart and he looked back over the whole mystery of their lovecontact only his soul was apart  he was aware of the strength and beauty and godlikeness that his breast was then to herthe magic but himself he stood far off like moses sister miriam she would drink the one drop of his innermost hearts blood and he would be carrion as cleopatra killed her lovers in the morning surely they knew that death was their just climax they had approached the climax accept then  but his soul stood apart and could have nothing to do with it if he had really been tempted he would have gone on and she might have had his central hearts blood yes and thrown away the carrion he would have been willing  but fatally he was not tempted his soul stood apart and decided at the bottom of his soul he disliked her or if not her then her whole motive her whole lifemode he was neither god nor victim neither greater nor less than himself his soul in its isolation as she lay on his breast chose it so with the souls inevitability so there was no temptation  when it was sufficiently light he kissed her and left her quietly he left the silent flat he had some difficulty in unfastening the various locks and bars and catches of the massive door downstairs and began in irritation and anger to feel he was a prisoner that he was locked in but suddenly the ponderous door came loose and he was out in the street the door shut heavily behind him with a shudder he was out in the morning streets of florence     chapter xx the broken rod   the day was rainy aaron stayed indoors alone and copied music and slept he felt the same stunned withered feeling as before but less intensely less disastrously this time he knew now without argument or thought that he would never go again to the marchesa not as a lover he would go away from it all he did not dislike her but he would never see her again a great gulf had opened leaving him alone on the far side  he did not go out till after dinner when he got downstairs he found the heavy nightdoor closed he wondered then remembered the signorinas fear of riots and disturbances as again he fumbled with the catches he felt that the doors of florence were trying to prevent his egress however he got out  it was a very dark night about nine oclock and deserted seeming he was struck by the strange deserted feeling of the citys atmosphere yet he noticed before him at the foot of the statue three men one with a torch a long torch with naked flames the men were stooping over something dark the man with the torch bending forward too it was a dark weird little group like mediaeval florence aaron lingered on his doorstep watching he could not see what they were doing but now the two were crouching down over a long dark object on the ground and the one with the torch bending also to look what was it they were just at the foot of the statue a dark little group under the big pediment the torchflames weirdly flickering as the torchbearer moved and stooped lower to the two crouching men who seemed to be kneeling  aaron felt his blood stir there was something dark and mysterious stealthy in the little scene it was obvious the men did not want to draw attention they were so quiet and furtiveseeming and an eerie instinct prevented aarons going nearer to look instead he swerved on to the lungarno and went along the top of the square avoiding the little group in the centre he walked the deserted darkseeming street by the river then turned inwards into the city he was going to the piazza vittoria emmanuele to sit in the cafe which is the centre of florence at night there he could sit for an hour and drink his vermouth and watch the florentines  as he went along one of the dark rather narrow streets he heard a hurrying of feet behind him glancing round he saw the torchbearer coming along at a trot holding his flaming torch up in front of him as he trotted down the middle of the narrow dark street aaron shrank under the wall the trotting torchbearer drew near and now aaron perceived the other two men slowly trotting behind stealthily bearing a stretcher on which a body was wrapped up completely and darkly covered the torchbearer passed the men with the stretcher passed too hastily and stealthily the flickering flames revealing them they took no notice of aaron no notice of anything but trotted softly on towards the centre of the city their queer quick footsteps echoed down the distance then aaron too resumed his way  he came to the large brilliantlylighted cafe it was sunday evening and the place was full men florentines many many men sat in groups and in twos and threes at the little marble tables they were mostly in dark clothes or black overcoats they had mostly been drinking just a cup of coffeeothers however had glasses of wine or liquor but mostly it was just a little coffeetray with a tiny coffee pot and a cup and saucer there was a faint film of tobacco smoke and the men were all talking talking talking with that peculiar intensity of the florentines aaron felt the intense compressed sound of many halfsecret voices for the little groups and couples abated their voices none wished that others should hear what they said  aaron was looking for a seatthere was no table to himwhen suddenly someone took him by the arm it was argyle  come along now come and join us here this way come along  aaron let himself be led away towards a corner there sat lilly and a strange man called levison the room was warm aaron could never bear to be too hot after sitting a minute he rose and took off his coat and hung it on a stand near the window as he did so he felt the weight of his fluteit was still in his pocket and he wondered if it was safe to leave it  i suppose no one will steal from the overcoat pockets he said as he sat down  my dear chap theyd steal the gold filling out of your teeth if you happened to yawn said argyle why have you left valuables in your overcoat  my flute said aaron  oh they wont steal that said argyle  besides said lilly we should see anyone who touched it  and so they settled down to the vermouth  well said argyle what have you been doing with yourself eh i havent seen a glimpse of you for a week been going to the dogs eh  or the bitches said aaron  oh but look here thats bad thats bad i can see i shall have to take you in hand and commence my work of reform oh im a great reformer a zwingli and savonarola in one i couldnt count the number of people ive led into the right way it takes some finding you know strait is the gatedamned strait sometimes a damned tight squeeze argyle was somewhat intoxicated he spoke with a slight slur and laughed really tickled at his own jokes the man levison smiled acquiescent but lilly was not listening his brow was heavy and he seemed abstracted he hardly noticed aarons arrival  did you see the row yesterday asked levison  no said aaron what was it  it was the socialists they were making a demonstration against the imprisonment of one of the railwaystrikers i was there they went on all right with a good bit of howling and gibing a lot of young louts you know and the shopkeepers shut up shop and nobody showed the italian flag of course well when they came to the via benedetto croce there were a few mounted carabinieri so they stopped the procession and the sergeant said that the crowd could continue could go on where they liked but would they not go down the via verrocchio because it was being repaired the roadway was all up and there were piles of cobble stones these might prove a temptation and lead to trouble so would the demonstrators not take that roadthey might take any other they likedwell the very moment he had finished there was a revolver shot he made a noise and fell forward over his horses nose one of the anarchists had shot him then there was hell let loose the carabinieri fired back and people were bolting and fighting like devils i cleared out myself but my godwhat do you think of it  seems pretty mean said aaron  meanhe had just spoken them fairthey could go where they liked only would they not go down the one road because of the heap of stones and they let him finish and then shot him dead  was he dead said aaron  yeskilled outright the nazione says  there was a silence the drinkers in the cafe all continued to talk vehemently casting uneasy glances  well said argyle if you let loose the dogs of war you mustnt expect them to come to heel again in five minutes  but theres no fair play about it not a bit said levison  ah my dear fellow are you still so young and callow that you cherish the illusion of fair play said argyle  yes i am said levison  live longer and grow wiser said argyle rather contemptuously  are you a socialist asked levison  am i my aunt tabithas dachshund bitch called bella said argyle in his musical indifferent voice yes bellas her name and if you can tell me a damneder name for a dog i shall listen i assure you attentively  but you havent got an aunt called tabitha said aaron  havent i oh havent i ive got two aunts called tabitha if not more  they arent of any vital importance to you are they said levison  not the very least in the worldif it hadnt been that my elder aunt tabitha had christened her dachshund bitch bella i cut myself off from the family after that oh i turned over a new leaf with not a family name on it couldnt stand bella amongst the rest  you must have strained most of the gnats out of your drink argyle said lilly laughing  assiduously assiduously i cant stand these little vermin oh i am quite indifferent about swallowing a camel or twoor even a whole string of dromedaries how charmingly eastern that sounds but gnats not for anything in the world would i swallow one  youre a bit of a socialist though arent you persisted levison now turning to lilly  no said lilly i was  and am no more said argyle sarcastically my dear fellow the only hope of salvation for the world lies in the reinstitution of slavery  what kind of slavery asked levison  slavery slavery when i say slavery i dont mean any of your damned modern reform cant i mean solid sound slavery on which the greek and the roman world rested far finer worlds than ours my dear chap oh far finer and cant be done without slavery simply cant be doneoh theyll all come to realise it when theyve had a bit more of this democratic washerwomen business  levison was laughing with a slight sneer down his nose anyhow theres no immediate dangeror hope if you prefer itof the reinstituting of classic slavery he said  unfortunately no we are all such fools said argyle  besides said levison who would you make slaves of  everybody my dear chap beginning with the idealists and the theorising jews and after them your nicelybred gentlemen and then perhaps your profiteers and rothschilds and all politicians and ending up with the proletariat said argyle  then who would be the mastersthe professional classes doctors and lawyers and so on  what masters they would be the sewerage slaves as being those who had made most smells there was a moments silence  the only fault i have to find with your system said levison rather acidly is that there would be only one master and everybody else slaves  do you call that a fault what do you want with more than one master are you asking for severalwell perhaps theres cunning in thatcunning devils cunning devils these theorising slaves and argyle pushed his face with a devilish leer into aarons face cunning devils he reiterated with a slight tipsy slur that befouled epictetus wasnt the last of emnor the first oh not by any means not by any means  here lilly could not avoid a slight spasm of amusement but returning to serious conversation said levison turning his rather sallow face to lilly i think youll agree with me that socialism is the inevitable next step  lilly waited for some time without answering then he said with unwilling attention to the question i suppose its the logically inevitable next step  use logic as lavatory paper cried argyle harshly yeslogically inevitableand humanly inevitable at the same time some form of socialism is bound to come no matter how you postpone it or try variations said levison  all right let it come said lilly its not my affair neither to help it nor to keep it back or even to try varying it  there i dont follow you said levison suppose you were in russia now  i watch it im not  but youre in italy which isnt far off supposing a socialist revolution takes place all around you wont that force the problem on youit is every mans problem persisted levison  not mine said lilly  how shall you escape it said levison  because to me it is no problem to bolsh or not to bolsh as far as my mind goes presents no problem not any more than to be or not to be to be or not to be is simply no problem  no i quite agree that since you are already existing and since death is ultimately inevitable to be or not to be is no sound problem said levison but the parallel isnt true of socialism that is not a problem of existence but of a certain mode of existence which centuries of thought and action on the part of europe have now made logically inevitable for europe and therefore there is a problem there is more than a problem there is a dilemma either we must go to the logical conclusionor  somewhere else said lilly  yesyes precisely but where else thats the one half of the problem supposing you do not agree to a logical progression in human social activity because after all human society through the course of ages only enacts spasmodically but still inevitably the logical development of a given idea  well then i tell youthe idea and the ideal has for me gone deaddead as carrion  which idea which ideal precisely  the ideal of love the ideal that it is better to give than to receive the ideal of liberty the ideal of the brotherhood of man the ideal of the sanctity of human life the ideal of what we call goodness charity benevolence public spiritedness the ideal of sacrifice for a cause the ideal of unity and unanimityall the lotall the whole beehive of idealshas all got the modern beedisease and gone putrid stinkingand when the ideal is dead and putrid the logical sequence is only stinkwhich for me is the truth concerning the ideal of good peaceful loving humanity and its logical sequence in socialism and equality equal opportunity or whatever you likebut this time he stinkethand im sorry for any christus who brings him to life again to stink livingly for another thirty years the beastly lazarus of our idealism  that may be true for you  but its true for nobody else said lilly all the worse for them let them die of the beedisease  not only that persisted levison but what is your alternative is it merely nihilism  my alternative said lilly is an alternative for no one but myself so ill keep my mouth shut about it  that isnt fair  i tell you the ideal of fairness stinks with the resti have no obligation to say what i think  yes if you enter into conversation you have  bah then i didnt enter into conversationthe only thing is i agree in the rough with argyle youve got to have a sort of slavery again people are not men they are insects and instruments and their destiny is slavery they are too many for me and so what i think is ineffectual but ultimately they will be brought to agreeafter sufficient exterminationand then they will elect for themselves a proper and healthy and energetic slavery  i should like to know what you mean by slavery because to me it is impossible that slavery should be healthy and energetic you seem to have some other idea in your mind and you merely use the word slavery out of exasperation  i mean it none the less i mean a real committal of the lifeissue of inferior beings to the responsibility of a superior being  itll take a bit of knowing who are the inferior and which is the superior said levison sarcastically  not a bit it is written between a mans brows which he is  im afraid we shall all read differently  so long as were liars  and putting that question aside i presume that you mean that this committal of the lifeissue of inferior beings to someone higher shall be made voluntarilya sort of voluntary selfgift of the inferiors  yesmore or lessand a voluntary acceptance for its no pretty gift after allbut once made it must be held fast by genuine power oh yesno playing and fooling about with it permanent and very efficacious power  you mean military power  i do of course  here levison smiled a long slow subtle smile of ridicule it all seemed to him the preposterous pretentiousness of a megalomaniacone whom after a while humanity would probably have the satisfaction of putting into prison or into a lunatic asylum and levison felt strong overwhelmingly strong in the huge social power with which he insignificant as he was was armed against such criminalimbecile pretensions as those above set forth prison or the lunatic asylum the face of the fellow gloated in these two inevitable engines of his disapproval  it will take you some time before youll get your doctrines accepted he said  accepted id be sorry i dont want a lot of swine snouting and sniffing at me with their acceptancebah levisonone can easily make a fool of you do you take this as my gospel  i take it you are speaking seriously  here lilly broke into that peculiar gay whimsical smile  but i should say the blank opposite with just as much fervour he declared  do you mean to say you dont mean what youve been saying said levison now really looking angry  why ill tell you the real truth said lilly i think every man is a sacred and holy individual never to be violated i think there is only one thing i hate to the verge of madness and that is bullying to see any living creature bullied in any way almost makes a murderer of me that is true do you believe it  yes said levison unwillingly that may be true as well you have no doubt like most of us got a complex nature which  c r a s h  there intervened one awful minute of pure shock when the soul was in darkness  out of this shock aaron felt himself issuing amid a mass of terrible sensations the fearful blow of the explosion the noise of glass the hoarse howl of people the rushing of men the sudden gulf the awful gulfing whirlpool of horror in the social life  he stood in agony and semiblindness amid a chaos then as he began to recover his consciousness he found himself standing by a pillar some distance from where he had been sitting he saw a place where tables and chairs were all upside down legs in the air amid debris of glass and breakage he saw the cafe almost empty nearly everybody gone he saw the owner or the manager advancing aghast to the place of debris he saw lilly standing not far off white as a sheet and as if unconscious and still he had no idea of what had happened he thought perhaps something had broken down he could not understand  lilly began to look round he caught aarons eye and then aaron began to approach his friend  what is it he asked  a bomb said lilly  the manager and one old waiter and three or four youths had now advanced to the place of debris and now aaron saw that a man was lying thereand horror blood was running across the floor of the cafe men began now hastily to return to the place some seized their hats and departed again at once but many began to crowd ina black eager crowd of men pressing to where the bomb had burstwhere the man was lying it was rather dark some of the lamps were brokenbut enough still shone men surged in with that eager excited zest of people when there has been an accident grey carabinieri and carabinieri in the cocked hat and fine sunday uniform pressed forward officiously  let us go said lilly  and he went to the far corner where his hat hung but aaron looked in vain for his own hat the bomb had fallen near the stand where he had hung it and his overcoat  my hat and coat he said to lilly  lilly not very tall stood on tiptoe then he climbed on a chair and looked round then he squeezed past the crowd  aaron followed on the other side of the crowd excited angry men were wrestling over overcoats that were mixed up with a broken marble tabletop aaron spied his own black hat under the sofa near the wall he waited his turn and then in the confusion pressed forward to where the coats were someone had dragged out his and it lay on the floor under many feet he managed with a struggle to get it from under the feet of the crowd he felt at once for his flute but his trampled torn coat had no flute in its pocket he pushed and struggled caught sight of a section and picked it up but it was split right down two silver stops were torn out and a long thin spelch of wood was curiously torn off he looked at it and his heart stood still no need to look for the rest  he felt utterly utterly overcomeas if he didnt care what became of him any further he didnt care whether he were hit by a bomb or whether he himself threw the next bomb and hit somebody he just didnt care any more about anything in life or death it was as if the reins of his life slipped from his hands and he would let everything run where it would so long as it did run  then he became aware of lillys eyes on himand automatically he joined the little man  let us go said lilly  and they pushed their way through the door the police were just marching across the square aaron and lilly walked in the opposite direction groups of people were watching suddenly lilly swervedin the middle of the road was a large black glisten of blood trickling horribly a wounded man had run from the blow and fallen here  aaron did not know where he was going but in the via tournabuoni lilly turned towards the arno and soon they were on the ponte santa trinita  who threw the bomb said aaron  i suppose an anarchist  its all the same said aaron  the two men as if unable to walk any further leaned on the broad parapet of the bridge and looked at the water in the darkness of the still deserted night aaron still had his flute section in his hand his overcoat over his arm  is that your flute asked lilly  bit of it smashed  let me look  he looked and gave it back  no good he said  oh no said aaron  throw it in the river aaron said lilly  aaron turned and looked at him  throw it in the river repeated lilly its an end  aaron nervelessly dropped the flute into the stream the two men stood leaning on the bridgeparapet as if unable to move  we shall have to go home said lilly tanny may hear of it and be anxious  aaron was quite dumbfounded by the nights event the loss of his flute here was a blow he had not expected and the loss was for him symbolistic it chimed with something in his soul the bomb the smashed flute the end  there goes aarons rod then he said to lilly  itll grow again its a reed a waterplantyou cant kill it said lilly unheeding  and me  youll have to live without a rod meanwhile  to which pleasant remark aaron made no reply     chapter xxi words   he went home to bed and dreamed a strange dream he dreamed that he was in a country with which he was not acquainted night was coming on and he had nowhere to sleep so he passed the mouth of a sort of cave or house in which a woman an old woman sat therefore he entered and though he could not understand the language still his second self understood the cave was a house and men came home from work his second self assumed that they were tinminers  he wandered uneasily to and fro no one taking any particular notice of him and he realized that there was a whole vast country spreading a sort of underworld country spreading away beyond him he wandered from vast apartment to apartment down narrow corridors like the roads in a mine in one of the great square rooms the men were going to eat and it seemed to him that what they were going to eat was a man naked man but his second self knew that what appeared to his eyes as a man was really a mans skin stuffed tight with prepared meat as the skin of a bologna sausage this did not prevent his seeing the naked man who was to be eaten walk slowly and stiffly across the gangway and down the corridor he saw him from behind it was a big handsome man in the prime of life quite naked and perhaps stupid but of course he was only a skin stuffed with meat whom the grey tinminers were going to eat  aaron the dreamaaron turned another way and strayed along the vast square rooms cavern apartments he came into one room where there were many children all in white gowns and they were all busily putting themselves to bed in the many beds scattered about the room at haphazard and each child went to bed with a wreath of flowers on its head white flowers and pink so it seemed so there they all lay in their flowercrowns in the vast space of the rooms and aaron went away  he could not remember the following part only he seemed to have passed through many grey domestic apartments where were all women all greyish in their clothes and appearance being wives of the underground tinminers the men were away and the dreamaaron remembered with fear the food they were to eat  the next thing he could recall was that he was in a boat and now he was most definitely two people his invisible conscious self what we have called his second self hovered as it were before the prow of the boat seeing and knowing but unseen his other self the palpable aaron sat as a passenger in the boat which was being rowed by the unknown people of this underworld they stood up as they thrust the boat along other passengers were in the boat too women as well but all of them unknown people and not noticeable  the boat was upon a great lake in the underworld country a lake of dark blue water but crystal clear and very beautiful in colour the second or invisible aaron sat in the prow and watched the fishes swimming suspended in the clear beautiful darkblue water some were pale fish some frighteninglooking like centipedes swimming and some were dark fish of definite form and delightful to watch  the palpable or visible aaron sat at the side of the boat on the end of the middle seat with his naked right elbow leaning out over the side and now the boat entered upon shallows the impalpable aaron in the bows saw the whitish clay of the bottom swirl up in clouds at each thrust of the oars whitishclayey clouds which would envelope the strange fishes in a sudden mist and on the right hand of the course stakes stood up in the water at intervals to mark the course  the boat must pass very near these stakes almost touching and aarons naked elbow was leaning right over the side as they approached the first stake the boatmen all uttered a strange cry of warning in a foreign language the fleshandblood aaron seemed not even to hear the invisible aaron heard but did not comprehend the words of the cry  so the naked elbow struck smartly against the stake as the boat passed  the rowers rowed on and still the fleshandblood aaron sat with his arm over the side another stake was nearing will he heed will he heed thought the anxious second self the rowers gave the strange warning cry he did not heed and again the elbow struck against the stake as the boat passed and yet the fleshandblood aaron sat on and made no sign there were stakes all along this shallow part of the lake beyond was deep water again the invisible aaron was becoming anxious will he never hear will he never heed will he never understand he thought and he watched in pain for the next stake but still the fleshandblood aaron sat on and though the rowers cried so acutely that the invisible aaron almost understood their very language still the aaron seated at the side heard nothing and his elbow struck against the third stake  this was almost too much but after a few moments as the boat rowed on the palpable aaron changed his position as he sat and drew in his arm though even now he was not aware of any need to do so the invisible aaron breathed with relief in the bows the boat swung steadily on into the deep unfathomable water again  they were drawing near a city a lakecity like mexico they must have reached a city because when aaron woke up and tried to piece together the dream of which these are mere fragments he could remember having just seen an idol an astarte he knew it as seated by the road and in her open lap were some eggs smallish hens eggs and one or two bigger eggs like swans and one single little roll of bread these lay in the lap of the roadside astarte and then he could remember no more  he woke and for a minute tried to remember what he had been dreaming and what it all meant but he quickly relinquished the effort so he looked at his watch it was only halfpast three he had one of those american watches with luminous phosphorescent figures and fingers and tonight he felt afraid of its eerily shining face  he was awake a long time in the darkfor two hours thinking and not thinking in that barren state which is not sleep nor yet full wakefulness and which is a painful strain at length he went to sleep again and did not wake till past eight oclock he did not ring for his coffee till nine  outside was a bright daybut he hardly heeded it he lay profitlessly thinking with the breaking of the flute that which was slowly breaking had finally shattered at last and there was nothing ahead no plan no prospect he knew quite well that people would help him francis dekker or angus guest or the marchese or lilly they would get him a new flute and find him engagements but what was the good his flute was broken and broken finally the bomb had settled it the bomb had settled it and everything it was an end no matter how he tried to patch things up the only thing he felt was a thread of destiny attaching him to lilly the rest had all gone as bare and bald as the dead orb of the moon so he made up his mind if he could to make some plan that would bring his life together with that of his evanescent friend  lilly was a peculiar bird clever and attractive as he undoubtedly was he was perhaps the most objectionable person to know it was stamped on his peculiar face aaron thought of lillys dark ugly face which had something that lurked in it as a creature under leaves then he thought of the wideapart eyes with their curious candour and surety the peculiar halfveiled surety as if nothing nothing could overcome him it made people angry this look of silent indifferent assurance nothing can touch him on the quick nothing can really get at him they felt at last and they felt it with resentment almost with hate they wanted to be able to get at him for he was so openseeming so very outspoken he gave himself away so much and he had no money to fall back on yet he gave himself away so easily paid such attention almost deference to any chance friend so they all thought here is a wise person who finds me the wonder which i really amand lo and behold after he had given them the trial and found their inevitable limitations he departed and ceased to heed their wonderful existence which to say the least of it was fraudulent and damnable it was then after his departure that they realised his basic indifference to them and his silent arrogance a silent arrogance that knew all their wisdom and left them to it  aaron had been through it all he had started by thinking lilly a peculiar little freak gone on to think him a wonderful chap and a bit pathetic progressed and found him generous but overbearing then cruel and intolerant allowing no man to have a soul of his own then terribly arrogant throwing a fellow aside like an old glove which is in holes at the fingerends and all the time which was most beastly seeing through one all the time freak and outsider as he was lilly knew he knew and his soul was against the whole world  driven to bay and forced to choose forced to choose not between life and death but between the world and the uncertain assertive lilly forced to choose and yet in the world having nothing left to choose for in the world there was nothing left to choose unless he would give in and try for success aaron knew well enough that if he liked to do a bit of buttering people would gladly make a success of him and give him money and success he could become quite a favourite  but no if he had to give in to something if he really had to give in and it seemed he had then he would rather give in to the little lilly than to the beastly people of the world if he had to give in then it should be to no woman and to no social ideal and to no social institution noif he had to yield his wilful independence and give himself then he would rather give himself to the little individual man than to any of the rest for to tell the truth in the man was something incomprehensible which had dominion over him if he chose to allow it  as he lay pondering this over escaping from the cul de sac in which he had been running for so long by yielding to one of his pursuers yielding to the peculiar mastery of one mans nature rather than to the quicksands of woman or the stinking bogs of society yielding since yield he must in some direction or other yielding in a new direction now to one strange and incalculable little individual as aaron lay so relaxing finding a peculiar delight in giving his soul to his minds hero the selfsame hero tapped and entered  i wondered he said if youd like to walk into the country with me it is such a nice day i thought you might have gone out already but here you are in bed like a woman whos had a babyyoure all right are you  yes said aaron im all right  miserable about your fluteah well there are more flutes get up then and lilly went to the window and stood looking out at the river  were going away on thursday he said  where to said aaron  naples weve got a little house there for the winterin the country not far from sorrentoi must get a bit of work done now the winter is coming and forget all about everything and just live with life whats the good of running after life when weve got it in us if nobody prevents us and obstructs us  aaron felt very queer  but for how long will you settle down he asked  oh only the winter i am a vagrant really or a migrant i must migrate do you think a cuckoo in africa and a cuckoo in essex is one and the same bird anyhow i know i must oscillate between north and south so oscillate i do its just my nature all people dont have the same needs  perhaps not said aaron who had risen and was sitting on the side of the bed  i would very much like to try life in another continent among another race i feel europe becoming like a cage to me europe may be all right in herself but i find myself chafing another year i shall get out i shall leave europe i begin to feel caged  i guess there are others that feel caged as well as you said aaron  i guess there are  and maybe they havent a chance to get out  lilly was silent a moment then he said  well i didnt make life and society i can only go my own way  aaron too was silent a deep disappointment was settling over his spirit  will you be alone all winter  just myself and tanny he answered but people always turn up  and then next year what will you do  who knows i may sail far off i should like to i should like to try quite a new lifemode this is finished in meand yet perhaps it is absurd to go further im rather sick of seekers i hate a seeker  what said aaron rather sarcasticallythose who are looking for a new religion  religionand loveand all that its a disease now  oh i dont know said aaron perhaps the lack of love and religion is the disease  ahbah the grinding the old millstones of love and god is what ails us when theres no more grist between the stones weve ground love very small time to forget it forget the very words religion and god and lovethen have a shot at a new mode but the very words rivet us down and dont let us move rivets and we cant get them out  and where should we be if we could said aaron  we might begin to be ourselves anyhow  and what does that mean said aaron being yourselfwhat does it mean  to me everything  and to most folks nothing theyve got to have a goal  there is no goal i loathe goals more than any other impertinence gaols they are bahjails and jailers gaols and gaolers  wherever you go youll find people with their noses tied to some goal said aaron  their wagon hitched to a starwhich goes round and round like an ass in a gin laughed lilly be damned to it  aaron got himself dressed and the two men went out took a tram and went into the country aaron could not help itlilly put his back up they came to a little inn near a bridge where a broad stream rustled bright and shallow it was a sunny warm day and aaron and lilly had a table outside under the thin trees at the top of the bank above the river the yellow leaves were fallingthe tuscan sky was turquoise blue in the stream below three naked boys still adventurously bathed and lay flat on the shingle in the sun a wagon with two pale loving velvety oxen drew slowly down the hill looking at each step as if they were going to come to rest to move no more but still they stepped forward till they came to the inn and there they stood at rest two old women were picking the last acorns under three scrubby oaktrees whilst a girl with bare feet drove her two goats and a sheep up from the waterside towards the women the girl wore a dress that had been blue perhaps indigo but which had faded to the beautiful lavenderpurple colour which is so common and which always reminded lilly of purple anemones in the south  the two friends sat in the sun and drank red wine it was midday from the thin square belfry on the opposite hill the bells had rung the old women and the girl squatted under the trees eating their bread and figs the boys were dressing fluttering into their shirts on the streams shingle a big girl went past with somebodys dinner tied in a red kerchief and perched on her head it was one of the most precious hours the hour of pause noon and the sun and the quiet acceptance of the world at such a time everything seems to fall into a true relationship after the strain of work and of urge  aaron looked at lilly and saw the same odd distant look on his face as on the face of some animal when it lies awake and alert yet perfectly at one with its surroundings it was something quite different from happiness an alert enjoyment of rest an intense and satisfying sense of centrality as a dog when it basks in the sun with one eye open and winking or a rabbit quite still and wideeyed with a faintlytwitching nose not passivity but alert enjoyment of being central lifecentral in ones own little circumambient world  they sat thus stillor lay under the treesfor an hour and a half then lilly paid the bill and went on  what am i going to do this winter do you think aaron asked  what do you want to do  nay thats what i want to know  do you want anything i mean does something drive you from inside  i cant just rest said aaron  cant you settle down to somethingto a job for instance  ive not found the job i could settle down to yet said aaron  why not  its just my nature  are you a seeker have you got a divine urge or need  how do i know laughed aaron perhaps ive got a damned urge at the bottom of me im sure its nothing divine  very well then now in life there are only two great dynamic urgesdo you believe me  how do i know laughed aaron do you want to be believed  no i dont care a straw only for your own sake youd better believe me  all right thenwhat about it  well then there are only two great dynamic urges in life love and power  love and power said aaron i dont see power as so very important  you dont see because you dont look but thats not the point what sort of urge is your urge is it the love urge  i dont know said aaron  yes you do you know that you have got an urge dont you  yes rather unwillingly aaron admitted it  well then what is it is it that you want to love or to be obeyed  a bit of both  all righta bit of both and what are you looking for in lovea woman whom you can love and who will love you out and out and all in all and happy ever after sort of thing  thats what i started out for perhaps laughed aaron  and now you know its all my eye aaron looked at lilly unwilling to admit it lilly began to laugh  you know it well enough he said its one of your lost illusions my boy well then what next is it a god youre after do you want a god you can strive to and attain through love and live happy ever after countless millions of eternities immortality and all that is this your little dodge  again aaron looked at lilly with that odd double look of mockery and unwillingness to give himself away  all right then youve got a loveurge that urges you to god have you then go and join the buddhists in burmah or the newest fangled christians in europe go and stick your head in a bush of nirvana or spiritual perfection trot off  i wont said aaron  you must if youve got a loveurge then give it its fulfilment  i havent got a loveurge  you have you want to get excited in love you want to be carried away in love you want to whoosh off in a nice little love whoosh and love yourself dont deny it i know you do you want passion to sweep you off on wings of fire till you surpass yourself and like the swooping eagle swoop right into the sun i know you my loveboy  not any morenot any more ive been had too often laughed aaron  bah its a lesson men never learn no matter how sick they make themselves with love they always rush for more like a dog to his vomit  well what am i to do then if im not to love cried aaron  you want to go on from passion to passion from ecstasy to ecstasy from triumph to triumph till you can whoosh away into glory beyond yourself all bonds loosened and happy ever after either that or nirvana opposite side of the medal  theres probably more hate than love in me said aaron  thats the recoil of the same urge the anarchist the criminal the murderer he is only the extreme lover acting on the recoil but it is love only in recoil it flies back the loveurge and becomes a horror  all right then im a criminal and a murderer said aaron  no youre not but youve a loveurge and perhaps on the recoil just now but listen to me its no good thinking the loveurge is the one and only niente you can whoosh if you like and get excited and carried away loving a woman or humanity or god swoop away in the love direction till you lose yourself but thats where youre had you cant lose yourself you can try but you might just as well try to swallow yourself youll only bite your fingers off in the attempt you cant lose yourself neither in woman nor humanity nor in god youve always got yourself on your hands in the end and a very raw and jaded and humiliated and nervousneurasthenic self it is too in the end a very nasty thing to wake up to is ones own raw self after an excessive lovewhoosh look even at president wilson he lovewhooshed for humanity and found in the end hed only got a very sorry self on his hands  so leave off leave off my boy leave off lovewhooshing you cant lose yourself so stop trying the responsibility is on your own shoulders all the time and no god which man has ever struck can take it off you are yourself and so be yourself stick to it and abide by it passion or no passion ecstasy or no ecstasy urge or no urge theres no goal outside you where you can consummate like an eagle flying into the sun or a moth into a candle theres no goal outside youand theres no god outside you no god whom you can get to and rest in none its a case of             trot trot to market to buy a penny bun            and trot trot back again as fast as you can run   but theres no god outside you whom you can rise to or sink to or swoop away to you cant even gum yourself to a divine nirvana moon because all the time youve got to eat your dinner and digest it there is no goal outside you none  there is only one thing your own very self so youd better stick to it you cant be any bigger than just yourself so you neednt drag god in youve got one job and no more there inside you lies your own very self like a germinating egg your precious easter egg of your own soul there it is developing bit by bit from one single eggcell which you were at your conception in your mothers womb on and on to the strange and peculiar complication in unity which never stops till you dieif then youve got an innermost integral unique self and since its the only thing you have got or ever will have dont go trying to lose it youve got to develop it from the egg into the chicken and from the chicken into the oneandonly phoenix of which there can only be one at a time in the universe there can only be one of you at a time in the universeand one of me so dont forget it your own single oneness is your destiny your destiny comes from within from your own selfform and you cant know it beforehand neither your destiny nor your selfform you can only develop it you can only stick to your own very self and never betray it and by so sticking you develop the one and only phoenix of your own self and you unfold your own destiny as a dandelion unfolds itself into a dandelion and not into a stick of celery  remember this my boy youve never got to deny the holy ghost which is inside you your own souls self never or youll catch it and youve never got to think youll dodge the responsibility of your own souls self by loving or sacrificing or nirvaningor even anarchising and throwing bombs you never will  aaron was silenced for a moment by this flood of words then he said smiling  so id better sit tight on my soul till it hatches had i  oh yes if your souls urge urges you to love then love but always know that what you are doing is the fulfilling of your own souls impulse its no good trying to act by prescription not a bit and its no use getting into frenzies if youve got to go in for love and passion go in for them but they arent the goal theyre a mere means a lifemeans if you will the only goal is the fulfilling of your own souls active desire and suggestion be passionate as much as ever it is your nature to be passionate and deeply sensual as far as you can be small souls have a small sensuality deep souls a deep one but remember all the time the responsibility is upon your own head it all rests with your own lonely soul the responsibility for your own action  i never said it didnt said aaron  you never said it did you never accepted you thought there was something outside to justify you god or a creed or a prescription but remember your soul inside you is your only godhead it develops your actions within you as a tree develops its own new cells and the cells push on into buds and boughs and flowers and these are your passion and your acts and your thoughts and expressions your developing consciousness you dont know beforehand and you cant you can only stick to your own soul through thick and thin  you are your own tree of life roots and limbs and trunk somewhere within the wholeness of the tree lies the very self the quick its own innate holy ghost and this holy ghost puts forth new buds and pushes past old limits and shakes off a whole body of dying leaves and the old limits hate being empassed and the old leaves hate to fall but they must if the treesoul says so  they had sat again during this harangue under a white wall aaron listened more to the voice than the words it was more the sound value which entered his soul the tone the strange speechmusic which sank into him the sense he hardly heeded and yet he understood he knew he understood oh so much more deeply than if he had listened with his head and he answered an objection from the bottom of his soul  but you talk he said as if we were like trees alone by ourselves in the world we arent if we love it needs another person than ourselves and if we hate and even if we talk  quite said lilly and thats just the point weve got to love and hate moreoverand even talk but we havent got to fix on any one of these modes and say thats the only mode it is such imbecility to say that love and love alone must rule it is so obviously not the case yet we try and make it so  i feel that said aaron its all a lie  its worse its a half lie but listen i told you there were two urgestwo great lifeurges didnt i there may be more but it comes on me so strongly now that there are two love and power and weve been trying to work ourselves at least as individuals from the loveurge exclusively hating the powerurge and repressing it and now i find weve got to accept the very thing weve hated  weve exhausted our loveurge for the moment and yet we try to force it to continue working so we get inevitably anarchy and murder its no good weve got to accept the power motive accept it in deep responsibility do you understand me it is a great life motive it was that great dark powerurge which kept egypt so intensely living for so many centuries it is a vast dark source of life and strength in us now waiting either to issue into true action or to burst into cataclysm powerthe powerurge the willtopowerbut not in nietzsches sense not intellectual power not mental power not conscious willpower not even wisdom but dark living fructifying power do you know what i mean  i dont know said aaron  take what you call love for example in the real way of love the positive aim is to make the other personor personshappy it devotes itself to the other or to others but change the mode let the urge be the urge of power then the great desire is not happiness neither of the beloved nor of oneself happiness is only one of many states and it is horrible to think of fixing us down to one state the urge of power does not seek for happiness any more than for any other state it urges from within darkly for the displacing of the old leaves the inception of the new it is powerful and selfcentral not seeking its centre outside in some god or some beloved but acting indomitably from within itself  and of course there must be one who urges and one who is impelled just as in love there is a beloved and a lover the man is supposed to be the lover the woman the beloved now in the urge of power it is the reverse the woman must submit but deeply deeply submit not to any foolish fixed authority not to any foolish and arbitrary will but to something deep deeper to the soul in its dark motion of power and pride we must reverse the poles the woman must now submitbut deeply deeply and richly no subservience none of that no slavery a deep unfathomable free submission  youll never get it said aaron  you will if you abandon the love idea and the love motive and if you stand apart and never bully never force from the conscious will thats where nietzsche was wrong his was the conscious and benevolent will in fact the lovewill but the deep powerurge is not conscious of its aims and it is certainly not consciously benevolent or lovedirectedwhatever else happens somewhere sometime the deep powerurge in man will have to issue forth again and woman will submit livingly not subjectedly  she never will persisted aaron anything else will happen but not that  she will said lilly once man disengages himself from the lovemode and stands clear once he stands clear and the other great urge begins to flow in him then the woman wont be able to resist her own soul will wish to yield itself  woman yield aaron reechoed  womanand man too yield to the deep powersoul in the individual man and obey implicitly i dont go back on what i said before i do believe that every man must fulfil his own soul every woman must be herself herself only not some mans instrument or some embodied theory but the mode of our being is such that we can only live and have our being whilst we are implicit in one of the great dynamic modes we must either love or rule and once the lovemode changes as change it must for we are worn out and becoming evil in its persistence then the other mode will take place in us and there will be profound profound obedience in place of this lovecrying obedience to the incalculable powerurge and men must submit to the greater soul in a man for their guidance and women must submit to the positive powersoul in man for their being  youll never get it said aaron  you will when all men want it all men say they want a leader then let them in their souls submit to some greater soul than theirs at present when they say they want a leader they mean they want an instrument like lloyd george a mere instrument for their use but its more than that its the reverse its the deep fathomless submission to the heroic soul in a greater man you aaron you too have the need to submit you too have the need livingly to yield to a more heroic soul to give yourself you know you have and you know it isnt love it is lifesubmission and you know it but you kick against the pricks and perhaps youd rather die than yield and so die you must it is your affair  there was a long pause then aaron looked up into lillys face it was dark and remoteseeming it was like a byzantine eikon at the moment  and whom shall i submit to he said  your soul will tell you replied the other   the end
