5361504	by the same writer    the secret rose   the celtic twilight   poems   the wind among the reeds   the shadowy waters   ideas of good and evil     plays for an irish theatre  volume i     where there is nothing    being volume one of plays   for an irish theatre by   w b yeats     london a h bullen 47 great   russell street wc 1903       chiswick press charles whittingham and co   tooks court chancery lane london     dedication of volumes one and two of plays for an irish theatre   my dear lady gregory i dedicate to you two volumes of plays that are in part your own  when i was a boy i used to wander about at rosses point and ballisodare listening to old songs and stories i wrote down what i heard and made poems out of the stories or put them into the little chapters of the first edition of the celtic twilight and that is how i began to write in the irish way  then i went to london to make my living and though i spent a part of every year in ireland and tried to keep the old life in my memory by reading every country tale i could find in books or old newspapers i began to forget the true countenance of country life the old tales were still alive for me indeed but with a new strange half unreal life as if in a wizards glass until at last when i had finished the secret rose and was halfway through the wind among the reeds a wise woman in her trance told me that my inspiration was from the moon and that i should always live close to water for my work was getting too full of those little jewelled thoughts that come from the sun and have no nation i had no need to turn to my books of astrology to know that the common people are under the moon or to porphyry to remember the imagemaking power of the waters nor did i doubt the entire truth of what she said to me for my head was full of fables that i had no longer the knowledge and emotion to write then you brought me with you to see your friends in the cottages and to talk to old wise men on slieve echtge and we gathered together or you gathered for me a great number of stories and traditional beliefs you taught me to understand again and much more perfectly than before the true countenance of country life  one night i had a dream almost as distinct as a vision of a cottage where there was wellbeing and firelight and talk of a marriage and into the midst of that cottage there came an old woman in a long cloak she was ireland herself that cathleen ni hoolihan for whom so many songs have been sung and about whom so many stories have been told and for whose sake so many have gone to their death i thought if i could write this out as a little play i could make others see my dream as i had seen it but i could not get down out of that high window of dramatic verse and in spite of all you had done for me i had not the country speech one has to live among the people like you of whom an old man said in my hearing she has been a servingmaid among us before one can think the thoughts of the people and speak with their tongue we turned my dream into the little play cathleen ni hoolihan and when we gave it to the little theatre in dublin and found that the working people liked it you helped me to put my other dramatic fables into speech some of these have already been acted but some may not be acted for a long time but all seem to me though they were but a part of a summers work to have more of that countenance of country life than anything i have done since i was a boy  w b yeats  feb 1903       paul ruttledge a country gentleman   thomas ruttledge his brother   mrs thomas ruttledge   mr

old hedge long enough  paul ruttledge you neednt worry about me i should be bored if i went in and i dont want to be bored more than is necessary  thomas ruttledge what is that creature you are clipping at now i cant make it out  paul ruttledge oh it is a cochin china fowl an image of some of our neighbours like the others  thomas ruttledge i dont see any likeness to anyone  paul ruttledge oh yes there is if you could see their minds instead of their bodies that comb now  mrs ruttledge coming out on steps thomas are you coming in  thomas ruttledge yes im coming but paul wont come       thomas ruttledge goes out  mrs ruttledge oh this is nonsense paul you must come all these men will think it so strange if you dont it is nonsense to think you will be bored mr green is talking in the most interesting way  paul ruttledge oh i know greens conversation very well  mrs ruttledge and mr joyce your old guardian thomas says he was always so welcome in your fathers time he will think it so queer  paul ruttledge oh i know all their virtues theres dowler who puts away thousands a year in consols and algie who tells everybody all about it have i forgotten anybody oh yes colonel lawley who used to lift me up by the ears when i was a child to see africa no georgina i know all their virtues but im not coming in  mrs ruttledge i cant imagine why you wont come in and be sociable  paul ruttledge you see i cant i have something to do here i have to finish this comb you see it is a beautiful comb but the wings are very short the poor creature cant fly  mrs ruttledge but cant you

jerome who has come to gate as she disappears paul you there that is lucky i was just going to ask for you  paul ruttledge flinging clipper away and jumping up oh father jerome i am delighted to see you i havent seen you for ever so long come and have a talk or will you have some lunch  jerome no thank you i will stay a minute but i wont go in  paul ruttledge that is just as well for you would be bored to death there has been a meeting of magistrates in the village and my brother has brought them all in to lunch  jerome i am collecting for the monastery and my donkey has gone lame i have had to put it up in the village i thought you might be able to lend me one to go on with  paul ruttledge of course im delighted to lend you that or anything else ill go round to the yard with you and order it but sit down here first what have you been doing all this time  jerome oh we have been very busy you know we are going to put up new buildings  paul ruttledge absentmindedly no i didnt know that  jerome yes our school is increasing so much we are getting a grant for technical instruction some of the fathers are learning handicrafts father aloysius is going to study industries in france but we are all busy we are changing with the times we are beginning to do useful things  paul ruttledge useful things i wonder what you have begun to call useful things do you see those marks over there on the grass  jerome what marks  paul ruttledge those marks over there those little marks of scratching  jerome going over to the place paul ruttledge has pointed out i dont see anything  paul ruttledge you are getting blind jerome cant you see that the poultry have been scratching there  jerome no the grass is perfectly smooth  paul ruttledge well the marks are there whether you see them or not for mr green and mr dowler and mr algie and the rest of them run out of their houses when nobody is looking in their real shapes shapes like those on my hedge and then they begin to scratch they scratch all together they dont dig but they scratch and all the time their mouths keep going like that       he holds out his hand and opens and shuts his fingers like a      birds bill  jerome oh paul you are making fun of me  paul ruttledge of course i am only talking in parables i think all the people i meet are like farmyard creatures they have forgotten their freedom their human bodies are a disguise a pretence they keep up to deceive one another  jerome sitting down what is wrong with you  paul ruttledge oh nothing of course you see how happy i am i have a good house and a good property and my brother and his charming wife have come to look after me you see the toys of their children here and everywhere what should be wrong with me  jerome i know you too well not to see that there is something wrong with you  paul ruttledge there is nothing except that i have been thinking a good deal lately  jerome perhaps your old dreams or visions or whatever they were have come back they always made you restless you ought to see more of your neighbours  paul ruttledge theres nothing interesting but human nature and thats in the single soul but these neighbours of mine they think in flocks and roosts  jerome you are too hard on them they are busy men they havnt much time for thought i daresay  paul ruttledge thats what i complain of when i hear these people talking i always hear some organized or vested interest chirp or quack as it does in the newspapers algie chirps even you jerome though i have not found your armorial beast are getting a little monastic when i have found it i will put it among the others there is a place for it there but the worst of it is that it will take so long getting nice and green  jerome i dont know what creature you could make for me  paul ruttledge i am not sure yet i think it might be a pigeon something cooing and gentle and always coming home to the dovecot not to the wild woods but to the dovecot  jerome i wonder what creature you yourself are like  paul ruttledge i daresay i am like some creature or other for very few of us are altogether men but if i am i would like to be one of the wild sort you are right about my dreams they have been coming back lately do you remember those strange ones i had at college  jerome those visions of pulling something down  paul ruttledge yes they have come back to me lately sometimes i dream i am pulling down my own house and sometimes it is the whole world that i am pulling down standing up i would like to have great iron claws and to put them about the pillars and to pull and pull till everything fell into pieces  jerome i dont see what good that would do you  paul ruttledge oh yes it would when everything was pulled down we would have more room to get drunk in to drink contentedly out of the cup of life out of the drunken cup of life  jerome that is a terribly wild thought i hope you dont believe all you say  paul ruttledge perhaps not i only know that i want to upset everything about me have you not noticed that it is a complaint many of us have in this country and whether it comes from love or hate i dont know they are so mixed together here  jerome i wish you would come and talk to our superior he has a perfect gift for giving advice  paul ruttledge well well go to the yard now he gets up  jerome i have often thought you would come to the monastery yourself in the end you were so much the most pious of us all at school you would be happy in a monastery something is always happening there  paul ruttledge as they go up the garden i daresay i daresay but i am not even sure that i am a christian  jerome well anyway i wish that you would come and talk to our superior they go out                                            charlie ward and boy enter by the path beyond      the hedge and stand at gate  charlie ward no use going up there johneen its too grand a place its a dog they might let loose on us but ill tell you what just slip round to the back door and ask do they want any cans mended  johneen let you take the rabbit then were after taking out of the snare i cant bring it round with me  charlie ward faith you cant they think as bad of us taking a rabbit that was fed and minded by god as if it was of their own rearing give it here to me its hardly it will go in my pocket its as big as a hare its next my skin ill have to put it or it might be noticed on me boy goes out       charlie ward is struggling to put rabbit inside his      coat when paul ruttledge comes back  paul ruttledge is there anything i can do for you do you want to come in  charlie ward im a tinker by trade your honour i wonder is there eer a tin can the maids in the house might want mended or any chairs to be bottomed  paul ruttledge a tinker where do you live  charlie ward faith i dont stop long in any place i go about like the crows picking up my way of living like themselves  paul ruttledge opening gate come inside here charlie ward hesitates come in you are welcome       puts his hand on his shoulder charlie ward tries to      close his shirt over rabbit  paul ruttledge ah you have a rabbit there the keeper told me he had come across some snares in my woods  charlie ward if he did sir it was no snare of mine he found this is a rabbit i bought in the town of garreen early this morning sixpence i was made give for it and to mend a tin can along with that  paul ruttledge touching rabbit its warm still however but the day is hot never mind you are quite welcome to it i daresay you will have a cheery meal of it by the roadside my dinners are often tiresome enough i often wish i could changelook here will you change clothes with me  charlie ward faith id swap soon enough if you werent humbugging me its i that would look well with that suit on me the peelers would all be touching their caps to me youd see them running out for me to sign summonses for them  paul ruttledge but i am not humbugging i am in earnest  charlie ward in earnest then when i go back ill commit paddy cockfight to prison for hitting me yesterday  paul ruttledge you dont believe me but i will explain im dead sick of this life i want to get away i want to escapeas you say to pick up my living like the crows for a while  charlie ward to make your escape oh thats different coming closer but what is it you did you dont look like one that would be in trouble but sometimes a gentleman gets a bit wild when he has a drop taken  paul ruttledge well never mind i will explain better while we are changing come over here to the potting shed make haste those magistrates will be coming out  charlie ward the magistrates are they after you hurry on then faith they wont know you with this coat looking at his rags its a pity i didnt put on my old one coming out this morning       they go out through the garden thomas ruttledge comes      down steps from house with colonel lawley and      mr green  mr green yes they have made me president of the county horticultural society my speech was quite a success it was punctuated with applause i said i looked upon the appointment not as a tribute to my own merits but to their public spirit and to the society which i assured them had come to stay  colonel lawley what has become of paul and father jerome i thought i heard their voices out here and now they are conspicuous by their absence  thomas ruttledge he seems to have no friend he cares for but that father jerome  mr green i wish he would come more into touch with his fellows  colonel lawley what a pity he didnt go into the army i wish he would join the militia every man should try to find some useful sphere of employment  mr green thomas your brother will never come to see me though i often ask him he would find the best peoplepeople worth meetingat my house i wonder if he would join the horticultural society i know i voice the sentiments of all the members in saying this i spoke to a number of them at the function the other day  thomas ruttledge i wish he would join something joyce wants him to join the masonic lodge it is not a right life for him to keep hanging about the place and doing nothing  mr green he wont even come and sit on the bench its not fair to leave so much of the work to me i ought to get all the support possible from local men       mrs ruttledge comes down steps with mr dowler      mr algie and mr joyce she is walking in front  mrs ruttledge to thomas ruttledge oh thomas isnt it too bad paul has lent the donkey to that friar i wanted mr joyce to see the children in their panniers do speak to him about it  thomas ruttledge well the donkey belongs to him and for the matter of that so does the house and the place it would be rather hard on him not to be able to use things as he likes  mr algie what a pleasure it must be to paul to have you and the little ones living here he certainly owes you a debt of gratitude man was not born to live alone  mrs ruttledge well i think we have done him good he hasnt done anything for years except mope about the house and cut the bushes into those absurd shapes and now we are trying to make him live more like other people  colonel lawley he was always inclined to be a bit of a faddist  mrs ruttledge to mr algie do let me give you a lesson in croquet i have learned all the new rules to mr joyce please bring me that basket of balls to colonel lawley will you bring me the mallets yes i am afraid he is a faddist we have done our best for him but he ought to be more with men  mr algie yes mr dowler was just saying he ought to try and be made a director of the new railway  colonel lawley the militiathe militia  mr joyce its a great help to a man to belong to a masonic lodge  mr green the horticultural society is in want of new members  mrs ruttledge well i wish he would join something                                            enter paul ruttledge in tinkers clothes carrying a rabbit in      his hand charlie ward follows in pauls clothes all stand      aghast  mr joyce good god       drops basket colonel lawley who has mallets in his hand at      sight of paul ruttledge drops them and stands still  mrs ruttledge paul are you out of your mind  thomas ruttledge for goodness sake paul dont make such a fool of yourself  mrs ruttledge what on earth has happened and who on earth is that man  paul ruttledge opens gate for tinker to charlie ward wait for me my friend down there by the crossroad charlie ward goes out  mr green has he stolen your clothes  paul ruttledge oh its all right i have changed clothes with him i am going to join the tinkers  all to join the tinkers  paul ruttledge life is getting too monotonous i would give it a little variety to mr green as you would say it has been running in grooves  mr joyce to mrs ruttledge this is only his humbugging talk he never believes what he says       paul ruttledge goes towards the steps  mrs ruttledge surely you are not going into the house with those clothes  paul ruttledge you are quite right thomas will go in for me to thomas ruttledge just go to my study will you and bring me my despatchbox i want something from it before i go  thomas ruttledge where are you going to i wish you would tell me what you are at  paul ruttledge the despatchbox is on the top of the bureau       thomas ruttledge goes out  mr joyce what does all this mean  paul ruttledge i will explain sits down on the edge of iron table did you never wish to be a witch and to ride through the air on a white horse  mr joyce i cant say i ever did  paul ruttledge never only think of itto ride in the darkness under the stars to make ones horse leap from cloud to cloud to watch the sea glittering under ones feet and the mountain tops going by  colonel lawley but what has this to do with the tinkers  paul ruttledge as i cannot find a broomstick that will turn itself into a white horse i am going to turn tinker  mr dowler i suppose you have some picturesque idea about these people but i assure you you are quite wrong they are nothing but poachers  mr algie they are nothing but thieves  mr joyce they are the worst class in the country  paul ruttledge oh i know that they are quite lawless that is what attracts me to them i am going to be irresponsible  mr green one cannot escape from responsibility by joining a set of vagabonds  paul ruttledge vagabondsthat is it i want to be a vagabond a wanderer as i cant leap from cloud to cloud i want to wander from road to road that little path there by the clipped edge goes up to the highroad i want to go up that path and to walk along the highroad and so on and on and on and to know all kinds of people did you ever think that the roads are the only things that are endless that one can walk on and on and on and never be stopped by a gate or a wall they are the serpent of eternity i wonder they have never been worshipped what are the stars beside them they never meet one another the roads are the only things that are infinite they are all endless  mrs ruttledge but they must stop when they come to the sea  paul ruttledge ah you are always so wise  mr joyce stop talking nonsense paul and throw away those filthy things  paul ruttledge that would be setting cleanliness before godliness i have begun the regeneration of my soul  mr dowler i dont see what godliness has got to do with it  mr algie nor i either  paul ruttledge there was a saint who said i must rejoice without ceasing although the world shudder at my joy he did not think he could save his soul without it i agree with him and as i was discontented here i thought it time to make a change like that worthy man i must be content to shock my friends  mr dowler but you had everything here you could want  paul ruttledge thats just it you who are so wealthy you of all people should understand that i want to get rid of all that responsibility answering letters and so on it is not worth the trouble of being rich if one has to answer letters could you ever understand georgina that one gets tired of many charming things there are family responsibilities to mr joyce but i can see that you who were my guardian sympathize with me in that  mr joyce indeed i do not  mrs ruttledge i should think you could be cheerful without ceasing to be a gentleman  paul ruttledge you are thinking of my clothes we must feel at ease with the people we live amongst i shall feel at ease with the great multitude in these clothes i am beginning to be a man of the world i am the beggarman of all the agesi have a notion homer wrote something about me  mr dowler he is either making fun of us or talking great rot i cant listen to any more of this nonsense i cant see why a man with property cant let well alone algie are you coming my way       they both go into the house and come out presently with umbrella      and coat  mr green depend upon it hes going to write a book there was a man who made quite a name for himself by sleeping in a casual ward  paul ruttledge oh no im not going to write about it if one writes one can do nothing else i am going to express myself in life to thomas ruttledge who has returned with box i hope soon to live by the work of my hands but every trade has to be learned and i must take something to start with to mrs ruttledge do you think you will have any kettles to mend when i come this way again       he has taken box from thomas ruttledge and unlocked it  thomas ruttledge i cant make head or tail of what you are at  colonel lawley what he is at is fads  mr green i dont think his motive is far to seek he has some idea of going back to the dark ages rousseau had some idea of the same kind but it didnt work  paul ruttledge yes i want to go back to the dark ages  mr green do you want to lose all the world has gained since then  paul ruttledge what has it gained i am among those who think that sin and death came into the world the day newton eat the apple to mrs ruttledge who is going to speak i know you are going to tell me he only saw it fall never mind it is all the same thing  mrs ruttledge beginning to cry oh he is going mad  mr joyce im afraid he is really leaving us  paul ruttledge who has been looking at papers tearing one or two etc takes out a packet of notes which he puts in his breast i daresay this will last me long enough thomas i am not robbing you of very much well goodbye pats him gently on the shoulder i mustnt forget the rabbit it may be my dinner tonight i wonder who will skin it goodbye colonel i think ive astonished you today slaps his shoulder that was too hard was it forgive it you know im a common man now lifts his hat and goes out of gate closes it after him and stands with his hands on it and speaks with the voice of a common man go on live in your poultryyard scratch straw and cluck and cackle at everything that you take for a fox exit  mr joyce goes to mrs ruttledge who has sat down and is wiping her eyes i am very sorry for this for his fathers sake but it may be as well in the end if it comes to the worst you and thomas will keep up the family name better than he would have done  mr dowler hell find the poor very different from what he thinks when they pick his pocket  colonel lawley to think that a magistrate should have such fads  mr green i venture to say you will see him here in a very different state of mind in a week  mr algie who has been in a brown study he has done for himself in this world and the next why he wont be asked to a single shoot if this is heard of  thomas ruttledge turning from the gate here are the children georgina dont say anything before the nurse  mr green well i must be off goes in for stick  mr joyce just bring me out my coat green       they all prepare to go mrs ruttledge has gone to open gate and      children come in one in a perambulator all gather round them      admiringly  mr joyce have you a kiss for godfather today  mrs ruttledge the poor darlings i hope they will never know what has happened  colonel lawley thank goodness they have no nonsense in their heads we know where we are with them   curtain     act ii        scene by the roadside a wall of unmortared stone in the      background tinkers encampment men women and children standing      round paul ruttledge standing by a fire  paul ruttledge what do you mean by tinning the soldering iron  charlie ward if the face of it is not well tinned it wont lift the solder show me here       takes soldering iron from paul ruttledges hand  paul ruttledge sitting down and drawing a tin can to him now let me see how you mend this hole it seems easy im sure i will be able to learn it as well as any of you       two tinkers come and stand over him  charlie ward pointing to one of them this sir is tommy the song hes the best singer we have but the divil a much good he is only that hes a great warrant to snare hares  tommy the song is the gentleman going to join us  paul ruttledge indeed i am if youll let me theres nothing id like better  tommy the song but are you going to learn the trade  paul ruttledge yes if youll teach me im sure ill make a good tinker look at that now see how ive stopped that hole already  charlie ward taking the can from him and looking at it if every can had a little hole in the middle like that i think you would be able to mend them but theres the straight hole and the crooked hole the round hole the square hole the angle hole the bottom hole the top hole the side leak the open leak the leakallround but i wont frighten you with the names of them all only this i will say that when youve learned to mend all the leakages in a canand that should take you a yearyoure only in the first day of the tinkers week  tommy the song dont believe him hes only humbugging you its not the hardness of the work will daunt you  paul ruttledge thank you i was not believing him at all im quite sure ill be able to mend any can at the end of a week but the bottoming of them will take longer i can see thats not so easy when will you start to teach me that charlie  charlie ward as another tinker comes up paddy heres the gentleman i was telling you about hes going to join us for good and all to paul ruttledge wait till we have time and some quiet place and hell show you as good a cockfight as ever you saw a woman comes up this is his wife molly the scold we call her faith she is a better fighter than any cock he ever had in a basket hed find it hard to shut the lid on her  molly the scold the gentleman seems foolish is he all there  paddy cockfight stop your chat molly or ill hit you a welt  charlie ward keep your tongue quiet molly if the gentleman has reasons for keeping out of the way it isnt for us to be questioning him to paul ruttledge dont mind her shes cross enough but maybe your own ladies would be cross as well if they saw their young sons dying by the roadside in a little kennel of straw under the asscart the way she did from first to last  paul ruttledge i suppose you have your troubles like others but you seem cheerful enough  charlie ward it isnt anything to fret about some of us go soon and some travel the roads for their lifetime what does it matter when we are under the nettles if it was with a short rope or a long one we were hanged  paul ruttledge yes that is the way to take life what does the length of our rope matter  charlie ward we havent time to be thinking of troubles like people that would be shut up in a house we have the wide world before us to make our living out of the people of the whole world are begrudging us our living and we make it out of them for all that when they will spread currant cakes and feather beds before us it will be time for us to sit down and fret  tommy the song its likely youll think the life too hard would you like to be passing by houses in the nighttime and the fire shining out of them and you hardly given the loan of a sod to light your pipe and the rain falling on you  paul ruttledge why are the people so much against you  tommy the song we are not like themselves its little we care about them or they about us if their saint did curse us itself  charlie ward stop i wont have you talking about that story here why would they think so much of the curse of one saint and saints so plenty  paddy cockfight wheres the good of a gentleman being here hell be breaking down on the road its on the asscart hell be wanting to sit  tommy the song indeed i dont think hell stand the hardship  paul ruttledge oh ill stand it well enough  tommy the song youre not like us that were reared to it you were not born like us with wandering in the heart  paul ruttledge oh yes i have wandering in the heart i got sick of these lighted rooms you were talking of just now  charlie ward that might be so its the dark is welcome to a man sometimes  paul ruttledge the dark yes i think that is what i want stands up the dark where there is nothing that is anything and nobody that is anybody one can be free there where there is nothing well if you let me stay with you i dont think you will hear any complaints from me charlie ward paddy and the rest of you i want you to understand that from this out i am

what they can off the ass and away with them  paul ruttledge and why wouldnt they tell me that am i not one of yourselves  charlie ward ah its likely theyll never trust you  paul ruttledge but they will soon see that i am one of themselves  charlie ward no but thats the very thing youre not one of ourselves you were not born on the road reared on the road married on the road like us  paul ruttledge well its too late for me to be reared on the road but i dont see why i shouldnt marry on the road like you i certainly would do it if it would make me one of you  charlie ward it might make you one of us theres no doubt about that its the only thing that would do it  paul ruttledge well find a wife for me  charlie ward faith you havent far to go to find one paddy there will give you over

cheek some      groceries a string of onions etc on the ass which still has      its nursery trappings he goes up to charlie ward thinking he is      paul ruttledge  jerome paul what are you doing here  charlie ward turning what do you want  jerome oh im mistaken i thought  paul ruttledge i am here father jerome but youre talking to the wrong man  jerome good god paul what has happened  paul ruttledge nothing has happened that need surprise you dont you remember what we talked of today you told me i was too much by myself after you went away i thought i would make a change  jerome but a change like this  paul ruttledge why should you find fault with it i am richer now than i was then i only lent you that donkey then now i give him to you  jerome what has brought you among such people as these  paul ruttledge i find them on the whole better company than the people i left a little while ago let me introduce you to  jerome what can you possibly gain by coming here are you going to try and teach them  paul ruttledge oh no i am going to learn from them  jerome what can you learn from them  paul ruttledge to pick up my living like the crows and to solder tin cans just give me that one i mended a while ago       holds it out to father jerome  jerome that is all nonsense  paul ruttledge i am happy do not your saints put all opponents to the rout by saying they alone of all mankind are happy  jerome i suppose you will not compare the happiness of these people with the happiness of saints  paul ruttledge there are all sorts of happiness some find their happiness like thomas à kempis with a little book and a little cell  paddy cockfight i would wonder at anybody that could be happy in a cell  paul ruttledge these men fight in their way as your saints fought for their hand is against the world i want the happiness of men who fight who are hit and hit back not the fighting of men in red coats that formal soonfinished fighting but the endless battle the endless battle tell me father jerome did you ever listen in the middle of the night  jerome listen for what  paul ruttledge did you ever when the monastery was silent and the dogs had stopped barking listen till you heard music  jerome what sort of music do you mean  paul ruttledge not the music we hear with these ears touching his ears but the music of paradise  jerome brother colman once said he heard harps in the night  paul ruttledge harps it was because he was shut in a cell he heard harps maybe it sounds like harps in a cell but the music i have heard sometimes is made of the continual clashing of swords it comes rejoicing from paradise  jerome these are very wild thoughts  tommy the song i often heard music in the forths there is many of us hear it when we lie with our heads on the ground at night  jerome that was not the music of paradise  paul ruttledge why should they not hear that music although it may not set them praying but dancing  jerome how can you think you will ever find happiness amongst their devils mirth  paul ruttledge i have taken to the roads because there is a wild beast i would overtake and these people are good snarers of beasts they can help me  charlie ward what kind of a wild beast is it you want  paul ruttledge oh its a very terrible wild beast with iron teeth and brazen claws that can root up spires and towers  charlie ward its best not to try and overtake a beast like that but to cross running water and leave it after you  tommy the song i heard one coming after me one night very big and shadowy it was and i could hear it breathing but when it came up with me i lifted a hazel rod was in my hand and it was gone on the moment  paul ruttledge my wild beast is laughter the mightiest of the enemies of god i will outrun it and make it friendly  jerome that is your old wild talk do have some sense and go back to your family  paul ruttledge i am never going back to them i am going to live among these people i will marry among them  jerome that is nonsense you will soon change your mind  paul ruttledge oh no i wont i am taking my vows as you made yours when you entered religion i have chosen my wife i am going to marry before evening  jerome thank god you will have to stop short of that the church will never marry you  paul ruttledge oh i am not going to ask the help of the church but i am to be married by what may be as old a ceremony as yours what is it i am to do charlie  charlie ward to lep a budget sir  paul ruttledge yes that is it the budget is there by the wall  jerome i command you in the name of the holy church and of the teaching you have received from the church to leave this folly this degradation this sin  paul ruttledge you forget jerome that i am on the track of the wild beast and hunters in all ages have been a bad people to preach to when i have tamed the beast perhaps i will bring him to your religious house to be baptized  jerome i will not listen to this profanity to charlie ward it is you who have put this madness on him as you have stolen his clothes  charlie ward stop your chat ye petticoated preacher  paul ruttledge i think father jerome you had better be getting home this people never gave in to the preaching of s patrick  paddy cockfight ill send you riding home with your face to the tail of the ass  tommy the song no stop till we show you that we can make as good curses as yourself that you may never be warm in winter or cold in summer time  charlie ward thats the chat bravo let him have it  tinkers be off be off out of this  molly the scold now curse him tommy  tommy the song a wide hoarseness on youa high hanging to you on a windy day that shivering fever may stretch you nine times and that the curses of the poor may be your best music and you hiding behind the door jerome goes out  molly the scold and you hiding behind the door and squeezed between the hinges and the wall  other tinkers squeezed between the hinges and the wall they follow jerome  paul ruttledge crying after them dont harm that gentleman he is a friend of mine       he goes to the wall and stands there silently looking upward  sabina silver it was grand talk indeed i didnt understand a word of it  paul ruttledge the crows are beginning to fly home there is a flock of them high up under that cloud i wonder where their nests are  charlie ward a long way off among those big trees about tillyra castle  paul ruttledge yes i remember i have seen them coming home there on a windy evening tossing and whirling like the sea they may have seen what i am looking for they fly so far a sailor told me once that he saw a crow three hundred miles from land but maybe he was a liar  charlie ward well they fly far anyway  paul ruttledge they tell one another what they have seen too that is why they make so much noise maybe their news goes round the world he comes towards the others i think they have seen my wild beast laughter they could tell me if he has a face smoky from the eternal fires and wings of brass and claws of brassclaws of brass holds out his hands and moves them like claws sabina would you like to see a beast with eyes hard and cold and blue like sapphires would you sabina well its time

am thinking it is the first prayer he ever said in his life  sabina silver its likely it was paul hes after talking to him through the length of an hour  paul ruttledge maybe it was dont mind him i said just now that when we were all dead and in heaven it would be a sort of drunkenness a sort of ecstasy there is a hymn about it but it is in latin et calix meus inebrians quam praeclarus est how splendid is the cup of my drunkenness  charlie ward well that is a great sort of a hymn i never thought there was a hymn like that i never did  paddy cockfight to think now there is a hymn like that i mustnt let it slip out of my mind how splendid is the cup of my drunkenness thats it  charlie ward have you found that old bird of mine  tommy the song who has been searching among the baskets here he is in the basket and a lot of things over it  charlie ward get out that new speckled bird of yours paddy ive been wanting to see how could he play for a week past  paul ruttledge where do you get the cocks  paddy cockfight it was a man below mullingar owned this one the day i first seen him i fastened my two eyes on him he preyed on my mind and next night if i didnt go back every foot of nine miles to put him in my bag  paul ruttledge do you pay much for a good fighting cock  sabina silver laughs do you pay much paddy  paul ruttledge perhaps you dont pay anything  sabina silver i think paddy gets them cheap  charlie ward he gets them cheaper than another man would anyhow  paddy cockfight hes the best cock i ever saw before or since believe me i made no mistake when i pitched on him  tommy the song i dont care what you think of him ill back the red its he has the lively eye  molly the scold andy farrell had an old cock and it bent double like himself and all the feathers flittered out of it but i hold you hed leather both your red and your speckled cock together i tell ye boys that was the cock       uproarious shouts and yells heard outside  charlie ward those free drinks of yours paul is playing the devil with them do you hear them now and every roar out of them theyre putting the cocks astray he takes out a cock sure they think its thunder  molly the scold theres not a man of them outside there now but would be ready to knock down his own brother  tommy the song he wouldnt know him to knock him down theyre all blind i never saw the like of it  paul ruttledge you in here stood it better than that  charlie ward when those common men drink its what they fall down they havent the heads theyre not like us that have to keep heads and heels on us  paddy cockfight its well we kept them out of this or theyd be lying on the floor now and thered be no place for my poor bird to show himself off look at him now isnt he the beauty takes out the cock  charlie ward now

voice outside  voice open this door  paddy cockfight thats green the removable i know his voice well  charlie ward clear away boys back with those cocks there throw that sack over the baskets quick will ye  colonel lawley outside open this door at once  mr green outside i insist on this door being opened  molly the scold what do they want at all i wish we didnt come into a place with no back door to it  paul ruttledge theres nothing to be afraid of open the door charlie charlie ward opens the door                                            enter mr green colonel lawley mr dowler mr joyce mr algie      and thomas ruttledge  paddy cockfight all jps i have looked at every one of them from the dock  mr green mr ruttledge this is very sad  mr joyce this is a disgraceful business paul the whole countryside is demoralized there is not a man who has come to sensible years who is not drunk  mr dowler this is a flagrant violation of all propriety society is shaken to its roots my own servants have been led astray by the free drinks that are being given in the village my butler who has been with me for seven years has not been seen for the last two days  paul ruttledge i am sure you will echo mr dowler algie  mr algie indeed i do i endorse his sentiments completely there has not been a stroke of work done for the last week the hay is lying in ridges where it has been cut there is not a man to be found to water the cattle it is impossible to get as much as a horse shod in the village  paul ruttledge i think you have something to say colonel lawley  colonel lawley i have undoubtedly i want to know when law and order are to be reestablished the police have been quite unable to cope with the disorder some of them have themselves got drunk if my advice had been taken the military would have been called in  mr green the military are not indispensable on occasions like the present there are plenty of police coming now we have wired to dublin for them they will be here by the four oclock train  paul ruttledge gets down from his bin but you have not told me what you have come here for is there anything i can do for you  thomas ruttledge wont you come home paul the children have been asking for you and we dont know what to say  mr green we have come to request you to go to the publichouses to stop the free drinks to send the people back to their work as for those tinkers the law will deal with them when the police arrive  thomas ruttledge oh paul why have you upset the place like this  paul ruttledge well i wanted to give a little pleasure to my fellowcreatures  mr dowler this seems rather a low form of pleasure  paul ruttledge i daresay it seems to you a little violent but the poor have very few hours in which to enjoy themselves they must take their pleasure raw they havent the time to cook it  mr algie but drunkenness  paul ruttledge putting his hand on the shoulders of two of the magistrates have we not tried sobriety do you like it i found it very dull a yell from outside there is not one of those people outside but thinks that he is a king that he is riding the wind there is not one of them that would not hit the world a slap in the face some poet has written that exuberance is beauty and that the roadway of excess leads to the palace of wisdom but i forgotyou do not read the poets  mr dowler what we want to know is are you going to send the people back to their work  paul ruttledge oh work is such a little thing in comparison with experience think what it is to them to have their imagination like a blazing tarbarrel for a whole week work could never bring them such blessedness as that  mr dowler everyone knows there is no more valuable blessing than work  mr algie idleness is the curse of this country  paul ruttledge i am prejudiced for i have always been an idler doubtless the poor must work it was no doubt of them you were speaking yet doesnt the church say doesnt it describe heaven as a place where saints and angels only sing and hold branches and wander about hand in hand that must be changed we must teach the poor to think work a thing fit for heaven a blessed thing ill tell you what well do dowler will you subscribe and you and you and well send lecturers about with magic lanterns showing heaven as it should be the saints with spades and hammers in their hands and everybody working the poor might learn to think more of work then will you join in that scheme dowler  mr dowler i think youd better leave these subjects alone it is obvious you have cut yourself off from both religion and society  mr green the world could not go on without work  paul ruttledge the world could not go on without work the world could not go on without work i must think about it gets up on bin why should the world go on perhaps the christian teacher came to bring it to an end let us send messengers everywhere to tell the people to stop working and then the world may come to an end he spoke of the world the flesh and the devil perhaps it would be a good thing to end these one by one  colonel lawley come away out of this he has gone mad  paul ruttledge ah i thought that would scare them  mr joyce i wish paul you would come back and live like a christian  paul ruttledge like a christian  mr joyce come away theres no use stopping here any longer  paul ruttledge sternly wait i have something to say to that to charlie ward do not let anyone leave this place       tinkers close together at the door  mr green to tinkers this is nonsense let me through       tinker spreads out his arms before him  paul ruttledge you have come into a different kingdom now the old kingdom of the people of the roads the houseless people we call ourselves tinkers and you are going to put us on our trial if you can you call yourselves christians and we will put you on your trial first i will put the world on its trial and myself of yesterday to a boy run out johneen keep a watch and tell us when the train is coming sabina that rope we will set these gentlemen on those barrels tinkers take hold of them  colonel lawley keep your hands off me you drunken scoundrel       strikes at charlie ward but tinkers seize his arms behind  paul ruttledge tie all their hands behind them  mr dowler wed better give in theres no saying how many more of them there are  mr algie ill be quiet the odds are too great against us  mr green the police will soon be here we may as well stay quietly  paddy cockfight here give it to me ill put a good twist in it dont be afraid sir its not about your neck im putting it there now sit quiet and easy and you wont feel it at all  paul ruttledge are all their hands tied now then heave them up on to the barrels       slight scuffle during which all are put on the barrels in a      semicircle  paul ruttledge ah yes you are on my barrels now last time i saw you you were on your own dunghill let me see is there anyone here who can write  charlie ward nobody  paul ruttledge never mind you can keep count on your fingers the rest must sit down and behave themselves as befits a court they say they are living like christians let us see  thomas ruttledge oh paul dont make such a fool of yourself  paul ruttledge the point is not wisdom or folly but the christian life  mr dowler dont answer him thomas let us preserve our dignity  mr algie yes let us keep a dignified attitudewe wont answer these ruffians at all  paul ruttledge respect the court turns to colonel lawley you have served your queen and country in the field and now you are a colonel of militia  colonel lawley well what is there to be ashamed of in that answer me that now  paul ruttledge yet there is an old saying about turning the other cheek an old saying a saying so impossible that the world has never been able to get it out of its mind you have helped to enlist men for the army i think some of them have fought in the late war and you have even sent some of your own militia there  colonel lawley if i did im proud of it  paul ruttledge did they think it was a just war  colonel lawley that was not their business they had taken the queens pay they would have disgraced themselves if they had not gone  paul ruttledge is it not the doctrine of your christian church of your catholic church that he who fights in an unjust war knowing it to be unjust loses his own soul  colonel lawley i should like to know what would happen to the country if there werent soldiers to protect it  paul ruttledge we are not discussing the country we are discussing the christian life has this gentleman lived the christian life  all the tinkers he has not  paddy cockfight his sergeant tried to enlist me giving me a shilling and i drunk  tommy the song singing    she bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree   but i being young and foolish with her would not agree  charlie ward stop your mouth tommy this is not your show to paul ruttledge are you going to put a fine on the colonel if so id like his cloak  paul ruttledge now well try mr dowler the rich man holds up his fingers in a ring mr dowler could you go through this  mr algie dont answer him dowler hes going beyond all bounds  paul ruttledge i was a rich man and i could not and yet i am something smaller than a camel and this is something larger than a needles eye  mr joyce dont answer this profanity  charlie ward but what about the cloak  paul ruttledge oh go and take it       charlie ward goes and takes cloak off the colonel  colonel lawley you drunken rascal ill see you in the dock for this  mr joyce youre encouraging robbery now  paul ruttledge remember the commandment give to him that asketh thee and the hard commandment goes even farther him that taketh thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also holding out his rags have i not shown you what mr green would call a shining example charlie ask them all for their coats  charlie ward i will and their boots too  all the tinkers uproariously give me your coat ill have your boots etc  mr green wait till the police come ill turn the tables on you you may all expect hard labour for this  paul ruttledge to the tinkers stand back the trial is not over mr green these friends of yours have been convicted of breaking the doctrine they boast of they do not love their enemies they do not give to every man that asks of them some of them mr dowler for instance lay up treasures upon earth they ask their goods again of those who have taken them away but you mr green are the worst of all they break the law of christ for their own pleasure but you take pay for breaking it when their goods are taken away you condemn the taker when they are smitten on one cheek you punish the smiter you encourage them in their breaking of the law of christ  tommy the song he does indeed he gave me two months for snaring rabbits  paddy cockfight he tried to put a fine on me for a cock i had and he took five shillings off molly for hitting a man  paul ruttledge your evidence is not wanted his own words are enough stretching out his arms have any of these gentlemen been living the christian life  all they have not  johneen coming in yed best clear off now i see the train coming in to the station  paddy cockfight the police will find plenty to do in the village before they come to us thats one good job  paul ruttledge one moment i have done trying the world i have left you have accused me of upsetting order by my free drinks and i have showed you that there is a more dreadful fermentation in the sermon on the mount than in my beerbarrels christ thought it in the irresponsibility of his omnipotence getting from his bin charlie give me that cloak he flings it back  charlie ward arent you going to punish them anyway  paul ruttledge no no from this out i would punish nobody but myself       some of the tinkers have gone out  charlie ward wed best be off while we can come along paul sibbys gone       as they go out tommy the song is singing    down by the sally garden my love and i did stand   and on my leaning shoulder she laid her milkwhite hand   she bade me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree   but i being young and foolish with her would not agree       all go out except paul ruttledge  paul ruttledge well goodbye thomas i dont suppose ill see you again use all i have spend it on your children

threadbare clothes of the apostles and run naked for awhile is going out  thomas ruttledge you have nothing against me have you paul  paul ruttledge oh yes i have a little that i have said against all

left sitting on steps        scene 2the crypt under the monastery church a small barred      window high up in the wall through which the cold dawn is      breaking altar in a niche at the back of stage there are seven      unlighted candles on the altar a little hanging lamp near the      altar paul ruttledge is lying on the altar steps friars are      dancing slowly before him in the dim light father aloysius is      leaning against a pillar       some friars come in carrying lanterns  first friar what are they doing dancing  second friar i told you they were dancing and you would not believe me  first friar what on earth are they doing it for  third friar i heard them saying father paul told them to do it if they ever found him in a trance again he told them it was a kind of prayer and would bring joy down out of heaven and make it easier for him to preach  second friar how still he is lying you would nearly think him to be dead  a friar it is just a twelvemonth today since he was in a trance like this  second friar that was the time he gave his great preaching i cant blame those that went with him for he all but persuaded me  first friar they think he is going to preach again when he awakes thats why they are dancing when he wakes one of them will go and call the others  third friar we were all in danger when one so pious was led away its five years he has been with us now and no one ever went so quickly from lay brother to novice and novice to friar  first friar the way he fasted too the superior bade me watch him at meal times for fear he should starve himself  third friar he thought a great deal of brother paul then but he isnt so well pleased with him now  second friar what is father aloysius doing there standing so quiet and his eyes shut  third friar he is meditating didnt you hear brother paul gives meditations of his own  first friar colman was telling me about that he gives them a joyful thought to fix their minds on they must not let their minds stray to anything else they must follow that single thought and put everything else behind them  third friar colman fainted the other day when he was at his meditation he says it is a great labour to follow one thought always  second friar what do they do it for  first friar to escape what they call the wandering of nature they say it was in the trance brother paul got the knowledge of it he says that if a man can only keep his mind on the one high thought he gets out of time into eternity and learns the truth for itself  third friar he calls that getting above law and number and becoming king and priest in ones own house  second friar a nice state of things it would be if every man was his own priest and his own king  first friar i wonder will he wake soon i thought i saw him stir just now father aloysius will he wake soon  aloysius what did you say  first friar will he wake soon  aloysius yes yes he will wake very soon now  second friar what are they going to do now are they going to dance  third friar he was too patient with him he would have made short work of any of us if we had gone so far  first dancer    nam et si ambulavero in medio umbrae mortis   non timebo mala quoniam tu mecum es  first friar they are singing the twentysecond psalm what madness to sing  second dancer    virga tua et baculus tuus   ipsa me consolata sunt  first dancer    parasti in conspectu meo mensam   adversus eos qui tribulant me  second dancer  impinguasti in oleo caput meum et calix meus inebrians quam praeclarus est  second friar here is the superior therell be bad work now                                            superior comes in  superior holding up his hand silence       they stop singing and dancing  first dancer its the superior  superior stop this blasphemy leave the chapel at once i will deal with you byandby dancing friars go out  jerome stooping over paul he has not wakened from the trance yet  aloysius who still remains perfectly motionless not yet but he will soon awakepaul  superior it is hardly worth while being angry with those poor fools whose heads he has turned with his talk stoops and touches his hand it is quite rigid i will wait till he is alive again there is no use wasting words on a dead body  jerome stooping over him his eyes are beginning to quiver let me be the first to speak to him he may say some wild things when he awakes not knowing who is before him  superior he must not preach i must have his submission at once  jerome i will do all i can with him he is most likely to listen to me i was once his close friend  superior speak to him if you like but entire submission is the only thing i will accept to the other monks come with me we will leave father jerome here to speak to him superior and friars go to the door such desecration such blasphemy remember father jerome entire submission and at once superior and friars go out  jerome where are the rest of his friends father aloysius bartley and colman ought to be with him when he is like this  aloysius they are resting because when he has given his message they may never be able to rest again  jerome bending over him my poor paul this will wear him out see how thin he has grown  aloysius he is hard upon his body he does not care what happens to his body  jerome he was like this when he was a boy some wild thought would come on him and he would not know day from night he would forget even to eat it is a great pity he was so hard to himself it is a pity he had not always someone to look after him  aloysius god is taking care of him what could men like us do for him we cannot help him it is he who helps us  jerome going on his knee and taking his hand he is awaking help me to lift him up they lift him into a chair  aloysius i will go and call the others now  jerome do not let them come for a little time i must speak to him first  aloysius i cannot keep them away long one cannot know when the words may be put in his mouth       aloysius goes out jerome stands by paul ruttledge holding his      hand  paul ruttledge raising his head ah you are there jerome i am glad you are there i could not get up to drive away the mouse that was eating the wax that dropped from the candles have you driven it away  jerome it is not evening now it is almost morning you were on your knees praying for a great many hours and then i think you fainted  paul ruttledge i dont think i was praying i was among people a great many people and it was very brighti will remember presently  jerome do not try to remember you are tired you must be weak you must come and have food and rest  paul ruttledge i do not think i can rest i think there is something else i have to do i forget what it is  jerome i am afraid you are thinking of preaching again you must not preach the superior says you must not he is very angry i have never seen him so angry he will not allow you to preach again  paul ruttledge did i ever preach  jerome yes it was in the garden you got the trance last time we found you like this and we lifted you to the bench under the yew tree and then you began to speak you spoke about getting out of the body while still alive about getting away from law and number all the friars came to listen to you we had never heard such preaching before but it was very like heresy  paul ruttledge getting up jerome jerome i remember now where i was i was in a great round place and a great crowd of things came round me i couldnt see them very clearly for a time but some of them struck me with their feet hard feet like hoofs and soft catlike feet and some pecked me and some bit me and some clawed me there were all sorts of beasts and birds as far as i could see  jerome were they devils paul were they the deadly sins  paul ruttledge i dont know but i thought and i dont know how the thought came to me that they were the part of mankind that is not human the part that builds up the things that keep the soul from god  jerome that was a terrible vision  paul ruttledge i struggled and i struggled with them and they heaped themselves over me till i was unable to move hand or foot and that went on for a long long time  jerome crossing himself god have mercy on us  paul ruttledge then suddenly there came a bright light and all in a minute the beasts were gone and i saw a great many angels riding upon unicorns white angels on white unicorns they stood all round me and they cried out brother paul go and preach get up and preach brother paul and then they laughed aloud and the unicorns trampled the ground as though the world were already falling in pieces  jerome it was only a dream come with me you will forget it when you have had food and rest  paul ruttledge looking at his arm it was there one of them clawed me one that looked at me with great heavy eyes  jerome the superior has been here try and listen to me he says you must not preach  paul ruttledge great heavy eyes and hard sharp claws  jerome putting his hands on his shoulders you must awake from this you must remember where you are you are under rules you must not break the rules you are under the brothers will be coming in to hear you you must not speak to them the superior has forbidden it  paul ruttledge touching jeromes hand i have always been a great trouble to you  jerome you must go and submit to the superior go and make your submission now for my sake think of what i have done for your sake remember how i brought you in and answered for you when you came here i did not tell about that wild business i have done penance for that deceit  paul ruttledge yes you have always been good to me but do not ask me this i have had other orders  jerome last time you preached the whole monastery was upset the friars began to laugh suddenly in the middle of the night  paul ruttledge if i have been given certain truths to tell i must tell them at once before they slip away from me  jerome i cannot understand your ideas you tell them impossible things things that are against the order of nature  paul ruttledge i have learned that one needs a religion so wholly supernatural that is so opposed to the order of nature that the world can never capture it       some friars come in they carry green branches in their hands  paul ruttledge they are coming will you stay and listen  jerome i must not stay i must not listen  paul ruttledge help me over to the candles i am weak my knees are weak i shall be strong when the words come i shall be able to teach he lights a taper at the hanging lamp and tries to light the candles with a shaking hand jerome takes the taper from him and lights the candles why are you crying jerome  jerome because we that were friends are separated now we shall never be together again  paul ruttledge never again the love of god is a very terrible thing  jerome i have done with meddling i must leave you to authority now i must tell the superior you will not obey he goes out  first friar father jerome had a very dark look going out  second friar he was shut up with the superior this morning i wonder what they were talking about  first friar i wonder if the superior will mind our taking the branches they are only cut on palm sunday other years what will he tell us i wonder it seems as if he was going to tell us how to do some great thing do you think he will teach us to do cures like the friars used at esker  second friar those were great cures they did there and they were not strange men but just the same as ourselves i heard of a man went to them dying on a cart and he walked twenty miles home to burren holding the horses head  first friar maybe well be able to see visions the same as were seen at knock its a great wonder all that was seen and all that was done there  third friar i was there one time and the whole place was full of crutches that had been thrown away by people that were cured there was a silver crutch there some rich man from america had sent as an offering after getting his cure speak to him brother colman he seems to be in some sort of a dream ask if he is going to speak to us now  colman we are all here brother paul  paul ruttledge have you all been through your meditations they all gather round him  bartley we have all tried we have done our best but it is hard to keep our mind on the one thing for long  paul ruttledge he ascended into heaven have you meditated upon that did you reject all earthly images that came into your mind till the light began to gather  third friar i could not fix my mind well when i put out one thought others came rushing in  colman when i was meditating the inside of my head suddenly became all on fire  aloysius while i was meditating i felt a spout of fire going up between my shoulders  paul ruttledge that is the way it begins you are ready now to hear the truth now i can give you the message that has come to me stand here at either side of the altar brother colman come beside me here lay down your palm branches before this altar you have brought them as a sign that the walls are beginning to be broken up that we are going back to the joy of the green earth goes up to the candles and speaks et calix meus inebrians quam praeclarus est for a long time after their making men and women wandered here and there half blind from the drunkenness of eternity they had not yet forgotten that the green earth was the love of god and that all life was the will of god and so they wept and laughed and hated according to the impulse of their hearts he takes up the green boughs and presses them to his breast they gathered the green earth to their breasts and their lips as i gather these boughs to mine in what they believed would be an eternal kiss he remains a little while silent  second friar i see a light about his head  third friar i wonder if he has seen god  paul ruttledge it was then that the temptation began not only the serpent who goes upon his belly but all the animal spirits that have loved things better than life came out of their holes and began to whisper the men and women listened to them and because when they had lived according to the joyful will of god in mother wit and natural kindness they sometimes did one another an injury they thought that it would be better to be safe than to be blessèd they made the laws the laws were the first sin they were the first mouthful of the apple the moment man had made them he began to die we must put out the laws as i put out this candle       he puts out the candle with an extinguisher still holding the      boughs with his left hand two orthodox friars have come in  first orthodox friar you had better go for the superior  second orthodox friar i must stop and listen       the first orthodox friar listens for a minute or two and then      goes out  paul ruttledge and when they had lived amidst the green earth that is the love of god they were sometimes wetted by the rain and sometimes cold and hungry and sometimes alone from one another they thought it would be better to be comfortable than to be blessèd they began to build big houses and big towns they grew wealthy and they sat chattering at their doors and the embrace that was to have been eternal ended lips and hands were parted he lets the boughs slip out of his arms we must put out the towns as i put out this candle puts out another candle  a friar yes yes we must uproot the towns  paul ruttledge but that is not all for man created a worse thing yes a worse defiance against god the friars groan god put holiness into everything that lives for everything that desires is full of his will and everything that is beautiful is full of his love but man grew timid because it had been hard to find his way amongst so much holiness and though god had made all time holy man said that only the day on which god rested from life was holy and though god had made all places holy man said no place but this place that i put pillars and walls about is holy this place where i rest from life and in this and like ways he built up the church we must destroy the church we must put it out as i put out this candle puts out another candle  friars clasping one anothers hands he is right he is right the church must be destroyed the superior comes in  first friar here is the superior  a friar he has been saying  superior hush i will hear him to the end  paul ruttledge that is not all these things may be accomplished and yet nothing be accomplished the christians business is not reformation but revelation and the only labours he can put his hand to can never be accomplished in time he must so live that all things shall pass away he stands silent for a moment and then cries lifting his hand above his head give me wine out of thy pitchers oh god how splendid is my cup of drunkenness we must become blind and deaf and dizzy we must get rid of everything that is not measureless eternal life we must put out hope as i put out this candle puts out a candle and memory as i put out this candle as before and thought the waster of life as i put out this candle as before and at last we must put out the light of the sun and of the moon and all the light of the world and the world itself he now puts out the last candle the chapel is very dark the only light is the faint light of morning coming through the window we must destroy the world we must destroy everything that has law and number for where there is nothing there is god       the superior comes forward one of pauls friars makes as if to      speak to him the superior strikes at him with the back of his      hand  superior to paul ruttledge get out of this rebel blasphemous rebel  paul ruttledge do as you like to me but you cannot silence my thoughts i learned them from jesus christ who made a terrible joy and sent it to overturn governments and all settled order       pauls friars rush to save him from the superior  paul ruttledge there is no need for violence i am ready to go  colman taking his hand i will go with you  aloysius i will go with you too  several other friars and i and i and i  superior whoever goes with this heretic goes straight into the pit  bartley do not leave us behind you let us go with you  colman teach us teach us we will help you to teach others  paul ruttledge let me go alone the one more the one nearer falsehood  bartley we will go with you we will go with you we must go where we can hear your voice  a friar who stands behind the superior god is making him speak against himself  paul ruttledge no the time has not come for you you would be thinking of your food at midday and listening for the bells at prayer time you have not yet heard the voices and seen the faces  superior a miracle god is making the heretic speak against himself listen to him  aloysius we will not stay behind we will go with you  bartley we cannot live without hearing you  paul ruttledge i am led by hands that are colder than ice and harder than diamonds they will lead me where there will be hard thoughts of me in the hearts of all that love me and there will be a fire in my heart that will make it as bare as the wilderness  aloysius we will go with you we too will take those hands that are colder than ice and harder than diamonds  several monks we too we too  patrick bring us to the hands that are colder than ice and harder than diamonds  other monks pull them away pull them away from him       they are about to seize the monks who are with paul ruttledge  superior going between them back back i will have no scuffling here let the devil take his children if he has a mind to god will call his own       the monks fall back superior goes up to altar takes the cross      from it and turns standing on the steps  superior father aloysius come to me here aloysius takes paul ruttledges hand father bartley father colman they go nearer to paul ruttledge father patrick a friar comes towards him kneel down father patrick kneels father clement father nestor father james  leave the hereticyou are on the very edge of the pit your shoes are growing red hot  a friar i am afraid i am afraid he kneels  superior kneel down return to your god several monks kneel  colman they have deserted us  paul ruttledge many will forsake the truth before the world is pulled down stretching out his arms over his head i pulled down my own house now i go out to pull down the world  superior strip off those holy habits  paul ruttledge taking off his habit one by one i am plucking off the rags and tatters of the world     act v        scene smooth level grass near the shannon ecclesiastical ruins      a part of which have been roofed in rocky plain in the distance      with a river father colman sorting some bundles of osiers       aloysius enters with an empty bag  colman you are the first to come back aloysius where is brother bartley  aloysius he parted from me at the cross roads and went on to preach at shanaglish he should soon be back now  colman have you anything in the bag  aloysius nothing throws the bag down it doesnt seem as if our luck was growing we have but food enough to last till tomorrow we have hardly that the rats from the river got at the few potatoes i gathered from the farmers at lisheen last week in the corner where they were  colman this is the first day you got nothing at all maybe you didnt ask the right way  aloysius i asked for alms for the sake of the love of god but the first place where i asked it the man of the house was giving me a handful of meal and the woman came and called out that we were serving the devil in the name of god and she drove me from the door  colman it is since the priests preached against us they say that did you go on to lisheen they used always to treat us well there  aloysius i did but i got on no better there  colman that is a wonder after the woman that had the jaundice being cured with prayers by brother paul  aloysius thats just it if he did cure her they say the two best of her husbands bullocks died of the blackwater the next day and he was no way thankful to us after that  colman did you try the houses along the bog road  aloysius i did and the children coming back from school called out after me and asked who was it did away with the widow clorans cow  colman the widow clorans cow  aloysius that was the cow that died after grazing in the ruins here  colman if it did it was because of an old boot it picked up and ate and that never belonged to us  aloysius i wish we had something ourselves to eat they should be sitting down to their dinner in the monastery now they will be having a good dinner today to carry them over the fast tomorrow  colman i am thinking sometimes brother paul should give more thought to us than he does it is all very well for him he is so taken up with his thoughts and his visions he doesnt know if he is full or fasting  aloysius he has such holy thoughts and visions no one would like to trouble him he ought not to be in the world at all or to do the worlds work  colman so long as he is in the world he must give some thought to it there must be something wrong in the way he is doing things now i thought he would have had half ireland with him by this time with his great preaching but someway when he preaches to the people they dont seem to mind him much  aloysius he is too far above them they have not education to understand him  colman they understand me well enough when i give my mind to it but it is harder to preach now than it was in the monastery we had something to offer then absolution here and heaven after  aloysius isnt it enough for them to hear that the kingdom of heaven is within them and that if they do the right meditations  colman what can poor people that have their own troubles on them get from a few words like that they hear at a cross road or a market and the wind maybe blowing them away if we could gather them together now look aloysius at these sally rods i have a plan in my mind about them       he has stuck some of the rods in the ground and begins weaving      others through them  aloysius are you going to make baskets like you did in the monastery schools  colman we must make something if we are to live but it is more than that i was thinking of we might coax some of the youngsters to come and learn the basket making it would make them take to us better if we could put them in the way of earning a few pence  aloysius taking up some of the osiers and beginning to twist them that might be a good way to come at them they could work through the day and at evening we could tell them how to repeat the words till the light comes inside their heads but would paul think well of it he is more for pulling down than building up  colman when i explain it to him i am sure he will think well of it he cant go on for ever without anyone to listen to him  aloysius i suppose not and with no way of living but i dont know im afraid he wont like it  colman hush here he is coming  aloysius if one had a plan now for doing some destruction  colman hush dont you see there is somebody with him                                            paul ruttledge comes in with charlie ward  paul ruttledge this is charlie ward my old friend  aloysius the charlie ward you lived on the roads with  paul ruttledge yes when i went looking for the favour of my hard mother earth he helped me he is her good child and she loves him  colman he is welcome how did he find you out  paul ruttledge i dont know how did you find me out charlie  charlie ward oh i didnt lose sight of you so much as you thought i had to stop away from gortmore a good while after we left you at the gate but i sent paddy cockfight one time to get news and he mended cans for the laundry of the monastery and they told him you were well again and a monk as good as the rest but a while ago i got word there was a monk had gone near to break up the whole monastery with his talk and his piety and i said to myself thats paul and then i heard there was a monk had been driven out for not keeping the rules and i said to myself thats paul and the other day when whats left of us came to athlone i heard talk of some disfrocked monks that were upsetting the whole neighbourhood and i said thats paul to sabina silver i said that that merry chap paul i said  paul ruttledge im afraid you have a very bad opinion of me charlie well maybe i earned it  aloysius you cannot know much of him if you have a bad opinion of him he will be made a saint some day  charlie ward he will if theres such a thing as a saint of mischief  paul ruttledge a saint of mischief well why not that as well as another he would upset all the beehives he would throw them into the marketplace sit down now charlie and eat a bit with us  colman you are welcome indeed to all we can give you but we have not a bit of food that is worth offering you aloysius got nothing at all in the villages today brother paul the people are getting cross  paul ruttledge well sit down anyway the country people liked me well enough once there was no man they liked so much as myself when i gave them drink for nothing didnt they charlie  charlie ward oh that was a great time they were lying thick about the roads ill be thinking of it to my dying day  paul ruttledge i have given them another kind of drink now  charlie ward what sort of a drink is that  paul ruttledge we have rolled a great barrel out of a cellar that is under the earth we have rolled it right into the midst of them he moves his hand about as if he were moving a barrel its heavy and when they have drunk what is in it i would like to see the man that would be their master  charlie ward that would be a great drink but i wouldnt be sure that youre in earnest  paul ruttledge colman and aloysius will tell you all about it it was made in a good still the barley was grown in a field thats down under the earth  charlie ward thats likely enough i often heard of places like that  paul ruttledge and when they have drunk from my barrel they will break open the door they will put law and number under their two feet and they will have a hot palm and a cold palm for they will put down the moon and the sun with their two hands  charlie ward theres no mistake but youre the same paul still nice and plain and simple only for your hard talk and what about the rheumatism its hardly you got through that fit you had and you dont look as if much hardship would agree with you now  aloysius he does not indeed and if he doesnt kill himself one way he will another wait now till i tell you the way he is living i dont think he tasted bit or sup today and all he had last night was a couple of dry potatoes  charlie ward is that so takes paul ruttledges arm you havent much more flesh on you than a crane in moonlight they dont seem to have much notion of minding you here you that were reared soft it would be better for you to come back to us bad as our lodging is thered be a bit in the pot for you and sabina to care you its she would give you a good welcome  colman starting up we can mind him well enough here i have a plan we havent been getting on the way we ought with the people its no way to be getting on with people to be asking things of them always they have no opinion at all of us seeing us the way we are they have no notion of the respect they should show to brother paul and the way all the brothers used to be listening to his preaching and the townspeople as well and i myself the time i preached in dublin  aloysius yes indeed paul think of the great crowds used to come when you preached in the abbey church and all the money that was gathered that time of the mission  paul ruttledge yes i used to like once to see all the faces looking up at me but now all that is gone from me now i think it is enough to be a witness for the truth and to think the thoughts i like god will bring the people to me he will make of my silence a great wind that will shatter the ships of the world  colman that is all very well but the people are not coming  aloysius and more than that they are driving us away from their doors now paul  charlie ward the way they do to us but paul was not born on the roads lights his pipe  colman its no use stopping waiting for a wind if we have anything to say thats worth the people listening to we must bring them to hear it one way or another now it is what i was saying to aloysius we must begin teaching them to make things they never had the chance of any instruction of the sort here  paul ruttledge to make things this sort of things takes the halfmade basket from colman  colman those and other things we got a good training in the old days and well get a grant from the technical board the board pays up to four hundred pounds to some of its instructors  paul ruttledge and then  aloysius oh then well sell all the things we make im sure well get a market for them  paul ruttledge oh i understand you will sell them and what about the dividing of the money you will need to make laws about that  colman of course we will have to make rules and to pay according to work  paul ruttledge oh we will grow quite rich in time what are we to do then we cant go on living in this ruin  colman of course not well build workshops and houses for those who come to work from a distance good houses slated not thatched  paul ruttledge turning to aloysius and charlie ward yes you see his plan to gather the people together to build houses for them to make them rich too and to keep their money safe and the kingdom of god too what about that  colman oh im just coming to that they will think so much more of our teaching when we have got them under our influence by other things of course we will teach them their meditations and give them a regular religious life we must settle out some little place for them to pray intheres a high gable over there where we could hang a bell  paul ruttledge oh yes i understand you would weave them together like this weaves the osiers in and out you would add one thing to another laws and money and church and bells till you had got everything back again that you have escaped from but it is my business to tear things asunder like this tears pieces from the basket and this and this  aloysius i told him youd never agree to it he ought to have known that himself  colman we must have something to offer the people  paul ruttledge you say that because you got nothing today aloysius has got nothing in his sack taking sack and turning it upside down it is quite empty every religious teacher before me has offered something to his followers but i offer them nothing plunging his arm down into the sack my sack is quite empty i will never dip my hand into natures full sack of illusions i am tired of that old conjuring bag he walks up and down muttering  charlie ward to colman you may as well give up trying to settle him down to anything he was a tinker once and hell be a tinker always he has got the wandering into his blood will you come back to the roads paul to your old friends and to sabina  paul ruttledge sitting down beside him ah my old friends they were very kind to me but these friends too are very kind to me  charlie ward well come and see them anyway theyll be glad to see you those that are left of us  paul ruttledge those that are left of you where are the others  charlie ward some are dead and some are jailed and some are on the roads here and there sabina is with us always and johneen is a great hand with the tools now but tommy the song  paul ruttledge oh tommy the song does he pray still he was beginning to pray did he ever get an answer  charlie ward well i dont know about an answer but i believe he heard something one night beside an old thorn tree some sort of a voice it was  paul ruttledge a voice what did it say to him did he see anything we have learned too much our minds are like troubled waterwe get nothing but broken images he who knew nothing may have seen all is he praying still  charlie ward if he is its in galway gaol hes praying with or without a thorn tree  paul ruttledge did he tell no one what the voice said to him  charlie ward he did not unless he might have told johneen or some other one  paul ruttledge i will go with you and see them gets up  colman to aloysius with whom he has been whispering take care but if he goes back to his old friends hell stop with them and leave us  aloysius putting his hand on paul ruttledges arm dont go brother paul till i talk to you awhile  paul ruttledge do you want me well charlie i will stay here i wont go but bring all the rest to see me i want to ask them about that vision  charlie ward ill bring one of them anyway exit  aloysius brother paul it is what i am thinking now the tinkers have come back to you you could begin to gather a sort of an army you cant fight your battle without an army they could call to the other tinkers and the tramps and the beggars and the sievemakers and all the wandering people it would be a great army  paul ruttledge yes that would be a great army a great wandering army  aloysius the people would be afraid to refuse us then we would march on  paul ruttledge yes we could march on we could march on the towns and we could break up all settled order we could bring back the old joyful dangerous individual life we would have banners we would each have a banner banners with angels upon themwe will march upon the world with banners  colman we would not be in want of food then we could take all we wanted  aloysius we could take all we wanted we would be too many to put in gaol all the people would join us in the end you would be able to persuade them all brother paul you would be their leader we would make great stores of food  paul ruttledge we will have one great banner that will go in front it will take two men to carry it and on it we will have laughter with his iron claws and his wings of brass and his eyes like sapphires  aloysius that will be the banner for the front we will have different troops we will have captains to organize them to give them orders  paul ruttledge standing up to organize that is to bring in law and number organizeorganizethat is how all the mischief has been done i was forgetting we cannot destroy the world with armies it is inside our minds that it must be destroyed it must be consumed in a moment inside our minds god will accomplish his last judgment first in one mans mind and then in another he is always planning last judgments and yet it takes a long time and that is why he laments in the wind and in the reeds and in the cries of the curlews  colman i think we had better go down to the river and see are there
