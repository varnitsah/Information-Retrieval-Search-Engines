small maynard  company       but in silence in dreams projections   while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on   so soon what is over forgotten and waves wash the imprints off the       sand   with hinged knees returning i enter the doors while for you up there   whoever you are follow without noise and be of strong heart    i onward go i stop   with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds   i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable   one turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy i never knew you   yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that would       save you    i am faithful i do not give out   the fracturd thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen   these and more i dress with impassive hand yet deep in my breast a       fire a burning flame    thus in silence in dreams projections   returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals   the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand   i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young   some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad   many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossd and rested   many a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips    the wound dresser     preface   as introduction to these letters from walt whitman to his mother i have availed myself of three of whitmans communications to the press covering the time during which the material which composes this volume was being written these communications parts of which but in no case the whole were used by whitman in his memoranda of the secession war seem to me to form in spite of certain duplications which to my mind have the force not the weakness of repetition quite an ideal background to the letters to mrs whitman since they give a full and free description of the circumstances and surroundings in the midst of which those were composed readers who desire a still more extended account of the man himself his work and environment at that time may consult with profit the editors walt whitman pp 3444 oconnors good gray poet included in that volume pp 99130 specimen days pp 2663 included in walt whitmans complete prose works and above all the section of leaves of grass called drumtaps i do not believe that it is in the power of any man now living to make an important addition to the vivid picture of those days and nights in the hospitals drawn by whitman himself and to be found in his published prose and verse and above all in the living words of the present letters to his mother these last were written on the spot as the scenes and incidents in all their living and sombre colors passed before his eyes while his mind and heart were full of the sights and sounds the episodes and agonies of those terrible hours how could any one writing in cold blood today hope to add words of any value to those he wrote then  perhaps in conclusion it may be as well to repeat what was said in the introduction to a former volumethat these letters make no pretensions as literature they are as indeed is all that whitman has written as he himself has over and over again said something quite different from thatsomething much less to the average cultured and learned man something much more to the man or woman who comes within range of their attraction but doubtless the critics will still insist that if they are not literature they ought to be or otherwise should not be printed failing as is their wont to comprehend that there are other qualities and characteristics than the literary some of them as important and as valuable which may be more or less adequately conveyed by print  r m b     contents                                           page    the great army of the wounded            1    life among fifty thousand soldiers      11

convalescent camps etc in washington and its neighborhood sometimes contain over fifty thousand sick and wounded men every form of wound the mere sight of some of them having been known to make a tolerably hardy visitor faint away every kind of malady like a long procession with typhoid fever and diarrhoea at the head as leaders are here in steady motion the soldiers hospital how many sleepless nights how many womens tears how many long and waking hours and days of suspense from every one of the middle eastern and western states have concentrated here our own new york in the form of hundreds and thousands of her young men may consider herself herepennsylvania ohio indiana and all the west and northwest the sameand all the new england states the same  upon a few of these hospitals i have been almost daily calling as a missionary on my own account for the sustenance and consolation of some of the most needy cases of sick and dying men for the last two months one has much to learn to do good in these places great tact is required these are not like other hospitals by far the greatest proportion i should say five sixths of the patients are american young men intelligent of independent spirit tender feelings used to a hardy and healthy life largely the farmers are represented by their sonslargely the mechanics and workingmen of the cities then they are soldiers all these points must be borne in mind  people through our northern cities have little or no idea of the great and prominent feature which these military hospitals and convalescent camps make in and around washington there are not merely two or three or a dozen but some fifty of them of different degrees of capacity some have a thousand and more patients the newspapers here find it necessary to print every day a directory of the hospitalsa long list something like what a directory of the churches would be in new york philadelphia or boston  the government which really tries i think to do the best and quickest it can for these sad necessities is gradually settling down to adopt the plan of placing the hospitals in clusters of onestory wooden barracks with their accompanying tents and sheds for cooking and all needed purposes taking all things into consideration no doubt these are best adapted to the purpose better than using churches and large public buildings like the patent office these sheds now adopted are long onestory edifices sometimes ranged along in a row with their heads to the street and numbered either alphabetically wards a or b c d and so on or wards 1 2 3 etc the middle one will be marked by a flagstaff and is the office of the establishment with rooms for the ward surgeons etc one of these sheds or wards will contain sixty cots sometimes on an emergency they move them close together and crowd in more some of the barracks are larger with of course more inmates frequently there are tents more comfortable here than one might think whatever they may be down in the army  each ward has a wardmaster and generally a nurse for every ten or twelve men a ward surgeon has generally two wardsalthough this varies some of the wards have a woman nurse the armorysquare wards have some very good ones the one in ward e is one of the best  a few weeks ago the vast area of the second story of that noblest of washington buildings the patent office was crowded close with rows of sick badly wounded and dying soldiers they were placed in three very large apartments i went there several times it was a strange solemn and with all its features of suffering and death a sort of fascinating sight i went sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular cases some i found needed a little cheering up and friendly consolation at that time for they went to sleep better afterwards two of the immense apartments are filled with high and ponderous glass cases crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil machine or invention it ever entered into the mind of man to conceive and with curiosities and foreign presents between these cases were lateral openings perhaps eight feet wide and quite deep and in these were placed many of the sick besides a great long double row of them up and down through the middle of the hall many of them were very bad cases wounds and amputations then there was a gallery running above the hall in which there were beds also it was indeed a curious scene at night when lit up the glass cases the beds the sick the gallery above and the marble pavement under foot the suffering and the fortitude to bear it in the various degrees occasionally from some the groan that could not be repressed sometimes a poor fellow dying with emaciated face and glassy eyes the nurse by his side the doctor also there but no friend no relativesuch were the sights but lately in the patent office the wounded have since been removed from there and it is now vacant again  of course there are among these thousands of prostrated soldiers in hospital here all sorts of individual cases on recurring to my notebook i am puzzled which cases to select to illustrate the average of these young men and their experiences i may here say too in general terms that i could not wish for more candor and manliness among all their sufferings than i find among them  take this case in ward 6 campbell hospital a young man from plymouth county massachusetts a farmers son aged about twenty or twentyone a soldierly american young fellow but with sensitive and tender feelings most of december and january last he lay very low and for quite a while i never expected he would recover he had become prostrated with an obstinate diarrhoea his stomach would hardly keep the least thing down he was vomiting half the time but that was hardly the worst of it let me tell his storyit is but one of thousands  he had been some time sick with his regiment in the field in front but did his duty as long as he could was in the battle of fredericksburg soon after was put in the regimental hospital he kept getting worsecould not eat anything they had there the doctor told him nothing could be done for him there the poor fellow had fever also received perhaps it could not be helped little or no attention lay on the ground getting worse toward the latter part of december very much enfeebled he was sent up from the front from falmouth station in an open platform car such as hogs are transported upon north and dumped with a crowd of others on the boat at aquia creek falling down like a rag where they deposited him too weak and sick to sit up or help himself at all no one spoke to him or assisted him he had nothing to eat or drink was used amid the great crowds of sick either with perfect indifference or as in two or three instances with heartless brutality  on the boat when night came and when the air grew chilly he tried a long time to undo the blankets he had in his knapsack but was too feeble he asked one of the employees who was moving around deck for a moments assistance to get the blankets the man asked him back if he could not get them himself he answered no he had been trying for more than half an hour and found himself too weak the man rejoined he might then go without them and walked off so h lay chilled and damp on deck all night without anything under or over him while two good blankets were within reach it caused him a great injurynearly cost him his life  arrived at washington he was brought ashore and again left on the wharf or above it amid the great crowds as before without any nourishmentnot a drink for his parched mouth no kind hand had offered to cover his face from the forenoon sun conveyed at last some two miles by the ambulance to the hospital and assigned a bed bed 49 ward 6 campbell hospital january and february 1863 he fell down exhausted upon the bed but the wardmaster he has since been changed came to him with a growling order to get up the rules he said permitted no man to lie down in that way with his own clothes on he must sit upmust first go to the bathroom be washed and have his clothes completely changed a very good rule properly applied he was taken to the bathroom and scrubbed well with cold water the attendants callous for a while were soon alarmed for suddenly the halffrozen and lifeless body fell limpsy in their hands and they hurried it back to the cot plainly insensible perhaps dying  poor boy the long train of exhaustion deprivation rudeness no food no friendly word or deed but all kinds of upstart airs and impudent unfeeling speeches and deeds from all kinds of small officials and some big ones cutting like razors into that sensitive heart had at last done the job he now lay at times out of his head but quite silent asking nothing of any one for some days with death getting a closer and a surer grip upon him he cared not or rather he welcomed death his heart was broken he felt the struggle to keep up any longer to be useless god the world humanityall had abandoned him it would feel so good to shut his eyes forever on the cruel things around him and toward him  as luck would have it at this time i found him i was passing down ward no 6 one day about dusk 4th january i think and noticed his glassy eyes with a look of despair and hopelessness sunk low in his thin pallidbrown young face one learns to divine quickly in the hospital and as i stopped by him and spoke some commonplace remark to which he made no reply i saw as i looked that it was a case for ministering to the affection first and other nourishment and medicines afterward i sat down by him without any fuss talked a little soon saw that it did him good led him to talk a little himself got him somewhat interested wrote a letter for him to his folks in massachusetts to l h campbell plymouth county soothed him down as i saw he was getting a little too much agitated and tears in his eyes gave him some small gifts and told him i should come again soon he has told me since that this little visit at that hour just saved him a day more and it would have been perhaps too late  of course i did not forget him for he was a young fellow to interest any one he remained very sickvomiting much every day frequent diarrhoea and also something like bronchitis the doctor said for a while i visited him almost every day cheered him up took him some little gifts and gave him small sums of money he relished a drink of new milk when it was brought through the ward for sale for a couple of weeks his condition was uncertainsometimes i thought there was no chance for him at all but of late he is doing betteris up and dressed and goes around more and more february 21 every day he will not die but will recover  the other evening passing through the ward he called mehe wanted to say a few words particular i sat down by his side on the cot in the dimness of the long ward with the wounded soldiers there in their beds ranging up and down h told me i had saved his life he was in the deepest earnest about it it was one of those things that repay a soldiers hospital missionary a thousandfoldone of the hours he never forgets  a benevolent person with the right qualities and tact cannot perhaps make a better investment of himself at present anywhere upon the varied surface of the whole of this big world than in these military hospitals among such thousands of most interesting young men the army is very youngand so much more american than i supposed reader how can i describe to you the mute appealing look that rolls and moves from many a manly eye from many a sick cot following you as you walk slowly down one of these wards to see these and to be incapable of responding to them except in a few cases so very few compared to the whole of the suffering men is enough to make ones heart crack i go through in some cases cheering up the men distributing now and then little sums of moneyand regularly letterpaper and envelopes oranges tobacco jellies etc etc  many things invite comment and some of them sharp criticism in these hospitals the government as i said is anxious and liberal in its practice toward its sick but the work has to be left in its personal application to the men to hundreds of officials of one grade or another about the hospitals who are sometimes entirely lacking in the right qualities there are tyrants and shysters in all positions and especially those dressed in subordinate authority some of the ward doctors are careless rude capricious needlessly strict one i found who prohibited the men from all enlivening amusements i found him sending men to the guardhouse for the most trifling offence in general perhaps the officialsespecially the new ones with their straps or badgesput on too many airs of all places in the world the hospitals of american young men and soldiers wounded in the volunteer service of their country ought to be exempt from mere conventional military airs and etiquette of shoulderstraps but they are not exempt  w w  from the new york times february 26 1863     life among fifty thousand soldiers   our brooklyn people not only from having so many hundreds of their own kith and kin and almost everybody some friend or acquaintance here in the clustering military hospitals of washington would doubtless be glad to get some account of these establishments but also to satisfy that compound of benevolence and generosity which marks brooklyn i have sometimes thought more than any other city in the world a military hospital here in washington is a little city by itself and contains a larger population than most of the wellknown country towns down in the queens and suffolk county portions of long island i say one of the government hospitals here is a little city in itself and there are some fifty of these hospitals in the district of columbia alone in them are collected the tens of thousands of sick and wounded soldiers the legacies of many a bloody battle and of the exposure of two years of camp life i find these places full of significance they have taken up my principal time and labor for some months past imagine a long onestory wooden shed like a short wide ropewalk well whitewashed then cluster ten or a dozen of these together with several smaller sheds and tents and you have the soldiers hospital as generally adopted here it will contain perhaps six or seven hundred men or perhaps a thousand and occasionally more still there is a regular staff and a substaff of big and little officials military etiquette is observed and it is getting to become very stiff i shall take occasion before long to show up some of this illfitting nonsense the harvest is large the gleaners few beginning at first with casual visits to these establishments to see some of the brooklyn men wounded or sick here i became by degrees more and more drawn in until i have now been for many weeks quite a devotee to the businessa regular selfappointed missionary to these thousands and tens of thousands of wounded and sick young men here left upon government hands many of them languishing many of them dying i am not connected with any society but go on my own individual account and to the work that appears to be called for almost every day and frequently in the evenings i visit in this informal way one after another of the wards of a hospital and always find cases enough where i can be of service cases enough do i say alas there is perhaps not one ward or tent out of the seven or eight hundred now hereabout filled with sick in which i am sure i might not profitably devote every hour of my life to the abstract work of consolation and sustenance for its suffering inmates and indeed beyond that a person feels that in some one of these crowded wards he would like to pick out two or three cases and devote himself wholly to them meanwhile however to do the best that is permitted i go around distributing myself and the contents of my pockets and haversack in infinitesimal quantities with faith that nearly all of it will somehow or other fall on good ground in many cases where i find a soldier dead broke and pretty sick i give half a tumbler of good jelly i carry a goodsized jar to a ward have it opened get a spoon and taking the head nurse in tow i go around and distribute it to the most appropriate cases to others i give an orange or an apple to others some spiced fruits to others a small quantity of pickles many want tobacco i do not encourage any of the boys in its use but where i find they crave it i supply them i always carry some cut up in small plugs in my pocket then i have commissions some new york or connecticut or other soldier will be going home on sick leave or perhaps discharged and i must fit him out with good new undershirt drawers stockings etc  but perhaps the greatest welcome is for writing paper envelopes etc i find these always a rare reliance when i go into a new ward i always carry two or three quires of paper and a good lot of envelopes and walk up and down and circulate them around to those who desire them then some will want pens pencils etc in some hospitals there is quite a plenty of reading matter but others where it is needed i supply  by these and like means one comes to be better acquainted with individual cases and so learns every day peculiar and interesting character and gets on intimate and soon affectionate terms with noble american young men and now is where the real good begins to be done after all here i will egotistically confess i like to flourish even in a medical point of view it is one of the greatest things and in a surgical point of view the same i can testify that friendship has literally cured a fever and the medicine of daily affection a bad wound in these sayings are the final secret of carrying out well the rôle of a hospital missionary for our soldiers which i tell for those who will understand them  as i write i have lying before me a little discarded notebook filled with memoranda of things wanted by the sickspecial cases i use up one of these little books in a week see from this sample for instance after walking through a ward or two bed 53 wants some liquorice bed 6erysipelasbring some raspberry vinegar to make a cooling drink with water bed 18 wants a good booka romance bed 25a manly friendly young fellow h d b of the twentyseventh connecticut an independent young soulrefuses money and eatables so i will bring him a pipe and tobacco for i see he much enjoys a smoke bed 45sore throat and coughwants horehound candy bed 11 when i come again dont forget to write a letter for him etc the wants are a long and varied list some need to be humored and forgotten others need to be especially remembered and obeyed one poor german dyingin the last stage of consumptionwished me to find him in washington a german lutheran clergyman and send him to him i did so one patient will want nothing but a toothpick another a comb and so on all whims are represented and all the states there are many new york state soldiers here also pennsylvanians i find of course many from massachusetts connecticut and all the new england states and from the western and northwestern states five sixths of the soldiers are young men  among other cases of young men from our own city of brooklyn i have encountered and have had much to do with in hospital here is john lowery wounded and arm amputated at fredericksburg i saw this young fellow down there last december immediately after the battle lying on a blanket on the ground the stump of his arm bandaged but he not a bit disheartened he was soon afterward sent up from the front by way of aquia creek and has for the past three months been in the campbell hospital here in ward 6 on the gain slowly but steadily he thinks a great deal of his physician here dr frank hinkle and as some fifty other soldiers in the ward do the same and bear testimony in their hearty gratitude and medical and surgical imprisonment to the quality of dr h i think he deserves honorable mention in this letter to the people of our cityespecially as another brooklyn soldier in ward 6 amos h vliet expresses the same feeling of obligation to the doctor for his faithfulness and kindness vliet and lowery both belong to that old war regiment whose flag has flaunted through more than a score of hotcontested battles the fiftyfirst new york colonel potter and it is to be remembered that no small portion of the fame of this old veteran regiment may be claimed near home for many of her officers and men are from brooklyn the friends of these two young soldiers will have a chance to talk to them soon in brooklyn i have seen a good deal of jack lowery and i find him and heard of him on the field as a brave soldierly fellow amos vliet too made a firstrate soldier he has had frozen feet pretty bad but now better occasionally i meet some of the brooklyn fourteenth in ward e of armory hospital i found a member of company c of that regiment isaac snyder he is now acting as nurse there and makes a very good one charles dean of co h of the same regiment is in ward a of armory acting as wardmaster i also got very well acquainted with a young man of the brooklyn fourteenth who lay sick some time in ward f he has lately got his discharge and gone home i have met with others in the hstreet and patentoffice hospitals colonel fowler of the fourteenth is in charge i believe of the convalescent camp at alexandria lieutenantcolonel debevoise is in brooklyn in poor health i am sorry to say thus the brooklyn invalids are scattered around  off in the mud a mile east of the capitol i found the other day in emory hospital there in ward c three brooklyn soldiersallen v king michael lally and patrick hennessy none of them however are very sick  at a rough guess i should say i have met from one hundred and fifty to two hundred young and middleaged men whom i specifically found to be brooklyn persons many of them i recognized as having seen their faces before and very many of them knew me some said they had known me from boyhood some would call to me as i passed down a ward and tell me they had seen me in brooklyn i have had this happen at night and have been entreated to stop and sit down and take the hand of a sick and restless boy and talk to him and comfort him awhile for old brooklyns sake  some pompous and every way improper persons of course get in power in hospitals and have full swing over the helpless soldiers there is great state kept at judiciarysquare hospital for instance an individual who probably has been waiter somewhere for years past has got into the high and mighty position of sergeantofarms at this hospital he is called red stripe from his artillery trimmings by the patients of whom he is at the same time the tyrant and the laughingstock going in to call on some sick new york soldiers here the other afternoon i was stopped and treated to a specimen of the airs of this powerful officer surely the government would do better to send such ablebodied loafers down into service in front where they could earn their rations than keep them here in the idle and shallow sinecures of military guard over a collection of sick soldiers to give insolence to their visitors and friends i found a shallow old person also here named dr hall who told me he had been eighteen years in the service i must give this judiciary establishment the credit from my visits to it of saying that while in all the other hospitals i met with general cordiality and deference among the doctors ward officers nurses etc i have found more impudence and more dandy doctorism and more needless airs at this judiciary than in all the twoscore other establishments in and around washington but the corps of management at the judiciary has a bad name anyhow and i only specify it here to put on record the general opinion and in hopes it may help in calling the attention of the government to a remedy for this hospital is half filled with new york soldiers many noble fellows and many sad and interesting cases of course there are exceptions of good officials here and some of the women nurses are excellent but the empire state has no reason to be oversatisfied with this hospital  but i should say in conclusion that the earnest and continued desire of the government and much devoted labor are given to make the military hospitals here as good as they can be considering all things i find no expense spared and great anxiety manifested in the highest quarters to do well by the national sick i meet with firstclass surgeons in charge of many of the hospitals and often the ward surgeons medical cadets and head nurses are fully faithful and competent dr bliss head of armorysquare and dr baxter head of campbell seem to me to try to do their best and to be excellent in their posts dr bowen one of the ward surgeons of armory i have known to fight as hard for many a poor fellows life under his charge as a lioness would fight for her young i mention such cases because i think they deserve it on public grounds  i thought i would include in my letter a few cases of soldiers especially interesting out of my notebook but i find that my story has already been spun out to sufficient length i shall continue here in washington for the present and maybe for the summer to work as a missionary after my own style among these hospitals for i find it in some respects curiously fascinating with all its sadness nor do i find it ended by my doing some good to the sick and dying soldiers they do me good in return more than i do them  w w  from the brooklyn eagle march 19 1863     hospital visits   as this tremendous war goes on the public interest becomes more general and gathers more and more closely about the wounded the sick and the government hospitals the surgeons and all appertaining to the medical department of the army up to the date of this writing december 9 1864 there have been as i estimate near four hundred thousand cases under treatment and there are today probably taking the whole service of the united states two hundred thousand or an approximation to that number on the doctors list half of these are comparatively slight ailments or hurts every family has directly or indirectly some representative among this vast army of the wounded and sick  the following sketch is made to gratify the general interest in this field of the war and also for a few special persons through whose means alone i have aided the men it extends over a period of two years coming down to the present hour and exhibits the army hospitals at washington the camp hospitals in the field etc a very few cases are given as specimens of thousands the account may be relied upon as faithful though rapidly thrown together it will put the reader in as direct contact as may be with scenes sights and cases of these immense hospitals as will be seen it begins back two years since at a very gloomy period of the contest  began my visits december 21 1862 among the camp hospitals in the army of the potomac under general burnside spent a good part of the day in a large brick mansion on the banks of the rappahannock immediately opposite fredericksburg it is used as a hospital since the battle and seems to have received only the worst cases outdoors at the foot of a tree within ten yards of the front of the house i notice a heap of amputated feet legs arms hands etcabout a load for a onehorse cart several dead bodies lie near each covered with its brown woollen blanket in the dooryard toward the river are fresh graves mostly of officers their names on pieces of barrel staves or broken board stuck in the dirt most of these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported north to their friends  the house is quite crowded everything impromptu no system all bad enough but i have no doubt the best that can be done all the wounds pretty bad some frightful the men in their old clothes unclean and bloody some of the wounded are rebel officers prisoners one a mississippiana captainhit badly in the leg i talked with some time he asked me for papers which i gave him i saw him three months afterward in washington with leg amputated doing well  i went through the rooms down stairs and up some of the men were dying i had nothing to give at that visit but wrote a few letters to folks home mothers etc also talked to three or four who seemed most susceptible to it and needing it  december 22 to 31am among the regimental brigade and division hospitals somewhat few at home realize that these are merely tents and sometimes very poor ones the wounded lying on the ground lucky if their blanket is spread on a layer of pine or hemlock twigs or some leaves no cots seldom even a mattress on the ground it is pretty cold i go around from one case to another i do not see that i can do any good but i cannot leave them once in a while some youngster holds on to me convulsively and i do what i can for him at any rate stop with him and sit near him for hours if he wishes it  besides the hospitals i also go occasionally on long tours through the camps talking with the men etc sometimes at night among the groups around the fires in their shebang enclosures of bushes i soon get acquainted anywhere in camp with officers or men and am always well used sometimes i go down on picket with the regiments i know best  as to rations the army here at present seems to be tolerably well supplied and the men have enough such as it is most of the regiments lodge in the flimsy little shelter tents a few have built themselves huts of logs and mud with fireplaces  i might give a long list of special cases interesting items of the wounded men here but have not space  left falmouth january 1863 by aquia creek railroad and so on government steamer up the potomac many wounded were with us on cars and boat the cars were just common platform ones the railroad journey of ten or twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise the soldiers guarding the road came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair and halfawake look those on duty were walking their posts some on banks over us others down far below the level of the track i saw large cavalry camps off the road at aquia creek landing were numbers of wounded going north while i waited some three hours i went around among them several wanted word sent home to parents brothers wives etc which i did for them by mail the next day from washington on the boat i had my hands full one poor fellow died going up  am now january february etc 1863 in and around washington daily visiting the hospitals am much in campbell patentoffice eighthstreet hstreet armorysquare and others am now able to do a little good having money as almoner of others home and getting experience i would like to give lists of cases for there is no end to the interesting ones but it is impossible without making a large volume or rather several volumes i must therefore let one or two days visits at this time suffice as specimens of scores and hundreds of subsequent ones through the ensuing spring summer and fall and indeed down to the present week  sunday january 25afternoon and till 9 in the evening visited campbell hospital attended specially to one case in ward i very sick with pleurisy and typhoid fever young man farmers sond f russell company e sixtieth new yorkdownhearted and feeble a long time before he would take any interest soothed and cheered him gently wrote a letter home to his mother in malone franklin county n y at his request gave him some fruit and one or two other gifts enveloped and directed his letter etc then went thoroughly through ward 6 observed every case in the ward without i think missing one found some cases i thought needed little sums of money supplied them sums of perhaps thirty twentyfive twenty or fifteen cents distributed a pretty bountiful supply of cheerful reading matter and gave perhaps some twenty to thirty persons each one some little gift such as oranges apples sweet crackers figs etc etc etc  thursday january 29devoted the main part of the day from 11 to 330 oclock to armorysquare hospital went pretty thoroughly through wards f g h and isome fifty cases in each ward in ward h supplied the men throughout with writing paper and a stamped envelope each also some cheerful reading matter distributed in small portions about half of it in this ward to proper subjects a large jar of firstrate preserved berries also other small gifts in wards g h and i found several cases i thought good subjects for small sums of money which i furnished in each case the poor wounded men often come up dead broke and it helps their spirits to have even the small sum i give them my paper and envelopes all gone but distributed a good lot of amusing reading matter also as i thought judicious tobacco oranges apples etc some very interesting cases in ward i charles miller bed no 19 company d fiftythird pennsylvania is only sixteen years of age very bright courageous boy left leg amputated below the knee next bed below him young lad very sickgave the two each appropriate gifts in the bed above also amputation of the left leggave him a part of a jar of raspberries bed no 1 this ward gave a small sum also also to a soldier on crutches sitting on his bed near  evening same daywent to see d f r campbell hospital before alluded to found him remarkably changed for the betterup and dressed quite a triumph he afterwards got well and went back to his regiment distributed in the wards a quantity of notepaper and forty or fifty mostly paid envelopes of which the men were much in need also a fourpound bag of gingersnaps i bought at a bakers in seventh street  here is a case of a soldier i found among the crowded cots in the patent hospitalthey have removed most of the men of late and broken up that hospital he likes to have some one to talk to and we will listen to him he got badly wounded in the leg and side at fredericksburg that eventful saturday 13th december he lay the succeeding two days and nights helpless on the field between the city and those grim batteries for his company and his regiment had been compelled to leave him to his fate to make matters worse he lay with his head slightly down hill and could not help himself at the end of some fifty hours he was brought off with other wounded under a flag of truce  we ask him how the rebels treated him during those two days and nights within reach of themwhether they came to himwhether they abused him he answers that several of the rebels soldiers and others came to him at one time and another a couple of them who were together spoke roughly and sarcastically but did no act one middleaged man however who seemed to be moving around the field among the dead and wounded for benevolent purposes came to him in a way he will never forget this man treated our soldier kindly bound up his wounds cheered him gave him a couple of biscuits gave him a drink of whiskey and water asked him if he could eat some beef this good secesh however did not change our soldiers position for it might have caused the blood to burst from the wounds where they were clotted and stagnated our soldier is from pennsylvania has had a pretty severe time the wounds proved to be bad ones but he retains a good heart and is at present on the gain  it is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way one two or even four or five days  i continue among the hospitals during march april etc without intermission my custom is to go through a ward or a collection of wards endeavoring to give some trifle to each without missing any even a sweet biscuit a sheet of paper or a passing word of friendliness or but a look or nod if no more in this way i go through large numbers without delaying yet do not hurry i find out the general mood of the ward at the time sometimes see that there is a heavy weight of listlessness prevailing and the whole ward wants cheering up i perhaps read to the men to break the spell calling them around me careful to sit away from the cot of any one who is very bad with sickness or wounds also i find out by going through in this way the cases that need special attention and can then devote proper time to them of course i am very cautious among the patients in giving them food i always confer with the doctor or find out from the nurse or wardmaster about a new case but i soon get sufficiently familiar with what is to be avoided and learn also to judge almost intuitively what is best  i do a good deal of writing letters by the bedside of coursewriting all kinds including love letters many sick and wounded soldiers have not written home to parents brothers sisters and even wives for one reason or another for a long long time some are poor writers some cannot get paper and envelopes many have an aversion to writing because they dread to worry the folks at homethe facts about them are so sad to tell i always encourage the men to write and promptly write for them  as i write this in may 1863 the wounded have begun to arrive from hookers command from bloody chancellorsville i was down among the first arrivals the men in charge of them told me the bad cases were yet to come if that is so i pity them for these are bad enough you ought to see the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here foot of sixth street at night two boatloads came about halfpast seven last night a little after eight it rained a long and violent shower the poor pale helpless soldiers had been debarked and lay around on the wharf and neighborhood anywhere the rain was probably grateful to them at any rate they were exposed to it  the few torches light up the spectacle all around on the wharf on the ground out on side places etc the men are lying on blankets old quilts etc with the bloody rags bound around their heads arms legs etc the attendants are few and at night few outsiders alsoonly a few hardworked transportation men and drivers the wounded are getting to be common and people grow callous the men whatever their condition lie there and patiently wait till their turn comes to be taken up near by the ambulances are now arriving in clusters and one after another is called to back up and take its load extreme cases are sent off on stretchers the men generally make little or no ado whatever their sufferingsa few groans that cannot be repressed and occasionally a scream of pain as they lift a man into the ambulance  today as i write hundreds more are expected and tomorrow and the next day more and so on for many days  the soldiers are nearly all young men and far more americans than is generally supposedi should say nine tenths are native born among the arrivals from chancellorsville i find a large proportion of ohio indiana and illinois men as usual there are all sorts of wounds some of the men are fearfully burnt from the explosion of artillery caissons one ward has a long row of officers some with ugly hurts yesterday was perhaps worse than usual amputations are going on the attendants are dressing wounds as you pass by you must be on your guard where you look i saw the other day a gentleman a visitor apparently from curiosity in one of the wards stop and turn a moment to look at an awful wound they were probing etc he turned pale and in a moment more he had fainted away and fallen on the floor  i buy during the hot weather boxes of oranges from time to time and distribute them among the men also preserved peaches and other fruits also lemons and sugar for lemonade tobacco is also much in demand large numbers of the men come up as usual without a cent of money through the assistance of friends in brooklyn and boston i am again able to help many of those that fall in my way it is only a small sum in each case but it is much to them as before i go around daily and talk with the men to cheer them up  my notebooks are full of memoranda of the cases of this summer and the wounded from chancellorsville but space forbids my transcribing them  as i sit writing this paragraph sundown thursday june 25 i see a train of about thirty huge fourhorse wagons used as ambulances filled with wounded passing up fourteenth street on their way probably to columbian carver and mount pleasant hospitals this is the way the men come in now seldom in small numbers but almost always in these long sad processions through the past winter while our army lay opposite fredericksburg the like strings of ambulances were of frequent occurrence along seventh street passing slowly up from the steamboat wharf from aquia creek  this afternoon july 22 1863 i spent a long time with a young man i have been with considerable named oscar f wilber company g one hundred fiftyfourth new york low with chronic diarrhoea and a bad wound also he asked me to read him a chapter in the new testament i complied and asked him what i should read he said make your own choice i opened at the close of one of the first books of the evangelists and read the chapters describing the latter hours of christ and the scenes at the crucifixion the poor wasted young man asked me to read the following chapter also how christ rose again i read very slowly for oscar was feeble it pleased him very much yet the tears were in his eyes he asked me if i enjoyed religion i said perhaps not my dear in the way you mean and yet maybe it is the same thing he said it is my chief reliance he talked of death and said he did not fear it i said why oscar dont you think you will get well he said i may but it is not probable he spoke calmly of his condition the wound was very bad it discharged much then the diarrhoea had prostrated him and i felt that he was even then the same as dying he behaved very manly and affectionate the kiss i gave him as i was about leaving he returned fourfold he gave me his mothers address mrs sally d wilber alleghany postoffice cattaraugus county n y i had several such interviews with him he died a few days after the one just described  august september october etci continue among the hospitals in the same manner getting still more experience and daily and nightly meeting with most interesting cases through the winter of 18634 the same the work of the army hospital visitor is indeed a trade an art requiring both experience and natural gifts and the greatest judgment a large number of the visitors to the hospitals do no good at all while many do harm the surgeons have great trouble from them some visitors go from curiosityas to a show of animals others give the men improper things then there are always some poor fellows in the crises of sickness or wounds that imperatively need perfect quietnot to be talked to by strangers few realize that it is not the mere giving of gifts that does good it is the proper adaption nothing is of any avail among the soldiers except conscientious personal investigation of cases each for itself with sharp critical faculties but in the fullest spirit of human sympathy and boundless love the men feel such love more than anything else i have met very few persons who realize the importance of humoring the yearnings for love and friendship of these american young men prostrated by sickness and wounds  february 1864i am down at culpepper and brandy station among the camp of first second and third corps and going through the division hospitals the condition of the camps here this winter is immensely improved from last winter near falmouth all the army is now in huts of logs and mud with fireplaces and the food is plentiful and tolerably good in the camp hospitals i find diarrhoea more and more prevalent and in chronic form it is at present the great disease of the army i think the doctors generally give too much medicine oftener making things worse then they hold on to the cases in camp too long when the disease is almost fixed beyond remedy they send it up to washington alas how many such wrecks have i seen landed from boat and railroad and deposited in the washington hospitals mostly but to linger awhile and die after being kept at the front too long  the hospitals in front this winter are also much improved the men have cots and often wooden floors and the tents are well warmed  march and april 1864back again in washington they are breaking up the camp hospitals in meades army preparing for a move as i write this in march there are all the signs yesterday and last night the sick were arriving here in long trains all day and night i was among the newcomers most of the night one train of a thousand came into the depot and others followed the ambulances were going all night distributing them to the various hospitals here when they come in some literally in a dying condition you may well imagine it is a lamentable sight i hardly know which is worse to see the wounded after a battle or these wasted wrecks  i remain in capital health and strength and go every day as before among the men in my own way enjoying my life and occupation more than i can tell  of the army hospitals now in and around washington there are thirty or forty i am in the habit of going to all and to fairfax seminary alexandria and over long bridge to the convalescent camp etc as a specimen of almost any one of these hospitals fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of ground on which are grouped ten or twelve very large wooden barracks with perhaps a dozen or twenty and sometimes more than that number of small buildings capable all together of accommodating from five hundred to a thousand or fifteen hundred persons sometimes these large wooden barracks or wards each of them perhaps from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet long are arranged in a straight row evenly fronting the street others are planned so as to form an immense v and others again arranged around a hollow square they make all together a huge cluster with the additional tents extra wards for contagious diseases guardhouses sutlers stores chaplains house etc in the middle will probably be an edifice devoted to the offices of the surgeon in charge and the ward surgeons principal attachés clerks etc then around this centre radiate or are gathered the wards for the wounded and sick  these wards are either lettered alphabetically ward g ward k or else numerically 1 2 3 etc each has its ward surgeon and corps of nurses of course there is in the aggregate quite a muster of employees and over all the surgeon in charge any one of these hospitals is a little city in itself take for instance the carver hospital out a couple of miles on a hill northern part of fourteenth street it has more inmates than an ordinary country town the same with the lincoln hospital east of the capitol or the finley hospital on high grounds northeast of the city both large establishments armorysquare hospital under dr bliss in seventh street one of the best anywhere is also temporarily enlarged this summer with additional tents sheds etc it must have nearly a hundred tents wards sheds and structures of one kind and another the worst cases are always to be found here a wanderer like me about washington pauses on some high land which commands the sweep of the city one never tires of the noble and ample views presented here in the generally fine soft peculiar air and light and has his eyes attracted by these white clusters of barracks in almost every direction they make a great show in the landscape and i often use them as landmarks some of these clusters are very full of inmates counting the whole with the convalescent camps whose inmates are often worse off than the sick in the hospitals they have numbered in this quarter and just down the potomac as high as fifty thousand invalid disabled or sick and dying men  my sketch has already filled up so much room that i shall have to omit any detailed account of the wounded of may and june 1864 from the battles of the wilderness spottsylvania etc that would be a long history in itself the arrivals the numbers and the severity of the wounds outviewed anything that we have seen before for days and weeks a melancholy tide set in upon us the weather was very hot the wounded had been delayed in coming and much neglected very many of the wounds had worms in them an unusual proportion mortified it was among these that for the first time in my life i began to be prostrated with real sickness and was before the close of the summer imperatively ordered north by the physician to recuperate and have an entire change of air  what i know of first fredericksburg chancellorsville wilderness etc makes clear to me that there has been and is yet a total lack of science in elastic adaptation to the needs of the wounded after a battle the hospitals are long afterward filled with proofs of this  i have seen many battles their results but never one where there was not during the first few days an unaccountable and almost total deficiency of everything for the woundedappropriate sustenance nursing cleaning medicines stores etc i do not say surgical attendance because the surgeons cannot do more than human endurance permits whatever pleasant accounts there may be in the papers of the north this is the actual fact no thorough previous preparation no system no foresight no genius always plenty of stores no doubt but always miles away never where they are needed and never the proper application of all harrowing experiences none is greater than that of the days following a heavy battle scores hundreds of the noblest young men on earth uncomplaining lie helpless mangled faint alone and so bleed to death or die from exhaustion either actually untouched at all or with merely the laying of them down and leaving them when there ought to be means provided to save them  the reader has doubtless inferred the fact that my visits among the wounded and sick have been as an independent missionary in my own style and not as an agent of any commission several noble women and men of brooklyn boston salem and providence have voluntarily supplied funds at times i only wish they could see a tithe of the actual work performed by their generous and benevolent assistance among the suffering men  he who goes among the soldiers with gifts etc must beware how he proceeds it is much more of an art than one would imagine they are not charitypatients but american young men of pride and independence the spirit in which you treat them and bestow your donations is just as important as the gifts themselves sometimes more so then there is continual discrimination necessary each case requires some peculiar adaptation to itself it is very important to slight nobodynot a single case some hospital visitors especially the women pick out the handsomest looking soldiers or have a few for their pets of course some will attract you more than others and some will need more attention than others but be careful not to ignore any patient a word a friendly turn of the eye or touch of the hand in passing if nothing more  one hot day toward the middle of june i gave the inmates of carver hospital a general icecream treat purchasing a large quantity and going around personally through the wards to see to its distribution  here is a characteristic scene in a ward it is sunday afternoon middle of summer 1864 hot and oppressive and very silent through the ward i am taking care of a critical case now lying in a half lethargy near where i sit is a suffering rebel from the eighth louisiana his name is irving he has been here a long time badly wounded and lately had his leg amputated it is not doing very well right opposite me is a sick soldier boy laid down with his clothes on sleeping looking much wasted his pallid face on his arm i see by the yellow trimming on his jacket that he is a cavalry boy he looks so handsome as he sleeps one must needs go nearer to him i step softly over and find by his card that he is named william cone of the first maine cavalry and his folks live in skowhegan  well poor john mahay is dead he died yesterday his was a painful and lingering case i have been with him at times for the past fifteen months he belonged to company a one hundred and first new york and was shot through the lower region of the abdomen at second bull run august 1862 one scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of nearly two years the bladder had been perforated by a bullet going entirely through him not long since i sat a good part of the morning by his bedside ward e armorysquare the water ran out of his eyes from the intense pain and the muscles of his face were distorted but he utters nothing except a low groan now and then hot moist cloths were applied and relieved him somewhat poor mahay a mere boy in age but old in misfortune he never knew the love of parents was placed in his infancy in one of the new york charitable institutions and subsequently bound out to a tyrannical master in sullivan county the scars of whose cowhide and club remained yet on his back his wound here was a most disagreeable one for he was a gentle cleanly and affectionate boy he found friends in his hospital life and indeed was a universal favorite he had quite a funeral ceremony  through fourteenth street to the river and then over the long bridge and some three miles beyond is the huge collection called the convalescent camp it is a respectable sized army in itself for these hospitals tents sheds etc at times contain from five to ten thousand men of course there are continual changes large squads are sent off to their regiments or elsewhere and new men received sometimes i found large numbers of paroled returned prisoners here  during october november and december 1864 i have visited the military hospitals about new york city but have not room in this article to describe these visits  i have lately been november 25 in the centralpark hospital near one hundred and fourth street it seems to be a wellmanaged institution during september and previously went many times to the brooklyn city hospital in raymond street where i found taken in by contract a number of wounded and sick from the army most of the men were badly off and without a cent of money many wanting tobacco i supplied them and a few special cases with delicacies also repeatedly with letterpaper stamps envelopes etc writing the addresses myself plainlya pleased crowd gathering around me as i directed for each one in turn this brooklyn hospital is a bad place for soldiers or anybody else cleanliness proper nursing watching etc are more deficient than in any hospital i know for dinner on sundays i invariably found nothing but rice and molasses the men all speak well of drs yale and kissam for kindness patience etc and i think from what i saw there are also young medical men in its management otherwise this is the poorest hospital i have been in out of many hundreds  among places apart from soldiers visited lately december 7 i must specially mention the great brooklyn general hospital and other public institutions at flatbush including the extensive lunatic asylum under charge of drs chapin and reynolds of the latter and i presume i might include these county establishments generally i have deliberately to put on record about the profoundest satisfaction with professional capacity completeness of house arrangements to ends required and the right vital spirit animating all that i have yet found in any public curative institution among civilians  in washington in camp and everywhere i was in the habit of reading to the men they were very fond of it and liked declamatory poetical pieces miles oreillys pieces were also great favorites i have had many happy evenings with the men we would gather in a large group by ourselves after supper and spend the time in such readings or in talking and occasionally by an amusing game called the game of twenty questions  for nurses middleaged women and mothers of families are best i am compelled to say young ladies however refined educated and benevolent do not succeed as army nurses though their motives are noble neither do the catholic nuns among these homeborn american young men mothers full of motherly feeling and however illiterate but bringing reminiscences of home and with the magnetic touch of hands are the true women nurses many of the wounded are between fifteen and twenty years of age  i should say that the government from my observation is always full of anxiety and liberality toward the sick and wounded the system in operation in the permanent hospitals is good and the money flows without stint but the details have to be left to hundreds and thousands of subordinates and officials among these laziness heartlessness gouging and incompetency are more or less prevalent still i consider the permanent hospitals generally well conducted  a very large proportion of the wounded come up from the front without a cent of money in their pockets i soon discovered that it was about the best thing i could do to raise their spirits and show them that somebody cared for them and practically felt a fatherly or brotherly interest in them to give them small sums in such cases using tact and discretion about it  a large majority of the wounds are in the arms and legs but there is every kind of wound in every part of the body i should say of the sick from my experience in the hospitals that the prevailing maladies are typhoid fever and the camp fevers generally diarrhoea catarrhal affections and bronchitis rheumatism and pneumonia these forms of sickness lead all the rest follow there are twice as many sick as there are wounded the deaths range from six to ten per cent of those under treatment  i must bear my most emphatic testimony to the zeal manliness and professional spirit and capacity generally prevailing among the surgeons many of them young men in the hospitals and the army i will not say much about the exceptions for they are few but i have met some of those few and very foolish and airish they were i never ceased to find the best young men and the hardest and most disinterested workers among these surgeons in the hospitals they are full of genius too i have seen many hundreds of them and this is my testimony  during my two years in the hospitals and upon the field i have made over six hundred visits and have been as i estimate among from eighty thousand to one hundred thousand of the wounded and sick as sustainer of spirit and body in some slight degree in their time of need these visits varied from an hour or two to all day or night for with dear or critical cases i watched all night sometimes i took up my quarters in the hospital and slept or watched there several nights in succession i may add that i am now just resuming my occupation in the hospitals and camps for the winter of 18645 and probably to continue the seasons ensuing  to many of the wounded and sick especially the youngsters there is something in personal love caresses and the magnetic flood of sympathy and friendship that does in its way more good than all the medicine in the world i have spoken of my regular gifts of delicacies money tobacco special articles of food knickknacks etc etc but i steadily found more and more that i could help and turn the balance in favor of cure by the means here alluded to in a curiously large proportion of cases the american soldier is full of affection and the yearning for affection and it comes wonderfully grateful to him to have this yearning gratified when he is laid up with painful wounds or illness far away from home among strangers many will think this merely sentimentalism but i know it is the most solid of facts i believe that even the moving around among the men or through the ward of a hearty healthy clean strong generoussouled person man or woman full of humanity and love sending out invisible constant currents thereof does immense good to the sick and wounded  to those who might be interested in knowing it i must add in conclusion that i have tried to do justice to all the suffering that fell in my way while i have been with wounded and sick in thousands of cases from the new england states and from new york new jersey and pennsylvania and from michigan wisconsin indiana illinois and the western states i have been with more or less from all the states north and south without exception i have been with many from the border states especially from maryland and virginia and found far more union southerners than is supposed i have been with many rebel officers and men among our wounded and given them always what i had and tried to cheer them the same as any i have been among the army teamsters considerably and indeed always find myself drawn to them among the black soldiers wounded or sick and in the contraband camps i also took my way whenever in their neighborhood and i did what i could for them  w w  from the new york times december 11 1864     illustration louisa van velsor whitman  from a daguerreotype taken about 1855  the heliotype printing co boston     letters of 18623   i  washington monday forenoon dec 29 1862 dear dear motherfriday the 19th inst i succeeded in reaching the camp of the 51st new york and found george1 alive and well in order to make sure that you would get the good news i sent back by messenger to washington a telegraphic dispatch i dare say you did not get it for some time as well as a letterand the same to hannah2 at burlington i have staid in camp with george ever since till yesterday when i came back to washington about the 24th george got jeffs3 letter of the 20th mother how much you must have suffered all that week till georges letter cameand all the rest must too as to me i know i put in about three days of the greatest suffering i ever experienced in my life i wrote to jeff how i had my pocket picked in a jam and hurry changing cars at philadelphiaso that i landed here without a dime the next two days i spent hunting through the hospitals walking day and night unable to ride trying to get informationtrying to get access to big people etci could not get the least clue to anything odell would not see me at all but thursday afternoon i lit on a way to get down on the government boat that runs to aquia creek and so by railroad to the neighborhood of falmouth opposite fredericksburgso by degrees i worked my way to ferreros4 brigade which i found friday afternoon without much trouble after i got in camp when i found dear brother george and found that he was alive and well o you may imagine how trifling all my little cares and difficulties seemedthey vanished into nothing and now that i have lived for eight or nine days amid such scenes as the camps furnish and had a practical part in it all and realize the way that hundreds of thousands of good men are now living and have had to live for a year or more not only without any of the comforts but with death and sickness and hard marching and hard fighting and no success at that for their continual experiencereally nothing we call trouble seems worth talking about one of the first things that met my eyes in camp was a heap of feet arms legs etc under a tree in front of a hospital the lacy house  george is very well in health has a good appetitei think he is at times more wearied out and homesick than he shows but stands it upon the whole very well every one of the soldiers to a man wants to get home  i suppose jeff got quite a long letter i wrote from camp about a week ago i told you that george had been promoted to captainhis commission arrived while i was there when you write address capt george w whitman co k 51st new york volunteers ferreros brigade near falmouth va jeff must write oftener and put in a few lines from mother even if it is only two linesthen in the next letter a few lines from mat and so on you have no idea how letters from home cheer one up in camp and dissipate homesickness  while i was there george still lived in capt franciss tentthere were five of us altogether to eat sleep write etc in a space twelve feet square but we got along very wellthe weather all along was very fineand would have got along to perfection but capt francis is not a man i could like muchi had very little to say to him george is about building a place half hut and half tent for himself he is probably about it this very day and then he will be better off i think every captain has a tent in which he lives transacts company business etc has a cook or a man of all work and in the same tent mess and sleep his lieutenants and perhaps the first sergeant they have a kind of fireplaceand the cooks fire is outside on the open ground george had very good times while francis was awaythe cook a young disabled soldier tom is an excellent fellow and a firstrate cook and the second lieutenant pooley is a tiptop young pennsylvanian tom thinks all the world of george when he heard he was wounded on the day of the battle he left everything got across the river and went hunting for george through the field through thick and thin i wrote to jeff that george was wounded by a shell a gash in the cheekyou could stick a splint through into the mouth but it has healed up without difficulty already everything is uncertain about the army whether it moves or stays where it is there are no furloughs granted at present i will stay here for the present at any rate long enough to see if i can get any employment at anything and shall write what luck i have of course i am unsettled at present dear mother my love      walt  if jeff or any writes address me care of major hapgood paymaster u s a army washington d c i send my love to dear sister mat5 and little sis6and to andrew7 and all my brothers o mat how lucky it was you did not cometogether we could never have got down to see george   ii  washington friday morning jan 2 1863 dear sister8you have heard of my fortunes and misfortunes of course through my letters to mother and jeff since i left home that tuesday afternoon but i thought i would write a few lines to you as it is a comfort to write home even if i have nothing particular to say well dear sister i hope you are well and hearty and that little sis9 keeps as well as she always had when i left home so far dear little plague how i would like to have her with me for one day i can fancy i see her and hear her talk jeff must have got a note from me about a letter i have written to the eagleyou may be sure you will get letters enough from me for i have little else to do at present since i laid my eyes on dear brother george and saw him alive and welland since i have spent a week in camp down there opposite fredericksburg and seen what well men and sick men and mangled men endureit seems to me i can be satisfied and happy henceforward if i can get one meal a day and know that mother and all are in good health and especially be with you again and have some little steady paying occupation in n y or brooklyn  i am writing this in the office of major hapgood way up in the top of a big high house corner of 15th and f street there is a splendid view away down south of the potomac river and across to the georgetown side and the grounds and houses of washington spread out beneath my high point of view the weather is perfecti have had that in my favor ever since leaving homeyesterday and today it is bright and plenty warm enough the poor soldiers are continually coming in from the hospitals etc to get their paysome of them waiting for it to go home they climb up here quite exhausted and then find it is no good for there is no money to pay them there are two or three paymasters desks in this room and the scenes of disappointment are quite affecting here they wait in washington perhaps week after week wretched and heartsickthis is the greatest place of delays and puttings off and no finding the clue to anything this building is the paymastergenerals quarters and the crowds on the walk and corner of poor sick pale tattered soldiers are awfulmany of them day after day disappointed and tired out well mat i will suspend my letter for the present and go through the cityi have a couple of poor fellows in the hospital to visit also      walt  saturday evening jan 3 1863 i write this in the place where i have my lodgingroom 394 l street 4th door above 14th street a friend of mine william d oconnor10 has two apartments

out down town for an hour or two to make some saturday evening purchases and i am left in possession of the premisesso i sit by the fire and scribble more of my letter i have not heard anything from dear brother george since i left the camp last sunday morning 28th dec i wrote to him on tuesday last i wish to get to him the two blue woolen shirts jeff sent as they would come very acceptable to himand will try to do it yet i think of sending them by mail if the postage is not more than 1  yesterday i went out to the campbell hospital to see a couple of brooklyn boys of the 51st they knew i was in washington and sent me a note to come and see them o my dear sister how your heart would ache to go through the rows of wounded young men as i didand stopt to speak a comforting word to them there were about 100 in one long room just a long shed neatly whitewashed inside one young man was very much prostrated and groaning with pain i stopt and tried to comfort him he was very sick i found he had not had any medical attention since he was brought there among so many he had been overlooked so i sent for the doctor and he made an examination of him the doctor behaved very wellseemed to be anxious to do rightsaid that the young man would recover he had been brought pretty low with diarrhoea and now had bronchitis but not so serious as to be dangerous i talked to him some timehe seemed to have entirely given up and lost hearthe had not a cent of moneynot a friend or acquaintance i wrote a letter from him to his sisterhis name is john a holmes campello plymouth county mass i gave him a little change i hadhe said he would like to buy a drink of milk when the woman came through with milk trifling as this was he was overcome and began to cry then there were many many others i mention the one as a specimen my brooklyn boys were john lowery shot at fredericksburg and lost his left forearm and amos h vlietjeff knows the latterhe has his feet frozen and is doing well the 100 are in a ward 6 and there are i should think eight or ten or twelve such wards in the campbell hospitalindeed a real village then there are 38 more hospitals here in washington some of them much larger  sunday forenoon jan 4 1863 mat i hope and trust dear mother and all are well and everything goes on good home the envelope i send jeff or any of you can keep for direction or use it when wanted to write to

of house to build is quite a consideration if any house i should build a regular irish shanty myselftwo rooms and an end shed i think thats luxury enough since i have been down in the army  well mother i believe i will not fill out the sheet this time as i want to go down without delay to the p o and send georges letter and this one goodbye dear mother      walt   iv  washington monday morning feb 9 1863 dearest motheri write to enclose you a letter i have just received from george his corps ninth army and perhaps one other are to move either to fort monroe or somewhere down theresome say suffolk i am in hopes that when they get there george will still have a sight for a furlough i have written him i should think four letters since the 27th jan and have sent him hans letter to you in one i hope he has got most of them before this i am afraid the 3 change i sent him is gone he will write to you as soon as he gets settled wherever they go to i dont know as it makes any difference in respect to danger or fighting from this move one reason they have to move from the rappahannock up there is that wood is all gone for miles forage is scarce to get and i dont know as there is any need of their staying there for any purpose in some haste dearest mother as i am off to visit for an hour or so one of my hospitals your affectionate son      walt   v  office major hapgood cor 15th  f sts washington feb 13 1863 dear brother12nothing new still i thought i would write you a line this morning the 4 namely 2 from theo a drake and 2 from john d martin enclosed in your letter of the 10th came safe they too will please accept the grateful thanks of several poor fellows in hospital here  the letter of introduction to mr webster chief clerk state department will be very acceptable if convenient i should like mr lane to send it on immediately i do not so much look for an appointment from mr seward as his backing me from the state of new york i have seen preston king this morning for the second time it is very amusing to hunt for an officeso the thing seems to me just now even if one dont get it i have seen charles sumner three timeshe says evry thing here moves as part of a great machine and that i must consign myself to the fate of the reststill in an interview i had with him yesterday he talked and acted as though he had life in him and would exert himself to any reasonable extent for me to get something meantime i make about enough to pay my expenses by hacking on the press here and copying in the paymasters offices a couple of hours a day one thing is favorable here namely pay for whatever one does is at a high rate i have not yet presented my letters to either seward or chasei thought i would get my forces all in a body and make one concentrated dash if possible with the personal introduction and presence of some big bug i like fat old preston king very muchhe is fat as a hogshead with great hanging chops the first thing he said to me the other day in the parlor chambers of the senate when i sent in for him and he came out was why how can i do this thing or any thing for youhow do i know but you are a secessionist you look for all the world like an old southern plantera regular carolina or virginia planter i treated him with just as much hauteur as he did me with bluntnessthis was the first timeit afterward proved that charles sumner had not prepared the way for me as i supposed or rather not so strongly as i supposed and mr king had even forgotten itso i was an entire stranger but the same day c s talked further with mr king in the senate and the second interview i had with the latter this forenoon he has given me a sort of general letter endorsing me from new yorkone envelope is addressed to secretary chase and another to gen meigs head quartermasters dept meantime i am getting better and better acquainted with officehunting wisdom and washington peculiarities generally i spent several hours in the capitol the other day the incredible gorgeousness of some of the rooms interior decorations etcrooms used perhaps but for merely three or four committee meetings in the course of the whole yearis beyond ones flightiest dreams costly frescoes of the style of taylors saloon in broadway only really the best and choicest of their sort done by imported french and italian artists are the prevailing sorts imagine the work you see on the fine china vases in tiffanys the paintings of cupids and goddesses etc spread recklessly over the arched ceiling and broad panels of a big roomthe whole floor underneath paved with tesselated pavement which is a sort of cross between marble and china with little figures drab blue cream color etc these things with heavy elaborately wrought balustrades columns and stepsall of the most beautiful marbles i ever saw some white as milk other of all colors green spotted lined or of our old chocolate colorall these marbles used as freely as if they were common blue flagswith rich doorframes and windowcasings of bronze and goldheavy chandeliers and mantles and clocks in every roomand indeed by far the richest and gayest and most unamerican and inappropriate ornamenting and finest interior workmanship i ever conceived possible spread in profusion through scores hundreds and almost thousands of roomssuch are what i find or rather would find to interest me if i devoted time to it but a few of the rooms are enough for methe style is without grandeur and without simplicity these days the state our country is in and especially filled as i am from top to toe of late with scenes and thoughts of the hospitals america seems to me now though only in her youth but brought already here feeble bandaged and bloody in hospitalthese days i say jeff all the poppyshow goddesses and all the pretty blue and gold in which the interior capitol is got up seem to me out of place beyond anything i could telland i get away from it as quick as i can when that kind of thought comes over me i suppose it is to be described throughoutthose interiorsas all of them got up in the french stylewell enough for a new york   vi  washington march 31 1863 dearest motheri have not heard from george except a note he wrote me a couple of days after he got back from his furlough i think it likely the regiment has gone with its corps to the west the kentucky or tennessee regionburnside at last accounts was in cincinnati well it will be a change for george if he is out there i sent a long letter to han last saturdayenclosed georges note to me mother when you or jeff writes again tell me if my papers and mss are all right i should be very sorry indeed if they got scattered or used up or anythingespecially the copy of leaves of grass covered in blue paper13 and the little ms book drumtaps and the ms tied up in the square spotted stonepaper loose coversi want them all carefully kept  mother it is quite a snowstorm here this morningthe ground is an inch and a half deep with snowand it is snowing and drizzlingbut i feel very independent in my stout armyboots i go anywhere i have felt quite well of my deafness and cold in my head for four days or so but it is back again bad as ever this morning  dear mother i wrote the above in my roomi have now come down to major hapgoods office i do not find anything from home and no particular news in the paper this morningno news about the ninth army corps or where they are i find a good letter from one of my new york boys fifth avenue a young fellow named hugo fritsch son of the austrian consulgeneralhe writes me a long firstrate letter this morning he too speaks about the operalike jeff he goes there a good dealsays that medori the soprano as norma made the greatest success ever seensays that the whole company there now the singers are very fine all this i write for jeff and mati hope they will go once in a while when it is convenient  it is a most disagreeable day here mother walking poshy and a rain and drizzle  there is nothing new with me no particular sight for an office that i can count on but i can make enough with the papers for the present necessities i hear that the paymaster major yard that pays the 51st has gone on west i suppose to cincinnati or wherever the brigade has goneof course to pay uphe pays up to 1st of marchall the army is going to be paid up to 1st march everywhere  mother i hope you are well and hearty as usual i am so glad you are none of you going to move i would like to have the pleasure of miss mannahatta whitmans company the first fine forenoon if it were possible i think we might have firstrate times for one day at any rate i hope she will not forget her uncle walt i received a note from probasco requesting me not to put his name in my next letter i appreciate his motive and wish to please him alwaysbut in this matter i shall do what i think appropriate mother i see some very interesting persons herea young masters mate who was on the hatteras when surprised and broadsided by the alabama capt semmeshe gave me a very good acct of it allthen capt mullen u s army engineer who has been six years out in the rocky mts making a govt road 650 miles from ft benton to walla wallavery very interesting to know such men intimately and talk freely with them dearest mother i shall have great yarns to spin when i come home i am not a bit homesick yet i should like to see you and mat very very muchone thinks of the women when he is away      walt  shall send the shirts in a day or two   vii  washington wednesday forenoon april 15 1863 dearest motherjeffs letter of the 11th acknowledging the books also the one about five days previous containing the 10 from van anden came safe jeffs letters are always first rate and welcomethe good long one with so much about home and containing hans and georges was especially so it is a great pleasure though sometimes a melancholy one to hear from han under her own hand i have writ to georgei wrote last friday i directed the letter to lexington or elsewhere kentuckyas i saw in a letter in a cincinnati paper that gen ferrero was appointed provost marshal at lexington the 51st is down there somewhere and i guess it is about as well off there as anywhere there is much said about their closing up the regimental companiesthat is where there are ten companies of 40 men each closing them up to five companies of 80 men each it is said the government purposes something of this kind it will throw a good many captains and lieutenants out i suppose you know that le gendre is now colonel of the 51stits a pity if we havent americans enough to put over our old war regiments i think less and less of foreigners in this war what i see especially in the hospitals convinces me that there is no other stock for emergencies but native americanno other name by which we can be saved  mother i feel quite bad about andrewi am so in hopes to hear that he has recoveredi think about him every day he must not get fretting and disheartenedthat is really the worst feature of any sickness diseases of the throat and bronchia are the result always of bad state of the stomach blood etc they never come from the throat itself the throat and the bronchia are lined like the stomach and other interior organs with a fine lining like silk or crape and when all this gets ulcerated or inflamed or whatnot it is dr sammiss mucous membrane you know it is bad and most distressing medicine is really of no great account except just to pacify a person this lining i speak of is full of little blood vessels and the way to make a real cure is by gentle and steady means to recuperate the whole system this will tell upon the blood upon the blood vessels and so finally and effectually upon all this coating i speak of that lines the throat etc but as it is a long time before this vital lining membrane very important is injured so it is a long time before it can be made all healthy and right again but andrew is young and strong enough and has a good constitution for basisand of course by regular diet care and nary whiskey under any circumstances i am sure he would not only get over that trouble but be as well and strong as he ever was in his life mother you tell him i sent him my love and nancy14 the same and the dear little boys the samethe next time you or mat goes down there you take this and show him  mat i am quite glad to hear that you are not hurried and fretted with work from new york this springi am sure i should think sis and housekeeping etc would be enough to attend to i was real amused with siss remarks and all that was in the letter about her you must none of you notice her smartness nor criticisms before her nor encourage her to spread herself nor be critical as it is not good to encourage a child to be too sharpand i hope sissy is going to be a splendid specimen of good animal health for the few years to come i should think more of that than anythingthat is the foundation of all righteousness included as to her mental vivacity and growth they are plenty enough of themselves and will get along quite fast enough of themselves plenty fast enoughdont stimulate them at all dear little creature how i should like to see her this minute jeff must not make his lessons to her in music anyways strong or frequent on any accounttwo lessons a week of ten minutes each is enoughbut then i dare say jeff will think of all these things just the same as i am saying jeff writes he wonders if i am as well and hearty and i suppose he means as much of a beauty as ever whether i look the same well not only as much but more soi believe i weigh about 200 and as to my face so scarlet and my beard and neck they are terrible to behold i fancy the reason i am able to do some good in the hospitals among the poor languishing and wounded boys is that i am so large and wellindeed like a great wild buffalo with much hair many of the soldiers are from the west and far north and they take to a man that has not the bleached shiny and shaved cut of the cities and the east i spent three to four hours yesterday in armory hospital one of my particular boys there was dyingpneumoniahe wanted me to stop with him awhile he could not articulatebut the look of his eyes and the holding on of his hand was deeply affecting his case is a relapseeight days ago he had recovered was up was perhaps a little carelessat any rate took cold was taken down again and has sank rapidly he has no friends or relatives here yesterday he labored and panted so for breath it was terrible he is a young man from new england from the country i expected to see his cot vacated this afternoon or evening as i shall go down then mother if you or mat was here a couple of days you would cry your eyes out i find i have to restrain myself and keep my composurei succeed pretty well goodbye dearest mother      walt  jeff capt muller remains here yet for some time he is bringing out his report i shall try to send you a copy give my best respects to dr ruggles  mother my last letter home was a week ago todaywe are having a dark rainy day hereit is now

was sorry to hear you had a return of your rheumatismi do hope you will favor yourself more it depends so much on thatand rheumatism is so obstinate when it gets hold of one mother you received a letter from me sent last wednesday 22nd of course with a small quantity of shinplasters next time you or jeff writes i wish you would tell me whether the letters come pretty regularly the next morning after i write themthis now ought to reach you wednesday forenoon april 29th mother did a mr howell call on you he was here last week to see about his boy died a long while ago in hospital in yorktown

timesat least as comfortable as the law allows i am so glad you are not going to have the trouble of moving this 1st of may how are the browns tell will i should like to see him first rateif he was here attached to the suite of some big officer or something of that kind he would have a good time and do well i see lots of young fellows not half as capable and trustworthy as he coming and going in washington in such positions the big generals and head men all through the armies and provosts etc like to have a squad of such smart nimble young men around them give my respects to mr and mrs brown  tell jeff i am going to write to mr lane either today or tomorrow jeff asks me if i go to hospitals as much as ever if my letters home dont show it you dont get em i feel sorry sometimes after i have sent them i have said so much about hospitals and so mournful o mother the young man in armorysquare dennis barrett in the 169th n y i mentioned before is probably going to get up after all he is like one saved from the grave saturday last i saw him and talked with him and gave him something to eat and he was much betterit is the most unexpected recovery i have yet seen mother i see jeff says in the letter you dont hear from me very ofteni will write oftener especially to jeff dear brother i hope you are getting along good and in good spirits you must not mind the failure of the sewer bills etc it dont seem to me it makes so much difference about worldly successes beyond just enough to eat and drink and shelter in the moderatest limits any more since the last four months of my life especially and that merely to live and have one fair meal a day is enoughbut then you have a family and that makes a difference  matty i send you my best love dear sisterhow i wish i could be with you one or two good days mat do you remember the good time we had that awful stormy night we went to the opera new york and had the front seat and heard the handsomemouthed guerrabella and had the good oyster supper at fulton marketpewter them ales o mat i hope and trust we shall have such times again  tell andrew he must remember what i wrote about the throat etc i am sure he will get all right before long and recover his voice give him my loveand tell mannahatta her uncle walt is living now among the sick soldiers jeff look out for the eagles and send the portraits dearest mother i must bid you and all for the present goodbye      walt   ix  washington tuesday may 5 1863 dearest motheryour letter came safe and was very welcome and always will be mother i am sorry about your rheumatismif it still continues i think it would be well for me to write a line to mrs piercy and get jeff to stop with it so that you could take the baths again as i am sure they are very beneficial dear mother you write me or jeff must in the next letter how you are getting along whether it is any better or worsei want to know mother about georges fund in the bank i hope by all means you can scratch along so as to leave 250 therei am so anxious that our family should have a little ranch even if it is the meanest kind off somewhere that you can call your own and that would do for ed etcit might be a real dependence and comfortand maybe for george as much as any one i mean to come home one of these days and get the acre or half acre somewhere out in some byplace on long island and build ityou see if i dont about hannah dear mother i hardly know what advice to give youfrom what i know at present i cant tell what course to pursue i want han to come home from the bottom of my heart then there are other thoughts and considerations that come up dear mother i cannot advise but shall acquiesce in anything that is settled upon and try to help  the condition of things here in the hospitals is getting pretty badthe wounded from the battles around fredericksburg are coming up in large numbers it is very sad to see them i have written to mr lane asking him to get his friends to forward me what they think properbut somehow i feel delicate about sending such requests after all  i have almost made up my mind to do what i can personally and not seek assistance from others  dear mother i have not received any letter from george i write to him and send papers to winchester mother while i have been writing this a very large number of southern prisoners i should think 1000 at least has past up pennsylvania avenue under a strong guard i went out in the street close to them poor fellows many of them mere ladsit brought the tears they seemed our flesh and blood too some wounded all miserable in clothing all in dirt and tattersmany of them fine young men mother i cannot tell you how i feel to see those prisoners marched   x  washington wednesday forenoon may 13 1863 dearest motheri am late with my letter this weekmy poor poor boys occupy my time very muchi go every day and sometimes nights i believe i mentioned a young man in ward f armorysquare with a bad wound in the leg very agonizinghad to have it propt up and an attendant all the while dripping water on night and day i was in hopes at one time he would get through with it but a few days ago he took a sudden bad turn and died about 3 oclock the same afternoonit was horrible he was of good familyhandsome intelligent man about 26 married his name was john elliot of cumberland valley bedford co pennbelonged to 2nd pennsylvania cavalry i felt very bad about it i have wrote to his fatherhave not received any answer yet no friend nor any of his folks was here and have not been here nor sentprobably dont know of it at all the surgeons put off amputating the leg he was so exhausted but at last it was imperatively necessary to amputate mother i am shocked to tell you that he never came alive off the amputating tablehe died under the operationit was what i had dreaded and anticipated poor young man he suffered much very very much for many days and bore it so patientlyso that it was a release to him mother such things are awfulnot a soul here he knew or cared about except meyet the surgeons and nurses were good to him i think all was done for him that could bethere was no help but take off the leg he was under chloroformthey tried their best to bring him tothree long hours were spent a strong smelling bottle held under his nostrils with other means three hours mother how contemptible all the usual little worldly prides and vanities and striving after appearances seems in the midst of such scenes as thesesuch tragedies of soul and body to see such things and not be able to help them is awfuli feel almost ashamed of being so well and whole  dear mother i have not heard from george himself but i got a letter from fred mcready a young brooklyn man in 51sthe is intimate with george said he was well and hearty i got the letter about five days ago i wrote to george four days since directed to winchester kentucky i got a letter from a friend in nashville tenn yesterdayhe told me the 9th army corps was ordered to move to murfreesboro tenn i dont know whether this is so or not i send papers to george almost every day so far i think it was fortunate the 51st was moved west and i hope it will continue so mother it is all a lottery this war no one knows what will come up next  mother i received jeffs letter of may 9thit was welcome as all jeffs letters are and all others from home jeff says you do not hear from me at home but seldom mother i write once a week to you regular but i will write soon to jeff a good long letteri have wanted to for some time but have been much occupied dear brother i wish you to say to probasco and all the other young men on the works i send them my love and best thanksnever anything came more acceptable than the little fund they forwarded me the last week through mr lane our wounded from hookers battles are worse wounded and more of them than any battle of the war and indeed any i may say of modern timesbesides the weather has been very hot here very bad for new wounds yet as jeff writes so downhearted i must tell him the rebellion has lost worse and more than we have the more i find out about it the more i think they the confederates have received an irreparable harm and loss in virginiai should not be surprised to see them either voluntarily or by force leaving virginia before many weeks i dont see how on earth they can stay there i think hooker is already reaching after them againi myself do not give up hooker yet dear mother i should like to hear from han poor han i send my best love to sister mat and all goodbye dearest mother      walt   xi  washington tuesday forenoon may 19 1863 dearest mother i sent george a letter yesterdayhave not got any letter myself from georgy but have sent him quite a good many and papers mother what a tramp the 51st has hadthey only need now to go to california and they will finish the job complete o mother how welcome the shirts werei was putting off and putting off to get some new ones i could not find any one to do them as i want them and it would have cost such a priceand so my old ones had got to be when they came back from the wash i had to laugh they were a lot of rags held together with starch i have a very nice old black aunty for a washwoman but she bears down pretty hard i guess when she irons them and they showed something like the poor old city of fredericksburg does since burnside bombarded it well mother when the bundle came i was so gladand the coats too worn as they are they come in very handyand the cake dear mother i am almost like the boy that put it under his pillow and woke up in the night and eat some i carried a good chunk to a young man wounded i think a good deal of and it did him so much goodit is dry but all the better as he eat it with tea and it relished i eat a piece with him and drinked some tea out of his cup as i sat by the side of his cot mother i have neglected i think what i ought to have told you two or three weeks ago that is that i have discarded my old clothessomewhat because they were too thick and more still because they were worse gone in than any i have ever yet wore i think in my life especially the trowsers wearing my big boots had caused the inside of the legs just above the knee to wear two beautiful round holes right through cloth and partly through the lining producing a novel effect which was not necessary as i produce a sufficient sensation withoutthen they were desperately faded i have a nice plain suit of a dark wine color looks very well and feels goodsingle breasted sack coat with breast pockets etc and vest and pants same as what i always wear pants pretty full so upon the whole all looks unusually good for me my hat is very good yet boots ditto have a new necktie nice shirtsyou can imagine i cut quite a swell i have not trimmed my beard since i left home but it is not grown much longer only perhaps a little bushier i keep about as stout as ever and the past five or six days i have felt wonderful well indeed never did i feel better about ten or twelve days ago we had a short spell of very warm weather here but for about six days now it has been delightful just warm enough i generally go to the hospitals from 12 to 4and then again from 6 to 9 some days i only go in the middle of the day or evening not bothand then when i feel somewhat opprest i skip over a day or make perhaps a light call only as i have several cautions from the doctors who tell me that one must beware of continuing too steady and long in the air and influences of the hospitals i find the caution a wise one  mother you or jeff must write me what andrew does about going to north carolina i should think it might have a beneficial effect upon his throat i wrote jeff quite a long letter sunday jeff must write to me whenever he can i like dearly to have themand whenever you feel like it you too dear mother tell sis her uncle walt will come back one of these days from the sick soldiers and take her out on fort greene again mother i received a letter yesterday from john elliots father in bedford co pennsylvania the young man i told you about who died under the operation it was very sad it was the first he knew about it i dont know whether i told you of dennis barrett pneumonia three weeks since had got well enough to be sent home dearest mother i hope you will take things as easy as possible and try to keep a good heart matty my dear sister i have to inform you that i was treated to a splendid dish of icecream sunday night i wished you was with me to have another i send you my love dear sister mother i hope by all means it will be possible to keep the money whole to get some ranch next spring if not before i mean to come home and build it goodbye for the present dear mother      walt   xii  washington tuesday forenoon may 26 1863 dearest motheri got a long letter from george dated near lancaster kentucky may 15th he seems to be well and in good spiritssays he gets some letters from me and papers too at the time he wrote the 51st was doing provost duty at lancaster but would not probably remain so very longseem to be moving towards southeast kentuckyhad a good camp and good times generally le gendre is colonelgen ferrero has left the servicecol potter now briggen is in cincinnaticapt sims etc are all well george describes kentucky as a very fine countrysays the people are about half and half secesh and union this is the longest letter i have yet received from george did he write you one about the same time mother i have not recd any word from home in over a weekthe last letter i had from mr lane was about twelve days ago sending me 10 for the soldiers five from mr kirkwood and five from mr conklin brush mother dear i should like to hear from martha i wish jeff would write me about it has andrew gone and how is your wrist and arm mother we had some very hot weather herei dont know what i should have done without the thin grey coat you sentyou dont know how good it does and looks too i wore it three days and carried a fan and an umbrella quite a japaneemost everybody here carries an umbrella on account of the sun yesterday

just the same as ever i suppose jess and ed are just the same as ever when you write you tell me all about everything and the browns and the neighborhood generally mother is georges trunk home and of no use there i wish i had it here as i must have a trunkbut do not wish you to send until i send you word i suppose my letter never appeared in the eagle well i shall send them no more as i think likely they hate to put in anything which may celebrate me a little even though it is just the thing they want for their paper and readers they altered the other letter on that account very meanly i shall probably have letters in the n y times and perhaps other papers in about a week mother i have been pretty active in hospitals for the past two weeks somewhere every day or night i have written you so much about cases etc i will not write you any more on that subject this time o the sad sad things i seethe noble young men with legs and arms taken offthe deathsthe sick weakness sicker than death that some endure after amputations there is a great difference some make little of it others lie after it for days just flickering alive and o so deathly weak and sick i go this afternoon to campbell hospital out a couple of miles  mother i should like to have jeff send me 20 of the largesized portraits and as many of the standing figure do them up flat i think every day about martha mother have you heard any further about han goodbye for the present dearest mother      walt   xiii  washington tuesday morning june 9 1863 dearest motherjeffs letter came yesterday and was very welcome as i wanted to hear about you all i wrote to george yesterday and sent jeffs letter enclosed it looks from some accounts as though the 9th army corps might be going down into east tennessee cumberland gap or perhaps bound for knoxville it is an important region and has many southern unionists the staunchest union man i have ever met is a young southerner in the 2nd tennessee union regthe was ten months in southern prisons came up from richmond paroled about ten weeks ago and has been in hospital here sick until lately he suffered everything but deathhe is the one they hung up by the heels head downwardsand indeed worse than death but stuck to his convictions like a herojohn barker a real manly fellow i saw much of him and heard much of that country that can be relied on he is now gone home to his regt  mother i am feeling very well these daysmy head that was stopt up so and hard of hearing seems to be all right i only hope you have had similar good fortune with your rheumatism and that it will continue so i wish i could come in for a couple of days and see you if i should succeed in getting a transportation ticket that would take me to new york and back i should be tempted to come home for two or three days as i want some mss and books and the trunk etcbut i will see mother your letter week before last was very goodwhenever you feel like it you write me dear mother and tell me everything about the neighborhood and all the items of our family  and sister mat how is she getting alongi believe i will have to write a letter especially to her and sis one of these times  it is awful dry weather here no rain of any consequence for five or six weeks we have strawberries good and plenty 15 cents a quart with the hulls oni go down to market sometimes of a morning and buy two or three quarts for the folks i take my meals with mother do you know i have not paid as you may say a cent of board since i have been in washington that is for mealsfour or five times i have made a rush to leave the folks and find a moderatepriced boardinghouse but every time they have made such a time about it that i have kept on it is mr and mrs oconnor he is the author of harrington he has a 1600 office in the treasury and she is a firstrate woman a massachusetts girl they keep house in a moderate way they have one little girl lost a fine boy about a year ago they have two rooms in the same house where i hire my rooms and i take breakfast halfpast 8 and dinner halfpast 4 with them as they will have it so thats the way it has gone on now over five months and as i say they wont listen to my leavingbut i shall do so i think i can never forget the kindness and real friendship and it appears as though they would continue just the same if it were for all our lives but i have insisted on going to market it is pleasant in the cool of the morning and getting the things at my own expense two or three times a week lately i pay for the room i occupy now 7 a monththe landlord is a mixture of booby miser and hog his name is g the landlady is a good woman washington raisedthey are quite rich he is irish of the worst kindhas had a good office for ten years until lincoln came in they have bought another house smaller to live in and are going to move were to have moved 1st of june they had an auction of the house we live in yesterday but nobody came to buy so it was ridiculouswe had a red flag out and a nigger walked up and down ringing a big bell which is the fashion here for auctions  well mother the war still goes on and everything as much in a fog as everand the battles as bloody and the wounded and sick getting worse and plentier all the time i see a letter in the tribune from lexington ky june 5th headed the 9th army corps departing for vicksburgbut i cannot exactly make it out on reading the letter carefullyi dont see anything in the letter about the 9th corps moving from vicksburg at any rate i think the 2nd division is more likely to be needed in kentucky or as i said in eastern tennessee as the secesh are expected to make trouble there but one can hardly tellthe only thing is to resign oneself to events as they occur it is a sad and dreary time for so many thousands of parents and relatives not knowing what will occur next mother i told you i think last week that i had wrote to han and enclosed georges last letter to mei wrote a week ago last sundayi wonder if she got the letter about the pictures i should like jeff to send them as soon as convenientmight send 20 of the big head 10 or 12 of the standing figure and 3 of the carte visite  i am writing this in major hapgoods officeit is bright and pleasant only the dust here in washington is a great nuisance mother your shirts do first ratei am wearing them the one i have on today suits me better than any i have ever yet had i have not worn the thin coat the last week or so as it has not been very hot lately mother i think something of commencing a series of lectures and reading etc through different cities of the north to supply myself with funds for my hospital and soldiers visits as i do not like to be beholden to the medium of others i need a pretty large supply of money etc to do the good i would like to and the work grows upon me and fascinates meit is the most affecting thing you ever see the lots of poor sick and wounded young men that depend so much in one word or another upon my petting or soothing or feeding sitting by them and feeding them their dinner or suppersome are quite helpless some wounded in both armsor giving some trifle for a novelty or a change it isnt for the value of it or stopping a little while with them nobody will do but meso mother i feel as though i would like to inaugurate a plan by which i could raise means on my own hook and perhaps quite plenty too best love to you dearest mother and to sister mat and jeff      walt   xiv  washington monday morning june 22 1863 dear motherjeffs letter came informing me of the birth of the little girl15 and that matty was feeling pretty well so far i hope it will continue dear sister i should much like to come home and see you and the little one i am sure from jeffs description it is a noble babeand as to its being a girl it is all the better i am not sure but the whitman breed gives better women than men  well mother we are generally anticipating a lively time here or in the neighborhood as it is probable lee is feeling about to strike a blow on washington or perhaps right into itand as lee is no fool it is perhaps possible he may give us a good shake he is not very far offyesterday was a fight to the southwest of here all day we heard the cannons nearly all day the wounded are arriving in small squads every day mostly cavalry a great many ohio men they send off today from the washington hospitals a great many to new york philadelphia etc all who are able to make room which looks ominousindeed it is pretty certain that there is to be some severe fighting maybe a great battle again the pending week i am getting so callous that it hardly arouses me at all i fancy i should take it very quietly if i found myself in the midst of a desperate conflict here in washington  mother i have nothing particular to write abouti see and hear nothing but new and old cases of my poor suffering boys in hospitals and i dare say you have had enough of such things i have not missed a day at hospital i think for more than three weeksi get more and more wound round poor young menthere are some cases that would literally sink and give up if i did not pass a portion of the time with them i have quite made up my mind about the lecturing etc projecti have no doubt it will succeed well enough the way i shall put it in operation you know mother it is to raise funds to enable me to continue my hospital ministrations on a more freehanded scale as to the sanitary commissions and the like i am sick of them all and would not accept any of their berths you ought to see the way the men as they lay helpless in bed turn away their faces from the sight of those agents chaplains etc hirelings as elias hicks would call themthey seem to me always a set of foxes and wolves they get well paid and are always incompetent and disagreeable as i told you before the only good fellows i have met are the christian commissionersthey go everywhere and receive no pay  dear dear mother i want much to see you and dear matty too i send you both my best love and jeff too the pictures camei have not heard from george nor han i write a day earlier than usual      walt  we here think vicksburg is ours the probability is that it has capitulatedand there has been no general assaultcant tell yet whether the 51st went there we are having very fine weather here todayrained last night   xv  washington june 30th 1863 dearest motheryour letter with hans i have sent to george though whether it will find him or not i cannot tell as i think the 51st must be away down at vicksburg i have not had a word from george yet mother i have had quite an attack of sore throat and distress in my head for some days past up to last night but today i feel nearly all right again i have been about the city same as usual nearlyto the hospitals etc i mean i am told that i hover too much over the beds of the hospitals with fever and putrid wounds etc one soldier brought here about fifteen days ago very low with typhoid fever livingston brooks co b 17th penn cavalry i have particularly stuck to as i found him to be in what appeared to be a dying condition from negligence and a horrible journey of about forty miles bad roads and fast driving and then after he got here as he is a simple country boy very shy and silent and made no complaint they neglected him i found him something like i found john holmes last winter i called the doctors attention to him shook up the nurses had him bathed in spirits gave him lumps of ice and ice to his head he had a fearful bursting pain in his head and his body was like fire he was very quiet a very sensible boy old fashioned he did not want to die and i had to lie to him without stint for he thought i knew everything and i always put in of course that what i told him was exactly the truth and that if he got really dangerous i would tell him and not conceal it the rule is to remove bad fever patients out from the main wards to a tent by themselves and the doctor told me he would have to be removed i broke it gently to him but the poor boy got it immediately in his head that he was marked with death and was to be removed on that account it had a great effect upon him and although i told the truth this time it did not have as good a result as my former fibs i persuaded the doctor to let him remain for three days he lay just about an even chance go or stay with a little leaning toward the first but mother to make a long story short he is now out of any immediate danger he has been perfectly rational throughoutbegins to taste a little food for a week he ate nothing i had to compel him to take a quarter of an orange now and then and i will say whether anyone calls it pride or not that if he does get up and around again its me that saved his life mother as i have said in former letters you can have no idea how these sick and dying youngsters cling to a fellow and how fascinating it is with all its hospital surroundings of sadness and scenes of repulsion and death in this same hospital armorysquare where this cavalry boy is i have about fifteen or twenty particular cases i see much tosome of them as much as him there are two from east brooklyn george monk co a 78th n y and stephen redgate his mother is a widow in east brooklyni have written to her both are pretty badly woundedboth are youngsters under 19 o mother it seems to me as i go through these rows of cots as if it was too bad to accept these children to subject them to such premature experiences i devote myself much to armorysquare hospital because it contains by far the worst cases most repulsive wounds has the most suffering and most need of consolation i go every day without fail and often at nightsometimes stay very late no one interferes with me guards nurses doctors nor anyone i am let to take my own course  well mother i suppose you folks think we are in a somewhat dubious position here in washington with lee in strong force almost between us and you northerners well it does look ticklish if the rebs cut the connection then there will be fun the reb cavalry come quite near us dash in and steal wagon trains etc it would be funny if they should come some night to the presidents country house soldiers home where he goes out to sleep every night it is in the same direction as their saucy raid last sunday mr lincoln passes here 14th st every evening on his way out i noticed him last evening about halfpast 6he was in his barouche two horses guarded by about thirty cavalry the barouche comes first under a slow trot driven by one man in the box no servant or footman beside the cavalry all follow closely after with a lieutenant at their head i had a good view of the president last evening he looks more careworn even than usual his face with deep cut lines seams and his complexion gray through very dark skina curious looking man very sad i said to a lady who was looking with me who can see that man without losing all wish to be sharp upon him personally the lady assented although she is almost vindictive on the course of the administration thinks it wants nerve etcthe usual complaint the equipage is rather shabby horses indeed almost what my friends the broadway drivers would call old plugs the president dresses in plain black clothes cylinder hathe was alone yesterday as he came up he first drove over to the house of the sec of war on k st about 300 feet from here sat in his carriage while stanton came out and had a 15 minutes interview with him i can see from my window and then wheeled around the corner and up fourteenth st the cavalry after him i really think it would be safer for him just now to stop at the white house but i expect he is too proud to abandon the former custom then about an hour after we had a large cavalry regiment pass with blankets arms etc on the war march over the same track the regt was very full over a thousandindeed thirteen or fourteen hundred it was an old regt veterans old fighters young as they were they were preceded by a fine mounted band of sixteen about ten bugles the rest cymbals and drums i tell you mother it made everything ringmade my heart leap they played with a will then the accompaniment the sabers rattled on a thousand mens sidesthey had pistols their heels were spurredhandsome american young men i make no acct of any other rude uniforms well worn but good cattle prancingall good riders full of the devil nobody shaved very sunburnt the regimental officers splendidly mounted but just as roughly dressed as the men came immediately after the band then company after company with each its officers at its headthe tramps of so many horses there is a good hard turnpikethen a long train of men with led horses mounted negroes and a long long string of baggage wagons each with four horses and then a strong rear guard i tell you it had the look of real warnoble looking fellows a man feels so proud on a good horse and armed they are off toward the region of lees supposed rendezvous toward susquehannah for the great anticipated battle alas how many of these healthy handsome rollicking young men will lie cold in death before the apples ripen in the orchard mother it is curious and stirring here in some respects smaller or larger bodies of troops are moving continuallymany justwell men are turned out of the hospitals i am where i see a good deal of them there are getting to be many black troops there is one very good regt here black as tar they go around have the regular uniformthey submit to no nonsense others are constantly forming it is getting to be a common sight the rest of the letter is losted   xvi  washington july 10 1863 dear motheri suppose you recd a letter from me last wednesday as i sent you one tuesday 7th dear mother i was glad enough to hear from george by that letter from snyders bluffs june 28th i had felt a little fear on acct of some of those storming parties grant sent against vicksburg the middle of june and up to the 20thbut this letter dispels all anxiety i have written to george many times but it seems he has not got them mother i shall write immediately to him again i think he will get the letter i sent last sunday as i directed it to vicksburgi told him all the news from home mother i shall write to han and enclose georges letter i am real glad to hear from mat and the little one all so favorable we are having pleasant weather here still i go to campbell hospital this afternooni still keep going mother the wounded are doing rather badly i am sorry to say there are frequent deathsthe weather i suppose which has been peculiarly bad for wounds so wet and warm though not disagreeable outdoors mother you must write as often as you can and jeff tooyou must not get worried about the ups and downs of the war i dont know any course but to resign oneself to eventsif one can only bring ones mind to it goodbye once more for the present dearest mother mat and the dear little ones      walt  mother do you ever hear from mary16   xvii  washington wednesday forenoon july 15 1863 dear motherso the mob has risen at last in new yorki have been expecting it but as the day for the draft had arrived and everything was so quiet i supposed all might go on smoothly but it seems the passions of the people were only sleeping and have burst forth with terrible fury and they have destroyed life and property the enrolment buildings etc as we hear the accounts we get are a good deal in a muddle but it seems bad enough the feeling here is savage and hot as fire against new york the mobcopperhead mob the papers here call it and i hear nothing in all directions but threats of ordering up the gunboats cannonading the city shooting down the mob hanging them in a body etc etc meantime i remain silent partly amused partly scornful or occasionally put a dry remark which only adds fuel to the flame i do not feel it in my heart to abuse the poor people or call for a rope or bullets for them but that is all the talk here even in the hospitals the accts from n y this morning are that the govt has ordered the draft to be suspended therei hope it is true for i find that the deeper they go in with the draft the more trouble it is likely to make i have changed my opinion and feelings on the subjectwe are in the midst of strange and terrible timesone is pulled a dozen different ways in his mind and hardly knows what to think or do mother i have not much fear that the troubles in new york will affect any of our family still i feel somewhat uneasy about jeff if any one as he is more around i have had it much on my mind what could be done if it should so happen that jeff should be draftedof course he could not go without its being the downfall almost of our whole family as you may say mat and his young ones and sad blow to you too mother and to all i didnt see any other way than to try to raise the 300 mostly by borrowing if possible of mr lane mother i have no doubt i shall make a few hundred dollars by the lectures i shall certainly commence soon for my hospital missionary purposes and my own for that purpose and i could lend that amt to jeff to pay it back maybe the draft will not come off after all i should say it was very doubtful if they can carry it out in n y and brooklynand besides it is only one chance out of several to be drawn if it does i dont wonder dear brother jeff feels the effect it would have on domestic affairs i think it is right to feel so full as strongly as a man can i do hope all will go well and without such an additional trouble falling upon us but as it can be met with money i hope jeff and mat and all of you dear mother will not worry any more about it i wrote to jeff a few lines last sunday i suppose he got mother i dont know whether you have had a kind of gloomy week the past week but somehow i feel as if you all had but i hope it has passed over how is dear sister mat and how is miss mannahatta and little black head i sometimes feel as if i must come home and see you alli want to very much  my hospital life still continues the samei was in armory all day yesterdayand day and night before they have the men wounded in the railroad accident at laurel station bet here and baltimore about 30 soldiers some of them horribly injured at 3 oclock a m last saturday by collisionpoor poor poor men i go again this afternoon and nighti see so much of butcher sights so much sickness and suffering i must get away a while i believe for selfpreservation i have felt quite well though the past weekwe have had rain continually mother i have not heard from george since have you i shall write han today and send georges letterif you or jeff has not written this week i hope jeff will write on receiving this goodbye for present dearest mother and jeff and mat      walt  mother the army is to be paid off two months more right away of course george will get two months more pay dear mother i hope you will keep untouched and put in bank every cent you can i want us to have a ranch somewhere by or before next spring   xviii  washington aug 11 1863 dear motheri sent jeff a letter on sundayi suppose he got it at the office i feel so anxious to hear from george one cannot help feeling uneasy although these days sometimes it cannot help being long intervals without ones hearing from friends in the army o i do hope we shall hear soon and that it is all right with him it seems as if the 9th corps had returned to vicksburg and some accts say that part of the corps had started to come up the river againtoward kentucky i suppose i have sent george two letters within a week past hoping they might have the luck to get to him but hardly expect it either  mother i feel very sorry to hear andrew is so troubled in his throat yet i know it must make you feel very unhappy jeff wrote me a good deal about it and seems to feel very bad about andrews being unwell but i hope it will go over and that a little time will make him recoveri think about it every day  mother it has been the hottest weather here that i ever experienced and still continues so yesterday and last night was the hottest still i slept sound have good ventilation through my room little as it is i still hire the same room in l street i was quite wet with sweat this morning when i woke up a thing i never remember to have happened to me before for i was not disturbed in my sleep and did not wake up once all night mother i believe i did not tell you that on the 1st of june or a while before the oconnors the friends i took my meals with so long moved to other apartments for more room and pleasanternot far off though i am there every day almost a littleso for nearly two months and a half i have been in the habit of getting my own breakfast in my room and my dinner at a restaurant i have a little spirit lamp and always have a capital cup of tea and some bread and perhaps some preserved fruit for dinner i get a good plate of meat and plenty of potatoes good and plenty for 25 or 30 cents i hardly ever take any thing more than these two meals both of them are pretty heartyeat dinner about 3my appetite is plenty good enough and i am about as fleshy as i was in brooklyn mother i feel better the last ten days and at present than i did the preceding six or eight weeks there was nothing particular the matter with me but i suppose a different climate and being so continually in the hospitalsbut as i say i feel better more strength and better in my head etc about the wound in my hand and the inflammation etc it has thoroughly healed and i have not worn anything on my hand nor had any dressing for the last five days mother i hope you get along with the heat for i see it is as bad or worse in new york and brooklyni am afraid you suffer from it it must be distressing to you dear mother do let things go and just sit still and fan yourself i think about you these hot days i fancy i see you down there in the basement i suppose you have your coffee for breakfast i have not had three cups of coffee in six monthstea altogether i must come home and have some coffee for breakfast with you  mother i wrote to you about erastus haskell co k 141st n yhis father poor old man come on here to see him and found him dead three days he had the body embalmed and took home they are poor folks but very respectable i was at the hospital yesterday as usuali never miss a day i go by my feelingsif i should feel that it would be better for me to lay by for a while i should do so but not while i feel so well as i do the past week for all the hot weather and while the chance lasts i would improve it for by and by the night cometh when no man can work aint i getting pious i got a letter from probasco yesterday he sent 4 for my sick and woundedi wish jeff to tell him that it came right and give him the mens thanks and my love  mother have you heard anything from han and about marys fannyi hope you will write me soon and tell me everything tell me exactly as things are but i know you willi want to hear family affairs before anything else i am so glad to hear mat is good and heartyyou must write me about hat and little black head too mother how is eddy getting along and jess is he about the same i suppose will brown is home all right tell him i spoke about him and the browns too dearest mother i send you my love and to jeff toomust write when you can      walt   xix  washington aug 18 1863 dear motheri was mighty glad to get georges letter i can tell youyou have not heard since i suppose they must be now back again in kentucky or that way as i see by a letter from cairo up the mississippi river that boats had stopt there with the 9th corps on from vicksburg going up towards cincinnatii think the letter was dated aug 10 i have no doubt they are back again up that way somewhere i wrote to george four or five days agoi directed it ohio mississippi or elsewhere mother i was very glad indeed to get your letteri am so sorry andrew does not get any better it is very distressing about losing the voice he must not be so much alarmed as that continues some times years and the health otherwise good  mother i wrote to han about five days ago told her we had heard from george and all the newsi must write to mary too without faili should like to hear from them all and from fanny there has been a young man here in hospital from farmingdale he was wounded his name is hendrickson he has gone home on a furlough he knows the van nostrands very welli told him to go and see aunt fanny i was glad you gave emma price my direction here i should like to hear from mrs price and her girls first rate i think a great deal about themand mother i wish you to tell any of them so they always used me first rate and always stuck up for meif i knew their street and number i should write  it has been awful hot here now for twentyone days aint that a spell of weather the first two weeks i got along better than i would have thought but the last week i have felt it more have felt it in my head a littlei no more stir without my umbrella in the day time than i would without my boots i am afraid of the sun affecting my head and move pretty cautious mother i think every day i wonder if the hot weather is affecting mother much i suppose it must a good deal but i hope it cannot last much longer mother i had a letter in the n y times of last sundaydid you see it i wonder if george cant get a furlough and come home for a while that furlough he had was only a fleabite if he could it would be no more than right for no man in the country has done his duty more faithful and without complaining of anything or asking for anything than george i suppose they will fill up the 51st with conscripts as that seems the order of the daya good many are arriving here from the north and passing through to join meades army we are expecting to hear of more rows in new york about the draft it commences there right away i seethis time it will be no such doings as a month or five weeks ago the govt here is forwarding a large force of regulars to new york to be ready for anything that may happenthere will be no blank cartridges this time well i thought when i first heard of the riot in n y i had some feeling for them but soon as i found what it really was i felt it was the devils own work all through i guess the strong arm will be exhibited this time up to the shoulder mother i want to see you and all very much as i wish to be here at the opening of congress and during the winter i have an idea i will try to come home for a month but i dont know wheni want to see the young ones and mat and jeff and everybody well mother i should like to know all the domestic affairs at home dont you have the usual things eating etc why mother i should think you would eat nearly all your meals with mati know you must when they have anything good and i know mat will have good things if she has got a cent left mother dont you miss walt loafing around and carting himself off to new york toward the latter part of every afternoon how do you and the browns get alongthat hell hole over the way what a nuisance it must be nights and i generally have a very good sleep mother i suppose you sleep in the back room yeti suppose the new houses next door are occupied how i should like to take a walk on old fort greenetell mannahatta her uncle walt will be home yet from the sick soldiers and have a good walk all around if she behaves to her grandmother and dont cut up mother i am scribbling this hastily in major hapgoods office it is not so hot today quite endurable i send you my love dear mother and to all and wish jeff and you to write as often as you can      walt   xx  washington aug 25 1863 dear motherthe letter from george and your lines and a few from jeff came yesterday and i was glad indeed to be certain that george had got back to kentucky safe and wellwhile so many fall that we know or what is about as bad get sick or hurt in the fight and lay in hospital it seems almost a miracle that george should have gone through so much south and north and east and west and been in so many hardfought battles and thousands of miles of weary and exhausting marches and yet have stood it so and be yet alive and in good health and spirits o mother what would we have done if it had been otherwiseif he had met the fate of so many we knowif he had been killed or badly hurt in some of those battles i get thinking about it sometimes and it works upon me so i have to stop and turn my mind on something else mother i feel bad enough about andrew and i know it must be so with you tooone dont know what to do if we had money he would be welcome to it if it would do any good if georges money comes from kentucky this last time and you think some of it would do andrew any real good i advise you to take some and give himi think it would be proper and george would approve of it i believe there is not much but trouble in this world and if one hasnt any for himself he has it made up by having it brought close to him through others and that is sometimes worse than to have it touch ones self mother you must not let andrews case and the poor condition of his household comforts etc work upon you for i fear you willbut mother its no use to worry about such things i have seen so much horrors that befall men so bad and such suffering and mutilations etc that the poor men can defy their fate to do anything more or any harder misfortune or worse agoing that i sometimes think i have grown callousbut no i dont think it is that but nothing of ordinary misfortune seems as it used to and death itself has lost all its terrorsi have seen so many cases in which it was so welcome and such a relief  mother you must just resign yourself to things that occurbut i hardly think it is necessary to give you any charge about it for i think you have done so for many years and stood it all with good courage  we have a second attack of hot weathersunday was the most burning day i ever yet saw it is very dry and dusty here but today we are having a middling good breezei feel pretty well and whenever the weather for a day or so is passably cool i feel really first rate so i anticipate the cooler season with pleasure mother i believe i wrote to you i had a letter in n y times sunday 16thi shall try to write others and more frequently the three eagles came safe i was glad to get themi sent them and another paper to george mother none of you ever mention whether you get my letters but i suppose they come safeit is not impossible i may miss some week but i have not missed a single one for months past i wish i could send you something worth while and i wish i could send something for andrewmother write me exactly how it is with him mother i have some idea han is getting some better it is only my idea somehowi hope it is so from the bottom of my heart did you hear from marys fanny since and how are mats girls so mannahatta you tear uncle georges letters do you you mustnt do so little girl nor uncle walts either but when you get to be a big girl you must have them all nice and read them for grandmother will perhaps leave them to you in her will if you behave like a lady matty my dear sister how are you getting along i really want to see you bad and the baby toowell maybe we shall all come together and have some good times yet jeff i hope by next week this time we shall be in possession of charlestonsome papers say burnside is moving for knoxville but it is doubtfuli think the 9th corps might take a rest awhile anyhow goodbye mother      walt   xxi  washington sept 1 1863 dear motheri have been thinking today and all yesterday about the draft in brooklyn and whether jeff would be drafted you must some of you write me just as soon as you get thisi want to know i feel anxious enough i can tell youand besides it seems a good while since i have received any letters from home of course it is impossible for jeff to go in case it should turn out he was draftedthe way our family is all situated now it would be madness if the common council raise the money to exempt men with families dependent on them i think jeff ought to have no scruples in taking advantage of it as i think he is in duty boundbut we will see what course to take when we know the result etc write about it right away  the eagles came this is the second time i am glad to get themjeff wait till you get four or five and then send them with a twocent stamp i have not had any letter from george mother have you heard anything did the money come dear mother how are you nowadays i do hope you feel well and in good spiritsi think about you every day of my life out here sometimes i see women in the hospitals mothers come to see their sons and occasionally one that makes me think of my dear motherone did very much a lady about 60 from pennsylvania come to see her son a captain very badly wounded and his wound gangrened and they after a while removed him to a tent by himself another son of hers a young man came with her to see his brother she was a pretty fullsized lady with spectacles she dressed in blacklooked real velsory17 i got very well acquainted with her she had a real long island oldfashioned waybut i had to avoid the poor captain as it was that time that my hand was cut in the artery and i was liable to gangrene myselfbut she and the two sons have gone home now but i doubt whether the wounded one is alive as he was very low mother i want to hear about andrew too whether he went to rockland lake you have no idea how many soldiers there are who have lost their voices and have to speak in whispersthere are a great many i meet some almost every day as far as that alone is concerned andrew must not be discouraged as the general health may be good as common irrespective of that i do hope andrew will get along better than he thinks forit is bad enough for a poor man to be out of health even partially but he must try to look on the bright side mother have you heard anything from han since or from marys folks i got a letter from mrs price last week if you see emma tell her i was pleased to get it and shall answer it very soon mother i have sent another letter to the n y timesit may appear if not today within a few days i am feeling excellent well these days it is so moderate and pleasant weather now i was getting real exhausted with the heat i thought of you too how it must have exhausted you those hot days i still occupy the same 3rd story room 394 l st and get my breakfast in my room in the morning myself and dinner at a restaurant about 3 oclocki get along very well and very economical which is a forced put but just as well but i must get another room or a boardinghouse soon as the folks are all going to move this month my good and real friends the oconnors live in the same block i am in there every day dear mother tell mat and miss mannahatta i send them my lovei want to see them both o how i want to see jeff and you mother i sometimes feel as if i should just get in the cars and come homeand the baby too you must always write about her dear mother goodbye for present      walt   xxii  washington sept 8 1863 tuesday morning dearest motheri wrote to jeff sunday last that his letter sent sept 3rd containing your letter and 5 from mr lane had miscarriedthis morning when i came down to major hapgoods office i found it on my table so it is all rightsingular where it has been all this while as i see the postmark on it is brooklyn sept 3 as jeff said mother what to do about andrew i hardly knowas it is i feel about as much pity for you as i do for my poor brother andrew for i know you will worry yourself about him all the time i was in hopes it was only the trouble about the voice etc but i see i was mistaken and it is probably worse i know you and jeff and mat will do all you canand will have patience with all it is not only the sick who are poorly off but their friends but it is best to have the greatest forbearance and do and give etc whatever one canbut you know that and practice it too dear mother mother if i had the means o how cheerfully i would give them whether they availed anything for andrew or notyet i have long made up my mind that money does not amount to so much at least not so very much in serious cases of sickness it is judgment both in the person himself and in those he has to do withand good heart in everything mother you remember theodore gould how he stuck it out though sickness and death has had hold of him as you may say for fifteen years but anyhow i hope we will all do what we can for andrew mother i think i must try to come home for a monthi have not given up my project of lecturing i spoke about before but shall put it in practice yet i feel clear it will succeed enough i wish i had some of the money already it would be satisfaction to me to contribute something to andrews necessities for he must have bread i will write to you of course before i come mother i hope you will live betterjeff tells me you and jess and ed live on poor stuff you are so economical mother you mustnt do so as long as you have a centi hope you will at least four or five times a week have a steak of beef or mutton or something substantial for dinner i have one good meal of that kind every day or at least five or six days out of the sevenbut for breakfast i have nothing but a cup of tea and some bread or crackers firstrate tea though with milk and good white sugar well i find it is hearty enoughmore than half the time i never eat anything after dinner and when i do it is only a cracker and cup of tea mother i hope you will not stint yourselvesas to using georges money for your and jesss and eds needful living expenses i know george would be mad and hurt in his feelings if he thought you was afraid to mother you have a comfortable time as much as you can and get a steak occasionally wont you i suppose mat got her letter last saturday i sent it friday o i was so pleased that jeff was not drawn and i know how mat must have felt too i have no idea the government will try to draft again whatever happensthey have carried their point but have not made much out of it o how the conscripts and substitutes are deserting down in front and on their way thereyou dont hear anything about it but it is incrediblethey dont allow it to get in the papers mother i was so glad to get your letter you must write againcant you write tomorrow so i can get it friday or saturdayyou know though you wrote more than a week ago i did not get it till this morning i wish jeff to write too as often as he can mother i was gratified to hear you went up among the soldiersthey are rude in appearance but they know what is decent and it pleases them much to have folks even old women take an interest and come among them mother you must go again and take mat well dear mother i must close i am first rate in health so much better than a month and two months agomy hand has entirely healed i go to hospital every day or nighti believe no men ever loved each other as i and some of these poor wounded sick and dying men love each other goodbye dearest mother for present      walt  tuesday afternoon mother it seems to be certain that meade has gained the day and that the battles there in pennsylvania have been about as terrible as any in the wari think the killed and wounded there on both sides were as many as eighteen or twenty thousandin one place four or five acres there were a thousand dead at daybreak on saturday morning mother ones heart grows sick of war after all when you see what it really is every once in a while i feel so horrified and disgustedit seems to me like a great slaughterhouse and the men mutually butchering each otherthen i feel how impossible it appears again to retire from this contest until we have carried our points it is cruel to be so tossed from pillar to post in ones judgment washington is a pleasant place in some respectsit has the finest trees and plenty of them everywhere on the streets and grounds the capitol grounds though small have the finest cultivated trees i ever seethere is a great variety and not one but is in perfect condition after i finish this letter i am going out there for an hours recreation the great sights of washington are the public buildings the wide streets the public grounds the trees the smithsonian institute and grounds i go to the latter occasionallythe institute is an old fogy concern but the grounds are fine sometimes i go up to georgetown about two and a half miles up the potomac an old townjust opposite it in the river is an island where the niggers have their first washington regt encamped they make a good show are often seen in the streets of washington in squads since they have begun to carry arms the secesh here and in georgetown about three fifths are not insulting to them as formerly  one of the things here always on the go is long trains of army wagonssometimes they will stream along all day it almost seems as if there was nothing else but army wagons and ambulances they have great camps here in every direction of army wagons teamsters ambulance camps etc some of them are permanent and have small hospitals i go to them as no one else goes ladies would not venture i sometimes have the luck to give some of the drivers a great deal of comfort and help indeed mother there are camps here of everythingi went once or twice to the contraband camp to the hospital etc but i could not bring myself to go againwhen i meet black men or boys among my own hospitals i use them kindly give them something etci believe i told you that i do the same to the wounded rebels toobut as there is a limit to ones sinews and endurance and sympathies etc i have got in the way after going lightly as it were all through the wards of a hospital and trying to give a word of cheer if nothing else to every one then confining my special attentions to the few where the investment seems to tell best and who want it most mother i have real pride in telling you that i have the consciousness of saving quite a number of lives by saving them from giving upand being a good deal with them the men say it is so and the doctors say it is soand i will candidly confess i can see it is true though i say it of myself i know you will like to hear it mother so i tell you i am finishing this in major hapgoods office about 1 oclockit is pretty warm but has not cleared off yet the trees look so well from where i am and the potomacit is a noble river i see it several miles and the arlington heights mother i see some of the 47th brooklyn every day or two the regt is on the heights back of arlington house a fine camp ground o matty i have just thought of youdear sister how are you getting along jeff i will write you truly goodbye for the present dearest mother and all      walt   xxiii  washington sept 15 1863 dear motheryour letters were very acceptableone came just as i was putting my last in the post officei guess they all come right i have written to han and george and sent george papers mother have you heard anything whether the 51st went on with burnside or did they remain as a reserve in kentucky burnside has managed splendidly so far his taking knoxville and all togetherit is a firstclass success i have known tennessee union men here in hospital and i understand it thereforethe region where knoxville is is mainly union but the southerners could not exist without it as it is in their midst so they determined to pound and kill and crush out the unionistsall the savage and monstrous things printed in the papers about their treatment are true at least that kind of thing is as bad as the irish in the mob treated the poor niggers in new york we north dont understand some things about southerners it is very strange the contrastif i should pick out the most genuine union men and real patriots i have ever met in all my experience i should pick out two or three tennessee and virginia unionists i have met in the hospitals wounded or sick one young man i guess i have mentioned to you in my letters john barker 2nd tennessee vol union was a long while a prisoner in secesh prisons in georgia and in richmondthree times the devils hung him up by the heels to make him promise to give up his unionism once he was cut down for dead he is a young married man with one child his little property destroyed his wife and child turned outhe hunted and tormentedand any moment he could have had anything if he would join the confederacybut he was firm as a rock he would not even take an oath to not fight for either side they held him about eight monthsthen he was very sick scurvy and they exchanged him and he came up from richmond here to hospital here i got acquainted with him he is a large slow goodnatured man somehow made me often think of father shrewd very little to saywouldnt talk to anybody but me his whole thought was to get back and fight he was not fit to go but he has gone back to tennessee he spent two days with his wife and young one there and then to his regimenthe writes to me frequently and i to him he is not fit to soldier for the rebels have destroyed his health and strength though he is only 23 or 4 but nothing will keep him from his regiment and fightinghe is uneducated but as sensible a young man as i ever met and understands the whole question well mother jack barker is the most genuine union man i have ever yet met i asked him once very gravely why he didnt take the southern oath and get his libertyif he didnt think he was foolish to be so stiff etc i never saw such a look as he gave me he thought i was in earnestthe old devil himself couldnt have had put a worse look in his eyes mother i have no doubt there are quite a good many just such men he is down there with his regiment one of his brothers was killedwhen he fails in strength he gets the colonel to detach him to do teamsters duty for a few days on a march till he recruits his strengthbut he always carries his gun with himin a battle he is always in the ranksthen he is so sensible such decent manly ways nothing shallow or mean he must have been a giant in health but now he is weaker has a cough too mother can you wonder at my getting so attached to such men with such love especially when they show it to mesome of them on their dying beds and in the very hour of death or just the same when they recover or partially recover i never knew what american young men were till i have been in the hospitals well mother i have got writing onthere is nothing new with me just the same old thing as i suppose it is with you there mother how is andrew i wish to hear all about himi do hope he is better and that it will not prove anything so bad i will write to him soon myself but in the meantime you must tell him to not put so much faith in medicinedrugs i meanas in the true curative things namely diet and careful habits breathing good air etc you know i wrote in a former letter what is the cause and foundation of the diseases of the throat and what must be the remedy that goes to the bottom of the thingsudden attacks are to be treated with applications and medicines but diseases of a seated character are not to be cured by them only perhaps a little relieved and often aggravated made firmer  dearest mother i hope you yourself are well and getting along good about the letter in the times i see ever since i sent they have been very crowded with news that must be printedi think they will give it yet i hear there is a new paper in brooklyn or to be onei wish jeff would send me some of the first numbers without fail and a stray eagle in same parcel to make up the 4 ounces i am glad to hear mat was going to write me a good long letterevery letter from home is so good when one is away i often see the men crying in the hospital when they get a letter jeff too i want him to write whenever he can and not forget the new paper we are having pleasant weather here it is such a relief from that awful heat i cant think of another such siege without feeling sick at the thought  mother i believe i told you i had written to mrs pricedo you see emma are the soldiers still on fort greene well mother i have writ quite a letterit is between 2 and 3 oclocki am in major hapgoods all alonefrom my window i see all the potomac and all around washingtonmajor and all gone down to the army to pay troops and i keep house i am invited to dinner today at 4 oclock at a mr boylesi am going hope we shall have something good dear mother i send you my love and some to jeff and mat and all not forgetting mannahatta who i hope is a help and comfort to her grandmother well i must scratch off in a hurry for it is nearly an hour later than i thought goodbye for the present dear mother      walt   xxiv  washington sept 29 1863 dear motherwell here i sit this forenoon in a corner by the window in major hapgoods office all the potomac and maryland and virginia hills in sight writing my tuesday letter to you dearest mother major has gone home to boston on sick leave and only the clerk and me occupy the office and he not much of the time at the present moment there are two wounded officers come in to get their payone has crutches the other is drest in the lightblue uniform of the invalid corps way up here on the 5th floor it is pretty hard scratching for cripples and very weak men to journey up hereoften they come up here very weary and faint and then find out they cant get their money some redtape hitch and the poor soldiers look so disappointedit always makes me feel bad  mother we are having perfect weather here nowadays both night and day the nights are wonderful for the last three nights as i have walked home from the hospital pretty late it has seemed to me like a dream the moon and sky ahead of anything i ever see before mother do you hear anything from george i wrote to him yesterday and sent him your last letter and jeffs enclosedi shall send him some papers todayi send him papers quite often why hasnt jeff sent me the union with my letter in i want much to see it and whether they have misprinted it  mother i dont think the 51st has been in any of the fighting we know of down there yetwhat is to come of course nobody can tell as to burnside i suppose you know he is among his friends and i think this quite important for such the main body of east tennesseans are and are far truer americans anyhow than the copperheads of the north the tennesseans will fight for us too mother you have no idea how the soldiers sick etc i mean the american ones to a man all feel about the copperheads they never speak of them without a curse and i hear them say with an air that shows they mean it they would shoot them sooner than they would a rebel mother the troops from meades army are passing through here night and day going west and so down to reinforce rosecrans i supposethe papers are not permitted to mention it but it is so two army corps i should think have mostly passedthey go through night and dayi hear the whistle of the locomotive screaming away any time at night when i wake up and the rumbling of the trains  mother dear you must write to me soon and so must jeff i thought mat was going to send me a great long letteri am always looking for it i hope it will be full of everything about family matters and doings and how everybody really is i go to majors box three or four times a day i want to hear also about andrew and indeed about every one of you and everythingnothing is too trifling nothing uninteresting  o mother who do you think i got a letter from two or three days ago aunt fanny ansels mothershe sent it by a young man a wounded soldier who has been home to farmingdale on furlough and lately returned she writes a firstrate letter quaker all overi shall answer it she says mary and ansel and all are well i have received another letter from mrs priceshe has not good health i am sorry for her from my heart she is a good noble woman no better kind mother i am in the hospitals as usuali stand it better the last three weeks than ever beforei go among the worst fevers and wounds with impunity i go among the smallpox etc just the samei feel to go without apprehension and so i go nobody else goes and as the darkey said there at charleston when the boat run on a flat and the reb sharpshooters were peppering them somebody must jump in de water and shove de boat off      walt   xxv  washington oct 6 1863 dearest motheryour letter and georges came safedear brother george one dont more than get a letter from him before you want to hear again especially as things are looking pretty stormy that waybut mother i rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is still in kentucky at or near where george last wrote but of course that is only my guess i send george papers and occasionally letters mother i sent him enclosed your letter before the last though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home as you wanted to surprise him but i sent it mother i think rosecrans and burnside will be too much for the rebels down there yet i myself make a great acct of burnside being in the midst of friends and such friends toothey will fight and fight up to the handle and kill somebody it seems as if it was coming to that pass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed mother i wish you would write soon after you get this or jeff or mat must and tell me about andrew if there is anything different with himi think about him every day and night i believe i must come home even if it is only for a weeki want to see you all very much mother i know you must have a great deal to harass and trouble you i dont mean about andrew personally for i know you would feel to give your life to save his and do anything to nourish him but about the children and nancybut mother you must not let anything chafe you and you must not be squeamish about saying firmly at times not to have little georgy too much to trouble you poor little fellow i have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he grows older and while you are pleasant with nancy you must be sufficiently plain with heronly mother i know you will and jeff and mat will too be invariably good to andrew and not mind his being irritable at times it is his disease and then his temper is naturally fretful but it is such a misfortune to have such sicknessand always do anything for him that you can in reason mat my dear sister i know you will for i know your nature is to come out a firstclass girl in times of trouble and sickness and do anything mother you dont know how pleased i was to read what you wrote about little sis i want to see her so bad i dont know what to do i know she must be just the best young one on long islandbut i hope it will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to miss hat nor to put her nose out of joint because uncle walt i hope has heart and gizzard big enough for both his little nieces and as many more as the lord may send  mother i am writing this in major hapgoods office as usual i am all alone todaymajor is still absent unwell and the clerk is away somewhere o how pleasant it is herethe weather i meanand other things too for that matter i still occupy my little room 394 l st get my own breakfast there had good tea this morning and some nice biscuit yesterday morning and day before had peaches cut up my friends the oconnors that i wrote about recommenced cooking the 1st of this month they have been as usual in summer taking their meals at a family hotel near by saturday they sent for me to breakfast and sunday i eat dinner with themvery good dinner roast beef lima beans good potatoes etc they are truly friends to me i still get my dinner at a restaurant usually i have a very good plain dinner which is the only meal of any account i make during the day but it is just as well for i would be in danger of getting fat on the least encouragement and i have no ambition that way mother it is lucky i like washington in many respects and that things are upon the whole pleasant personally for every day of my life i see enough to make ones heart ache with sympathy and anguish here in the hospitals and i do not know as i could stand it if it was not counterbalanced outside it is curious when i am present at the most appalling thingsdeaths operations sickening wounds perhaps full of maggotsi do not fail although my sympathies are very much excited but keep singularly cool but often hours afterward perhaps when i am home or out walking alone i feel sick and actually tremble when i recall the thing and have it in my mind again before me mother did you see my letter in the n y times of sunday oct 4 that was the longdelayed letter mother i am very sorry jeff did not send me the union with my letter ini wish very much he could do so yet and always when i have a letter in a paper i would like to have one sent if you take the union send me some once in a while mother was it will brown sent me those tell him if so i was much obliged and if he or mr and mrs brown take any interest in hearing my scribblings mother you let them read the letters of course o i must not close without telling you the highly important intelligence that i have cut my hair and beardsince the event rosecrans charleston etc etc have among my acquaintances been hardly mentioned being insignificant themes in comparison jeff my dearest brother i have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or three weeks past will try to yet so it will reach you for sunday readingso goodbye jeff and goodbye for present mother dear and all and tell andrew he must not be discouraged yet      walt   xxvi  washington oct 11 1863 dear friend18your letters were both received and were indeed welcome dont mind my not answering them promptly for you know what a wretch i am about such things but you must write just as often as you conveniently can tell me all about your folks especially the girls and about mr a of course you wont forget arthur19 and always when you write to him send my love tell me about mrs u and the dear little rogues tell mrs b she ought to be here hospital matron only it is a harder pull than folks anticipate you wrote about emma20 she thinks she might and ought to come as nurse for the soldiers dear girl i know it would be a blessed thing for the men to have her loving spirit and hand and whoever of the poor fellows had them would indeed think it so but my darling it is a dreadful thingyou dont know these wounds sickness etc the sad condition in which many of the men are brought here and remain for days sometimes the wounds full of crawling corruption etc down in the fieldhospitals in front they have no proper care cant have and after a battle go for many days unattended to  abby i think often about you and the pleasant days the visits i used to pay you and how good it was always to be made so welcome o i wish i could come in this afternoon and have a good tea with you and have three or four hours of mutual comfort and rest and talk and be all of us together again is helen home and well and what is she doing now and you my dear friend how sorry i am to hear that your health is not ruggedbut dear abby you must not dwell on anticipations of the worst but i know that is not your nature or did not use to be i hope this will find you quite well and in good spirits i feel so well myselfi will have to come and see you i thinki am so fat out considerable in the open air and all red and tanned worse than ever you see therefore that my life amid these sad and deathstricken hospitals has not told upon me for i am this fall so running over with health and i feel as if i ought to go on on that account working among all the sick and deficient and o how gladly i would bestow upon you a liberal share of my health dear abby if such a thing were possible  i am continually moving around among the hospitals one i go to oftenest the last three months is armorysquare as it is large generally full of the worst wounds and sickness and is among the least visited to this or some other i never miss a day or evening i am enabled to give the men something and perhaps some trifle to their supper all around then there are always special cases calling for something special above all the poor boys welcome magnetic friendship personality some are so fervent so hungering for thispoor fellows how young they are lying there with their pale faces and that mute look in their eyes o how one gets to love themoften particular cases so suffering so good so manly and affectionate abby you would all smile to see me among themmany of them like children ceremony is mostly discardedthey suffer and get exhausted and so wearynot a few are on their dying bedslots of them have grown to expect as i leave at night that we should kiss each other sometimes quite a number i have to go round poor boys there is little petting in a soldiers life in the field but abby i know what is in their hearts always waiting though they may be unconscious of it themselves  i have a place where i buy very nice homemade biscuits sweet crackers etc among others one of my ways is to get a good lot of these and for supper go through a couple of wards and give a portion to each mannext day two wards more and so on then each marked case needs something to itself i spend my evenings altogether at the hospitalsmy days often i give little gifts of money in small sums which i am enabled to doall sorts of things indeed food clothing letterstamps i write lots of letters now and then a good pair of crutches etc etc then i read to the boys the whole ward that can walk gathers around me and listens  all this i tell you my dear because i know it will interest you i like washington very well did you see my last letter in the new york times of october 4th sunday i have three or four hours work every day copying and in writing letters for the press etc make enough to pay my waylive in an inexpensive manner anyhow i like the mission i am on here and as it deeply holds me i shall continue  october 15 well abby i guess i send you letter enough i ought to have finished and sent off the letter last sunday when it was written i have been pretty busy we are having new arrivals of wounded and sick now all the timesome very bad cases abby should you come across any one who feels to help contribute to the men through me write me i may then send word some purchases i should find acceptable for the men but this only if it happens to come in that you know or meet any one perfectly convenient abby i have found some good friends here a few but true as steelw d oconnor and wife above all he is a clerk in the treasuryshe is a yankee girl then c w eldridge21 in paymasters department he is a boston boy tootheir friendship has been unswerving  in the hospitals among these american young men i could not describe to you what mutual attachments and how passing deep and tender these boys some have died but the love for them lives as long as i draw breath these soldiers know how to love too when once they have the right person and the right love offered them it is wonderful you see i am running off into the clouds but this is my element abby i am writing this note this afternoon in major hs officehe is away sicki am here a good deal of the time alone it is a dark rainy afternoonwe dont know what is going on down in front whether meade is getting the worst of it or notbut the result of the big elections cheers us i believe fully in lincolnfew know the rocks and quicksands he has to steer through i enclose you a note mrs oc handed me to send youwritten i suppose upon impulse she is a noble massachusetts woman is not very rugged in healthi am there very muchher husband and i are great friends too well i will closethe rain is pouring the sky leaden it is between 2 and 3 i am going to get some dinner and then to the hospital goodbye dear friends and i send my love to all      walt   xxvii  washington oct 13 1863 dearest mothernothing particular new with me i am well and heartythink a good deal about home mother i so much want to see you even if only for a couple of weeks for i feel i must return here and continue my hospital operations they are so much needed although one can do only such a little in comparison amid these thousands then i desire much to see andrew i wonder if i could cheer him up any does he get any good from that treatment with the baths etc mother i suppose you have your hands full with nancys poor little children and one worry and another when one gets old little things bother a great deal mother i go down every day looking for a letter from you or jeffi had two from jeff latter part of the week i want to see jeff much i wonder why he didnt send me the union with my letter in i am disappointed at not getting it i sent han a n y times with my last letter and one to george too have you heard anything from george or han there is a new lot of wounded now again they have been arriving sick and wounded for three daysfirst long strings of ambulances with the sick but yesterday many with bad and bloody wounds poor fellows i thought i was cooler and more used to it but the sight of some of them brought tears into my eyes mother i had the good luck yesterday to do quite a great deal of good i had provided a lot of nourishing things for the men but for another quarterbut i had them where i could use them immediately for these new wounded as they came in faint and hungry and fagged out with a long rough journey all dirty and torn and many pale as ashes and all bloody i distributed all my stores gave partly to the nurses i knew that were just taking charge of themand as many as i could i fed myself then besides i found a lot of oyster soup handy and i procured it all at once mother it is the most pitiful sight i think when first the men are brought in i have to bustle round to keep from cryingthey are such rugged young menall these just arrived are cavalry men our troops got the worst of it but fought like devils our men engaged were kilpatricks cavalry they were in the rear as part of meades retreat and the reb cavalry cut in between and cut them off and attacked them and shelled them terribly but kilpatrick brought them out mostlythis was last sunday  mother i will try to come home before long if only for six or eight days i wish to see you and andrewi wish to see the young ones and mat you must write i am about moving i have been hunting for a room todayi shall write next time how i succeed goodbye for present dear mother      walt   xxviii  washington oct 20 1863 dearest motheri got your last letter sunday morning though it was dated thursday night mother i suppose you got a letter from me saturday last as i sent one the day before as i was concerned about andrew if i thought it would be any benefit to andrew i should certainly leave everything else and come back to brooklyn mother do you recollect what i wrote last summer about throat diseases when andrew was first pretty bad well thats the whole groundwork of the business any true physician would confirm it there is no great charm about such things as to any costly and mysterious baths there are no better baths than warm water or vapor and perhaps sulphur vapor there is nothing costly or difficult about them one can have a very good sweating bath at a pinch by having a pan of warm water under a chair with a couple of blankets around him to enclose the vapor and heating a couple of bricks or stones or anything to put in one after another and sitting on the chairit is a very wholesome sweat too and not to be sneezed at if one wishes to do what is salutary and thinks of the sense of a thing and not what others do andrew mustnt be discouraged those diseases are painful and tedious but he can recover and will yet dear mother i sent your last letter to george with a short one i wrote myself i sent it yesterday i sent a letter last wednesday 14th to him also hoping that if one dont reach him another will hasnt jeff seen capt sims or lieut mcready yet and dont they hear whether the 51st is near nicholasville kentucky yet i send george papers now and then mother one of your letters contains part of my letter to the union i wish i could have got the whole of it it seems to me mostly as i intended it barring a few slight misprints was my last name signed at the bottom of it tell me when you write next dear mother i am real sorry and mad too that the water works people have cut jeffs wages down to 50 this is a pretty time to cut a mans wages down the mean old punkin heads mother i cant understand it at all tell me more of the particulars jeff i often wish you was on here you would be better appreciatedthere are big salaries paid here sometimes to civil engineers jeff i know a fellow e c stedman has been here till lately is now in wall street he is poor but he is in with the big bankers hallett  co who are in with fremont in his line of pacific railroad i can get his stedmans address and should you wish it any time i will give you a letter to him i shouldnt wonder if the big men with fremont at head were going to push their route works road etc etc in earnest and if a fellow could get a good managing place in it why it might be worth while i think after jeff has been with the brooklyn water works from the beginning and so faithful and so really valuable to put down to 50the mean lowlived old shoats i have felt as indignant about it the meanness of the thing and mighty inconvenient too40 a month makes a big difference mother i hope jeff wont get and keep himself in a perpetual fever with all these things and others and botherations both family and business ones if he does he will just wear himself down before his time comes i do hope jeff you will take things equally all round and not brood or think too deeply so i go on giving you all good advice o mother i must tell you how i get along in my new quarters i have moved to a new room 456 sixth street not far from pennsylvania avenue the big street here and not far from the capitol it is in the 3d story an addition back seems to be going to prove a very good winter room as it is right under the roof and looks south has low windows is plenty big enough i have gas i think the lady will prove a good woman she is old and feeble there is a little girl of 4 or 5 i hear her sometimes calling grandma grandma just exactly like hat it made me think of you and hat right away one thing is i am quite by myself there is no passage up there except to my room and right off against my side of the house is a great old yard with grass and some trees back and the sun shines in all day etc and it smells sweet and good airgood big bed i sleep first rate there is a young wench of 12 or 13 lucy the niggers here are the best and most amusing creatures you ever seeshe comes and goes gets water etc she is pretty much the only one i see then i believe the front door is not locked at all at night in the other place the old thief the landlord had two front doors with four locks and bolts on one and three on the otherand a big bulldog in the back yard we were well fortified i tell you sometimes i had an awful time at night getting in i pay 10 a month this includes gas but not fuel jeff you can come on and see me easy now mother to give you an idea of prices here while i was looking for rooms about like our two in wheelers houses 2nd story nothing extra about them either in location or anything and the rent was 60 a month yet quite curious vacant houses here are not so very dear very much the same as in brooklyn dear mother jeff wrote in his letter latter part of last week you was real unwell with a very bad cold and that you didnt have enough good meals mother i hope this will find you well and in good spirits i think about you every day and night jeff thinks you show your age more and failing like o my dear mother you must not think of failing yet i hope we shall have some comfortable years yet mother dont allow things troubles to take hold of you write a few lines whenever you can tell me exactly how things are mother i am first rate and wellonly a little of that deafness again goodbye for present      walt   xxix  washington oct 27 1863 dearest motheryours and georges letter came and a letter from jeff tooall good i had received a letter a day or so before from george too i am very glad he is at camp nelson kentucky and i hope and pray the regt will be kept therefor god knows they have tramped enough for the last two years and fought battles and been through enough i have sent george papers to camp nelson and will write tomorrow i send him the unions and the late new york papers mother you or jeff write and tell me how andrew is i hope he will prove to be better such complaints are sometimes very alarming for awhile and then take such a turn for the better common means and steadily pursuing them about diet especially are so much more reliable than any course of medicine whatever mother i have written to han i sent her georges letter to me and wrote her a short letter myself i sent it four or five days ago mother i am real pleased to hear jeffs explanation how it is that his wages is cut down and that it was not as i fancied from the meanness of the old coons in the board i felt so indignant about it as i took it into my head though i dont know why that it was done out of meanness and was a sort of insult i was quite glad jeff wrote a few lines about itand glad they appreciate jeff too mother if any of my soldier boys should ever call upon you as they are often anxious to have my address in brooklyn you just use them as you know how to without ceremony and if you happen to have pot luck and feel to ask them to take a bite dont be afraid to do so there is one very good boy thos neat 2nd n y cavalry wounded in leg he is now home on furloughhis folks live i think in jamaica he is a noble boy he may call upon you i gave him here 1 toward buying his crutches etc i like him very much then possibly a mr haskell or some of his folks from western new york may callhe had a son died here a very fine boy i was with him a good deal and the old man and his wife have written me and asked me my address in brooklyn he said he had children in n y city and was occasionally down there mother when i come home i will show you some of the letters i get from mothers sisters fathers etcthey will make you cry there is nothing new with my hospital doingsi was there yesterday afternoon and

all fired up these dayswe have had some real cool weather here i must rake up a little cheap secondhand stove for my room for it was in the bargain that i should get that myself mother i like my place quite well better on nearly every account than my old room but i see it will only do for a winter room they keep it clean and the house smells clean and the room too my old room they just let everything lay where it was and you can fancy what a litter of dirt there wasstill it was a splendid room for air for summer as good as there is in washington i got a letter from mrs price this morningdoes emmy ever come to see you  matty my dear sister and miss mannahatta and the little one whose name i dont know and perhaps hasnt got any name yet i hope you are all well and having good times i often often think about you all mat do you go any to the opera now they say the new singers are so goodwhen i come home well try to go mother i am very wellhave some cold in my head and my ears stopt up yet making me sometimes quite hard of hearing i am writing this in major hapgoods office last sunday i took dinner at my friends the oconnorshad two roast chickens stewed tomatoes potatoes etc i took dinner there previous sunday also  well dear mother how the time passes awayto think it will soon be a year i have been away it has passed away very swiftly somehow to me o what things i have witnessed during that timei shall never forget them and the war is not settled yet and one does not see anything at all certain about the settlement yet but i have finally got for good i think into the feeling that our triumph is assured whether it be sooner or whether it be later or whatever roundabout way we are led there and i find i dont change that conviction from any reverses we meet or any delays or government blunders there are blunders enough heaven knows but i am thankful things have gone on as well for us as they havethankful the ship rides safe and sound at all then i have finally made up my mind that mr lincoln has done as good as a human man could do i still think him a pretty big president i realize here in washington that it has been a big thing to have just kept the united states from being thrown down and having its throat cut and now i have no doubt it will throw down secession and cut its throatand i have not had any doubt since gettysburg well dear dear mother i will draw to a close andrew and jeff and all i send you my love goodbye dear mother and dear matty and all hands      walt   xxx  washington dec 15 1863 dearest motherthe last word i got

of andrews funeral and how you all are getting along i have not received the eagle with the little piece in i was in hopes jeff would have sent it i wish he would yet or some of you would i want to

ever i go every day or evening i have not heard from georgei have no doubt the 51st is still at crab orchard  mother i hope you will try to write i send you my love and to jeff and mat and allso goodbye dear mother      walt     letters of 1864   i  washington friday afternoon jan 29 64 dear motheryour letter of tuesday night came this forenoonthe one of sunday night i received yesterday mother you dont say in either of them whether george has reenlisted or notor is that not yet decided positively one way or the other  o mother how i should like to be home i dont want more than two or three days i want to see george i have his photograph on the wall right over my table all the time and i want to see californiayou must always write in your letters how she is i shall write to han this afternoon or tomorrow morning and tell her probably george will come out and see her and that if he does you will send her word beforehand  jeff my dear brother if there should be the change made in the works and things all overturned you mustnt mindi dare say you will pitch into something better i believe a real overturn in the dead old beaten track of a mans life especially a young mans is always likely to turn out best though it worries one at first dreadfully mat i want to see you most sincerelythey havent put in anything in the last two or three letters about you but i suppose you are well my dear sister  mother the young man that i took care of lewis brown is pretty well but very restlesshe is doing well now but there is a long road before him yet it is torture for him to be tied so to his cot this weather he is a very noble young man and has suffered very much he is a maryland boy and like the southerners when they are union i think he is as strong and resolute a union boy as there is in the united states he went out in a maryland regt but transferred to a n y battery but i find so many noble men in the ranks i have ceased to wonder at it i think the soldiers from the new england states and the western states are splendid and the country parts of n y and pennsylvania too i think less of the great cities than i used to i know there are black sheep enough even in the ranks but the general rule is the soldiers are noble very  mother i wonder if george thinks as i do about the best way to enjoy a visit home after all when i come home again i shall not go off gallivanting with my companions half as much nor a quarter as much as i used to but shall spend the time quietly home with you while i do stay it is a great humbug spreeing around and a few choice friends for a man the real right kind in a quiet way are enough  mother i hope you take things easy dont you mother you know i was always advising you to let things go and sit down and take what comfort you can while you do live it is very warm here this afternoon it is warm enough for julythe sun burns where it shines on your face it is pretty dusty in the principal streets  congress is in session i see odell kalbfleisch etc often i have got acquainted with mr garfield an m c from ohio and like him very much indeed he has been a soldier west and i believe a good brave onewas a major general i dont go much to the debates this session yet congress will probably keep in session till well into the summer as to what course things will take political or military theres no telling i think though the secesh military power is getting more and more shaky how they can make any headway against our new large and fresh armies next season passes my wit to see  mother i was talking with a pretty high officer here who is behind the scenesi was mentioning that i had a great desire to be present at a firstclass battle he told me if i would only stay around here three or four weeks longer my wish would probably be gratified i asked him what he meant what he alluded to specifically but he would not say anything furtherso i remain as much in the dark as beforeonly there seemed to be some meaning in his remark and it was made to me only as there was no one else in hearing at the moment he is quite an admirer of my poetry  the reenlistment of the veterans is the greatest thing yet it pleases everybody but the rebelsand surprises everybody too mother i am well and fat i must weigh about 206 so washington must agree with me i work three or four hours a day copying dear mother i send you and hattie my love as you say she is a dear little girl mother try to write every week even if only a few lines love to george and jeff and mat      walt   ii  washington feb 2 1864 dearest motheri am writing this by the side of the young man you asked about lewis brown in armorysquare hospital he is getting along very well indeedthe amputation is healing up good and he does not suffer anything like as much as he did i see him every day we have had real hot weather here and for the last three days wet and rainy it is more like june than february mother i wrote to han last saturdayshe must have got it yesterday i have not heard anything from home since a week ago your last letter i suppose you got a letter from me saturday last i am well as usual there has been several hundred sick soldiers brought in here yesterday i have been around among them today all dayit is enough to make me heartsick the old times over again they are many of them mere wrecks though young men sickness is worse in some respects than wounds one boy about 16 from portland maine only came from home a month ago a recruit he is here now very sick and downhearted poor child he is a real country boy i think has consumption he was only a week with his regt i sat with him a long time i saw it did him great good i have been feeding some their dinners it makes me feel quite proud i find so frequently i can do with the men what no one else at all can getting them to eat some that will not touch their food otherwise nor for anybody elseit is sometimes quite affecting i can tell you i found such a case today a soldier with throat disease very bad i fed him quite a dinner the men his comrades around just stared in wonder and one of them told me afterwards that he the sick man had not eat so much at a meal in three months mother i shall have my hands pretty full now for a whilewrite all about things home      walt  lewis brown says i must give you his lovehe says he knows he would like you if he should see you   iii  washington friday afternoon feb 5 1864 dearest motheri am going down in front in the midst of the army tomorrow morning to be gone for about a weekso i thought i would write you a few lines now to let you know  mother i suppose you got my letter written last tuesdayi have not got any from home now for a number of days i am well and hearty the young man lewis brown is able to be up a little on crutches there is quite a number of sick young men i have taken in hand from the late arrivals that i am sorry to leave sick and downhearted and lonesome they think so much of a friend and i get so attached to them toobut i want to go down in camp once more very much and i think i shall be back in a week i shall spend most of my time among the sick and wounded in the camp hospitals if i had means i should stop with them poor boys or go among them periodically dispensing what i had as long as the war lasts down among the worst of it although what are collected here in hospital seem to me about as severe and needy cases as any after all  mother i want to hear about you all and about george and how he is spending his time home mother i do hope you are well and in good spirits and jeff and mat and all and dear little california and hattiei send them all my love mother i may write to you from down in frontso goodbye dear mother for present      walt  i hope i shall find several letters waiting for me when i get back here   iv  culpepper virginia friday night feb 12 1864 dearest motheri am still stopping down in this region i am a good deal of the time down within half a mile of our picket lines so that you see i can indeed call myself in the front i stopped yesterday with an artillery camp in the 1st corps at the invitation of capt crawford who said that he knew me in brooklyn it is close to the linesi asked him if he did not think it dangerous he said no he could have a large force of infantry to help him there in very short metre if there was any sudden emergency the troops here are scattered all around much more apart than they seemed to me to be opposite fredericksburg last winter they mostly have good huts and fireplaces etc i have been to a great many of the camps and i must say i am astonished how good the houses are almost everywhere i have not seen one regiment nor any part of one in the poor uncomfortable little shelter tents that i saw so common last winter after fredericksburgbut all the men have built huts of logs and mud a good many of them would be comfortable enough to live in under any circumstances i have been in the division hospitals around here there are not many men sick here and no woundedthey now send them on to washington i shall return there in a few days as i am very clear that the real need of ones services is there after allthere the worst cases concentrate and probably will while the war lasts i suppose you know that what we call hospital here in the field is nothing but a collection of tents on the bare ground for a floorrather hard accommodation for a sick man they heat them there by digging a long trough in the ground under them covering it over with old railroad iron and earth and then building a fire at one end and letting it draw through and go out at the other as both ends are open this heats the ground through the middle of the hospital quite hot i find some poor creatures crawling about pretty weak with diarrhoea there is a great deal of that they keep them until they get very bad indeed and then send them to washington this aggravates the complaint and they come into washington in a terrible condition o mother how often and how many i have seen come into washington from this awful complaint after such an experience as i have describedwith the look of death on their poor young faces they keep them so long in the field hospitals with poor accommodations the disease gets too deeply seated  today i have been out among some of the camps of the 2nd division of the 1st corps i have been wandering around all day and have had a very good time over woods hills and gulliesindeed a real soldiers march the weather is good and the travelling quite tolerable i have been in the camps of some massachusetts pennsylvania and new york regiments i have friends in them and went out to see them and see soldiering generally as i can never cease to crave more and more knowledge of actual soldiers life and to be among them as much as possible this evening i have also been in a large wagoners camp they had good fires and were very cheerful i went to see a friend there too but did not find him in it is curious how many i find that i know and that know me mother i have no difficulty at all in making myself at home among the soldiers teamsters or anyi most always find they like to have me very much it seems to do them good no doubt they soon feel that my heart and sympathies are truly with them and it is both a novelty and pleases them and touches their feelings and so doubtless does them goodand i am sure it does that to me there is more fun around here than you would think for i told you about the theatre the 14th brooklyn has got upthey have songs and burlesques etc some of the performers real good as i write this i have heard in one direction or another two or three good bands playingand hear one tooting away some gay tunes now though it is quite late at night mother i dont know whether i mentioned in my last letter that i took dinner with col fowler one day early part of the week his wife is stopping here i was down at the 14th as i came along this evening tooone of the officers told me about a presentation to george of a sword etche said he see it in the papers the 14th invited me to come and be their guest while i staid here but i have not been able to accept col fowler uses me tiptophe is provost marshal of this region makes a good officer mother i could get no pen and ink tonight well dear mother i send you my love and to george and jeff and mat and little girls and all      walt  direct to care of major hapgood as before and write soon mother i suppose you got a letter i wrote from down here last monday   v  washington march 2 1864 dear motheryou or jeff must try to write as soon as you receive this and let me know how little sis is tell me if she got entirely over the croup and how she isalso about georges trunks i do hope he received them it was such a misfortune i want to hear the end of it i am in hopes i shall hear that he has got them i have not seen in the papers whether the 51st has left new york yet mother i want to hear all about home and all the occurrences especially the two things i have just mentioned and how you are for somehow i was thinking from your letters lately whether you was as well as usual or not write how my dear sister mat is too and whether you are still going to stay there in portland avenue the coming year well dear mother i am just the same herenothing new i am well and hearty and constantly moving around among the wounded and sick there are a great many of the latter coming upthe hospitals here are quite fulllately they have been picking out in the hospitals all that had pretty well recovered and sending them back to their regiments they seem to be determined to strengthen the army this spring to the utmost they are sending down many to their regts that are not fit to go in my opinionthen there are squads and companies and regts too passing through here in one steady stream going down to the front returning from furlough home but then there are quite a number leaving the army on furlough reenlisting and going north for a while they pass through here quite largely mother lewis brown is getting quite well he will soon be able to have a wooden leg put on he is very restless and active and wants to go round all the time sam beatty is here in washington we have had quite a snow storm but it is clear and sunny today here but sloshy i am wearing my army bootsanything but the dust dear mother i want to see you and sis and mat and all very much if i can get a chance i think i shall come home for a while i want to try to bring out a book of poems a new one to be called drumtaps and i want to come to new york for that purpose too  mother i havent given up the project of lecturing either but whatever i do i shall for the main thing devote myself for years to come to these wounded and sick what little i can well goodbye dear mother for presentwrite soon      walt   vi  washington march 15 1861 dearest motheri got a letter from jeff last sundayhe says you have a very bad cold indeed dear mother i feel very much concerned about it i do hope it has passed over before this jeff wrote me about the house i hope it will be so you can both remain in the same house it would be much more satisfaction the poor boy very sick of brain fever i was with is dead he was only 19 and a noble boy so good though out of his senses some eight days though still having a kind of idea of things no relative or friend was with him it was very sad i was with him considerable only just sitting by him soothing him he was wandering all the time his talk was so affecting it kept the tears in my eyes much of the time the last twentyfour hours he sank very rapidly he had been sick some months ago and was put in the 6th invalid corpsthey ought to have sent him home instead the next morning after his death his brother came a very fine man postmaster at lyne ridge pahe was much affected and well he might be  mother i think it worse than ever here in the hospitals we are getting the dregs as it were of the sickness and awful hardships of the past three years there is the most horrible cases of diarrhoea you ever conceived of and by the hundreds and thousands i suppose from such diet as they have in the army well dear mother i will not write any more on the sick and yet i know you wish to hear about them every one is so unfeeling it has got to be an old story there is no good nursing o i wish you wereor rather women of such qualities as you and matwere here in plenty to be stationed as matrons among the poor sick and wounded men just to be present would be enougho what good it would do them mother i feel so sick when i see what kind of people there are among them with charge over themso cold and ceremonious afraid to touch them well mother i fear i have written you a flighty kind of a letteri write in haste      walt  the papers came right motherlove to jeff mat and all   vii  washington march 22 1861 dearest motheri feel quite bad to hear that you are not wellhave a pain in your side and a very bad cold dear mother i hope it is better i wish you would write to me or jeff would right away as i shall not feel easy until i hear i recd georges letter jeff wrote with it about your feeling pretty sick and the pain mother i also recd your letter a few days before you say the browns acted very mean and i should say they did indeed but as it is going to remain the same about the house i should let it all pass i am very glad mat and jeff are going to remain i should not have felt satisfied if they and you had been separated i have written a letter to han with others enclosed a good long letter took two postage stamps i have written to george too directed it to knoxville mother everything is the same with me i am feeling very well indeed the old trouble of my head stopt and my ears affected has not troubled me any since i came back here from brooklyn i am writing this in major hapgoods old office cor 15th and f streets where i have my old table and window it is dusty and chilly today anything but agreeable gen grant is expected every moment now in the army of the potomac to take active command i have just this moment heard from the frontthere is nothing yet of a movement but each side is continually on the alert expecting something to happen o mother to think that we are to have here soon what i have seen so many times the awful loads and trains and boat loads of poor bloody and pale and wounded young men againfor that is what we certainly will and before very long i see all the little signs geting ready in the hospitals etc it is dreadful when one thinks about it i sometimes think over the sights i have myself seen the arrival of the wounded after a battle and the scenes on the field too and i can hardly believe my own recollections what an awful thing war is mother it seems not men but a lot of devils and butchers butchering each other  dear mother i think twenty times a day about your sickness o i hope it is not so bad as jeff wrote he said you was worse than you had ever been before and he would write me again well he must even if only a few lines what have you heard from mary and her family anything well dear mother i hope this will find you quite well of the pain and of the coldwrite about the little girls and mat and all      walt   viii  washington march 29 1864 dearest motheri have written to george again to knoxville things seem to be quiet down there so far we think here that our forces are going to be made strongest here in virginia this spring and every thing bent to take richmond grant is here he is now down at headquarters in the field brandy station we expect fighting before long there are many indications i believe i told you they had sent up all the sick from front the letter is here mutilated so as to be illegible from the few remaining words however it is possible to gather that the writer is describing the arrival of a train of wounded over 600 in washington during a terribly rainy afternoon the letter continues i could not keep the tears out of my eyes many of the poor young men had to be moved on stretchers with blankets over them which soon soaked as wet as water in the rain most were sick cases but some badly wounded i came up to the nearest hospital and helped mother it was a dreadful night last friday nightpretty dark the wind gusty and the rain fell in torrents one poor boythis is a sample of one case out of the 600he seemed to be quite young he was quite small i looked at his body afterwards he groaned some as the stretcher bearers were carrying him along and again as they carried him through the hospital gate they set down the stretcher and examined him and the poor boy was dead they took him into the ward and the doctor came immediately but it was all of no use the worst of it is too that he is entirely unknownthere was nothing on his clothes or any one with him to identity him and he is altogether unknown mother it is enough to rack ones heartsuch things very likely his folks will never know in the world what has become of him poor poor child for he appeared as though he could be but 18 i feel lately as though i must have some intermission i feel well and hearty enough and was never better but my feelings are kept in a painful condition a great part of the time things get worse and worse as to the amount and sufferings of the sick and as i have said before those who have to do with them are getting more and more callous and indifferent mother when i see the common soldiers what they go through and how everybody seems to try to pick upon them and what humbug there is over them every how even the dying soldiers money stolen from his body by some scoundrel attendant or from the sick one even from under his head which is a common thing and then the agony i see every day i get almost frightened at the world mother i will try to write more cheerfully next timebut i see so much well goodbye for present dear mother      walt   ix  washington thursday afternoon march 31 1864 dearest motheri have just this moment received your letter dated last monday evening dear mother i have not seen anything in any paper where the 51st is nor heard anything but i do not feel any ways uneasy about them i presume they are at knoxville tennessee mother they are now paying off many of the regiments in this armybut about george i suppose there will be delays in sending money etc dear mother i wish i had some money to send you but i am living very close by the wind mother i will try somehow to send you something worth while and i do hope you will not worry and feel unhappy about money matters i know things are very high mother i suppose you got my letter written tuesday last 29th march did you not i have been going to write to jeff for more than a monthi laid out to write a good long letter but something has prevented me one thing and another but i will try to write tomorrow sure mother i have been in the midst of suffering and death for two months worse than everthe only comfort is that i have been the cause of some beams of sunshine upon their suffering and gloomy souls and bodies too many of the dying i have been with too  well mother you must not worry about the grocery bill etc though i suppose you will say that it is easier said than followed as to me i believe i worry about worldly things less than ever if that is possible tell jeff and mat i send them my love gen grant has just come in town from front the country here is all mad again i am going to a spiritualist medium this eveningi expect it will be a humbug of course i will tell you next letter dear mother keep a good heart      walt  how is california tell hat her uncle walt will come home one of these days and take her to new york to walk in broadway poor little jim i should like to see him there is a rich young friend of mine wants me to go to idaho with him to make money   x  washington tuesday afternoon april 5 1864 dearest motheri got a letter from jeff yesterdayhe says you often work too hard exposing yourself i suppose scrubbing etc and the worst of it is i am afraid it is true mother i would take things easy and let up on the scrubbing and such things they may be needed perhaps but they aint half as much needed as that you should be as well as possible and free from rheumatism and cold jeff says that  has had the chicken pox has she got all over it i want to hear so nance has had another child poor little one there dont seem to be much show for it poor little young one these times we are having awful rainy weather here it is raining today steady and spiteful enough the soldiers in camp are having the benefit of it and the sick many of them there is a great deal of rheumatism and also throat disease and they are affected by the weather i have writ to george again directed to knoxville mother i got a letter this morning from lewis brown the young man that had his leg amputated two months or so ago the one that i slept in the hospital by several nights for fear of hemorrhage from the amputation he is home at elkton maryland on furlough he wants me to come out there but i believe i shall not gohe is doing very well there are many very bad now in hospital so many of the soldiers are getting broke down after two years or two and a half exposure and bad diet pork hard biscuit bad water or none at all etc etcso we have them brought up here oh it is terrible and getting worse worse worse i thought it was bad to see these i sometimes think is more pitiful still  well mother i went to see the great spirit medium foster there were some little things some might call curious perhaps but it is a shallow thing and a humbug a gentleman who was with me was somewhat impressed but i could not see anything in it worth calling supernatural i wouldnt turn on my heel to go again and see such things or twice as much we had table rappings and lots of nonsense i will give you particulars when i come home one of these days jeff i believe there is a fate on your long letter i thought i would write it today but as it happens i will hardly get this in the mail i fear in time for today o how i want to see you all and sis and hat well i have scratched out a great letter just as fast as i could write  wednesday forenoon mother i didnt get the letter in the mail yesterday i have just had my breakfast some good tea and good toast and butter i write this in my room 456 sixth st the storm seems to be over dear mother i hope you are well and in good spiritswrite to me often as you can and jeff too any news from han      walt   xi  washington april 10 1864 dearest motheri recd your letter and sent the one you sent for george immediatelyhe must have got it the next day i had got one from him before yours arrived i mean to go to annapolis and see him  mother we expect a commencement of the fighting below very soon there is every indication of it we have had about as severe rain storms here lately as i ever see it is middling pleasant now there are exciting times in congressthe copperheads are getting furious and want to recognize the southern confederacy this is a pretty time to talk of recognizing such villains after what they have done and after what has transpired the last three years after first fredericksburg i felt discouraged myself and doubted whether our rulers could carry on the warbut that has passed away the war must be carried on and i could willingly go myself in the ranks if i thought it would profit more than at present and i dont know sometimes but i shall as it is mother you dont know what a feeling a man gets after being in the active sights and influences of the camp the army the wounded etc he gets to have a deep feeling he never experienced beforethe flag the tune of yankee doodle and similar things produce an effect on a fellow never such before i have seen some bring tears on the mens cheeks and others turn pale under such circumstances i have a little flag it belonged to one of our cavalry regts presented to me by one of the wounded it was taken by the secesh in a cavalry fight and rescued by our men in a bloody little skirmish it cost three mens lives just to get one little flag four by three our men rescued it and tore it from the breast of a dead rebelall that just for the name of getting their little banner back again the man that got it was very badly wounded and they let him keep it i was with him a good deal he wanted to give me something he said he didnt expect to live so he gave me the little banner as a keepsake i mention this mother to show you a specimen of the feeling there isnt a regt cavalry or infantry that wouldnt do the same on occasion  tuesday morning april 12 mother i will finish my letter this morning it is a beautiful day today i was up in congress very late last night the house had a very excited night session about expelling the men that want to recognize the southern confederacy you ought to hear the soldiers talk they are excited to madness we shall probably have hot times here not in the army alone the soldiers are true as the north star i send you a couple of envelopes and one to george write how you are dear mother and all the rest i want to see you all jeff my dear brother i wish you was here and mat too write how sis is i am well as usual indeed first rate every way i want to come on in a month and try to print my drumtaps i think it may be a success pecuniarily too dearest mother i hope this will find you entirely well and dear sister mat and all      walt   xii  washington tuesday noon april 19 1864 dearest motheri havent heard any news from home now in more than a week i hope you are well dear mother and all the rest too there is nothing new with me i can only write the same old story about going to the hospitals etc etc i have not heard anything since from georgehave you heard anything further i have written to him to annapolis we are having it pretty warm here today after a long spell of rain storms but the last two or three days very fine mother i suppose you got my letter of last tuesday 12th i went down to the capitol the nights of the debate on the expulsion of mr long last week they had night sessions very late i like to go to the house of representatives at night it is the most magnificent hall so rich and large and lighter at night than it is days and still not a light visibleit comes through the glass roofbut the speaking and the ability of the members is nearly always on a low scale it is very curious and melancholy to see such a rate of talent there such tremendous times as thesei should say about the same range of genius as our old friend dr swaim just about you may think i am joking but i am not motheri am speaking in perfect earnest the capitol grows upon one in time especially as they have got the great figure on top of it now and you can see it very well it is a great bronze figure the genius of liberty i suppose it looks wonderful towards sundown i love to go and look at it the sun when it is nearly down shines on the headpiece and it dazzles and glistens like a big star it looks quite curious  well mother we have commenced on another summer and what it will bring forth who can tell the campaign of this summer is expected here to be more active and severe than any yet as i told you in a former letter grant is determined to bend everything to take richmond and break up the banditti of scoundrels that have stuck themselves up there as a government he is in earnest about it his whole soul and all his thoughts night and day are upon it he is probably the most in earnest of any man in command or in the government eitherthats something aint it motherand they are bending everything to fight for their last chancecalling in their forces from southwest etc dear mother give my love to dear brother jeff and mat and all i write this in my room 6th st      walt   xiii  washington april 26 1864 dearest motherburnsides army passed through here yesterday i saw george and walked with him in the regiment for some distance and had quite a talk he is very well he is very much tanned and looks hardy i told him all the latest news from home george stands it very well and looks and behaves the same noble and good fellow he always was and always will be it was on 14th st i watched three hours before the 51st came along i joined him just before they came to where the president and gen burnside were standing with others on a balcony and the interest of seeing me etc made george forget to notice the president and salute him he was a little annoyed at forgetting it i called his attention to it but we had passed a little too far on and george wouldnt turn round even ever so little however there was a great many more than half the army passed without noticing mr lincoln and the others for there was a great crowd all through the streets especially here and the place where the president stood was not conspicuous from the rest the 9th corps made a very fine show indeed there were i should think five very full regiments of new black troops under gen ferrero they looked and marched very well it looked funny to see the president standing with his hat off to them just the same as the rest as they passed by then there were the michigan regiments one of them was a regiment of sharpshooters partly composed of indians then there was a pretty strong force of artillery and a middling force of cavalrymany new york pennsylvania massachusetts r i etc regts all except the blacks were veterans that had seen plenty of fighting mother it is very different to see a real army of fighting men from one of those shows in brooklyn or new york or on fort greene mother it was a curious sight to see these ranks after rank of our own dearest blood of men mostly young march by worn and sunburnt and sweaty with wellworn clothes and thin bundles and knapsacks tin cups and some with frying pans strapt over their backs all dirty and sweaty nothing real neat about them except their muskets but they were all as clean and bright as silver they were four or five hours passing along marching with wide ranks pretty quickly too it is a great sight to see an army 25 or 30000 on the march they are all so gay too poor fellows nothing dampens their spirits they all got soaked with rain the night before i saw fred mcready and capt sims and col le gendre etc i dont know exactly where burnsides army is going among other rumors it is said they are to go with the army of the potomac to act as a reserve force etc another is that they are to make a flank march to go round and get lee on the side etc i havent been out this morning and dont know what newswe know nothing only that there is without doubt to be a terrible campaign here in virginia this summer and that all who know deepest about it are very serious about it mother it is serious times i do not feel to fret or whimper but in my heart and soul about our country the forthcoming campaign with all its vicissitudes and the wounded and slaini dare say mother i feel the reality more than some because i am in the midst of its saddest results so much others may say what they like i believe in grant and in lincoln too i think grant deserves to be trusted he is working continually no one knows his plans we will only know them when he puts them in operation our army is very large here in virginia this spring and they are still pouring in from east and west you dont see about it in the papers but we have a very large army here  mother i am first rate in health thank god i never was better dear mother have you got over all that distress and sickness in your head you must write particular about it dear brother jeff how are you and how is matty and how the dear little girls jeff i believe the devil is in it about my writing you i have laid out so many weeks to write you a good long letter and something has shoved it off each time never mind mothers letters keep you posted you must write and dont forget to tell me all about sis is she as good and interesting as she was six months ago mother have you heard anything from han mother i have just had my breakfast i had it in my roomsome hard biscuit warmed on the stove and a bowl of strong tea with good milk and sugar i have given a michigan soldier his breakfast with me he relished it too he has just gone mother i have just heard again that burnsides troops are to be a reserve to protect washington so there may be something in it      walt  it is very fine weather here yesterday and today the hospitals are very full they are putting up hundreds of hospital tents   xiv  washington april 28 1864 dearest motheri thought i would write you just a line though i have nothing of importanceonly the talk of the street here seems more and more to assert that burnsides army is to remain near here to protect washington and act as a reserve so that grant can move the army of the potomac upon richmond without being compelled to turn and be anxious about the capital also that burnside can attend to lee if the latter should send any force up west of here what they call the valley of the shenandoah or invade pennsylvania again i thought you would like to hear this it looks plausible but there are lots of rumors of all kinds i cannot hear where burnsides army is as they dont allow the papers to print army movements but i fancy they are very near washington the other side of arlington heights this moment mother i wrote yesterday to han and sent one of georges letters from annapolis mother i suppose you got my letter of tuesday 26th i have not heard anything from you in quite a little while i am still well the weather is fine quite hot yesterday mother i am now going down to see a poor soldier who is very low with a long diarrhoeahe cannot recover when i was with him last night he asked me before i went away to ask gods blessing on him he says i am no scholar and you arepoor dying man i told him i hoped from the bottom of my heart god would bless him and bring him up yet i soothed him as well as i could it was affecting i can tell you jeff i wrote to mr kirkwood yesterday to 44 pierrepont st he sent me some money last monday is probasco still in the store in n y dear sister mat i quite want to see you and california not forgetting my little hattie too      walt  2 oclock 28th april dearest motherjust as i was going to mail this i received authentic information that burnsides army is now about 16 or 18 miles south of here at a place called fairfax court house they had last night no orders to move at present and i rather think they will remain there or near there what i have written before as a rumor about their being to be held as a reserve to act whenever occasion may need them is now quite decided on you may hear a rumor in new york that they have been shipped in transports from alexandriathere is no truth in it at all grants army of the potomac is probably to do the heavy work his army is strong and full of fight mother i think it is today the noblest army of soldiers that ever marchednobody can know the men as well as i do i sometimes think  mother i am writing this in willards hotel on my way down to hospital after i leave this at post office i shall come out to dinner at 4 oclock and then go back to hospital again in evening  good bye dear mother and all      walt   xv  washington may 3 1864 dearest motheri received your letter dated last friday afternoon with one from mr heyde it seems by that han is better but as you say it would be much more satisfactory if han would write to us herself mother i believe i told you i sent a letter to han last week enclosing one of georges from annapolis i was glad to get heydes letter though as it was mother i am sorry you still have returns of your cold does it affect your head like it did dear mother i hope you will not expose yourself nor work too much but take things easier i have nothing different to write about the war or movements here what i wrote last thursday about burnsides corps being probably used as a reserve is still talked of here and seems to be probable a large force is necessary to guard the railroad between here and culpepper and also to keep from any emergency that might happen and i shouldnt wonder if the 9th would be used for such purpose at least for the present i think the 51st must be down not very far from fairfax court house yet but i havent heard certain  mother i have seen a person up from front this morning there is no movement yet and no fighting started the men are in their camps yet gen grant is at culpepper you need not pay the slightest attention to such things as you mention in the eagle about the 9th corpsthe writer of it and very many of the writers on war matters in those papers dont know one bit more on what they are writing about than ed does mother you say in your letter you got my letter the previous afternoon why mother you ought to have got it wednesday forenoon or afternoon at furthest this letter now will get in new york wednesday morning by daylightyou ought to get it before noon the postmaster in brooklyn must have a pretty set of carriers to take twice as long to take a letter from new york to you as it does to go from washington to n y mother i suppose you got a letter from me friday also as i wrote a second letter on thursday last telling you the 9th corps was camped then about sixteen miles from here  about georges pictures perhaps you better wait till i hear from him before sending them i remain well as usual the poor fellow i mentioned in one of my letters last week with diarrhoea that wanted me to ask gods blessing on him was still living yesterday afternoon but just living he is only partially conscious is all wasted away to nothing and lies most of the time in half stupor as they give him brandy copiously yesterday i was there by him a few minutes he is very much averse to taking brandy and there was some trouble in getting him to take it he is almost totally deaf the last five or six days there is no chance for him at all quite a particular friend of mine oscar cunningham an ohio boy had his leg amputated yesterday close up by the thigh it was a pretty tough operation he was badly wounded just a year ago today at chancellorsville and has suffered a great deal lately got erysipelas in his leg and foot i forget whether i have mentioned him before or not he was a very large noblelooking young man when i first see him the doctor thinks he will live and get up but i consider it by no means so certain he is very much prostrated well dear mother you must write and jeff tooi do want to see you all very much how does mat get along and how little sis and all i send my love to you and jeff and all we are having a very pleasant coolish day here i am going down to post office to leave this and then up to my old friends the oconnors to dinner and then down to hospital well goodbye dear mother for present      walt  tuesday afternoon 3 oclock mother just as i was going to seal my letter major hapgood has come in from the p o and brings me a few lines from george which i encloseyou will see they were written four days ago   xvi  washington may 6 1864 dearest motheri write you a few lines as i know you feel anxious these times i suppose the new york papers must have it in this morning that the army of the potomac has made a move and has crossed the rapidan river at any rate that is the case as near as i can learn about burnsides army that lies in the rear of the army of the potomac from warrenton virginia and so to rappahannock river and up toward manassas it still appears to be kept as a reserve and for emergencies etc i have not heard anything from the 51st mother of course you got my letter of tuesday 3rd with the letter from george dated bristoe station i have writ to george since and addressed the letter warrenton va or elsewhere thinking he might get it  mother the idea is entertained quite largely here that the rebel army will retreat to richmond as it is well known that grant is very strong most folks say too strong for lee i suppose you know we menace them almost as much from up fortress monroe as we do from the rapidan butler and w f smith are down there with at least fifty or sixty thousand men and will move up simultaneously with grant the occasion is very serious and anxious but somehow i am full of hope and feel that we shall take richmondi hope to go there yet before the hot weather is past dear mother i hope you are well and little californialove to jeff and mat and all      walt  mother you ought to get this letter saturday forenoon as it will be in n y by sunrise saturday 7th  mother the poor soldier with diarrhoea is still living but o what a looking object death would be a boon to him he cannot last many hours cunningham the ohio boy with leg amputated at thigh has picked up beyond expectation nowlooks altogether like getting well the hospitals are very full i am very well indeedpretty warm here today   xvii  washington monday 2 oclockmay 9 64 dearest motherthere is nothing from the army more than you know in the n y papers the fighting has been hard enough but the papers make lots of additional items and a good deal that they just entirely make up there are from 600 to 1000 wounded coming up herenot 6 to 8000 as the papers have it i cannot hear what part the 9th corps took in the fight of friday and afterwards nor whether they really took any at allthey the papers are determined to make up just anything mother i received your letter and hansand was glad indeed to get both mother you must not be under such apprehension as i think it is not warranted  so far as we get news here we are gaining the day so far decidedly if the news we hear is true that lee has been repulsed and driven back by grant and that we are masters of the field and pursuing themthen i think lee will retreat south and richmond will be abandoned by the rebs but of course time only can develope what will happen mother i will write again wednesday or before if i hear anything to write love to jeff and mat and all      walt   xviii  washington may 10 64 12 past 2 pm dearest motherthere is nothing perhaps more than you see in the n y papers the fighting down in the field on the 6th i think ended in our favor though with pretty severe losses to some of our divisions the fighting is about 70 miles from here and 50 from richmondon the 7th and 8th followed up by the rebel army hauling off they say retreating and meade pursuing it is quite mixed yet but i guess we have the best of it if we really have richmond is a goner for they cannot do any better than they have done the 9th corps was in the fight and where i cannot tell yet but from the wounded i have seen i dont think that corps was deeply in i have seen 300 wounded they came in last night i asked for men of 9th corps but could not find any at all these 300 men were not badly wounded mostly in arms hands trunk of body etc they could all walk though some had an awful time of it they had to fight their way with the worst in the middle out of the region of fredericksburg and so on where they could get across the rappahannock and get where they found transportation to washington the govt has decided or rather gen meade has to occupy fredericksburg for depot and hospitali think that is a first rate decisionso the wounded men will receive quick attention and surgery instead of being racked through the long journey up here still many come in here mother my impression is that we have no great reason for alarm or sadness about george so far of course i know nothing well goodbye dearest mother      walt  mother i wrote you yesterday too tell dear brother jeff to write me love to mat the poor diarrhoea man died and it was a boon oscar cunningham 82nd ohio has had a relapse i fear it is going bad with him lung diseases are quite plentynight before last i staid in hospital all night tending a poor fellow it has been awful hot heremilder today   xix  washington may 12 12 past 5 pm dearest mothergeorge is all right unhurt up to tuesday morning 10th inst the 51st was in a bad battle last friday lost 20 killed between 40 and 50 wounded i have just seen some of the 51st wounded just arrived one of them fred saunders corporal co k georges company he said when he left the 51st was in rear on guard duty he left tuesday morning last the papers have it that burnsides corps was in a fight tuesday but i think it most probable the 51st was not in it  fred mcready is wounded badly but not seriously sims is safe you see le gendre is woundedhe was shot through the bridge of nose  mother you ought to get this friday forenoon 13th i will write again soon wrote once before today      walt   xx  washington may 13 1864 2 oclock p m dearest motheri wrote you a hurried letter late yesterday afternoon but left it myself at the p o in time for the mail you ought to have got it this forenoon or afternoon at furthest i sent you two letters yesterday i hope the carrier brings you your letters the same day i wrote to the brooklyn postmaster about it i have heard from george up to tuesday morning last 10th till which time he was safe the battle of friday 6th was very severe georges co k lost one acting sergeant sturgis killed 2 men killed 4 wounded as i wrote yesterday i have seen here corp fred saunders of co k who was wounded in side nothing serious in fridays fight and came up here i also talked with serg brown co f 51st rather badly wounded in right shoulder saunders said when he left tuesday morning he heard or saw them there i forget which the 51st and its whole division were on guard duty toward the rear the 9th corps however has had hard fighting since but whether the division or brigade the 51st is in was in the fights of tuesday 10th a pretty severe one or wednesday i cannot tell and it is useless to make calculationsand the only way is to wait and hope for the best as i wrote yesterday there were some 30 of 51st regt killed and 50 wounded in fridays battle 6th inst i have seen col le gendre he is here in washington not far from where i am 485 12th st is his address poor man i felt sorry indeed for him he is badly wounded and disfigured he is shot through the bridge of the nose and left eye probably lost i spent a little time with him this forenoon he is suffering very much spoke of george very kindly said your brother is well his orderly told me he saw him george sunday night last well fred mcready is wounded in hip i believe bone fracturedbad enough but not deeply serious i cannot hear of his arrival here if he comes i shall find him immediately and take care of him myself he is probably yet at fredericksburg but will come up i think yesterday and today the badly wounded are coming in the long lists of previous arrivals i suppose they are all reprinted at great length in n y papers are of men threefourths of them quite slightly wounded and the rest hurt pretty bad i was thinking mother if one could see the men who arrived in the first squads of two or three hundred at a time one wouldnt be alarmed at those terrible long lists still there is a sufficient sprinkling of deeply distressing cases i find my hands full all the time with new and old casespoor suffering young men i think of them and do try mother to do what i can for them and not think of the vexatious skedaddlers and merely scratched ones of whom there are too many lately come here  dearest mother hope you and all are wellyou must keep a good heart still the fighting is very mixed but it seems steadily turning into real successes for grant the news today here is very goodyou will see it in the n y papers i steadily believe grant is going to succeed and that we shall have richmondbut o what a price to pay for it we have had a good rain here and it is pleasanter and cooler i shall write very soon again      walt   xxi  washington may 18 1864 dearest motheri will only write you a hasty note this time as i am pretty tired and my head feels disagreeable from being in too much i was up yesterday to carver hospital and again saw the man of the 51st thos mccowell who told me of george up to latter part of thursday 12th inst i questioned him and his story was very clear so i felt perfectly satisfied he is wounded in hand will be transferred soon to new york and may call on you he is a young irishman and seems to be a very good fellow indeed i have written to george day before yesterday did you send my last letter to han if not send it yet mother i see such awful things i expect one of these days if i live i shall have awful thoughts and dreamsbut it is such a great thing to be able to do some real good assuage these horrible pains and wounds and save life eventhats the only thing that keeps a fellow up  well dear mother i make such reckoning of yet coming on and seeing you how i want to see jeff tooo it is too bad i have not written to him so longand mat too and little california and all i am going out now a little while i remain first rate as well as ever      walt   xxii  washington monday forenoon may 23 64 dear brother jeffi received your letter yesterday i too had got a few lines from george dated on the field 16th he said he had also just written to mother i cannot make out there has been any fighting since in which the 9th corps has been engaged i do hope mother will not get despondent and so unhappy i suppose it is idle to say i think georges chances are very good for coming out of this campaign safe yet at present it seems to me sobut it is indeed idle to say so for no one can tell what a day may bring forth sometimes i think that should it come when it must be to fall in battle ones anguish over a son or brother killed would be tempered with much to take the edge off i can honestly say it has no terrors for me if i had to be hit in battle as far as i myself am concerned it would be a noble and manly death and in the best cause then one finds as i have the past year that our feelings and imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole matter of the many i have seen die or known of the past year i have not seen or heard of one who met death with any terror yesterday afternoon i spent a good part of the afternoon with a young man of 17 named charles cutter of lawrence city mass 1st mass heavy artillery battery m he was brought in to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen well i thought to myself as i sat looking at him it ought to be a relief to his folks after all if they could see how little he suffered he lay very placid in a half lethargy with his eyes closed it was very warm and i sat a long while fanning him and wiping the sweat at length he opened his eyes quite wide and clear and looked inquiringly around i said what is it my dear do you want anything he said quietly with a good natured smile o nothing i was only looking around to see who was with me his mind was somewhat wandering yet he lay so peaceful in his dying condition he seemed to be a real new england country boy so good natured with a pleasant homely way and quite a fine looking boy without any doubt he died in course of night  there dont seem to be any war news of importance very late we have been fearfully disappointed with sigel not making his junction from the lower part of the valley and perhaps harassing lees left or left rear which the junction or equivalent to it was an indispensable part of grants plan we think this is one great reason why things have lagged so with the army some here are furious with sigel you will see he has been superseded his losses in his repulse are not so important though annoying enough but it was of the greatest consequence that he should have hastened through the gaps ten or twelve days ago at all hazards and come in from the west keeping near enough to our right to have assistance if he needed it jeff i suppose you know that there has been quite a large army lying idle mostly of artillery regts manning the numerous forts around here they have been the fattest and heartiest regts anywhere to be seen and full in numbers some of them numbering 2000 men well they have all every one been shoved down to the front lately we have had the militia regts pouring in here mostly from ohio they look first rate i saw two or three come in yesterday splendid american young men from farms mostly we are to have them for a hundred days and probably they will not refuse to stay another hundred jeff tell mother i shall write wednesday certain or if i hear anything i will write tomorrow i still think we shall get richmond      walt  jeff you must take this up to mother as soon as you go home jeff i have changed my quarters i moved saturday last i am now at 502 pennsylvania av near 3rd st i still go a little almost daily to major hapgoods cor 15th and f sts 5th floor am apt to be there about 12 or 1 see fred mcready and others of 51st georges letter to me of 16th i sent to han should like to see mr worther if he comes heregive my best remembrance to mr lane  i may very likely go down for a few days to ball plain and fredericksburg but one is wanted here permanently more than any other place i have written to george several times in hopes one at least may reach him matty my dear sister how are you getting along o how i should like to see you this very day   xxiii  washington may 25 1864 dearest motheri have not heard anything of george or the regt or corps more than i have already written i got jeffs letter on sunday and wrote to him next day which you have seen mother of course i have written to han and sent her georges letter to me dated 16th i have heard that the 9th corps has been moved to the extreme left of the army i should think by accounts this morning that the army must be nearly half way from fredericksburg to richmond the advance cant be more than 30 to 35 miles from there i see fred mcready about every other day i have to go down to alexandria about 6 miles from here he is doing quite well but very tired of the confinement i still go around daily and nightly among wounded mother it is just the same old story poor suffering young men great swarms of them come up here now every day all battered and bloodythere have 4000 arrived here this morning and 1500 yesterday they appear to be bringing them all up here from fredericksburg the journey from the field till they get aboard the boats at ball plain is horrible i believe i wrote several times about oscar cunningham 82nd ohio amputation of right leg wounded over a year ago a friend of mine here he is rapidly sinking said to me yesterday o if he could only die the young lad cutter of 1st massachusetts heavy artillery i was with sunday afternoon i wrote about in jeffs letter still holds out poor boy there is no chance for him at all  but mother i shall make you gloomy enough if i go on with these kind of particularsonly i know you like to hear about the poor young men after i have once begun to mention them mother i have changed my quartersam at 502 pennsylvania av near 3d street only a little way from the capitol where i was the house was sold and the old lady i hired the room from had to move out and give the owner possession i like my new quarters pretty welli have a room to myself 3d story hall bedroom i have my meals in the house mother it must be sad enough about nance and the young ones is the little baby still hearty i believe you wrote a few weeks after it was born that it was quite a fine child i see you had a draft in the 3d congressional district i was glad enough to see jeffs name was not drawn we have had it awful hot here but there was a sharp storm of thunder and lightning last night and today it is fine mother do any of the soldiers i see here from brooklyn or new york ever call upon you they sometimes say they will here tell jeff i got a letter yesterday from w e worthen in which he sent me some money for the men i have acknowledged it to mr w by letter well dear mother i must close o how i want to see you alli will surely have to come home as soon as this richmond campaign is decidedthen i want to print my new book love to matwrite to a fellow often as you can      walt   xxiv  washington may 30 1864 dearest motheri have no news at all to write this time i have not heard anything of the 51st since i last wrote you and about the general war news only what you see in the papers grant is gradually getting nearer and nearer to richmond many here anticipate that should grant go into richmond lee will make a side movement and march up west into the north either to attempt to strike washington or to go again into pennsylvania i only say if that should happen i for one shall not be dissatisfied so very much well mother how are you getting along homehow do you feel in health these days dear mother i hope you are well and in good heart yet i remain pretty well my head begins to trouble me a little with a sort of fullness as it often does in the hot weather singular to relate the 1st mass artillery boy charles cutter is still living and may get well i saw him this morning i am still around among wounded same but will not make you feel blue by filling my letter with sad particulars  i am writing this in willards hotel hurrying to catch this afternoons mail mother do you get your letters now next morning as you ought i got a letter from the postmaster of brooklyn about itsaid if the letters were neglected again to send him word i have not heard from home now in some days i am going to put up a lot of my old things in a box and send them home by express i will write when i send them have you heard anything from mary or han lately i should like to hear tell jeff he must write and you must too mother i have been in one of the worst hospitals all the forenoon it containing about 1600 i have given the men pipes and tobacco i am the only one that gives them tobacco o how much good it does some of themthe chaplains and most of the doctors are down upon itbut i give them and let them smoke to others i have given oranges fed them etc well dear mother goodbyelove to matty and sis      walt  fred mcready is coming home very soon on furloughhave any of the soldiers called on you   xxv  washington june 3 1864 dearest motheryour letter came yesterday i have not heard the least thing from the 51st sinceno doubt they are down there with the army near richmond i have not written to george lately i think the news from the army is very good mother you know of course that it is now very near richmond indeed from five to ten miles mother if this campaign was not in progress i should not stop here as it is now beginning to tell a little upon me so many bad wounds many putrefied and all kinds of dreadful ones i have been rather too much withbut as it is i certainly remain here while the thing remains undecided it is impossible for me to abstain from going to see and minister to certain cases and that draws me into others and so on i have just left oscar cunningham the ohio boyhe is in a dying conditionthere is no hope for himit would draw tears from the hardest heart to look at himhe is all wasted away to a skeleton and looks like some one fifty years old you remember i told you a year ago when he was first brought in i thought him the noblest specimen of a young western man i had seen a real giant in size and always with a smile on his face o what a change he has long been very irritable to every one but me and his frame is all wasted away the young massachusetts 1st artillery boy cutter i wrote about is dead he is the one that was brought in a week ago last sunday badly wounded in breast the deaths in the principal hospital i visit armorysquare average one an hour  i saw capt baldwin of the 14th this morning he has lost his left armis going home soon mr kalbfleisch and anson herrick m c from new york came in one of the wards where i was sitting writing a letter this morning in the midst of the wounded kalbfleisch was so much affected by the sight that he burst into tears o i must tell you i gave in carver hospital a great treat of ice cream a couple of days agowent round myself through about 15 large wardsi bought some ten gallons very nice you would have cried and been amused too many of the men had to be fed several of them i saw cannot probably live yet they quite enjoyed it i gave everybody somequite a number of western country boys had never tasted ice cream before they relish such things as oranges lemons etc mother i feel a little blue this morning as two young men i knew very well have just died one died last night and the other about half an hour before i went to the hospital i did not anticipate the death of either of them each was a very very sad case so young well mother i see i have written you another gloomy sort of letter i do not feel as first rate as usual      walt  you dont know how i want to come home and see you all you dear mother and jeff and mat and all i believe i am homesicksomething new for methen i have seen all the horrors of soldiers life and not been kept up by its excitement it is awful to see so much and not be able to relieve it   xxvi  washington june 7 1864 dearest motheri cannot write you anything about the 51st as i have not heard a word i felt very much disturbed yesterday afternoon as major hapgood came up from the paymaster generals office and said that news had arrived that burnside was killed and that the 9th corps had had a terrible slaughter he said it was believed at the paymaster generals office well i went out to see what reliance there was on it the rumor soon spread over town and was believed by manybut as near as i can make it out it proves to be one of those unaccountable stories that get started these times saturday night we heard that grant was routed completely etc etcso thats the way stories fly i suppose you hear the same big lies there in brooklyn well the truth is sad enough without adding anything to itbut grant is not destroyed yet but i think is going into richmond yet but the cost is terrible mother i have not felt well at all the last week i had spells of deathly faintness and bad trouble in my head too and sore throat quite a little budget aint they my head was the worst though i dont know the faint spells were not very pleasantbut i feel so much better this forenoon i believe it has passed over there is a very horrible collection in armory building in armorysquare hospitalabout 200 of the worst cases you ever see and i had been probably too much with them it is enough to melt the heart of a stone over one third of them are amputation cases well mother poor oscar cunningham is gone at last he is the 82d ohio boy wounded may 3d 63 i have written so much of him i suppose you feel as if you almost knew him i was with him saturday forenoon and also evening he was more composed than usual could not articulate very well he died about 2 oclock sunday morningvery easy they told me i was not there it was a blessed relief his life has been misery for months the cause of death at last was the system absorbing the pus the bad matter instead of discharging it from the wound i believe i told you i was quite blue from the deaths of several of the poor young men i knew well especially two i had strong hopes of their getting up things are going pretty badly with the wounded they are crowded here in washington in immense numbers and all those that come up from the wilderness and that region arrived here so neglected and in such plight it was awfulthose that were at fredericksburg and also from ball plain the papers are full of puffs etc but the truth is the largest proportion of worst cases got little or no attention we receive them here with their wounds full of wormssome all swelled and inflamed many of the amputations have to be done over again one new feature is that many of the poor afflicted young men are crazy every ward has some in it that are wandering they have suffered too much and it is perhaps a privilege that they are out of their senses mother it is most too much for a fellow and i sometimes wish i was out of itbut i suppose it is because i have not felt first rate myself i am going to write to george today as i see there is a daily mail to white house o i must tell you that we get the wounded from our present field near richmond much better than we did from the wilderness and fredericksburg we get them now from white house they are put on boats there and come all the way here about 160 or 170 miles white house is only twelve or fifteen miles from the field and is our present depot and base of supplies it is very pleasant here today a little cooler than it has beena good rain shower last evening the western regts continue to pour in here the 100 days menmay go down to front to guard posts trains etc  well mother how do things go on with you all it seems to me if i could only be home two or three days and have some good teas with you and mat and set in the old basement a while and have a good time and talk with jeff and see the little girls etc i should be willing to keep on afterward among these sad scenes for the rest of the summerbut i shall remain here until this richmond campaign is settled anyhow unless i get sick and i dont anticipate that mother dear i hope you are well and in fair spiritsyou must try to have you heard from sister han      walt  you know i am living at 502 pennsylvania av near 3d stit is not a very good place i dont like it so well as i did cooking my own gruband the air is not good jeff you must write   xxvii  washington june 10 1864 dearest motheri got your letter dated last wednesday i do not always depend on s accounts i think he is apt to make things full as bad as they are if not worse  mother i was so glad to get a letter from jeff this morning enclosing one from george dated june 1st it was so good to see his handwriting once more i have not heard anything of the regtthere are all sorts of rumors here among others that burnside does not give satisfaction to grant and meade and that it is expected some one else will be placed in command of 9th corps another rumor more likely is that our base of the army is to be changed to harrisons landing on james river instead of white house on pamunkey  mother i have not felt well again the last two days as i was tuesday but i feel a good deal better this morning i go round but most of the time feel very little like it the doctor tells me i have continued too long in the hospitals especially in a bad place armory building where the worst wounds were and have absorbed too much of the virus in my systembut i know it is nothing but what a little relief and sustenance of the right sort will set right i am writing this in major hapgoods office he is very busy paying off some men whose time is out they are going home to new york i wrote to george yesterday we are having very pleasant weather here just now mother you didnt mention whether mary had come so i suppose she has not i should like to see her and ansel too the wounded still come here in large numbersday and night trains of ambulances tell jeff the 10 from mr lane for the soldiers came safe i shall write to jeff right away i send my love to mat and all mother you must try to keep good heart      walt   xxviii  washington june 14 1864 dearest mother i am not feeling very well these daysthe doctors have told me not to come inside the hospitals for the present i send there by a friend every day i send things and aid to some cases i know and hear from there also but i do not go myself at present it is probable that the hospital poison has affected my system and i find it worse than i calculated i have spells of faintness and very bad feeling in my head fullness and painand besides sore throat my boarding place 502 pennsylvania av is a miserable place very bad air but i shall feel better soon i knowthe doctors say it will pass overthey have long told me i was going in too strong some days i think it has all gone and i feel well again but in a few hours i have a spell again mother i have not heard anything of the 51st i sent georges letter to han i have written to george since i shall write again to him in a day or two if mary comes home tell her i sent her my love if i dont feel better before the end of this week or beginning of next i may come home for a week or fortnight for a change the rumor is very strong here that grant is over the james river on south sidebut it is not in the papers we are having quite cool weather here mother i want to see you and jeff so much i have been working a little at copying but have stopt it lately      walt   xxix  washington june 17 1864 dearest mother i got your letter this morning this place and the hospitals seem to have got the better of me i do not feel so badly this forenoonbut i have bad nights and bad days too some of the spells are pretty badstill i am up some and around every day the doctors have told me for a fortnight i must leave that i need an entire change of air etc  i think i shall come home for a short time and pretty soon i will try it two or three days yet though and if i find my illness goes over i will stay here yet awhile all i think about is to be here if any thing should happen to george  we dont hear anything more of the army than you do there in the papers      walt  mother if i should come i will write a day or so before   the letter of june 17 1864 is the last of whitmans written from washington at or about this time that has been preserved and come down to us many probably many more than have been kept have been lost indeed it is a wonder that so many were saved for they were sent about from one member of the family to another and when once read seem to have been little valued the reader will have noticed a certain change of tone in the later letters showing that whitman was beginning to feel the inroads which the fatigues the unhealthy surroundings of the hospitals and especially the mental anxiety and distress inseparable from his work there were making upon even his superb health down to the time of his hospital work he had never known a days sickness but thereafter he never again knew except at intervals which grew shorter and less frequent as time went on the buoyant vigor and vitality of his first fortyfour years from 1864 to the end of 1872 the attacks described in his calamus letters became from year to year more frequent and more severe until in january 1873 they culminated in an attack of paralysis which never left him and from the indirect effects of which he died in 1892  but for years though often warned and sent away by the doctors during his better intervals and until his splendid health was quite broken by hospital malaria and the poison absorbed from gangrenous wounds he continued his ministrations to the sick and the maimed of the war those who joined the ranks and fought the battles of the republic did well but when the world knows as it is beginning to know how this man without any encouragement from without under no compulsion simply without beat of drum or any cheers of approval went down into those immense lazar houses and devoted his days and nights his heart and soul and at last his health and life to americas sick and wounded sons it will say that he did even better  r m b     as at thy portals also death   entering thy sovereign dim illimitable grounds   to memories of my mother to the divine blending maternity   to her buried and gone yet buried not gone not from me   i see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still   i sit by the form in the coffin   i kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips the cheeks the       closed eyes in the coffin   to her the ideal woman practical spiritual of all of earth life       love to me the best   i grave a monumental
