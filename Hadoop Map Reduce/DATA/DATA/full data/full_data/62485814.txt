the sunshine near the end of dufferin avenue which skirts the elevated ground above the city of quebec  behind her rose the heights of abraham where the dying wolfe wrested canada from france in front churches banks offices and dwellings curiously combining the old and the very new rose tier on tier to the great red frontenac hotel  it is a picturesque city that climbs back from its noble river supreme perhaps in its situation among canadian towns and still retaining something of the exotic stamp set upon it by its first builders whose art was learned in the france of long ago  from where she sat mrs keith could not see the ugly wooden wharves her glance rested on the flood that flowed toward her still and deep through a gorge lined with crags and woods and then widening rapidly washed the shores of a low green island  opposite her white houses shone on the levis ridge and beyond this a vast sweep of country steeped in gradations of color that ended in ethereal blue rolled away toward the hills of maine  mrs keith and her companion were both elderly  they had played their part in the drama of life one of them in a strenuous manner and now they were content with the position of lookerson  so far however nothing had occurred since breakfast to excite their interest  i think ill go to montreal by the special boat tonight mrs keith said with characteristic briskness  the hotels crowded the towns full and you keep meeting people whom you know or have heard about  i came here to see canada but i find it hard to realize that im not in london im tired of the bustle  mrs ashborne smiled  she had met margaret keith by chance in quebec but their acquaintance was of several years standing  tired she said  that is sorely a new sensation for you  ive often envied you your energy  age had touched mrs keith lightly though she had long been a childless widow and had silvery hair  tall and finely made with prominent nose and piercing eyes she was marked by a certain stateliness and a decided manner  she was blunt without rudeness and though often forceful was seldom arrogant  careless of her dress as she generally was margaret keith bore the stamp of refinement and breeding ah she said i begin to feel im old  but will you come to montreal with me tonight  i suppose id better though the boat takes longer than the train and i hear that the place viger is full  i dont know anything about the other hotels they might not be comfortable  theyll no doubt be able to offer us all that we require and i never pamper myself mrs keith replied  in fact its now and then a relief to do something thats opposed to the luxuriousness of the age  this was a favorite topic but she broke off as a man came toward her carrying one or two small parcels which apparently belonged to the girl at his side  he was a handsome man tall and rather spare with dark eyes and a soldierly look  his movements were quick and forceful but a hint of what mrs keith called swagger somewhat spoiled his bearing she thought he allowed his selfconfidence to be seen too plainly  the girl formed a marked contrast to him she was short and slender her hair and eyes were brown while her prettiness for one could not have called her beautiful was of an essentially delicate kind  it did not strike one at first sight but grew upon her acquaintances  her manner was quiet and reserved and she was plainly dressed in white but when she turned and dismissed her companion her pose was graceful  then she handed mrs keith some letters and papers  i have been to the postoffice and captain sedgwick made them search for our mail she said  it came some time ago but there was a mistake through its not being addressed to the hotel  mrs keith took the letters and gave mrs ashborne an english newspaper  the bobcat has torn a hole in the basket the girl went on and im afraid its trying to get at the mink  tell some of the hotel people to take it out at once and see that the basket is sent to be mended  the girl withdrew and mrs ashborne looked up  did i hear aright she asked in surprise  she said a bobcat  mrs keith laughed  i am making a collection of the smaller american animals  a bobcat is something like a big english ferret  it has high hindquarters and walks with a curious jumpi suppose that is how it got its name  im not sure it lives in canada an american got this one for me  i find natural history very interesting  i should imagine you found it expensive  arent some of the creatures savage  millicent looks after them and i always beat the sellers down fortunately i can afford to indulge in my caprices  you can consider this my latest fad if you like  i am subject to no claims and my means are hardly large enough to make me an object of interest to sycophantic relatives  is your companion fond of attending to wild animals mrs ashborne inquired  i have wondered where you got her  you have had a number but she is different from the rest  i suppose you mean she is too good for the post mrs keith suggested  however i dont mind telling you that she is eustace grahams daughter you must have heard of him  eustace graham  wasnt he in rather bad odoronly tolerated on the fringe of society  i seem to recollect some curious tales about him  toward the end he was outside the fringe indeed i dont know how he kept on his feet so long but he went downhill fast  a plucker of plump pigeons an expensive friend to smart young subalterns and boys about town  cards bets loans arranged and that kind of thing  all the same he had his good points when i first knew him  but after such a life as his daughter must have led do you consider her a suitable person to take about with you  what do your friends think  they have to receive her now and then  i cant say that i have much cause to respect my friends opinions and im not afraid of the girls contaminating me mrs keith replied besides millicent lost her mother early and lived with her aunts until a few months before her fathers death  i expect eustace felt more embarrassed than grateful when she came to take care of him but to do him justice he would see that none of the taint of his surroundings rested on the girl  he did wrong but i think he paid for it and it is better to be charitable  she broke off and glanced down at the big liner with creamcolored funnel that was slowly swinging across the stream  i must send millicent to buy our tickets for montreal she said the hotel will be crowded before long with that steamers noisy passengers  i shall be glad to escape from it all  let us hope that montreal will be quieter and we shall have a chance to see a bit of canada  mrs ashborne opened the morning post and presently looked up at her companion  a marriagebetween blanche newcombe and captain challonerat thornton holme in shropshire she read out  do you know the bride  i know bertram challoner better mrs keith replied and was silent for a minute or two musing on former days  his mother was an old friend of minea woman of imagination with strong artistic tastes and bertram resembles her  it was his father the colonel who forced him into the army and im somewhat astonished that he has done so well  they were all soldiers i understand  but wasnt there some scandal about a cousin  richard blake said mrs keith making room for millicent graham her companion who rejoined them  its getting an old story and i always found it puzzling  so far as one could judge dick blake should have made an excellent officer his mother the colonels sister was true to the challoner strain his father a reckless irish sportsman  but what was the story  i havent heard it  after blake broke his neck when hunting the colonel brought dick up and as a matter of course sent him into the army  he became a sapper entering the indian service  there he met his cousin bertram who was in the line somewhere on the frontier  they were both sent with an expedition into the hills and there was a night attack  it was important that an advanced post should be defended and dick had laid out the trenches  in the middle of the fight an officer lost his nerve the position was stormed and the expedition terribly cut up owing to the darkness and confusion there was a doubt about who had led the retreat but dick was blamed and made no defense  in spite of this he was acquitted at the inquiry perhaps because he was a favorite and colonel challoner was well known upon the frontier but the opinion of the mess was against him  he left the service and the challoners never speak of him  i once met lieutenant blake millicent broke in with a flush in her face  though he spoke only a word or two to me he did a very chivalrous thing one that needed courage and coolness  i find it hard to believe that such a man could ever be a coward  so do i mrs keith agreed  still i havent seen him since he was a boy  i saw him in london just before he went to india mrs ashborne said its strange i have never heard the story before although i have had whispers of the scandal from several quarters  it seems to be a sort of skeleton in the closet for the challoners  the disgrace was a great blow to the colonel  he has never got over it  i saw some one in the hotel last night that reminded me strongly of young blake  but i suppose it couldnt have been  no one knows where he is mrs keith replied  i believe he went to east africa and from there he may have drifted to america  the colonel never hears from him  she picked up one of her letters which had not yet been opened  this she said is from frances fosteryou know her  im sure it will contain news of the challoner wedding  she tore open the envelope and mrs ashborne turned again to her english newspaper  millicent sat looking out over the gorge while her thoughts went back to a dimly lighted drawingroom in a small london apartment where she was feeling very lonely and half dismayed one evening soon after she had joined her father  a few beautiful objects of art were scattered among the shabby furniture there were stains of wine on the fine eastern rug an inlaid table was scraped and damaged and one chair had a broken leg  all she saw spoke of neglect and vanished prosperity  hoarse voices and loud laughter came from an ad joining room and a smell of cigar smoke accompanied them  sitting at the piano she restlessly turned over some music and now and then played a few bars to divert her troubled thoughts  until a few weeks before she had led a peaceful life in the country and it had been a painful surprise to her to find her father of such doubtful character and habits  she was interrupted by the violent opening of the door and a group of excited men burst into the room  they were shouting with laughter at a joke which made her blush and one dragged a companion in by the arm  another breaking off from rude horseplay came toward her with a drunken leer  she shrank from his hot face and wineladen breath as she drew back wondering how she could reach her father who stood in the doorway trying to restrain his guests  then a young man sprang forward with disgust and anger in his brown face and she felt that she was safe  he looked clean and wholesome by contrast with the rest and his movements were swift and athletic  millicent could remember him very well for she had often thought of lieutenant blake with gratitude  just as the tipsy gallant stretched out his hand to seize her the electric light went out there was a brief scuffle in the darkness the door banged and when the light flashed up again only blake and her father were in the room  afterward her father told her with a look of shame on his handsome dissipated face that he had been afraid of something of the kind happening and she must leave him millicent refused for worn as he was by many excesses his health was breaking down and when he fell ill she nursed him until he died  she had not seen lieutenant blake since  mrs keiths voice broke in upon her recollections  its possible we may see bertram and the new mrs challoner  she is going out with him but they are to travel by the canadian pacific route and spend some time in japan before proceeding to his indian station  referring to the date of her letter she resumed they may have caught the boat that has just come in shes one of the railway empresses and theres an allan liner due tomorrow  we will go to the hotel and try to get a list of the passengers  she rose and they walked slowly back along the avenue     chapter ii  on the river boat  dusk was falling on the broad river and the bold ridge behind the city stood out sharp and black against a fading gleam in the western sky  a big sidewheel steamer spotlessly white with tiers of decks that towered above the sheds and blazed with light was receiving the last of her passengers and preparing to cast off from her moorings  richard blake hurried along the wharf and on reaching the gangplank stood aside to let an elderly lady pass  she was followed by her maid and a girl whose face he could not see  it was a few minutes after the sailing time and as the lady stepped on board a rope fell with a splash  there was a shout of warning as the bows caught by the current began to swing out into the stream and the end of the gangplank slipped along the edge of the wharf  it threatened to fall into the river and the girl was not yet on board  blake leaped upon the plank  seizing her shoulder he drove her forward until a seaman reaching out drew her safe on deck  then the paddles splashed and as the boat forged out into the stream the girl turned and thanked blake he could not see her clearly for an overarching deck cast a shadow on her face  glad to have been of assistance but i dont think you could have fallen in he said  the guyrope they had on the gangplank might have held it up  turning away he entered the smokingroom where he spent a while over an english newspaper that devoted some space to social functions and the doings of people of importance noticing once or twice with a curious smile mention of names he knew  he had the gift of making friends and before he went to india he had met a number of men and women of note who had been disposed to like him  then he had won the good opinion of responsible officers on the turbulent frontier and had made acquaintances that might have been valuable  now however he had done with all that he was banished from the world in which they moved and if they ever remembered him it was no doubt as one who had gone under  shaking off these thoughts he joined some americans in a game of cards and it was late at night when he went out into the moonlight as the boat steamed up lake st peter  a long plume of smoke trailed across the cloudless sky the water glistened with silvery radiance and looking over the wide expanse he could see dark trees etched faintly on the blue horizon  ahead the lights of three rivers twinkled among square black blocks of houses and tall sawmill stacks  a few passengers were strolling about but the english newspaper had made blake restless and he wanted to be alone  descending to a quieter deck he was surprised to see the girl he had assisted sitting in a canvas chair near the rail  nearby stood several large baskets from which rose an angry snarling  what is this he asked with the careless abruptness which usually characterized him  with your permission  he raised a lid while the girl watched him with amusement  looks like a menagerie on a small scale he remarked  are these animals yours  no they belong to mrs keith  mrs keith he said sharply  the lady i saw at the frontenac with the autocratic manners  its curious but she reminds me of somebody i knew and the names the same  i wonder  he broke off and millicent graham studied him as he stood in the moonlight  she did not think he recognized her and perhaps he was hardly justified in supposing that his timely aid at the gangway dispensed with the need for an introduction but she liked his looks which she remembered well  she had no fear of this mans presuming too far and his surprise when she mentioned mrs keith had roused her interest  yes she said i believe it was my employer you knew  he did not follow this lead  are you supposed to sit up all night and watch the animals for her he asked  only for an hour or two  the steamboat people refused to have them in the saloon and the maid should have relieved me  she was tired however with packing and running errands all day and i thought id let her sleep a while  then it cant be much of an intrusion if i try to make you more comfortable  let me move your chair nearer the deckhouse where youll be out of the wind but ill first see if i can find another rug  he left her without waiting for a reply and returning with a rug placed her chair in a sheltered spot then he leaned against the railing  so you are mrs keiths companion he observed  it strikes me as rather unfeeling of her to keep you here in the cold  he indicated the baskets  but whats her object in buying these creatures  caprice millicent smiled  some of them are savage and they cost a good deal  i cant imagine what she means to do with them i dont think she knows herself  one of them however has been growling all day and as its apparently unwell it mustnt be neglected  if it growls any more ill feel tempted to turn yonder hose upon it or try some other drastic remedy  please dont cried millicent in alarm  but you mustnt think mrs keith is inconsiderate  i have much to thank her for but she gets very enthusiastic over her hobbies  do you know whether she ever goes down to a little place in shropshire  yes i have been with her  once she took me to your old home  the color crept into millicents face  you dont seem to remember me lieutenant blake  blake had learned selfcontrol and he did not start though he came near doing so as he recalled a scene in which he had taken part some years earlier  it would have been inexcusable if i had forgotten you he responded with a smile  still i couldnt quite place you until a few moments ago when you faced the light  but you were wrong in one thing im no longer lieutenant blake  she appreciated the frankness which had prompted this warning and she saw that she had made a tactless blunder but she looked at him steadily  i forgot she said forgive me  i heard ofwhat happened in indiabut i knew that there must have been some mistake  she hesitated for a moment  i think so now  blake made a sudden movement and then leaned back against the railing  im afraid that an acquaintance which lasted three or four minutes could hardly enable you to judge first impressions are often wrong you know  anyway i dont complain of the opinion of gentlemen who knew more about me  millicent saw that the subject must be dropped  at our first meeting she said i had no opportunity for thanking you and you gave me none tonight  its curious that while ive met you only twice on both occasions you turned up just when you were needed  is it a habit of yours  blake laughed  thats a flattering thing to hint  the man whos always on hand when hes wanted is an estimable person  he studied her with an interest which she noticed but could not resent the girl had changed and gained something since their first meeting and he thought it was a knowledge of the world  she was he felt neither tainted nor hardened by what she had learned but her fresh childish look which suggested ignorance of evil had gone and could not come back  indeed he wondered bow she had preserved it in her fathers house  this was not a matter he could touch upon but presently she referred to it  i imagine she said shyly that on the evening when you came to my rescue in london you were surprised to find meso unprepared so incapable of dealing with the situation  that is true blake answered with some awkwardness  a bachelor dinner you know after a big race meeting at which we had backed several winners  one has to make allowances  millicent smiled rather bitterly  you may guess that i had to make them often in those days but it was on the evening we were speaking of that my eyes were first opened and i was startled  but you must understand that it was not by my fathers wish that i came to london and stayed with himuntil the end  he urged me to go away but his health had broken down and he had no one else to care for him  when he was no longer able to get about everybody deserted him and he felt it  i was truly sorry to hear of his death blake said  your father was once a very good friend to me  but if i may ask how was it he let you come to his flat  i forced myself upon him  my mother died long ago and her unmarried sisters took care of me  they lived very simply in a small secluded country house two oldfashioned evangelicals gentle but austere studying small economies giving all they could away  in winter we embroidered for missionary bazaars in summer we spent the days in a quiet walled garden  it was all very peaceful but i grew restless and when i heard that my fathers health was failing i felt that i must go to him  my aunts were grieved and alarmed but they said they dare not hinder me if i thought it my duty  stirred by troubled memories and perhaps encouraged by the sympathy he showed she had spoken on impulse without reserve and blake listened with pity  the girl brought up subject to wholesome puritanical influences in such surroundings as she had described must have suffered a cruel shock when suddenly plunged into the society of the rakes and gamblers who frequented her fathers flat  could you not have gone back when you were no longer needed he asked  no she said it would not have been fair  i had changed since i left my aunts  they were very sensitive and i think the difference they must have noticed in me would have jarred on them  i should have brought something alien into their unworldly life  it was too late to return i had to follow the path i had chosen  blake mused a while watching the lights of three rivers fade astern and the broad white wake of the paddles stream back across the glassy surface of the lake  the girl must have learned much of human failings since she left her sheltered home but he thought the sweetness of character which could not be spoiled by knowledge of evil was greatly to be admired  he was however a man of action and not a philosopher  well he said i appreciate your letting me talk to you but its cold and getting late and you have sat on deck long enough  ill see that somebody looks after the animals  millicent felt dubious though she was sleepy and tired  if anything happened to her pets mrs keith would not forgive me  ill engage that something will happen to some of them very soon unless you promise to go to your room blake laughed  then he called a deckhand  what have you to do  stand here until the watch is changed  then you can keep an eye on these baskets  if any of the beasts makes an alarming noise send to my room the second forward port side  look me up before we get to montreal  thats all right sir replied the man  blake turned to millicent and held out his hand as she rose  now he said you can go to rest with a clear conscience  she left him with a word of thanks wondering whether she had been indiscreet and why she had told him so much  she knew nothing to his advantage except one chivalrous action and she had not desired to arouse his pity but he had an honest face and had shown an understanding sympathy which touched her because she had seldom experienced it  he had left the army with a stain upon his name but she felt very confident that he had not merited his disgrace     chapter iii  the cousins  dinner was over at the windsor in montreal and mrs keith was sitting with mrs ashborne in the square between the hotel and st catharines street  a cool air blew uphill from the river and the patch of grass with its fringe of small dusty trees had a certain picturesqueness in the twilight  above it the wooded crest of the mountain rose darkly against the evening sky lights glittered behind the network of thin branches and fluttering leaves along the sidewalk and the dome of the cathedral bulked huge and shadowy across the square  downhill toward st jamess rose towering buildings with the roughhewn front of the canadian pacific station prominent among them and the air was filled with the clanging of streetcars and the tolling of locomotive bells once or twice however when the throb of the traffic momentarily subsided music rose faint and sweet from the cathedral and mrs keith turned to listen  she had heard the uplifted voices before through her open window in the early morning when the city was silent and its busy toilers slept and now it seemed to her appropriate that they could not be wholly drowned by its hoarse commercial clamor  the square served as a cool retreat for the inhabitants of crowded tenements and those who had nowhere else to go but margaret keith was not fastidious about her company  she was interested in the unkempt immigrants who waiting for a westbound train lay upon the grass surrounded by their tired children and she had sent millicent down the street to buy fruit to distribute among the travelers  she liked to watch the french canadian girls who slipped quietly up the broad cathedral steps  they were the daughters of the rank and file but their movements were graceful and they were tastefully dressed  then the blueshirted sinewy men who strolled past smoking roused her curiosity  they had not acquired their free springy stride in the cities these were adventurers who had met with strange experiences in the frozen north and the lonely west  some of them had hard faces and a predatory air but that added to their interest  margaret keith liked to watch them all and speculate about their mode of life that pleasure could still be enjoyed though as she sometimes told herself with humorous resignation she could no longer take a very active part in things  presently however something that appealed to her in a more direct and personal way occurred for a man came down the steps of the windsor and crossed the welllighted street with a very pretty english girl  he carried himself well and had the look of a soldier his figure was finely proportioned but his handsome face suggested sensibility rather than decision of character and his eyes were dreamy  his companion so far as mrs keith could judge by her smiling glance as she laid her hand upon his arm when they left the sidewalk was proud of him and much in love with him  whom are you looking at so hard mrs ashborne inquired  bertram challoner and his bride said mrs keith  theyre coming toward us yonder  then a curious thing happened for a man who was crossing the street seemed to see the challoners and turning suddenly stepped back behind a passing cab  they had their backs to him when he went on but he looked around as if to make sure he had not been observed before he entered the hotel  that was strange said mrs ashborne  it looked as if the fellow didnt want to meet our friends  who can he be  how can i tell mrs keith answered  i think ive seen him somewhere but thats all i know  looking around as millicent joined them she noticed the girls puzzled expression  millicent had obviously seen the strangers action but mrs keith did not wish to pursue the subject then and the next moment challoner came up and greeted her heartily while his wife spoke to mrs ashborne  we arrived only this afternoon and must have missed you at dinner he said  we may go west tomorrow though we havent decided yet ive no doubt we shall see you again tonight or at breakfast  after a few pleasant words the challoners passed on and mrs keith looked after them thoughtfully  bertram has changed in the last few years she said  i heard that he had malaria in india and that perhaps accounts for it but he shows signs of his mothers delicacy  she was not strong and i always thought he had her highly strung nervous temperament though he must have learned to control it in the army  he couldnt have got in unless the doctors were satisfied with him mrs ashborne pointed out  thats true but both mental and physical traits have a way of lying dormant while were young and developing later  bertram has shown himself a capable officer but to my mind he looked more like a soldier when he was at sandhurst than he does now  mrs ashborne glanced toward millicent who was distributing a basket of peaches among a group of untidy immigrant children  one toddling baby clung to her skirt  what a charming picture  miss graham fits the part well  you can see that shes sorry for the dirty little beggars  they dont look as if theyd had a happy time and a liners crowded steerage isnt a luxurious place  mrs keith smiled as millicent came toward her with a few of the small children clustered round her  i have some english letters to write she said and i think well go in  the challoners did not leave for the west the next day  about an hour before sunset they leaned upon the rails of a wooden gallery built out from the rock on the summit of the green mountain that rises close behind montreal  it is a viewpoint that visitors frequent and they gazed with appreciation at the wide landscape  wooded slopes led steeply down to the stately college buildings of mcgill and the rows of picturesque houses along sherbrook avenue lower yet the city shining in the clear evening light spread across the plain dominated by its cathedral dome and the towers of notre dame  green squares with trees in them checkered the blocks of buildings along its skirts where a haze of smoke hung about the wharves the great river gleamed in a broad silver band  on the farther bank the plain ran on again fading from green to gray and purple until it melted into the distance and the hills on the vermont frontier cut faintly blue against the sky  how beautiful this world is challoner exclaimed  i have seen grander sights and there are more picturesque cities than montrealim looking forward to showing you the work of the moguls in indiabut happiness such as ive had of late casts a glamour over everything  it wasnt always so with me ive had my bad hours when i was blind to beauty  though blanche challoner was very young and much in love she ventured a smiling rebuke  you shouldnt wish to remember them im afraid bertram theres a melancholy strain in you and i dont mean to let you indulge in it besides how could you have had bad hours  you have been made much of and given everything you could wish for since you were a boy  indeed i sometimes wonder how you escaped from being spoiled  when i joined the army i hated it that sounds like high treason doesnt it  however i got used to things and made art my hobby instead of my vocation  you wont mind if i confess that a view of this kind makes me long to paint  oh no i intend to encourage you  you mustnt waste your talent when we stay among the rockies we will spend the days in the most beautiful places we can find and i shall take my pleasure in watching you at work  but didnt your fondness for sketching amuse the mess  i used to be chaffed about it but i repaid my tormentors by caricaturing them  on the whole they were very goodnatured  i am sure they admired the drawings they ought to have done so anyway  you have talent  indeed i never quite understood why you became a soldier  i think it was from a want of moral courage you have seen that determination is not among my virtues  if you knew my father very well you would understand  though hes fond of pictures he looks upon artists and poets as a rather effeminate and irresponsible set and i must admit that he has met one or two unfavorable specimens then he couldnt imagine the possibility of a son of his not being anxious to follow the family profession and knowing how my defection would grieve him i let him have his way  there has always been a challoner fighting or ruling in india since john companys time  they must have been fine men by their portraits  theres one of a major henry challoner i fell in love with  he was with outram wasnt he  you have his look though theres a puzzling difference  i think those men were bluffer and blunter than you are  youre gentler and more sensitive in a way finer drawn  my sensitiveness has not been a blessing said challoner soberly  but it makes you lovable blanche declared  there must have been a certain ruthlessness about those old challoners which you couldnt show  after all their pictures suggest that their courage was of the unimaginative physical kind  a shadow crept into challoners face but he banished it  i am happy in having a wife who wont see my faults  then he added humorously after all however thats not good for one  blanche gave him a tender smile but he did not see it for he was gazing at a man who came down the steps from the neighboring cable railway  the newcomer was about thirty years old of average height and strongly made  his face was deeply sunburned and he had eyes of a curious dark blue with a twinkle in them and dark lashes though his hair was fair  as he drew nearer blanche was struck by something that suggested the family likeness of the challoners  he had their firm mouth and wide forehead but by no means their somewhat austere expression  he looked as if he went carelessly through life and could readily be amused  then he saw bertram and starting made as if he would pass the entrance to the gallery and blanche turned her surprised glance upon her husband  bertrams hand was tightly closed on the glasses he held and his face was tense and flushed but he stepped forward with a cry  dick  the newcomer moved toward him and blanche knew that he was the man who had brought dishonor upon her husbands family  this is a fortunate meeting bertram said and his voice was cordial though rather strained  blanche heres my cousin dick blake  blake showed no awkwardness  indeed on the whole he looked amused but his face grew graver as he fixed his eyes on mrs challoner  though im rather late youll let me wish you happiness he said i believe it will be yours  bertrams a good fellow i have much to thank him for  there was a sincerity and a hint of affection in his tone and bertram looked uncomfortable  but how did you come here bertram asked as if to turn the conversation from himself  where have you been since  he stopped abruptly and blake laughed  since you surreptitiously said goodby to me at peshawur  well after that i went to penang and from there to queensland  stayed a time at a pearlfishing station among the kanakas and then went to england for a few months  but how did you manage bertram inquired with some diffidence  it raises a point you wouldnt let me talk about at peshawur but ive often felt guilty because i didnt insist  traveling about as you have done is expensive  not to me blake explained with a twinkle  ive turned adventurer and i have the blake gift of getting along without money  he added in an explanatory aside to blanche for two or three generations we kept open house and a full stable in ireland on a revenue derived from rents which were rarely paid and if i hadnt been too young when a disaster gave the creditors their chance  id have given them a sporting run  but what did you do when you left england bertram broke in  went to east africa after that to this country where i tried my hand at prairie farming  found it decidedly monotonous and sold the homestead at a profit  then i did some prospecting and now im here on business  on business bertram exclaimed  you could never be trusted to get proper value for a shilling  ive learned to do so lately and thats not going far  if youre in commerce in this country you must know how to put down fifty cents and take up a dollars worth  anyhow im here to meet an american whose acquaintance i made farther west  hes a traveler in paints and varnishes and a very enterprising person as well as an unusually good sort  but ive told you enough about myself i want your news  blanche thought it cost her husband an effort to fall in with his cousins casual mood  blake however seemed quite at ease and she was growing interested in him  he reminded her of the challoner portraits in the dark oak gallery at sandymere but she thought him lighter more brilliant and in a sense more human than those stern soldiers  then she remembered that his irish blood explained something  they talked a while about english friends and relatives and then blake asked rather abruptly  and the colonel  well said bertram i heard that you saw him dick  i did for half an hour  i felt that it was my duty though the interview was hard on us both  he was fair as he always was and tried to hide his feelings  i couldnt blame him because he failed  bertram looked away and blakes face was troubled  there was a hint of emotion in his voice as he went on turning to blanche  whatever he may think of me i have a sincere respect for colonel challoner and i owe him more than i can ever repay  he brought me up after my fathers death and started me like a son in an honorable career  his tone grew lighter  its one of my few virtues that i dont forget my debts  but ive kept you some time  my american friend hasnt turned up yet and i may be here a few days  where are you staying  ill look you up before i leave  we go west tomorrow morning  come down and have dinner with us at the windsor bertram said and when mrs challoner seconded the request they went up the steps to the platform from which the cable train started     chapter iv  the man from connecticut  after an excellent dinner mrs keith took blanche away and the men found a quiet corner in the rotunda where they sat talking for a while  i have an appointment to keep and must go in a few minutes blake said glancing at his watch  make my excuses to your wife i shall not see her again  it would be better theres no reason why she should be reminded of anything unpleasant now  shes a good woman bertram and im glad she didnt shrink from me  it would have been a natural thing but i believe she was sorry and was anxious to make all the allowances she could  challoner was silent for a few moments his face showing signs of strain  i dont deserve her dick the thought of it troubles me  she doesnt know me for what i really am  rot blake exclaimed  its your misfortune that youre a sentimentalist with a habit of exaggerating things but if you dont indulge in your weakness too much youll go a long way  you showed the true challoner pluck when you smoked out that robbers nest in the hills and the pacification of the frontier valley was a smart piece of work  when i read about the business i never thought you would pull it off with the force you had  it must have impressed the authorities and youll get something better than your majors commission before long  i understand that youre already looked upon as a coming man  it was a generous speech but it was justified for challoner had shown administrative as well as military skill in the affairs his cousin mentioned  however he still looked troubled and his color was higher than usual  dick he said you know all i owe to you  i wish you would let me repay you in the only way i can  you know  no blake interrupted curtly its impossible  your father made me a similar offer and i couldnt consent  i suppose i have the blakes carelessness about money but what i get from my mothers little property keeps me on my feet  he laughed as he went on its lucky that your people knowing the family failing arranged matters so that the principal could not be touched  besides ive a plan for adding to my means  bertram dropped the subject  dick was often rather casual and inconsequent but there was a stubborn vein in him  when he took the trouble to think a matter out he was apt to prove immovable  anyway you will let me know how you get on  i think not  what good would it do  while im grateful its better that the challoners should have nothing more to do with me  think of your career keep your wife proud of youshe has good reason for being soand let me go my way and drop out of sight again  im a common adventurer and have been mixed up in matters that fastidious people would shrink fromwhich may happen again  still i manage to get a good deal of pleasure out of the life it suits me in many ways  he rose holding out his hand  goodby bertram  we may run across each other somewhere again  ill always be glad to do so challoner said with feeling  be sure i wont forget what a generous thing youve done for me dick  blake turned away but when he left the hotel his face was sternly set it had cost him something to check his cousins friendly advances and break the last connection between himself and the life he once had led but he knew it must be broken and he felt no pang of envious bitterness  for many years bertram had been a good and generous friend and blake sincerely wished him well  the challoners left by the pacific express the next morning and that evening a group of men were engaged in conversation at one end of the hotel rotunda  one was a sawmill owner another served the hudson bay company in the northern wilds the third was a young keeneyed american quick in his movements and concise in speech  youre in lumber arent you he said taking a strip of wood from his pocket and handing it to the mill owner  what would you call this  cedar sawn from a good log  thats so red cedar  you know something about that material  i ought to considering how much of it ive cut  been in the business for twenty years  the american took out another strip  the same stuff sir  how would you say it had been treated  the sawmill man carefully examined the piece of wood  its not french polish but ive never seen varnish as good as this except that its clear and shows the grain its more like some rare old japanese lacquer  it is varnish  try to scrape it with your knife  the man failed to make a mark on it and the american looked at him with a smile  what would you think of it as a business proposition  if not too dear it ought to drive every other highgrade varnish off the market  do you make the stuff  were not ready to sell it yet cant get hold of the raw material in quantities and were not satisfied about the best flux  ill give you my card  it bore the address of a paint and varnish factory in connecticut with the words represented by cyrus p harding at the bottom  well said the lumber man you seem to have got hold of a good thing mr harding but if youre not open to sell it what has brought you over here  im looking round we deal in all kinds of paints and miss no chance of a trade  then im going way up northwest  is there anything doing in my line there  not much the hudson bay man answered him  you may sell a few kegs along the railroad track but as soon as you leave it youll find no paint required  the settlers use logs or shiplap and leave them in the raw  the trip wont pay you  well ill see the country and find out something about the coniferous gums  theyre soft and resinous  dont you get the material you make good varnish of from the tropics  harding laughed  you people dont know your own resources  theres most everything a white man needs right on this american continent if hell take the trouble to look for it  lumber changes some of its properties with the location in which it grows i guess  we have pines in florida but when you get right up to their northern limit youll find a difference  theres something in that the sawmill man agreed  if youre going up to their northern limit youll see some of the roughest and wildest country on this earth declared the hudson bay agent  its almost impossible to get through in summer unless you stick to the rivers and to cross it in winter with the dog sleds is pretty tough work  so ive heard said harding  well im going to take a smoke  will you come along  they declined and when he left them one smiled at the other  theyre smart people across the frontier but to send a man into the northern timber belt looking for paint trade openings or resin they can make varnish of is about the limit to commercial enterprise  harding was leaning back in his chair in the smokingroom with a frown on his face when blake joined him  he had a nervous alert look and was dressed with fastidious neatness  so you have come along at last he remarked in an ironical tone feel like getting down to business or shall we put it off again  sorry i couldnt come earlier blake replied  somehow or other i couldnt get away  things kept turning up to occupy me  its a way they seem to have  your trouble is that youre too diffuse you spread yourself out too much  you want to fix your mind on one thing and that will have to be business as soon as we leave here  i dare say youre right  my interests apt to wander but if you take advantage of every opportunity that offers you get most out of life concentrations good but if you concentrate on a thing and then dont get it you begin to think what a lot of other things youve missed  that may be all right said harding dubiously but were going to concentrate on business right now  i have a wife and i dont forget it  mariannathats mrs hardingis living in a tworoom tenement making her own dresses and cooking on a gasoline stove sos to give me my chance for finding the gum  and im here in an expensive hotel where ive made about two dollars commission in three days  we have got to pull out as soon as possible  did you get any information from the hudson bay man  i learned something about our route through the timber belt and the kind of camp outfit well want the temperatures often fifty below in winter  then i was in revillons looking at their cheaper furs and in a store where they supply especially light handsleds snowshoes and patent cooking cans  we must have these things good and i estimate theyll cost about six hundred dollars  six hundred dollars will make a big hole in our capital  im afraid so but we cant run the risk of freezing to death and we may have to spend all winter in the wilds  thats true i dont go back until i find the gum  hardings tone was resolute and when he leaned forward musing with knitted brows blake gave him a sympathetic glance  harding had entered the paint factory when a very young man and had studied chemistry in his scanty spare time with the object of understanding his business better  he found the composition of varnishes an interesting subject and as the best gums employed came from the tropics and were expensive he began to experiment with the exudations from american trees  his employers hinted that he was wasting his time but harding continued trying to test a theory that the texture and hardness of the gums might depend upon climatic temperature  by chance a resinous substance which had come from the far north fell into his hands and he found that when combined with an african gum it gave astonishing results  before this happened however his employers had sent him out on the road and as they were sceptical about his discovery and he would not take them fully into his confidence they merely promised to keep his place open for a time now he was going to search for the gum at his own expense  well order the outfit in the morning he said presently glancing toward a man who sat across the room  do you think that fellow clarke can hear  ive a notion that hes been watching us  does it matter  you must bear in mind that we have a valuable secret and i understand that he lives somewhere in the country we are going through  as he spoke the hudson bay agent came in and walked over to clarke  that was good stuff you gave me a dose of last night he said to him it cured my ague right off  its a powerful drug clarke answered and must be used with discretion  if you feel you need it ill give you another dose  its an indian remedy i learned the secret up in the timber belt but i spent some time experimenting before i was satisfied about its properties  then you get on with indians  yes clarke said shortly  it isnt difficult when you grasp their point of view  you ought to know something about that  on the whole the hudson bay people treat the indians well there was a starving lad you picked up suffering from snowblindness near jackpine river and sent back safely to his tribe  thats so but i dont know how you knew  im sure i havent talked about it and my clerk has never left the factory  there wasnt another white man within a weeks journey  clarke smiled  i heard all the same  you afterward had some better furs than usual brought in  the agent looked surprised  some of these people are grateful but although ive been in the country twelve years i dont pretend to understand them  they understand you  the proof of it is that you can keep your factory open in a district where furs are rather scarce and you have had very few mishaps  you can take that as a compliment  blake noticed something significant in clarkes tone  then you know the jackpine the agent asked  pretty well though its not easy to reach  i came down it one winter from the wildgoose hills  id put in the winter with a band of stonies  the northern stonies  did you find them easy to get on with  they knew some interesting things clarke answered dryly  i went there to study  ah said the agent  what plain folk for want of a better name call the occult  but its fortunate that theres a barred door between white men and the indians mysticism  it has been opened to a white man once or twice  oh yes  he stepped through into the darkness and never came out again  there was an instance i could mention  civilized people would have no use for him afterward harding broke in  we want sane normal men on this continent  neurotics hoodoos and fakirs are worse than the plague theres contagion in their fooling  how would you define them  those who dont fit in with your ideas of the normal clarke sneered  i know a clean straight man when i meet him and thats enough for me harding retorted  i imagine that cleverer people are now and then deceived said clarke moving away as he spoke  thats a man i want to keep clear of harding declared  theres something wrong about him hes not wholesome     chapter v  cornering the bobcat  the next evening harding was taking out a cigar in the vestibule when a man brushed past him wearing big mittens and a loose black cloak such as oldfashioned frenchcanadians sometimes use  why blake he cried  what have you got on  have you been serenading somebody  i cant stop blake answered with a grin  open that door for mequick  a porter held back the door but as blake slipped through harding seized his cloak  hold on  i want a talk with you  blake made an effort to break loose and as he did so a bobcat dropped from beneath his arm and fell spitting and snarling to the floor its fur was torn and matted tufts were hanging loose and the creature had a singularly disreputable and ferocious appearance  blake made an attempt to recapture it but evading him easily it ran along the floor with a curious hopping gait and disappeared among the pillars then he turned to his friend with a rueful laugh  you see what youve done  its gone into the rotunda where everybody is  harding looked at him critically  you seem sober  what ever possessed you to get yourself up like an italian opera villain and go round the town with a wild beast under your arm  ill tell you later blake laughed  what we have to do now is to catch the thing  its time drawled harding  the circus is beginning  mens laughter and womens shrieks rose from the rotunda  somebody shouted orders in french there was a patter of running feet and then a crash as of chairs being overturned  blake sprang in and harding followed divided between amusement and impatience  they saw an animated scene  two porters were chasing the bobcat which now and then turned upon them savagely while several waiters keeping at a judicious distance tried to frighten it into a corner by flourishing their napkins  women fled out of the creatures way men hastily moved chairs and tables to give the pursuers room and some of the more energetic joined in the chase  at one end of the room mrs keith stood angrily giving instructions which nobody attended to  millicent standing near her looked hot and unhappy but for all that her eyes twinkled when a waiter colliding with a chair went down with a crash and the bobcat sped away from him in a series of awkward jumps  at last blake managed to seize it with his mittened hands  he rolled it in a cloth and gave it to a porter and then advanced toward mrs keith his face red with exertion but contrite and the cloak which had come unhooked hanging down from one shoulder  she glanced at him in a puzzled halfdisturbed manner when he stopped  as the cat belongs to me she said imperiously and as im told you dropped it in the vestibule i feel that im entitled to an explanation  i gave the animal to my maid this morning sending miss graham to see it delivered to a veterinary surgeon and it disappeared may i ask how it came into your possession  through no fault of miss grahams i assure you  i happened to notice your maid trying to carry an awkwardly shaped hamper and miss graham looking for a cab  it struck me the thing was more of a mans errand and i undertook it  its curious that you knew what the errand was unless miss graham told you  mrs keith looked sternly at millicent and the girl blushed  i have been led to believe that you made her acquaintance without my knowledge on board the steamer by which we came up  that said blake respectfully is not quite correct  i was formally presented to miss graham in england some time ago  however as i saw a car coming along st catharines while your maid was looking for a hack and there was no time to explain i scribbled a note on a bit of a letter and gave it to a boy to deliver to miss graham and then i took the cat to a taxidermist  to a taxidermist  why  it struck me that he ought to know something about the matter anyway he was the nearest approach to a vet that i could find  mrs keith looked at him thoughtfully  you seem to have a curious way of reasoning  what did the man say  he promised to engage the services of a dogfancier friend of his  you imagined that a dogfancier would specialize in cats  millicents eyes twinkled but mrs keiths face was serious and blakes perfectly grave  i dont know that i argued the matter out  to tell the truth i undertook the thing on impulse  so it seems  but you havent told me what became of my hamper  the hamper was unfortunately smashed  i left it at a basket shop and that explains the cloak  my friend the taxidermist insisted on lending it and his winter gloves to me  one looks rather conspicuous walking through the streets with a bobcat on ones arm  then to blakes astonishment mrs keith broke into a soft laugh  i understand it all she said  it was a prank one would expect you to play  though its a very long time since i saw you you havent changed dick  now take that ridiculous cloak off and come back and talk to me  when blake returned millicent had gone and mrs keith noticed the glance he cast about the room  i sent miss graham away she said  you have been here some days why didnt you tell me who you were  i wasnt sure you would be willing to acknowledge me he answered frankly  oh i never quite agreed with the popular opinion about what you were supposed to have done  it wasnt like you there must have been something that did not come out  thank you blake said quietly  she gave him a searching glance  cant you say something for yourself she urged  i think not  the least said the soonest mended you know  but for the sake of others  so far as i know only one person was much troubled about my disgrace im thankful my father died before it came  your uncle felt it very keenly  he was furious when the first news arrived and refused to believe you were to blame  then when major allardyce wrote he scarcely spoke for the rest of the day and it was a long time before he recovered from the blow i was staying at sandymere  he loved you dick and i imagined he expected you to do even better than his son  blake mused for a few moments and mrs keith could not read his thoughts  bertram is a good fellow he said  why should his people think less of him because he likes to paint  but ive been sorry for the colonel more sorry than ive felt for myself  there was a softness in his dark blue eyes that appealed to mrs keith she had been fond of dick blake in his younger days and firmly believed in him  now she could not credit his being guilty of cowardice  well she said you have a long life before you i trust and there are people who would be glad to see you reinstated  he made a sign of grave dissent  that cant happen in the way you mean  i closed the door of the old life against my return with my own hands and you dont gain distinction as the challoners think of it in business  what business have you gone into  blakes eyes gleamed humorously  at present im in the paint line  paint mrs keith exclaimed  yes but not common paint  we use the highest grade of lead and the purest linseed oil  varnish also of unapproachable quality guaranteed to stand exposure to any climate  theres nothing to equal our products in north america  do you seriously mean that you are going about selling these things  im trying to  i booked an order for two kegs yesterday but it isnt to be paid for until arrival when i shall not be here  cant i induce you to give us a trial  your house must need painting now and then and well ship you the stuff to liverpool in airtight drums  once you have tried it youll use nothing else  mrs keith laughed  dick youre a marvel  im glad adversity hasnt soured you but you know that you wont make enough to keep you in neckties at any business you take up  its ludicrous to think of your running about with paint samples  you seem to doubt my ability blake said humorously  here comes my american partner  he has been waiting for a word with me since this morning  and you kept him waiting  that was a true blake  but bring him here i want to know your friend  they spent a pleasant evening and the next afternoon blake and harding drove up the mountain with mrs keith and one or two others  the city was unpleasantly hot and the breeze that swept its streets blew clouds of sand and cement about for montreal is subject to fits of feverish constructional activity and on every other block buildings were being torn down and replaced by larger ones of concrete and steel  leaving its outskirts the carriage climbed the road which winds in loops through the shade of overhanging trees  wide views of blue hills and shining river opened up through gaps in the foliage the air lost its humid warmth and grew fresh and invigorating  reaching the level summit they found seats near the edge of a steep wooded slope  the strip of tableland is not remarkably picturesque but it is thickly covered with trees and one can look out across a vast stretch of country traversed by the great river  when the party scattered mrs keith was left with harding  they were in many ways strangely assorted companionsthe elderly english lady accustomed to the smoother side of life and the young american who had struggled hard from boyhoodbut they were sensible of a mutual liking mrs keith had a trace of the grand manner which had its effect on harding he showed a naive frankness which she found attractive besides his talk and conduct were marked by a labored correctness which amused and pleased her  she thought he had taken some trouble to acquire it  so you had to leave your wife at home she said presently  wasnt that rather hard for both of you  it was hard enough he replied with feeling  what made it worse was that i hadnt much money to leave with her but i had to go  the man who will take no chances has to stay at the bottom  then if its not an impertinence your means are small  your interest is a compliment  we had two hundred dollars when we were married  you wouldnt consider that much to begin on  no  still of course it depends upon what one expects  after all i think my poorest friends have been happiest  we had only one troublemaking the money go round harding told her with grave confidence  it was worst in the hot weather when other people could move out of town and it hurt me to see marianna looking white and tired  i used to wish i could send her to one of the farms up in the hillsthough i guess she wouldnt have gone without me shes brave and when my chance came she saw that i must take it  she sent me off with smiles but i knew what they cost  courage to face a hard task is a great gift  so you consider this trip to the northwest your opportunity  you must expect to sell a good deal of paint  harding looked up with a sudden twinkle  ill admit to you maam that i expect to sell very little  the company will pay my commission on any orders i get at the settlements but this is my venture not theirs  im going up into the wilds to look for a valuable raw material  ah said mrs keith  i suspected something like this  its difficult to imagine dick blakes going into anything so sober and matteroffact as the paint business  have you known him long  i met him a year ago and we spent two or three weeks together  but was that long enough to learn much about him  do you know his history  harding gave her a direct glance  do you  yes she said and i gather that he has taken you into his confidence  now you set me free to talk  when i asked him to be my partner he told me why he had left the army  that was the square thing and it made me keen on getting him  then you were not deterred by what you learned  not at all  i knew it was impossible that blake should have done what he was charged with  i agree with you but then i know him better than you do  what made you jump to the conclusion  you shall judge whether i hadnt good reason  i was in one of our lake ports collecting accounts and blake had come with me  it was late at night when i saw my last customer at his hotel and i had a valise halffull of silver currency and bills  going back along the waterfront where the secondrate saloons are i thought that somebody was following me  the lights didnt run far along the street i hadnt seen a patrol and as i was passing a dark block a man jumped out  i got a blow on the shoulder that made me sore for a week but the fellow had missed my head with the sandbag and i slipped behind a telegraph post before he could strike again  still things looked ugly  the man whod been following came into sight and i was between the two  then blake ran up the streetand i was mighty glad to see him  he had two men to tackle and one had a sandbag while i guess the other had a pistol  but you were there  that made it equal  oh no id been nearly knocked out with the sandbag and could hardly keep my feet  besides i had my employers money in the valise and it was my business to take care of it  mrs keith made a sign of agreement  i beg your pardon  you were right  blake got after the first thief like a panther  he was so quick i didnt quite see what happened but the man reeled halfway across the street before he fell and when his partner saw blake coming for him he ran  then when the trouble was over a policeman came along and he and blake helped me back to my hotel  knowing i had the money hed got uneasy when i was late  harding paused and looked meaningly at his companion  later i was asked to believe that the man who went for those two toughs with no weapon but his fists ran away under fire  the thing didnt seem plausible  and so you trust blake in spite of his story  the northwest is a hard country in winter and i may find myself in a tight place before ive finished my search harding answered with grave quietness  but if that happens ill have a partner i can trust my life to  whats more mrs harding feels im safe with him  mrs keith was moved his respect for his wifes judgment and his faith in his comrade appealed to her  tell me something about your journey she said  while they talked millicent and blake sat in the sunshine on the slope of the hill  beneath them a wide landscape stretched away toward the ottawa valley the road to the lonely north and the girl felt a longing to see the trackless wilds  the distance drew her  your way lies up yonder she said  i suppose you are thinking about it  are you looking forward to the trip  not so much as harding is blake replied  hes a bit of an enthusiast and ive been in the country before  its a singularly rough one and i anticipate our meeting with more hardships than money  which doesnt seem to daunt you  no not to a great extent  hardship is not a novelty to me and i dont think im avaricious  the fact is im a good deal better at spending than gathering  its undoubtedly easier the girl laughed  but while i like mr harding i shouldnt consider him a type of the romantic adventurer  youre right in one sense and wrong in another  hardings out for money and i believe hell get it if its to be had  hell avoid adventures so far as he can but if theres trouble to be faced it wont stop him  then he has left a safe employment broken up his home and set off on this long journey for the sake of a woman who is trying to hold out on a very few dollars in a couple of poor rooms until his return  hes taking risks which i believe may be serious in order that she may have a brighter and fuller life  is there no romance in that  what blake said about his comrades devotion to his wife appealed to the girl and she mused for a moment or two  she liked blake and he improved upon acquaintance  he had a whimsical humor and a dash of reckless gallantry  he was supposed to be in disgrace but she had cause to know that he was compassionate and chivalrous  you havent been with us long she said but we shall be duller when you have gone  thats nice to hear but its with mixed feelings that one leaves friends behind  ive lost some good ones  i can imagine your making others easily but havent you retained one or two  i think for instance you could count on mrs keith  ah  i owe a good deal to her  a little charity such as she shows goes a very long way  millicent did not answer and he watched her as she sat looking out into the distance with grave brown eyes  her face was gentle he thought there was pity for him in it and he felt strongly drawn to her but he remembered that he was a man with a tainted name and must travel a lonely road  some of the others joined them and soon afterward they walked down the winding road to the city  there harding found some letters he had been waiting for and there was now nothing to keep them in montreal  mrs keith was gracious to blake when he went to say goodby the next morning but he felt a strong sense of disappointment at finding her alone  he looked around for millicent and then as he was going out he met her in the hall  she wore her hat and the flush of color in her face indicated that she had been walking fast  im glad i didnt miss you she said  you are going now by the vancouver express  yes answered blake stopping beside a pillar and i was feeling rather gloomy until i saw you  hardings at the station and its depressing to set off on a long journey feeling that nobody minds your going  mrs keith will mind smiled millicent  im sure you have her good wishes  blake looked at her keenly  i want yours  you have them she said softly  i havent forgotten what happened one evening in london  i wish you a safe journey and every possible success  thank you  it will be something to remember that you have wished me well  as his eyes rested upon her he forgot that he was a marked man  she looked very fresh and desirable there was a hint of regret and pity in her face and a trace of shyness in her manner  i suppose i cant ask you to think of me now and then it would be too much he said a little bitterly  but i want you to know that these few days of your friendship have meant a great deal to me  i wishhe hesitated a momentthat i might have something of yourssome little mementoto take with me on my trip  millicent took a tiny bunch of flowers from the lace at the neck of her white dress and handed them to him with a smile  will these do  they wont last very long  they will last a long time well taken care of  when i come back i will show them to you  but i shall be in england then  england is not very far off and im a wanderer you know  well she said with faint confusion unless you hurry you will miss your train  goodby and good fortune  he took the hand she gave him and held it a moment  if your last wish is ever realized i shall come to thank you even in england  he turned and went out with hurried steps wondering what had led him to break through the reserve he had prudently determined to maintain what he had said might mean nothing but it might mean much  he had seen millicent graham for a few minutes in her fathers house and afterward met her every day during the week spent in montreal but brief as their friendship had been he had yielded to her charm  had he been free to seek her love he would eagerly have done so but he was not free  he was an outcast engaged in a desperate attempt to repair his fortune  miss graham knew this  perhaps she had taken his remarks as a piece of sentimental gallantry but something in her manner suggested a doubt  anyway he had promised to show her the flowers again some day and he carefully placed them in his pocketbook     chapter vi  the prairie  a strong breeze swept the wide plain blowing fine sand about and adding to blakes discomfort as he plodded beside a jaded indian pony and a small cart  the cart was loaded with preserved provisions camp stores and winter clothes he had bought it and the pony because that seemed cheaper than paying for transport  the settlement for which he and harding were bound stands near the northern edge of the great sweep of grass which stretches across central canada  since leaving the railroad they had spent four days upon the trail which sometimes ran plain before them marked by dints of wheels among the wiry grass and sometimes died away leaving them at a loss in a wilderness of sand and short poplar scrub  it was now late in the afternoon and the men were tired of battling with the wind which buffeted their sunburned faces with sharp sand they were crossing one of the high steppes of the middle prairie toward the belt of pines and muskegs which divides it from the barrens of the north  the broad stretch of fertile loam where prosperous wooden towns are rising fast among the wheatfields lay to the south of them and the arid tract through which they journeyed had so far no attraction for even the adventurous homestead preemptor  they found it a bleak and cheerless country crossed by the ravines of a few sluggish creeks the water of which was unpleasant to drink and dotted at long intervals by ponds bitter with alkali  in places stunted poplar bluffs cut against the sky but for the most part there was only a rolling waste of dingy grass  the trail was heavy the wheels sank deep in sand as they climbed a low rise and to make things worse the rounded whiteedged clouds which had scudded across the sky since morning were gathering in threatening masses  this had happened every afternoon but now and then the cloud ranks had broken to pour out a furious deluge and a blaze of lightning  harding anxiously studied the sky  i guess were up against another thunderstorm he said  my opinion of the midcontinental climate is singularly mean but id put this strip of canada near the limit  our texan northers are fierce when they come along but here it blows all the time  well make camp if you like i dont feel very fresh blake replied  not here snapped harding  where i stop i sleep and im not particularly enthusiastic about sheltering under the cart  last time we tried it the pony stampeded and the wheel went over my foot  the tents no good youd want a chain to stop its blowing away  well go on until we bring up to lee of a big solid bluff  very well blake agreed  i dare say we ought to find one in the hollow we got a glimpse of from the last rise but we havent had to put up with much discomfort yet  thats a matter of opinion  you havent limped forty miles on a bad foot but im not complaining  its a whole lot to feel that we have started doing nothing takes the sand out of me  blake had once or twice suggested that his comrade should ride but the pony was overburdened and harding refused  he explained that they could not expect to sell it at the settlement if it were in a wornout condition but blake suspected him of sympathy for the patient beast  they crossed the ridge and seeing a wavy line of trees in the wide hollow quickened their pace  the soil was firmer the scrub through which the wheels crushed was short and the trail led smoothly down a slight descent  this was comforting for half the sky was barred with leaden cloud and the parched grass gleamed beneath it lividly white while the light that struck a ridgetop here and there had a sinister luridness  it was getting cold and the wind was dropping and that was not a favorable sign  pushing the cart through the softer places dragging the jaded pony by the head they hurried on and at last plunged through a creek with the trees just beyond  a few minutes later they tethered the pony to lee of the cart and set up their tent  while blake was rummaging out provisions and harding searching the bluff for dry sticks they heard a beat of hoofs and a man rode up leading a second horse  he got down and hobbled the horses before he turned to blake  from the south  youre for sweetwater he asked  yes  how much farther is it  you ought to make it in a day and a half the stranger said  ill ride in with you  my names gardner  i run a store and hotel at sweetwater but i feel that i want to get out on the prairie now and then and as a horse was missing i went after him  a looker isnt he  the man had a goodhumored sunburned face and an honest look and he gladly acquiesced in blakes suggestion that he join them instead of cooking a separate supper  the prairie was now wrapped in inky gloom and there was an impressive stillness except for the occasional rustle of a leaf but the stillness was broken by a puff of icy wind which suddenly stirred the grass  the harsh rustle it made was followed by a deafening crash and a jagged streak of lightning fell from the leaden clouds then the air was filled with the roar of driving hail  it swept the woods rending leaves and smashing twigs while a constant blaze of lightning flickered about the grass  then the thunder died away and the hail gave place to torrential rain while the slender trees rocked in the blast and small branches drove past the tent where the men crouched inside  after the rain ceased suddenly a fierce red light streamed along the saturated grass from the huge sinking sun  harding with gardners help brought his pile of wood out of the tent and soon made a fire and it was getting dark though a band of transcendental green still burned upon the prairies western edge when they finished supper and sitting round the fire took out their pipes the hobbled horses were quietly grazing near them  thats undoubtedly a fine animal blake observed  is it yours  no it belongs to clarkes englishman  whos he  its a curious way to speak of a fellow  it fits him laughed gardner  guess hes clarkes hide and bonesand thats all therell be when the doctor gets through with him  hes a sucker the doctor taught farming and then sold land to  then whos the doctor harding inquired  thats not so easy to answer but hes a man you want to be friends with if you stay near the settlement  teaches farming to tenderfoot young englishmen and americans finds them land and stock to start withand makes a mighty good thing out of it  goes to montreal now and then but whether its to look up fresh suckers is more than i know  we met a fellow named clarke at the windsor not long ago  whats he like  when gardner described him harding frowned  thats the man he said  then i cant see what he was doing at the windsor an opium joint would have been more in his line  does the fellow live at sweetwater blake asked  has a farmand runs it wellabout three miles back but hes away pretty often in the north and at a settlement on the edge of the bush country  dont know what he does there and theyre a curious crowddubokars russians of sorts i guess  blake had seen the dubokars in other parts of canada and had found them an industrious people leading from religious convictions a remarkably primitive life  there were however fanatics among them and he understood that these now and then led their followers into outbreaks of emotional extravagance  they make good settlers as a rule he commented  but as they dont speak english how does the fellow get on with them  told me he was a philologist when i asked him then he allowed two or three of them were mystics and he was something in that line  he was a doctor once and got fired out of england for something he shouldnt have done  anyhow the dubokars are like the rest of usgood bad and pretty mixedand the crowd back of sweetwater belong to the last at first some of them didnt believe it was right to work horses and made the women drag the plow and they had one or two other habits that brought the police down on them  after that theyve given no trouble but they get on a jag of some kind now and then  blake nodded  he knew that the fanatic with untrained and unbalanced mind is liable under the influence of excitement to indulge in crude debauchery but it was strange that a man of culture such as clarke appeared to be should take part in these excesses  he had however no interest in the fellow and he turned the talk on to other matters until it got cold and they went to sleep  starting early the next morning they reached sweetwater after an uneventful journey and found it by no means an attractive place south of it rolling prairie ran back grayish white with withered grass to the skyline to the north straggling poplar bluffs and scattered jackpines crowned the summits of the ridges  a lake gleamed in a hollow a slow creek wound across the foreground in a deep ravine and here and there in the distance was an outlying farm  a row of houses followed the crest of the ravine some built of small logs and some of shiplap lumber which had cracked with exposure to the sun but all having a neglected and povertystricken air  the land was poor and the settlement was located too far from a market  with leaden thunderclouds hanging over it the place looked as desolate as the sadcolored waste  following the deeply rutted street which had a narrow plank sidewalk they reached the imperial hotela somewhat pretentious doublestoried building of unpainted wood with a veranda across the front  here gardner took the pony from them and gave them a room which had no furniture except a chair and two rickety iron beds  before he left them he indicated a printed list of the things they were not allowed to do  harding studied it with a sardonic smile  i dont see much use in prohibiting people from washing their clothes in the bedrooms when they dont give you any water he remarked this place must be about the limit in the way of cheap hotels  it isnt cheap responded blake ive seen the tariff  they found their supper better than they had reason to expect and afterward sat out on the veranda with the proprietor and one or two of the settlers who boarded at the hotel  the sun had set and now and then a heavy shower beat upon the shingled roof but the western sky was clear and flushed with vivid crimson toward which the prairie rolled away in varying tones of blue  lights shone in the windows behind the veranda and from one which stood open a hoarse voice drifted out singing in a maudlin fashion snatches of an old musichall ditty  its that fool bensonclarkes englishman gardner explained found hed got into my bed with his boots on after falling down in a muskeg  its not the first time hes played that trick when he gets worse than usual he makes straight for my room  why do you give him the liquor harding inquired  i dont  hes a pretty regular customer but he never gets too much at this hotel  and there isnt another  thats so gardner assented but he offered no explanation and blake changed the subject  unless youre fond of farming life in these remote districts is trying he remarked  the loneliness and monotony are apt to break down men who are not used to it  turns some of them crazy and kills off a few said a farmer who appeared to be well educated  after all worse things might happen to them  its conceivable agreed blake  but what particular things were you referring to  i was thinking of men who go to the devil while theyre alive theres a fellow in this neighborhood whos doing something of the kind  rot exclaimed a thick voice and a mans figure appeared against the light at the open window  devilsh a myth allegorolical gentleman everybody knowsh  hard word thatallegorolical  bad word too reminds you of things in the rivers down in florida  must be some in the creek here seen them in my homestead  you go to bed said gardner sternly  nosh a bit replied benson  who you talking to  he leaned forward in danger of falling through the window  lemme out  its not all drink gardner explained  he has something like shakes and ague now and then  says he got it in india  benson disappeared and a few moments afterward reeled out of the door and held himself upright by one of the veranda posts  now im here dont let me interrupt gentlemen he said  nice place if this post would keep still  warned by a sign from gardner the others ignored him and harding turned to the farmer  you hadnt finished what you were saying when he disturbed you  i dont know that it was of much importance speaking of degenerates werent we  we have a curious example of the neurotic here a fellow who makes a good deal of money by victimizing farmers who are forced to borrow when they lose a crop as well as preying on young fools from england and by way of amusement he studies modern magic and indulges in refined debauchery  it strikes me as a particularly unhallowed combination  no sensible man has any use for hoodoo tricks and the people who practise them harding said  theyre frauds from the start  dont know what youre talking about benson broke in  not all tricks  seen funny things in the east thingsh decent men better leave alone  letting go the post he lurched forward and as the light fell on his face blake started  he had been puzzled by something familiar in the voice and now he recognized the man and had no wish to meet him  he was too late in hitching his chair back into the shadow for benson had seen him and stopped with an excited cry  blake of the sappers  want to cut your old friendsh  whatsh you doing here  its a mutual surprise benson blake replied  benson holding on by a chair back smiled at him genially  often wondered where you went to after you left peshawur old man though you got the sack for it it wasnt your fault the ghazees broke our line that night  said so to the colonelcan see him now sitting there looking very sick and cut up and bolsover acting adjutant blinking like an owl  be quiet blake commanded in alarm for the man had been a lieutenant of native infantry when they had met on the hill campaign  benson however was not to be deterred  this gentleman old friend of mine never agreed with solemn old colonel but they wouldnt listen to me  very black night in india ghazees coming yelling up the hill nothing would stop em  rifles cracking nepalese compny busy with the bayonet and in the thick of it the bugle goes  raising a hand to his mouth he gave a shrill imitation of the call to cease firing and then lost his balance and fell over the chair with a crash  leave him to me said gardner seizing the fallen man and with some difficulty lifting him to his feet  after he pushed him through the door there were sounds of a scuffle and a few minutes later gardner came back with a bruise on his face  hes quiet now and the bartender will put him to bed he said  there was silence for the next few moments for the group on the veranda had been impressed by the scene then a man came up the steps he was dressed in old brown overalls and carried a riding quirt but harding recognized him as the man they had met at the hotel in montreal  have you got benson here he asked  sure said gardner  hes left his mark on my cheek  why dont you look after the fool  you must have come pretty quietly i didnt hear you until you were halfway up the steps  light boots clarke answered smiling i bought them from you  i dont know that i need hold myself responsible for benson but i found he wasnt in when i rode past his place and it struck me that he might get into trouble if he got on a jag  he turned and nodded to blake  so you have come up here  i may see you tomorrow but if bensons all right im going home now  he went into the hotel and soon afterward they heard him leave by another door  an hour later when harding and blake were in their room the keen young american brought his fist down on the bedpost with vehemence  i tell you he said theres something queer about that fellow clarkesomething even gardner dont know  i dont like that look thats behind his eyes not in em and the less we see of him i reckon the better     chapter vii  the occult man  after breakfast the next morning blake and harding sat on the veranda talking to the farmer  when they mentioned their first objective point and asked if he could give them any directions for reaching it he looked thoughtful  i only know that its remarkably rough country thick pine bush on rolling ground with some bad muskegs and small lakes he said  you would find things easier if you could hire an indian or two and a canoe when you strike the river  the boys here seldom go up so far but clarke could help you if he liked  he knows that country like a book and he knows the indians  were willing to pay him for any useful help harding said  be careful cautioned the farmer  if youre on a prospecting trip keep your secret close  theres another bit of advice i might give he turned to blake  if youre a friend of bensons take him along with you  i suppose i am in a way though its a long time since i met him but why do you suggest our taking him  i hate to see a man go to pieces as bensons doing  clarkes ruining the fellow  he must have got two or three thousand dollars out of him one way or another and isnt satisfied with that  lent him money on mortgage to start a foolish stockraising speculation and keeps him well supplied with drink  the fellows weak but he has his good points  but whats clarkes object  it isnt very clear  but a man whos seldom sober is easily robbed and bensons place is worth something clarke sees its properly farmed  however you must use your judgment about anything he tells you ive given you warning  the farmer rose as he spoke and when he had left them blake sat silent for a while  though he and benson had never been intimate friends it did not seem fitting to leave him in the clutches of a man who was ruining him in health and fortune  he would rather not have met the man at all but since they had met there seemed to be only one thing to be done  if you dont mind id like to take benson with us he said to harding  the american looked doubtful  we could do with another white man but i guess your friend isnt the kind we want  he may give us trouble and you cant count on much help from a whiskytank  however if you wish it you can bring him  soon afterward benson came out from the diningroom  he was two or three years younger than blake and had a muscular figure but he looked shaky and his face was weak and marked by dissipation  smiling in a deprecatory way he lighted a cigar  im afraid i made a fool of myself last night he said  if i made any unfortunate allusions you must overlook them  you must have seen that i wasnt altogether responsible  i did blake answered curtly  if we are to remain friends youd better understand that i cant tolerate any further mention of the matter you talked about  sorry responded benson giving him a keen glance  though i dont think you have much cause to be touchy about it ill try to remember  then id like you to know my partner mr harding who has agreed to a suggestion im going to make  we want you to come with us on a trip to the northern bush  thanks said benson shaking hands with harding  i wonder what use you think i would be  to tell the truth i havent considered whether you would be of any use or not  the trip will brace you up and you look as if you needed it  bensons face grew red  your intentions may be good but you virtuous and respectable people sometimes show a meddlesome thoughtfulness which degenerates like myself resent  besides i suspect your offer has come too late  i dont think you have much reason for taunting me with being respectable blake answered with a grim smile  anyway i want you to come with us  tilting back his chair benson looked heavily about  when i was new to the country i often wished to go north he said there are caribou and moose up yonder great sights when the rivers break up in the spring and a sled trip across the snow must be a thing to remember  the wilds draw mebut im afraid my nerves not good enough  a man must be fit in every way to cross the timber belt  why arent you fit  why have you let that fellow clarke suck the life and energy out of you as well as rob you of your money  you hit hard but i deserve it and ill try to explain  benson indicated the desolate settlement with a gesture of weariness ugly frame houses straggled weatherscarred and dilapidated along one side of the unpaved street while unsightly refuse dumps disfigured the slopes of the ravine in front  there was no sign of activity but two or three untidy loungers leaned against a rude shack with pool room painted on its dirty windows  all round the rolling prairie stretched back to the horizon washed in dingy drab and gray  the prospect was dreary and depressing  this place benson said grimly hasnt much to offer one in the way of relaxation and for a man used to something different life at a lonely homestead soon loses its charm  unless hes a keen farmer hes apt to go to bits  then why dont you quit harding asked  where could i go  a man with no profession except the one he hasnt the means to follow is not of much use at home and all my money is sunk in my place here  as things stand i cant sell it  he turned to blake  i left the army because a financial disaster for which i wasnt responsible stopped my allowance and i was in debt eventually about two thousand pounds were saved out of the wreck and i came here with that feeling badly hipped  perhaps that was one reason why i took to whisky and clarke who engaged to teach me farming saw that i got plenty of it  now he has his hands on all thats mine but he keeps me fairly supplied with cash and it saves trouble to leave things to him  when benson stopped blake made a sign of comprehension for he knew that somewhat exceptional qualities are required of the man who undertakes the breaking of virgin prairie in the remoter districts  he must have unflinching courage and stubbornness and be able to dispense with all the comforts and amenities of civilized life  no interests are offered him beyond those connected with his task for half the year he must toil unremittingly from dawn till dark and depend upon his own resources through the long bitter winter  for society he may have a hired hand and the loungers in the saloon of the nearest settlement which is often a days ride away and they are not as a rule men of culture or pleasing manners  for the strong in mind and body it is nevertheless a healthful life but benson was not of sufficiently tough fiber  now see here said harding  im out for money and this is a business trip but blake wants to take you and im agreeable  if you can stand for two or three months hard work in the open and very plain living youll feel yourself a match for clarke when you get back  though theres no reason why you should tell a stranger like myself how you stand if youd rather not i know something of business and might see a way out of your difficulties  benson hesitated  he would have resented an attempt to use his troubles as a text for improving remarks for he fully appreciated his failings  what he desired was a means for escaping their consequences and the american seemed to offer it  he began an explanation and with the help of a few leading questions made his financial position fairly clear  well said harding clarke has certainly got a tight hold on you but i guess its possible to shake him on  as things stand however it seems to me he has something to gain by your death  he couldnt count on thatto do the fellow justice hed hardly go so far but theres some truth in what you say  benson looked disturbed and irresolute but after a few moments he abruptly threw his cigar away and leaned forward with a decided air  if youll have me ill go with you  youre wise harding said quietly  shortly afterward benson left them and harding turned to blake  now you had better go along and see if you can learn anything from clarke about our road  hes a rogue but thats no reason we shouldnt make him useful  if he can help us pay him  but be careful what you say  remember that he was watching you at the hotel in montreal and ive a suspicion that he was standing in the shadow near the stairs when benson talked last night  borrowing a saddle blake rode over to clarkes homestead which had a wellkept prosperous look  he found its owner in a small room furnished as an office  files of papers and a large map of the western provinces hung on one wall and clarke was seated at a handsome american desk  he wore old overalls and the soil on his boots suggested that he had been engaged in fall plowing  as blake entered clarke looked up and the light fell on his face  it was deeply lined and of a curious dead color but while it bore a sensual stamp and something in it hinted at cruelty it was blake felt the face of a clever and determined man  ah said clarke  you have ridden over for a talk  glad to see you have a cigar  blake took one and explained his errand  clarke seemed to consider then he took out a small handdrawn map and passed it to his visitor  i wont ask why you are going north as i dare say its a secret however though its too valuable for me to lend it to you this will show you your way through the timber belt  he cleared one end of the desk  sit here and make a note of the features of the country  it took blake some time but he had been taught such work and did it carefully  ill give you a few directions clarke went on and you had better take them down  youll want a canoe and one or two indians  i can enable you to get them but i think the service is worth fifty dollars  id be glad to pay it when we come back blake answered cautiously its possible that we might not find the indians and we might leave the water and strike overland  as you like clarke said with a smile  ill give you the directions before you go  but theres another matter i want to talk about  he fixed his eyes on blake  you are a nephew of colonel challoner  i am but i cant see what connection this has  clarke stopped him  its not an impertinence  hear me out  you were a lieutenant of engineers and served in india where you left the army  that is correct but its not a subject im disposed to talk about  so i imagined clarke said dryly  still id like to say that there is some reason for believing you to be a badly treated man  you have my sympathy  thank you  i must remind you however that i have given you no grounds for offering it  a painful subject  but are you content to quietly suffer injustice  i dont admit an injustice  besides i dont see what you can know about the matteror how it concerns you  a proper line to take with an outsider like myself but i know you were turned out of the army for a fault you did not commit  blakes face set sternly  its hard to understand how you arrived at that flattering conclusion  i wont explain but im convinced of its correctness clarke replied watching him keenly  one would imagine that the most important matter is that you were driven out of a calling you liked and were sent here ruined in repute and fortune  are you satisfied with your lot  havent you the courage to insist on being reinstated  my reinstation would be difficult blake said curtly  it would be at the expense of  blake stopped him with a gesture  he would have left the house only that he was curious to learn where clarkes suggestions led and how much he knew  there was a moments silence and then clarke went on  a young man of ability with means and influence behind him has a choice of careers in england and theres another point to be considered you might wish to marry  that of course is out of the question now  it will no doubt remain so blake replied with the color creeping into his set face  then you have given up all idea of clearing yourself  the thing may be easier than you imagine if properly handled  clarke paused and added significantly in fact i could show you a way in which the matter could be straightened out without causing serious trouble to anybody concerned that is if you are disposed to take me into your confidence  blake got up filled with anger and uneasiness  he had no great faith in hardings scheme his life as a needy adventurer had its trials but he had no intention of changing it  this was an old resolve but it was disconcerting to feel that an unscrupulous fellow was anxious to meddle with his affairs for clarke had obviously implied the possibility of putting some pressure upon colonel challoner  blake shrank from the suggestion it was not to be thought of  i have nothing more to say on the subject he answered sternly  it must be dropped  somewhat to his surprise clarke acquiesced goodhumoredly after a keen glance at him  as you wish  however that neednt prevent my giving you the directions i promised particularly as it may help me to earn fifty dollars  i believe benson spent some time with you this morning are you taking him  blake started  he wondered how the man could have guessed but he admitted that benson was going  you may find him a drag but thats your affair clarke said in a tone of indifference  now sit down and make a careful note of what i tell you  believing that the information might be of service blake did as he was told and then took his leave  when he had gone a curious smile came over clarkes face  blake had firmly declined to be influenced by his hints but clarke had half expected that and he had learned enough about the young mans character to clear the ground for a plan that had formed and grown in his clever mind     chapter viii  trouble  darkness was settling down over the edge of the timber belt that cuts off the prairie from the desolate barrens  in the fading light the straggling wood wore a dreary forbidding look  the spruces were gnarled and twisted by the wind a number of them were dead and many leaned unsymmetrically athwart each other  blake and harding found no beauty in the scene as they wearily led two packhorses through the thin scattered trees with benson lagging a short distance behind  they had spent some time crossing a wide stretch of rolling country dotted with clumps of poplar and birch which was still sparsely inhabited and now they were compelled to pick their way among fallen branches and patches of muskeg for the ground was marshy and their feet sank among the withered needles  blake checked his pony and waited until benson came up  the man moved with a slack heaviness and his face was worn and tense  he was tired with the journey for excess had weakened him and now the lust for drink which he had stubbornly fought had grown overwhelming  i can go no faster  push on and ill follow your tracks he said in a surly tone  it takes time to get into condition and i havent walked much for several years  neither have i harding answered cheerfully  im more used to riding in elevators and streetcars but this sort of thing soon makes you fit  youre not troubled with my complaint benson grumbled and when blake started the pony he deliberately dropped behind  hes in a black mood well leave him to himself harding advised so far hes braced up better than i expected when a mans been tanking steadily its pretty drastic to put him through the total deprivation cure  i wonder blake said thoughtfully whether it is a cure we have both seen men who made some effort to save themselves go down  though im a long way from being a philanthropist i hate this waste of good material  perhaps its partly an economic objection because i used to get savage in india when any of the tommies lives were thrown away by careless handling  it was your soldiers business to be made use of wasnt it  yes but theres a difference between that and the other thing  its the needless waste of life and talent that annoys me  on the frontier we spent men freely so to speak because we tried to get something in returna rebel hill fort seized a raid turned back  if benson had killed himself in breaking a horse or by an accident with a harvesting machine one couldnt complain but to see him do so with whisky is another matter  harding nodded  blake was not given to serious conversation indeed he was rather casual as a rule but harding was shrewd and he saw beneath the surface a love of order and a constructive ability  i guess youre right but your speaking of india reminds me of something i want to mention  ive been thinking over what clarke said to you  his games obvious and it might have been a profitable one he wanted you to help him in squeezing colonel challoner  he knows now that he applied to the wrong man  suppose the fellow goes to work without you  it looks as if hed learned enough to make him dangerous  he can do nothing  let him trump up any plausible theory he likes it wont stand for a moment after i deny it  true agreed harding gravely  but if you were out of the way hed have a free hand  as you wouldnt join him youre a serious obstacle  blake laughed  im glad i am and as i come of a healthy stock theres reason to believe ill continue one  harding said nothing more and they went on in silence through the gathering darkness  the spruces were losing shape and getting blacker though through openings here and there a faint line of smoky red glowed on the horizon  a cold wind wailed among the branches and the thud of the tired horses feet rang dully among the shadowy trunks  reaching a strip of higher ground the men pitched camp and turned out the hobbled horses to graze among the swamp grass that lined a muskeg  after supper they sat beside their fire in silence for a while and then benson took his pipe from his mouth  ive had enough of this and im only a drag on you he said  give me grub enough to see me through and ill start back for the settlement the first thing in the morning  dont be a fool blake replied sharply  youll get harder and feel the march less every day  are you willing to let clarke get hold of you again  oh i dont want to go im driveni cant help myself  blake felt sorry for him  he imagined that benson had made a hard fight but he was being beaten by his craving  still it seemed unwise to show any sympathy  you want to wallow like a hog for two or three days that youll regret all your life he said  you have your chance for breaking free now be a man and take it  hold out a little longer and youll find it easier  benson regarded him with a mocking smile  im inclined to think the jag you so feelingly allude to will last a week that is if i can raise money enough from clarke to keep it up you may not understand that im willing to barter all my future for it  yes said harding grimly we understand all right  yours is not a singular case the trouble is that its too common  but well quit talking about it  you cant go  he was in no mood to handle the subject delicately they were alone in the wilds and the situation made for candor  there was only one way in which they could help the man and he meant to take it  benson turned to him angrily  your permissions not required im a free man  are you harding asked  it strikes me as a very curious boast improving the occasions a riling thing but there was never a slave in the world tighter bound than you  thats an impertinence benson exclaimed with a flush as unsatisfied longing drove him to fury  what business is it of yours to preach to me  confound you who are you  i tell you i wont have it  give me food enough to last until i reach sweetwater and let me go  as he spoke a haughty ring crept into his voice  benson would not have used that tone in his normal state but he belonged by right of birth to a ruling caste and no doubt felt that he had been treated with indignity by a man of lower station  harding however answered quietly  i am a paint factory drummer who has never had the opportunities you have enjoyed but so long as were up here in the wilds the only thing that counts is that were men with the same weaknesses and feelings because thats so and youre hard up against it my partner and i mean to see you through  you cant unless im willing  man dont you realize that talkings of no use  the thing im driven by wont yield to words  whats more to the purpose i didnt engage to go all the way with you  now that ive had enough im going back to the settlement  very well  you were right in claiming that there was no engagement of any kind  so far we have kept you in grub but were not bound to do so and if you leave us you must shift for yourself  there was a tense silence for a moment or two  benson his face marked with baffled desire and scarcely controlled fury glared at the others blakes expression was pitiful but his lips were resolutely set and hardings eyes were very keen and determined  a curious look crept into bensons face and he made a sign of resignation  it looks as if i were beaten he said quietly  i may as well go to sleep  he wrapped his blanket round him and lay down near the fire and soon afterward blake and harding crept into the tent  benson would be warm enough where he lay and they felt it a relief to get away from him  day was breaking when blake rose and threw fresh wood on the fire and as a bright flame leaped up driving back the shadows he saw that benson was missing  this however did not disturb him for the man had been restless and they had now and then heard him moving about at night  when the fire had burned up and he had filled the kettle without seeing anything of his friend he began to grow anxious  he called loudly but there was no answer and he could hear no movement in the bush  the dark spruces had grown sharper in form he could see some distance between the trunks but everything was still  you had better see if the horses are there harding suggested coming out of the tent  blake failed to find them near the muskeg but as the light got clearer he saw tracks leading through the bush  following these for a distance he came upon the indian pony still hobbled but the other a powerful range horse was missing  mounting the pony he rode back to camp where he found harding looking grave  the fellows gone and taken some provisions with him he said  he left this for us  it was a strip of paper apparently torn from a notebook with a few lines expressing bensons regret at having to leave them in such an unceremonious fashion and stating that he would leave the horse hobbled at a spot about two days ride away  he seems to think hes showing us some consideration in not riding the beast down to the settlement blake remarked with a dubious smile feeling strongly annoyed with himself for not taking more precautions with the cunning which the lust for drink breeds in its victims benson had outwitted him by feigning acquiescence  anyway he added ill have to go after him  we must have the horse for one thing but i suppose well lose four days  this is rough on you  yes agreed harding you must go after him but dont mind about me the mans a friend of yours and i like him i wouldnt feel happy if we let him fall back into the clutches of that cunning brute  now well get breakfast youll need it  if you dont mind waiting blake said while they made a hasty meal ill follow him halfway to sweetwater if necessary  you see i havent much expectation of overtaking him before he leaves the horse its faster than the pony and we dont know when he started  thats so  still youre tough and i guess the first hard days ride will be enough for your partner  five minutes later blake was picking his way as fast as possible through the woods  it was a cool morning and when he had gone a few miles the ground was fairly dear  by noon he was in more open country where there were long stretches of grass and after a short rest he pushed on fast  bright sunshine flooded the waste that now stretched back to the south sprinkled with clumps of bush that showed a shadowy blue in the distance  near at hand the birch and poplar leaves glowed in flecks of vivid lemon among the white stems but blake rode hard his eyes turned steadily on the misty skyline  it was broken only by clusters of small trees nothing moved on the wilderness of grass and sand ahead of him  he felt tired when evening came but he pressed on to find water before he camped  benson was a weakling who would no doubt give them further trouble but they had taken him in hand and blake had made up his mind to save him from the rogue who preyed upon his failings  it was getting late when he saw a faint trail of smoke curl up against the sky from a distant bluff and on approaching it he checked the jaded pony  then he dismounted and picketing the animal moved cautiously around the edge of the woods  passing a projecting tongue of smaller brush he saw as he had expected benson sitting beside the fire  blake stopped a moment to watch him  the mans face was weary his pose was slack and it was obvious that the life he had led had unfitted him for a long hard ride  he looked forlorn and dejected but as blake moved forward he roused himself and his eyes had an angry gleam  so you have overtaken me  i thought myself safe from you he exclaimed  you were wrong blake replied quietly  if it had been needful id have gone after you to clarkes  but im hungry and ill cook my supper at your fire  he glanced at the provisions scattered about you havent had much of a meal  its a long drink i want benson growled  blake let this pass  he prepared his supper and offered benson a portion  try some of that he urged indicating the light flapjacks fizzling among the pork in the fryingpan  it strikes me as a good deal more tempting than the stuff you have been eating  benson thrust the food aside and blake ate in silence  then he took out his pipe  now he said you can go to sleep when you wish  youre probably tired and its a long ride back to camp  you seem to count upon my going back with you benson replied mockingly  of course  do you suppose its likely after ive ridden all this way  blake laid down his pipe and leaned forward where the firelight flickered on his face  benson you force me to take a strong line with you  think a moment you have land and stock worth a good deal of money which my partner believes can be saved from the rogue whos stealing it from you  you are a young man and if you pull yourself together and pay off his claims you can sell out and look for another opening wherever you like but you know what will happen if you go on as you are doing a year or two longer  have you no friends or relatives in england to whom you owe something  is your life worth nothing that youre willing to throw it away  oh thats all true benson admitted irritably  do you think i cant see where im drifting  the trouble is that ive gone too far to stop  try persisted blake  its very well worth while  benson was silent for a few moments and then he looked up with a curious expression  youre wasting time dick he said  ive sunk too far  go back in the morning and leave me to my fate  when i go back you are coming with me  bensons nerves were on edge and his selfcontrol broke down  confound you he cried  let me alone  you have reached the limit once for all ill stand no more meddling  very well blake answered quietly  you have left me only one recourse and you cant blame me for taking it  whats that  superior strength  youre a heavier man than i am and ought to be a match for me but you have lost your nerve and grown soft and flabby with drink  its your own doing and now you have to take the consequences  if you compel me ill drag you back to camp with the pack lariat  do you mean that bensons face grew flushed and his eyes glittered  try me and see  savage as he was benson realized that his companion was capable of making good his promise  the man looked hard and very muscular and his expression was determined  this is insufferable he cried  blake coolly filled his pipe  theres no other remedy  before i go to sleep ill picket the horses close beside me and if you steal away on foot during the night ill ride you down a few hours after daybreak  i think you understand me theres nothing more to be said  he tried to talk about other matters but found it hard for benson tormented by his craving made no response  darkness wrapped them about and the prairie was lost in shadow  the leaves in the bluff rustled in a faint cold wind and the smoke of the fire drifted round the men  for a while benson sat moodily watching his companion and then wrapping his blanket round him he lay down and turned away his head  blake sat smoking for a while and then strolled toward the horses and chose a restingplace beside their pickets  waking in the cold of daybreak he saw benson asleep and prepared breakfast before he called him  they ate in silence and then blake led up the pony  i think well make a start he said as cheerfully as he could  for a moment or two benson hesitated standing with hands clenched and baffled desire in his face but blake looked coolly resolute and he mounted     chapter ix  a suspicious move  when benson and blake rode into the camp apparently on good terms with each other harding made no reference to what had occurred  he greeted them pleasantly and soon afterward they sat down to the supper he had been cooking  when they had finished they gathered round the fire with their pipes  a remark was made the other night which struck me as quite warranted benson said  it was pointed out that i had contributed nothing to the cost of this trip  it was very uncivil of harding to mention it blake answered still you see circumstances rather forced him  oh i admit that indeed you might put it more harshly with truth but i want to suggest that you let me take a share in your venture  sorry said harding promptly i cant agree to that  benson sat smoking in silence for a moment  i think i understand he said and i cant blame you  you havent much cause for trusting me  i didnt mean  i know benson interrupted  its my weakness youre afraid of however you must let me pay my share of the provisions and any transport we may be able to get  thats all i insist on now if you feel more confidence in me later i may reopen the other question  he paused and continued with a little embarrassment in his manner you are two good fellows  i think i can promise not to play the fool again  suppose we talk about something else blake suggested  they broke camp early the following morning and benson struggled manfully with his craving during the next week or two which they spent in pushing farther into the forest  it was a desolate waste of small stunted trees many of which were dead and stripped of half their branches while wide belts had been scarred by fire  harding found the unvarying somber green of the needles strangely monotonous but the ground was comparatively clear and the party made progress  then one evening when the country grew more broken they fell in with three returning prospectors  if youll trade your horses we might make a deal said one when they camped together  you cant take them much fartherthe countrys too roughand we could sell them to one of the farmers near the settlements  blake was glad to come to terms  weve been out two months on a general prospecting trip the man informed them  its the toughest country to get through i ever struck  his worn and ragged appearance bore this out and benson looked somewhat dismayed  are there minerals up yonder harding asked  were not in that line its a forest product were looking for  we found indications of gold copper and one or two other metals besides petroleum but we didnt see anything that looked worth taking up  considering the cost of transport you want to strike it pretty rich before what you find will pay as a business proposition  so i should imagine  petroleums a cheap product to handle when youre a long way from a market isnt it  give us plenty of it and well make a market  its an idea of mine that theres no part of this country that hasnt something worth working in it if you can get cheap fuel  where the lands too poor for farming you often find minerals and ore that wont pay for transport can be reduced on the spot so long as you have natural resources that can be turned into power  with an oil well in good flow wed soon start some profitable industry and put up a city that would bring a railroad in  show our business men a good opening and youll get the money  and there are men across the frontier who have a mighty keen scent for oil  have you done much prospecting harding asked  the man smiled  whenever i can get money enough for an outfit i go off on the trail theres a fascination in the thing that gets hold of youyou cant tell what you may strike and the prizes are big  however ill admit that after seven or eight years of it im poorer than when i started at the game  blake made a sign of comprehension  he knew the sanguine nature of the westerner and his belief in the richness of his country and he himself had felt the call of the wilderness  there was in truth a fascination in the silent waste that drew the adventurous into its rugged fastnesses that a number of them did not come back seldom deterred the others  we want to get as far north as the timber limit if we can harding said  i understand that there are no hudson bay factories near our line but we were told we might find some stony indians  theres one bunch of them the prospector replied  they ramble about after fish and furs but theyve a kind of basecamp where a few generally stop  theyre a mean crowd and often short of food but if theyve been lucky you might get supplies  now and then they put up a lot of dried fish and kill some caribou  he told blake roughly where the indian encampment lay and after talking for a while they went to sleep  the next morning the prospectors took the horses and started for the south while blakes party pushed on north with loads that severely tried their strength after a few days laborious march they reached a stream and found a few indians who were willing to take them some distance down it  it was a relief to get rid of the heavy packs and rest while the canoe glided smoothly through the straggling forest and the labor of hauling her across the numerous portages was light compared with the toil of the march  blake however had misgivings  they were making swift progress northward but it would be different when they came back  rivers and lakes would be frozen then  that might make traveling easier if they could pick up the hand sleds they had cached but there was a limit to the provisions they could transport and unless fresh supplies could be obtained they would have a long distance to traverse on scanty rations in the rigors of the arctic winter  after a day or two the indians who were going no farther landed them and they entered a belt of very broken country across which they must push to reach a larger stream  the ground was rocky pierced by ravines and covered with clumps of small trees  there were stony tracts across which they painfully picked their way steep ridges to be clambered over and belts of quaggy muskeg they must skirt  benson however gave them no trouble the man was getting hard and was generally cheerful and when he had an occasional fit of moroseness as he fought with the longing that tormented him they left him alone still at times they were daunted by the rugged sternness of the region they were steadily pushing through and the thought of the long return journey troubled them  one night when it was raining they sat beside their fire in a desolate gorge  a cold wind swept between the thin spruce trunks that loomed vaguely out of the surrounding gloom as the red glare leaped up and wisps of acrid smoke drifted about the camp  there was a lake up the hollow and now and then the wild and mournful cry of a loon rang out  the men were tired and somewhat dejected as they sat about the blaze with their damp blankets round them  a silence had fallen upon them but suddenly blake looked up startled  what was that he exclaimed  the others could hear nothing but the sound of running water and the wail of the wind  since leaving the indians they had seen no sign of life and believed that they were crossing uninhabited wilds  blake could not tell what had suddenly roused his attention but in former days he had developed his perceptive faculties by close night watching on the indian frontier where any relaxing of his vigilance might have cost his life  something he thought was moving in the bush and he felt uneasy  a stick cracked and harding called out as a shadowy figure appeared on the edge of the light  blake laughed but his uneasiness did not desert him when he recognized clarke  the fellow was not to be trusted and he had come upon them in a startling manner  i suppose you are surprised to see me clarke said moving coolly forward and sitting down by the fire  we are harding answered briefly  bensons face wore a curious strained expression but he did not speak  well clarke laughed as he filled his pipe i dare say i made a rather dramatic entrance falling upon you so to speak out of the dark  ive a suspicion that you enjoy that kind of thing harding said youre a man with the dramatic feeling guess you find it useful now and then  clarkes eyes twinkled but it was not with wholesome humor  his eyes were keen but he looked old and forbidding as he sat with the smoke blowing about him and the ruddy firelight on his face  theres some truth in your remark and i take it as a compliment but my arrivals easily explained  i saw your fire in the distance and curiosity brought me along  what are you doing up here  going on a visit to my friends the stonies  though its a long way i look them up now and then  from what ive heard of them they dont seem a very attractive lot blake interposed  but we havent offered you any supper  benson you might put on the fryingpan  no thanks said clarke  im camped with two halfbreeds a little way back  the stonies as you remark are not a polished set but were on pretty good terms and its their primitiveness that makes them interesting  you can learn things civilized men dont know much about from these people  in my opinion its knowledge thats not worth much to a white man harding remarked contemptuously  guess you mean the secrets of their medicinemen  what isnt gross superstition is trickery  there you are wrong  they have some tricks rather clever ones though thats not unusual with the professors of a more advanced occultism but living as they do in direct contact with nature in her most savage mood they have found clues to things that we regard as mysteries  anyway they have discovered a few effective remedies that arent generally known yet to medical science  he spoke with some warmth and had the look of a genuine enthusiast but harding laughed  medical science hasnt much to say in favor of hoodoo practises so far as i know  but i understand you are a doctor  i was pretty well known in london  then harding asked bluntly what brought you to sweetwater  if you havent heard i may as well tell you because the thing isnt a secret at the settlement clarke turned and his eyes rested on blake  im by no means the only man who has come to canada under a cloud  there was a famous policecourt affair that i figured in nothing was proved against me but my practise afterward fell to bits as a matter of fact i was absolutely innocent of the offense  i had acted without much caution out of pity and laid myself open to an attack that was meant to cover the escape of the real criminal  blake thought he spoke the truth and he felt some sympathy but clarke went on  in a few weeks i was without patients or friends driven out from the profession i loved and in which i was beginning to make my mark  it was a blow that i never altogether recovered from and the generous impulse which got me into trouble was the last that i ever yielded to  his face changed growing hard and malevolent and blake now felt strangely repelled  it looked as if the man had been soured by his misfortunes and had turned into an outlaw who took a vindictive pleasure in making such reprisals as he found possible upon society at large  this conclusion was borne out by what blake had learned at the settlement  no one made any comment and there was silence for a few minutes while the smoke whirled about the group and the drips from the dark boughs above fell upon the brands  then after a little casual talk clarke rose to go  i shall start at daybreak and your way lies to the east of mine he said  youll find traveling easier when the snow comes  i wish you good luck  though the loneliness of the wilds had now and then weighed upon them they all felt relieved when he left  after benson went to sleep blake and harding continued talking for a while  thats a man well have to watch the american declared  i suppose it struck you that he made no attempt to get your friend back  i noticed it  he may have thought it wouldnt succeed and didnt wish to show his hand  benson already looks a different man i saw clarke studying him  he could have drawn him away by the sight of a whisky flask or a hint of a jag in camp  my opinion is that he didnt want him  thats curious said blake  he seems to have stuck to benson pretty closely no doubt with the object of fleecing him and you think hes not altogether ruined yet  if what he told me is correct there are still some pickings left on him  i dont suppose the explanation is that clarke has some conscience and feels that he has robbed him enough  harding laughed  he has about as much pity as a hungry wolf in fact to my mind hes the more dangerous brute because ive a feeling that he delights in doing harm  theres something cruel about the man getting fired out of his profession must have warped his nature  then there was another point that struck mewhys he going so far to stay with those indians  its puzzling blake answered thoughtfully  he hinted that he was interested in their superstitions and i think there was some truth in it  meddling with these things seems to have a fascination for neurotic people and as the fellows a sensualist he may find some form of indulgence that wouldnt be tolerated near the settlements  all this however doesnt quite seem to account for the thing  ive another idea said harding  clarkes known as a crank and he takes advantage of it to cover his doings  at first i thought of the whisky trade but taking up prohibited liquor would hardly be worth his while though i dare say he has some with him to be used for gaining his indian friends good will  hes on the trail of something and its probably minerals  what the prospector told us suggested it to me  you may be right  anyway it doesnt seem to concern us  well said harding gravely im troubled about his leaving benson alone  the fellow had some good reasoni wish i knew  he rose to throw more wood on the fire and they changed the subject     chapter x  the muskeg  a fortnight later the party entered a hollow between two low ranges the hills receded as they progressed the basin widened and grew more difficult to traverse for the ground was boggy and thickly covered with small rotting pines  every here and there some had fallen and lay in tangles among pools of mire  a sluggish creek wound through the hollow and the men had often to cross it and as they plodded through the morass they found their loads intolerably heavy  still clarkes directions had plainly indicated this valley as their road and they stubbornly pushed on camping where they could find a dry spot  they were wet to the waist and their temper began to give way under the strain  when they lay down in damp clothes beside the fire at nights blake was annoyed to find his sleep disturbed by a touch of malarial fever  he had suffered from it in india and now it had attacked him again in his weakened condition due to the hardships of the march  sometimes he was too hot and sometimes he lay awake shivering for hours  saying nothing to his companions however he patiently trudged on though his head throbbed and he was conscious of a depressing weakness  the ground grew softer as they proceeded  the creek no longer kept within its banks but spread in shallow pools and the rotting trees were giving place to tall grass and reeds  the valley had turned into very wet muskeg  it was shut in by hills whose rocky sides were seamed by ravines and covered with banks of stones and short brush through which it was almost impossible to force a passage  after making several attempts to get out of the valley the men plodded on through the muskeg tramping down the wiry grass often stumbling over a partly submerged treetrunk  then one day blake felt his head reel  he staggered and dropped down heavily  sorry he mumbled  malaria  his companions gazed at him in dismay  his face was flushed his eyes glittered and he lay limply among the grass  he looked seriously ill harding realizing that the situation must be grappled with resolutely pulled himself together  you cant lie there the grounds too wet he said  its drier on yonder hummock and well have to get you across to it  if you can stand up and lean on us well fix you comfortably in camp in a few minutes  blake did not move  instead he lay gazing up at them and mumbling to himself  with much trouble they got him to a small stony knoll where they made a fire and spread their blankets on a bundle of reeds for him to lie on  then he spoke in a faint and listless voice  thanks  i think ill go to sleep  ill feel better tomorrow  he fell asleep but his rest was broken for he moved his limbs and muttered now and then  it was a heavy gray afternoon with a cold wind rippling the leaden pools and rustling the reeds and the watchers felt dejected and alarmed  neither had any medical knowledge and they were a very long way from the settlements  rocky hillsides and wet muskegs which they could not cross with a sick companion shut them off from all help  their provisions were not plentiful and the rigorous winter would soon set in  they scarcely spoke to each other as the afternoon wore away  when supper time came harding roused blake and tried to give him a little food  he could not eat however and soon sank again into a restless sleep  his companions sat disconsolately beside the fire as night closed in  their clothes were damp and splashed with mud for they had had to cross a patch of very soft muskeg to gather wood among a clump of rotting spruces  the wind was searching the reeds clashed and rustled drearily and even the splash of the ripples on a neighboring pool was depressing  as in turn they kept watch in the darkness their hearts sank  the next morning blake was obviously worse  he insisted irritably that he would be all right again in a day or two but the others felt dubious  how often must i tell you that the thing will wear off he said you neednt look so glum  i thought i was looking pretty cheerful harding objected with a forced laugh  anyway ive been working off my best stories for the last hour and i really think that one about the cincinnati man  you overdo the thing blake interrupted crossly and the way benson grins at your threadbare jokes would worry me if i were well  do you suppose im a fool and dont know what you think he raised himself on his elbow speaking angrily  try to understand that this is merely common malaria  ive had it several times but it doesnt bother you when youre out of the tropics  why bertramvery good fellow bertram sos his father  if anybody speaks against my cousin let him look out for me  he paused a moment looking around him dazedly  getting off the subject wasnt i  cant think with this pain in my head and back but dont worry  leave me alone ill soon be on my feet again  lying down he turned away from them and during the next few hours he dozed intermittently  late in the afternoon an indian reached the camp  he carried a dirty blue blanket and a few skins and was dressed in ragged white mens clothes  in a few words of broken english he made them understand that he was tired and short of food and they gave him a meal  when he had finished it they fell into conversation and benson who understood him best told harding that he had been trapping in the neighborhood  his tribe lived some distance off and though there were some stonies not far away he would not go to them for supplies  they were he said quarrelsome people  harding looked interested  ask the fellow where the village is  when benson had interpreted the indians answer harding lighted his pipe and thought keenly for a long time  rain had begun to fall and though they had built a rude shelter of earth and stones to keep off the wind in place of the tent which had been abandoned to save weight the raw damp seemed to reach their bones  it was not the place for a fever patient and harding was getting anxious  he had led his comrade into the adventure and he felt responsible for him moreover he had a strong affection for the helpless man  blake was very ill and something must be done to save him but for a while harding could not see how help could be obtained  then an idea crept into his mind and he got benson to ask the indian a few more questions about the locality  when they were answered he began to see his way but he waited until supper was over before he spoke of his plan  it was getting dark and raining hard  blake was asleep the indian sitting silent and the fire crackled noisily throwing up a wavering light against the surrounding gloom  i suppose i neednt consider you a friend of clarkes harding began  theres no reason why i should feel grateful to him though i cant blame him for all my misfortunes benson replied  that clears the ground  well it must have struck you that clarkes account of the whereabouts of the stony camp doesnt agree with what the prospectors and this indian told us  he fixed the locality farther west and a good deal farther off from where we are now  looks as if he didnt want us to reach the place  hes a scheming brute but i cant see his object in deceiving us  well leave that point for a minute  you must admit its curious that when we asked him for the easiest way he sent us through these hills and muskegs particularly as you have learned from the indian that we could have got north with much less trouble had we headed farther west  that has an ugly look benson answered thoughtfully  well im going to put the thing before you as i see it  clarke has lent you money and has a claim on your homestead which will increase in value as the settlement growsand sooner or later they are bound to bring in a railroad  now after what you once told me i dont think theres any reason why you shouldnt pay him off in a year or two if you keep steady and work hard but while you were in his clutches that looked very far from probable  you might have put it more plainlyi was drinking myself to death bensons face grew stern  you suggest that that is what the fellow wished  you can form your own opinion  my point is that it would suit him if you didnt come back from this trip  with nobody to dispute his statements hed prove he had a claim to all you own  benson started  i believe he would stick at nothing  but im only one of the party what would he gain if you and blake came to grief  that said harding evasively is not so clear  he glanced at his companion searchingly and seeing that he suspected nothing he decided not to enlighten him  benson seemed to have overcome his craving but there was a possibility that he might relapse after his return to the settlement and betray the secret in his cups harding thought clarke a dangerous man of unusual ability and abnormal character  he had learned from benson something of blakes history and had seen a chance for extorting money from colonel challoner indeed clarke had made overtures to blake on the subject with the pretext of wishing to ascertain whether the latter were willing to seek redress and had met with an indignant rebuff  this much was a matter of fact but harding surmised that the man finding blake more inclined to thwart than assist him would be glad to get rid of him  with blake out of the way the challoners father and son would be at clarkes mercy and it unfortunately looked as if his wishes might be gratified harding meant however to make a determined effort to save his comrade  i dont understand what youre leading up to benson remarked  its thisi suspect clarke intended us to get entangled among these muskegs where wed have no chance for renewing our provisions and he misled us about the stony village which he didnt wish us to reach well he has succeeded in getting us into trouble now he has to help us out  the fellow is a doctor  benson looked up eagerly  youre going to bring him here  its a daring plan because it will be difficult to make him come  hell come it he values his life harding said resolutely  the indian will take me to the village and perhaps see me through if i offer him enough he seems to have some grudge against the stonies ill have to drop in upon the doctor late at night when none of his indian friends are about  but wholl look after blake  he cant be left  thats your part  youd run more risk than i would and im his partner  id hate to stay benson protested  you know how im indebted to blake  its your place harding insisted  try to arrange the thing with the indian  it took some time but the man proved amenable  he frankly owned that he would not have ventured near the stony camp alone because of some quarrel between its inhabitants and his tribe originating benson gathered over a dispute about trapping grounds but he was ready to accompany the white man if the latter went well armed  all right thats settled  we start at daybreak said harding ill lie down now its your watch  five minutes later he was sound asleep and awoke quietly determined and ready for the march in the cold of dawn  he was a man of the cities bred to civilized life but he had a just appreciation of the risks attached to his undertaking  he meant to abduct the doctor who himself was dangerous to meddle with from an indian village where he apparently was held in great esteem  the stonies living far remote had escaped the chastening influence of an occasional visit from the patrols of the northwest police they knew nothing of law and order moreover there was a possibility that clarke might prove too clever for his abductor  it was certainly a strange adventure for a business man but harding believed that his comrade would perish unless help could be obtained he shook hands with benson who wished him a sincere goodluck and then with the indian leading struck out through the muskeg toward the shadowy hills     chapter xi  kidnapped  harding had cause to remember the forced march he made to the stony village  the light was faint and the low ground streaked with haze as they floundered through the muskeg sinking deep in the softer spots and splashing through shallow pools  when they reached the first hill bench he was hot and breathless and their path led sharply upward over banks of ragged stones which had a trick of slipping down when they trod on them  it was worse where the stones were large and they stumbled into the hollows between  then they struggled through short pinescrub crawled up a wet gorge where thick willows grew and afterward got entangled among thickets of thorny canes  hardings clothes were badly torn and his boots giving out his breath was labored and his heart beat painfully but he pressed on upward without slackening his pace for he knew there was no time to be lost  it was exhausting toil and trying to the man who until he entered that grim country had undergone no physical training and had seldom tried his muscles being left to shift for himself at an unusually early age had prevented his even playing outdoor games  his career had been a humble one but it had taught him selfreliance and when he was thrown into the company of men brought up in a higher station he was not surprised that they accepted him as an equal and a comrade  there was however nothing assertive in the man he knew his powers and their limitations  now he clearly recognized that he had undertaken a big thing but the need was urgent and he meant to see it through  he was of essentially practical temperament a man of action and it was necessary that he should keep up with his indian guide as long as possible  therefore he braced himself for the arduous task  in the afternoon they reached a tableland where traveling was slightly easier but when they camped without a fire among the rocks one of hardings feet was bleeding and he was very weary  walking was painful for the first hour after they started again at dawn but after walking a while his galled foot troubled him less and he doggedly followed the indian up and down deep ravines and over rough stony slopes  then they reached stunted timber thickly massed tangled pines with many dead trees among them a number which had fallen barring the way  the indian seemed tireless harding could imagine his muscles having been toughened into something different from ordinary flesh and blood  he was feeling great distress but for the present there was only one thing for him to do and that was to march  he saw it clearly with his shrewd sense and though his wornout body revolted his resolution did not flinch  they forced a way through thickets they skirted precipitous rocks passed clusters of ragged pines and plunged down ravines  in the afternoon the sun was hot and when it got low a cold wind buffeted them as they crossed the height of land  hardings side ached and his feet were bleeding but the march went on  just before dark there opened up before them a wide valley fading into the blue distance with water shining in its midst and gray blurs of willows here and there  however it faded swiftly and harding found himself limping across a stony ridge into a belt of drifting mist  half an hour afterward he threw himself down exhausted beside a fire in a sheltered hollow  late at night they stopped a few minutes to listen and look about on the outskirts of the indian village  thick willows stretched up to it with mist that moved before a light wind drifting past them and the blurred shapes of conical tepees showed dimly through the vapor  the night was dark but still and harding knew that a sound would carry some distance  he felt his heart beat tensely but there was nothing to be heard  he had seen dogs about the indian encampments farther south and he was afraid now of hearing a warning bark but nothing broke the silence and he concluded that clarkes friends were unable to find food enough for sledteams  this was reassuring because the odds against him were heavy enough knowing as he did that the indians sense of hearing is remarkably keen  making certain that his magazine pistol was loose he motioned to his guide and they moved cautiously forward  the ground was fortunately clear and their footsteps made little noise though now and then tufts of dry grass which harding trod upon rustled with what seemed to him alarming distinctness  still nobody challenged them and creeping up to the center of the village they stopped again  the nearest of the tepees was only thirty or forty yards away though others ran back into the mist  as harding stood listening with tingling nerves he clearly recognized the difficulty of his enterprise  in the first place there was nothing to indicate which tent clarke occupied and it was highly undesirable that harding should choose the wrong one and rouse an indian from his slumbers  then it was possible that the man shared a tepee with one of his hosts in which case harding would place himself at the indians mercy by entering it  clarke was a dangerous man and his stony friends were people with rudimentary ideas and barbarous habits  harding glanced at his guide but the man stood very still and he could judge nothing about his feelings from his attitude  fortune favored them for as harding made toward a tepee without any particular reason for doing so except that it stood a little apart from the others he saw a faint streak of light shine out beneath the curtain  this suggested that it was occupied by the white man and it was now an important question whether he could reach it silently enough to surprise him  beckoning the indian to fall behind he crept forward with his heart beating painfully and stopped a moment just outside the entrance  it was obvious that he had not been heard but he could not tell whether clarke was alone  then the indian creeping silently up behind him dragged the doorway open  harding jumped quickly through the entrance and stood ragged unkempt and strung up blinking in the unaccustomed light  the tent had an earth floor with a layer of reeds and grass thrown down on one side  it was frail and hinted at changing times and poverty for the original skin cover had been patched and eked out with the products of civilization in the shape of cotton flourbags and old sacking  in the later repairs sewing twine had been used instead of sinews  a wooden case stood open near the reeds and harding saw that it contained glass jars and what looked like laboratory apparatus a common tin kerosene lamp hung from the junction of the frame poles which met at the point of the cone  a curious smell which reminded him of the paint factory filled the tent though he could not recognize it  as harding entered clarke looked up from where he was bending over the case  it was harding thought a good test of his nerve but his face was imperturbable and he showed no surprise  there was silence for a moment while the indian stood motionless with his ax shining as it caught the light and hardings lips grew firmly set  then clarke spoke  so you have turned back  you found the muskeg too difficult to cross i suppose this fellow showed you the way here  harding felt worn out he crossed the floor to the heap of reeds and sat down facing clarke  we have come for you he announced abruptly and we must start at once  my partner is very sickfeverand youll have to cure him  clarke laughed without mirth  youre presuming on my consent  yes said harding sternly im counting right on that  it wouldnt be wise of you to refuse  i dont agree with you  a shout or a shot would bring in my friends and youd find yourself in a very unpleasant position  you had better understand that nobody troubles about what goes on up hereand i believe im a person of some influence he indicated hardings guide i dont know what this fellows doing in this neighborhood but he belongs to a tribe the stonies have a grudge against  on the whole i think you have been somewhat rash  i guess youre clever enough to see that since ive taken a lot of chances in coming im not likely to be bluffed off now  but well let that go  the most important thing is that blake will die unless he gets proper treatmentand gets it mighty soon  clarke regarded him with a mocking smile  its a matter of indifference to me whether blakes dies or not  oh no said harding  on the whole you would rather he did die hes in the way  he could not tell whether this shot had reached the mark for though clarkes eyes were steadily fixed on him the mans face was inscrutable  if youre right it seems strange that you should urge me to prescribe for him  there are precautions i mean to take harding informed him dryly however i havent come here to argue  for reasons of your own you sent us into a belt of country which you thought we couldnt possibly get through  you expected us to be held up there until our provisions ran out and winter set in when these stonies would no doubt have moved on  well part of what you wished has happened but the matter is taking a turn you couldnt have looked for  you led us into difficultiesand now youre going to get us out  i guess delay means danger  get ready to start  the indian raised his hand in warning  footsteps approached the tepee with something strangely stealthy in their tread and clarke turning his head listened with a curious expression  then he looked at harding and as the steps drew nearer the americans lips set tight his pose grew tense but it was more expressive of determination than alarm  for a few moments none of the party moved and then the attitude of all relaxed as the footsteps passed and grew indistinct  clarke broke into a faint smile  that was not an ordinary stony but a gentleman of my profession with similar interests going about his business  there are reasons why he should undertake it in the dark  you were right in supposing that you were in some dangerand the danger isnt over  harding felt a shiver  he had the repugnance of the healthy minded man of affairs from any form of meddling with what he vaguely thought of as the occult but in that remote grim solitude he could not scoff at it  understand this he said curtly  i mean to save my partner ive staked my life on doing so  but ive said enough  youre coming with menowand if you make any attempt to rouse your friends youll have a chance to learn something about the other world at first hand a few seconds afterward  clarke saw that it was not an idle threat  the american meant what he said and he hurriedly put a few things together and made them into a pack  then he turned to harding with a gesture of ironical resignation  im ready  the indian laid a firm hand on his arm and harding took out his pistol and extinguished the lamp  your interest in keeping quiet is as strong as mine he sternly reminded clarke  he set his teeth as they passed a tepee at a few yards distance  he could see the dark gap of the doorway and had a nervous fancy that eyes were following his movements for now that he had succeeded in the more difficult part of his errand he was conscious of strain  indeed he feared that he might grow limp with the reaction and the danger was not yet over  unless they reached camp in the next few days he thought blake would die and the journey was a long and arduous one still he was determined that if disaster overtook him the plotter who had betrayed them should not escape  harding was a respecter of law and social conventions but now under heavy stress he had suddenly become primitive  they approached the only remaining tepee  the tension on hardings nerves grew severe  as the indian holding tightly to their prisoners arm picked his way noiselessly past the open flap clarke made a queer noisehalf cough half sneezevery low but loud enough to be heard by any one in the tent  like a flash harding threw up his pistol ready for use  as he did so his foot tripped on a broken bottle lying in front of the dark entrance  the pistol did not go off but harding trying wildly to regain his balance fell with a crash against the tepee     chapter xii  the fever patient  when harding scrambled to his feet with his pistol still aimed clarke laughed  youre not only very rashand very clumsybut youre lucky  thats the only vacant tepee in the whole village  and my friends dont seem to have heard you  they moved on very quickly and cautiously and when they reached the thick willow bluff where they were comparatively safe harding felt easier  it was noon when they stumbled into camp harding ragged and exhausted and clarke limping after him in an even more pitiable state  the doctor had suffered badly from the hurried march but his conductor would brook no delay and the grim hints he had been given encouraged him to put forth his utmost exertion  blake was alive but when harding bent over him he feared that help had come too late  his skin looked harsh and dry his face had grown hollow and his thick strong hair had turned lank and was falling out his eyes were vacant and unrecognizing when he turned them upon harding  heres your patient the american said to clarke  we expect you to cure him and you had better get to work at once  then his face grew troubled as he turned to benson  how long has he been like that he asked  the last two days  im afraid hes very bad  harding sat down with a smothered groan  every muscle seemed to ache he could scarcely hold himself upright and his heart was very heavy he would miss blake terribly  it was hard to think of going on without him but he feared that this was inevitable  he was filled with a deep pity for the helpless man but after a few moments his weary face grew stern  he had done all that he was able and now clarke whom he believed to be a man of high medical skill must do his part  if he were unsuccessful it would be the worse for him  did you have much trouble benson asked as he laid out a meal  no i suppose i was fortunate because the thing was surprisingly easy  of course clarke did not want to come  i dont see how you overcame his objections  harding broke into a dry smile  in the kind of game i played with the doctor your strength depends on how much youre willing to lose and i put down all i had upon the table  that beat him because he wasnt willing to stake as much  you mean your life  of course i know you were in some danger but was it so serious  it would have been if id shot him and i think he saw i meant that whats more i may have to do so yet  hardings tone was quietly matter of fact but benson no longer wondered at clarkes submission  he had been a soldier and had faced grave risks but he was inclined to think that even before he had weakened it by excess his nerve had never been so good as this young americans  well he said im fond of blake and i recognize my debt to him we were once comrades in an adventure that was more dangerous than this but im not sure that id have been ready to go as far as you  in a way though you were quite justified the fellow no doubt set a trap for us  but if hes to have a fair chance we had better give him something to eat  if hes as hungry as you are he needs it  he called clarke to join them by the fire  weariness had deepened the lines on the doctors face and there were puffy pouches under his eyes  he was obviously exhausted and scarcely able to move but there was something malignant in his look  he ate greedily without speaking and then glanced up at the others  well benson asked whats your opinion  your friends state is dangerous  how he came to suffer from a severe attack of malaria in this bracing climate i cant determine and after all its not an important point  he cant live much longer at his present temperature  and the remedy  one of two is indicated and the choice is difficult because both are risky  then theyre risky to you as well as to your patient harding grimly reminded him  clarke made a contemptuous gesture which was not without a touch of dignity  his manner now was severely professional  one course would be to put him into the coldest water we can find its drastic treatment and sometimes effective but theres a strong probability of its killing him  you had better mention the other  the administration of a remedy of my own which ill admit few doctors would venture to use  its almost as dangerous as the first course and in case of success recovery is slower  harding pondered this for a moment or two  he distrusted the man and believed he would feel no compunction about poisoning blake should he consider it safe to do so but he thought he had convinced him of the contrary  i must leave you to decide but i warn you that ill hold you responsible if the results unfortunate  if you doubt my professional skill or good faith why do you put your partner in my charge  i have some confidence in your sense of selfinterest harding answered  youll serve the latter best by curing blake  clarke gave him a curious glance  ill try the draught and it had better be done now he said  there is no time to lose  he moved toward blake who lay with halfclosed eyes breathing with apparent difficulty and making feeble restless movements  stooping beside him he took out a very small bottle and carefully let a few drops fall into a spoon  with some trouble he got the sick man to swallow them and then he sat down and turned to harding  i cant predict the result  we must wait an hour then i may be able to form some opinion  harding lighted his pipe and though he found it strangely hard to sit still he smoked steadily  his mouth grew dry with the strain he was bearing but he refilled the pipe as it emptied and bit savagely on its stem crushing the wood between his teeth  there was so far as he could see no change in blake and he was stirred by a deep pity and a daunting sense of loneliness  he knew now that he had grown to love the man blakes quick resourcefulness had overcome many of the obstacles they had met with his whimsical humor had lightened the toilsome march and often when they were wet and worn out be had banished their dejection by a jest  now it looked as if they would hear his cheerful laugh no more and harding felt that if the worst came he would in a sense be accountable for his partners death  it was his sanguine expectations that had drawn blake into the wilds  benson seemed to find the suspense equally trying but he made no remark and there was nothing to be learned from clarkes impassive face  harding could only wait with all the fortitude he could muster but he long remembered that momentous hour  they were all perfectly still there was no wind a heavy gray sky overhung them and the smoke of the fire went straight up  the gurgle of running water came softly through the silence  at last when harding felt the tension becoming unendurable clarke glanced at his watch and reopened the small bottle  well try again he said gravely and harding thought he detected anxiety in his tone  the dose was given and harding feeling the urgent need of action if he were to continue calm got up and wandered about the muskeg  coming back after a while he looked at clarke  the doctor merely shook his head though his face now showed signs of uneasiness  harding sat down again and refilled his pipe noticing that the stem was nearly bitten through  he gathered from clarkes expression that they would soon know what to expect and he feared the worst  now however he was growing cool his eyes were very stern and his lips had set in an ominously determined fashion  benson glancing at him once or twice thought it boded trouble for the doctor if things went badly  the american had a ruthless air  at last clarke moving silently but quickly bent over his patient felt his pulse and listened to his breathing  harding leaned forward eagerly  blake seemed less restless his face which had been furrowed was relaxing there was a faint damp on it  he moved and sighed and then turning his head weakly he closed his eyes  a few moments later clarke stood up stretching out his arms with a gesture of deep weariness  i believe your partner has turned the corner he said he must sleep as long as he is able  harding crept away conscious of a relief so overpowering that he was afraid he might do something foolish and disturb his comrade if he remained  scarcely noticing where he was going he plunged into the swamp and plowed through it smashing down the reeds and splashing in the pools  quick movement was balm to his rawedged nerves for the suspense of the last two hours had tried him very hard  when he returned to camp rather wet and muddy clarke was sitting by his patients side and harding saw that blake was sleeping soundly with a sense of thankfulness too deep for expression he set about preparing the evening meal  now he could eat with appetite  before he and benson had finished their supper clarke joined them  i believe the worst dangers over he said though theres a possibility of a relapse  hell need careful attention for several days  longer i think said harding  anyhow youll have to make up your mind to stay while it strikes us as necessary  my times valuable and you run some risk in keeping me  you must recognize that theres a strong likelihood that the stonies will pick up my trail  if they get here theyll run up against all the trouble theyll have any use for harding replied  however i told our guide who seems pretty smart at such matters to take precautions and i understand that he fixed things so it would be hard to follow our tracks  you may remember that he took us across all the bare rocks he could find and made us wade up a creek  besides as you seem to have played on your friends superstitions they may not find anything remarkable in your disappearing mysteriously  youre a capable man clarke laughed  anyway i find this case appeals to my professional interest  for one thing its curious that the malaria should attack him in a severe form after a lengthy absence from the tropical jungles where he caught it  by the way how long is it since he left india  harding shrewdly returned an evasive answer  he did not think it desirable that clarke should learn too much about his comrades connection with india  i cant fix the date but its some time  however i understand he was afterward in an unhealthy part of africa which may account for it i dont think hes been in this country more than a year or two  did he ever speak of having malaria here  it is apt to return within a rather elastic period  not so far as i can recollect said harding  seeing that he could extract no useful information from him clarke abandoned the attempt and discussed the case from a medical point of view  then he rose wearily  as were not out of the wood yet and i dont expect ill be needed for a while id better get some sleep he said  you must waken me if theres any sign of a change  drawing his blanket round him he lay down on a bed of branches and reeds and his deep regular breathing soon indicated that he was asleep  harding looked at benson  i guess hell do all thats possible for his own sake  it strikes me hes a pretty good doctor  i understand that he once promised to become a famous one benson replied  though i left you to deal with the matter i kept my eye on him and my idea is that while he wouldnt have scrupled much about letting blake die if it had suited his purpose as soon as you showed him the danger of that course his professional feelings came uppermost  in fact i believe blake couldnt have got better treatment in montreal or london  now that the fellow has taken his case up hell effect a cure  but ill keep the first watchyou need a rest  in a few minutes harding was fast asleep and when he relieved benson late at night he found clarke at his post  shortly afterward blake opened his eyes and asked a few intelligent questions in a weak voice before he went to sleep again and the next morning he was obviously improving  although a strong man often recovers rapidly from an attack of malarial fever clarke stayed several days and gave harding a number of careful instructions on parting  i dont think that can do much harm said harding looking him in the face  your suspicions die hard clarke laughed  thats so returned harding coolly  as soon as you leave this camp i lose my hold on you  however ive given you the indian for a guide and hell see you safe to about a days march from your friends village and ive put up food enough for the journey  considering everything thats all the fee i need offer you  there wouldnt be much use in urging my claim clarke acquiesced  what about benson  i noticed you didnt seem particularly anxious to renew your acquaintance  are you willing to leave him with us  clarke smiled in an ironical manner  why do you ask when you mean to keep him  so far as im concerned youre welcome to the man i make you a present of him  have you had enough of this trip yet or are you going on  were going ahead you can do what you like about it  and now while i admire the way you pulled my partner through theres not much more to say  i wish you a safe journey  goodmorning  he turned back toward the fire while clarke stood a moment with clenched hand and a malignant look creeping into his eyes then following the indian the doctor silently moved forward across the muskeg     chapter xiii  a staunch ally  on a dark november morning when a blustering wind drove the rain against the windows thomas foster sat stripping the lock of a favorite gun in the room he called his study at hazlehurst in shropshire  the shelves on the handsome paneled walls contained a few works on agriculture horsebreeding and british natural history but two racks were filled with guns and fishingrods and the table at which foster was seated had a vise clamped to its edge  he had once had a commodious gunroom but had given it up under pressure from his wife as hazlehurst was small and she had numerous guests but the study was his private retreat  a hacksaw a few files a wire brush and a bottle of rangoon oil were spread out in front of him the latter standing for the sake of cleanliness on the cover of the field  foster laid down his tools and looked up with an air of humorous resignation as his wife came in  mrs foster was a slender vivacious woman fond of society  put that greasy thing away for a few minutes and listen to me she said sitting down opposite him  i am listening im inclined to think its my normal state foster answered with a smile  the greasy thing cost forty guineas and i wouldnt trust it to jenkins after young jimmy dropped it in a ditch jenkins can rear pheasants with any keeper ive met but hes no good at a gun  you shouldnt have taken jimmy out hes not strong enough yet  so it seems he gave us some trouble in getting him back to the cart after he collapsed in the woods  but it wasnt my fault he was keen on coming  mrs foster made a sign of agreement  jimmy was her cousin lieutenant walters lately invalided home from india  perhaps you were not so much to blame but that was not what i came to talk about she said  then i suppose you want my approval of some new plans  go ahead with any arrangements you wish to make but as far as possible leave me out  though it was a very wet spring i never saw the pheasants more plentiful glad i stuck to the handrearing though jenkins wanted to leave the birds alone in the higher woods  of course now weve cleared out the vermin  oh never mind the pheasants his wife broke in  you would talk about such things all day  the question is  it strikes me its when are we going to have the house to ourselves though i dont interfere much ive lately felt that im qualifying for a hotelkeeper  you have been unusually patient and im getting rather tired of entertaining people but margaret keith says shed like to come down you dont mind her  not a bit if she doesnt insist on bringing a menagerie  it was cats last time but i hear shes gone in for wild animals now  if she turns up with her collection well probably lose pattinson he had all he could stand on the last occasion  still megs good fun ready to meet you on any ground keen as a razor  after a little further talk mrs foster left him and a few days later mrs keith and millicent arrived at hazlehurst  lieutenant walters was sitting in a recess of the big hall when mrs foster went forward to greet them  the house was old and the dark paneling formed a good background for millicents delicate beauty which was of the blond type  walters studied her closely  he liked the something in her face that hinted at strength of character and he noted her grace as she accompanied her hostess up the broad stairs  when mrs keith and millicent returned to the hall a halfhour later tea was being served  colonel challoner is eager to see you margaret mrs foster said after they had chatted a while  he excused himself for not coming this evening because greythorpe is staying with him for a day or two but he made me promise to bring you over tomorrow  mrs keith acquiesced heartily for she was fond of the colonel  the evening passed pleasantly at hazlehurst for mrs foster made a charming hostess  foster who as a rule was indifferent to womens society livened the party by matching wits with margaret keith and lieutenant walters found mrs keiths pretty companion very interesting  at sandymere three miles away colonel challoner sat in his library with his guest  it was a large and simply furnished room but there was a tone of austere harmony in all its appointments  the dark oak table the rows of old books in faded leather bindings the antique lamps and the straightbacked chairs were in keeping with the severe lines of the somber panels and the heavy square molding of the ceiling  three wax candles in an old silver holder stood on a small table by the wide hearth on which a cheerful wood fire burned but most of the room was shadowy  the sense of empty space and gloom however had no effect on the two elderly men who sat with a cigar box and decanter in front of them engaged in quiet confidential talk  challoner was whitehaired straight and spare with aquiline features and piercing eyes greythorpe broadshouldered and big with a heavyjawed thoughtful face  they had been fast friends since their first meeting a number of years ago when challoner was giving evidence before a parliamentary commission  so you have not heard from blake after the day he came here greythorpe said  never directly challoner replied  on the whole it is better so though i regret it now and then  a weakness on my part perhaps but i was fond of dick and expected much from him  however it seems that bertram and margaret keith met him in montreal and she is coming here tomorrow  a very sad affair greythorpe mused  a promising career cut short and a life ruined by a moments failure of nerve  the price paid for it was a heavy one  still i found the matter difficult to understand because so far as i could tell there was nothing in blakes character that made such a failure possible  then its known that personal courage was always a characteristic of your family  his mother was my sister  you have seen her portrait  greythorpe made a sign of assent  he knew the picture of the woman with the proud determined face  and the other side  was the strain equally virile he asked  you shall judge said challoner  you and margaret keith are the only people to whom i have ever spoken freely of these things  i am sure of your discretion and sympathy  he crossed the floor and opening a cabinet came back with a photograph which he gave to his companion  dicks father  he was famous as a daring rider across an irish stonewall country and was killed when taking a dangerous leap  greythorpe studied the face which was of irish type with bold eyes in which a reckless twinkle showed  on the whole it suggested an ardent and somewhat irresponsible temperament  no sign of weakness there he said  though he might be careless and headstrong this man would ride straight and stand fire  i cant hint at an explanation of his sons disaster but i imagine that one might have been found if it had been diligently searched for  my opinion is that theres something hidden but whether it will ever come out is another matter  butyour nephew hasnt forfeited my liking  if i can ever be of any service  thanks i know responded challoner  it looks as if he meant to cut loose from all of us  while im sorry i cant say that hes wrong or that its not a proper feeling  and now i think well let the subject drop  the next afternoon was bright and mild and soon after mrs foster and her party arrived challoner offered to show them his winter shrubbery  i have lately planted a number of new specimens which you and margaret have not seen he said and you may be interested to learn what effects can be got by a judicious mingling of bushes remarkable for the beauty of their berries and branchcoloring among the stereotyped evergreens  they went out and millicent thought the front of the old house with its mullioned windows its heavy pillared coping and its angular chimney stacks made a picturesque background for the smoothclipped yew hedges and broad sweep of lawn  behind it a wood of tall beeches raised their naked boughs in pale intricate tracery against the soft blue sky  the shrubs proved worth inspection for some were rich with berries of hues that varied from crimson to lilac and the massed twigs of others formed blotches of strong coloring  the grass was dry and lighted by gleams of sunshine the air only cold enough to make movement pleasant  when challoner and his guests returned to the house he showed them the best bits of the old carved oak with which it was decorated and some curious works of art he had picked up in india and then he took them to the picture gallery which ran round the big square hall  a lantern dome admitted a cold light but a few sunrays struck through a window looking to the southwest and fell in long bright bars on polished floor and somber paneling  on entering the gallery challoner took out a case of miniatures and placing it on a small table brought a chair for mrs keith  you know the pictures but this collection generally interests you and i have added a few examples of a good french period since you were last here  mrs keith sat down and picked up a miniature  millicent would enjoy that picture of the hills at arrowdale she said  its near her old home in the north  challoner and the girl moved away down the gallery and he showed her a large painting of gray hills and a sullen tarn half revealed between folds of rolling vapor  millicent was stirred to keen appreciation  its beautiful she exclaimed  and so full of life  one can see the mist drive by and the ripples break upon the stones  perhaps its because i know the tarn that i like the picture so much but it makes one realize the rugged grandeur and the melancholy charm of the place that is genius  who is the painter  my son said the colonel quietly  millicent saw that he was troubled though she could not imagine the reason  i hardly know captain challoner whom i met only once but it is obvious that he has talent  you would rather have him a soldier  very much rather  but he is one  i understand that he has distinguished himself  after all it is perhaps a mistake to think of genius as limited to one abilitymusic or painting for example  real genius the power of understanding is more comprehensive the man who has it ought to be successful at whatever he undertakes  im dubious said challoner  it strikes me as a rather daring theory  it isnt mine millicent explained quickly  its a favorite theme of a philosopher im fond of and he insists upon it when he speaks about great men  perhaps im talking too freely but i feel that captain challoners being able to paint well shouldnt prevent his making a good officer  great men are scarce  im content that my son has so far done his duty quietly and well all i could wish for is that if any exceptional call should be made on him he should rise to the occasion  that is the supreme test men from whom one expects much sometimes fail to meet it  millicent guessed that he was thinking of a man who had been dear to him and who apparently had broken down beneath sudden stress  it must be hard to judge them unless one knows all the circumstances she said stoutly  not when a man has entered his countrys service  he must carry out his orders what he is sent to do must be done  no excuse can justify disobedience and failure  but we are getting too serious and i am boring you  there is another picture i think you would like to see  they walked down the long gallery chatting lightly  the colonel drew her attention to a few of his favorite landscapes and then they stood before a large painting of a scene unmistakably in british columbia the indian canoe on the rippled surface of the lake the tall stiff yet beautiful trees that crept down to the waters edge the furrowed snow peaks in the background stirred the girls pulse as she thought of one who even then perhaps was wandering about in that wild country she expressed her admiration of the painting and then rather hesitatingly mentioned the colonels nephew  have you heard anything from mr blake since he left montreal  nothing said challoner with a trace of grimness  he does not correspond with me  then i suppose you dont know where he is  i heard that he had left a small settlement on the western prairie and started for the north  he gave her a sharp glance  are you interested in my nephew  yes she said frankly  i dont know him very well but on two occasions he came to my assistance when i needed it  he was very tactful and considerate  then hes fortunate in gaining your good opinion  no doubt you know something about his history  i dare say my good opinion is not worth much but i feel that he deserves it in spite of what ive been told about him she answered with a blush  it is very sad that he should have to give up all he valued and i thought there was something gallant in his cheerfulnesshe was always ready with a jest  have you met his companion i understand that he is not a man of my nephews stamp  millicent smiled  hardly so from your point of view  does that mean that yours is not the same as mine  i have had to earn my living and that changes ones outlookperhaps id better not say enlarges it  however you shall judge  mr harding is a traveler for an american paint factory and had to begin work at an age when your nephew was at eton but i think him a very fine type hes serious courteous and sanguine and seems to have a strong confidence in his partner  ah  that is not so strange  the blakes have a way of inspiring trust and liking  its a gift of theirs  your nephew undoubtedly has it  he uses it unconsciously but i think that those who trust him are not deceived  challoner regarded her with a curious expression  after all he said that may be true  mrs foster joined them and when soon afterward she and her friends left challoner sat alone for a long time while the pictures faded as dusk crept into the gallery  a man of practical abilities with a stern perception of his duty he was inclined to distrust all that made its strongest appeal to the senses  art and music he thought were vocations for women in his opinion it was hardly fitting that a man should exploit his emotions by expressing them for public exhibition indeed he regarded sentimentality of any kind as a failing and it had been suggested that his son possessed the dangerous gift  one of his friends had even gone farther and hinted that bertram should never have been a soldier but challoner could not agree with that conclusion his lips set sternly as he went out in search of greythorpe     chapter xiv  defeat  a good fire burned on the hearth in the library at sandymere although the mild air of an early spring morning floated in through the open window  challoner sat in a big leather chair watching the flames and thinking of his nephew when a servant entered and handed him a card  challoner glanced at it  clarke  i dont know any one of that name  he stopped abruptly as he saw the word sweetwater in small type at the bottom of the card  he knew that that was the name of the prairie town from which blake had started on his quest into the wilderness  all right perkins he said rather eagerly and a few minutes afterward clarke entered the room with an irritating air of assurance  colonel challoner i presume  challoner bowed  you have brought me some news of my nephew richard blake  this disconcerted clarke  he had not imagined that his object would be known and he had counted upon challoners being surprised and thrown off his guard  it looked as if the colonel had been making inquiries about blake  clarke wished that he could guess his reason for it might affect the situation  that is correct he said  i have a good deal to tell you and it may take some time  challoner motioned to him to be seated and offered him a cigar and clarke lighted it before he spoke  your nephew he began spent a week in the settlement where i live preparing for a journey to the north  though his object was secret i believe he went in search of something to make varnish of because he took with him a young american traveler for a paint factory besides another man  i know all that challoner replied  i heard about his american companion who was the other  we will come to him presently  there is still something which i think you do not know  yes challoner said  he was suspicious for his visitors looks were not in his favor  clarke gave the colonel a keen glance  it concerns your nephews earlier history  that is of most importance to himself and me  it cant interest you  it interests me very much clarke returned with an ironical smile i must ask you to let me tell you what i know  challoner consented and clarke gave what the colonel admitted was a very accurate account of the action on the indian frontier  well he concluded the orders were to hold onthey could send for support if very hard pressed but they mustnt yield a yard of ground it was hot work in front of the trench upon the ridgethe natives pouring into it at one endbut the men held their ground untilthere was an order givenin a white mans voiceand the bugle called them off  somebody had ventured to disobey instructions and after that the hill was lost  the bugler was killed so they could learn nothing from him  clarke paused a moment and narrowed his eyes  now he said it is of vital importance to you to know who gave that order to retreat  that question has been answered and settled challoner replied severely  i think incorrectly  yes the colonel queried again  perhaps you will let me have your theory as to what occurred  that was the opportunity for which clarke was waiting  his argument had been cleverly worked out his points carefully arranged and challoners heart sank for the damaging inference could hardly be shirked  your suggestions are plausible but you cant seriously expect me to attach much weight to them challoner said  besides you seem to have overlooked the important fact that at the regimental inquiry the verdict was that nobody in particular was to blame  oh no clarke replied with a harsh laugh  i merely question its validity  i imagine that reasons which would not be officially recognized led the court to take a lenient view  but what of that blake had to leave the army a ruined man and ive good reason for knowing what an acquittal like his is worth  he paused a moment  i may as well tell you candidly because its probable that youll make inquiries about me  well id won some reputation as a medical specialist when i became involved in a sensational police caseyou may recollect it  challoner started  so you are the man  i think nothing was actually proved against you  no said clarke dryly there was only a fatal suspicion  as it happens i was innocent but i had to give up my profession and my life was spoiled  theres no reason why you should be interested in thisi mention it merely because a similar misfortune has befallen richard blake  the point of course is that it has done so undeservedly  i think you must see who the real culprit is  you mean to infer that my son is a coward and gave the shameful order  challoners eyes glittered though his face was colorless its unthinkable  nevertheless its true  why did he without permission and abusing his authority over the guard spend two hours late at night with blake who was under arrest  what had they to say that took so long when there was a risk of captain challoners being discovered  why did blake make no defense unless it was because he knew that to clear himself would throw the blame upon his friend  you press me hard said challoner in a hoarse voice  but that my son should so have failed in his duty to his country and his cousin is impossible  yet you were willing to believe your nephew guilty  had you any cause to doubt his courage  challoner felt beaten by the mans remorseless reasoning there was scarcely a point he could contest  a conviction that humbled him to the dust was being forced on him but he would not let his rough visitor see him shrink as the truth seared him  ill admit that you have told me a rather likely tale  as you dont speak of having been in india may i ask who gave you the information  blakes companion the man ive mentioned a former indian officer named benson  his full name please  clarke gave it to him and challoner crossing the floor took a book from a shelf and turned over the pages  yes hes here  what led him to talk of the thing to an outsider  drink  ill confess to having taken advantage of the condition he was often in  challoner sat down and coolly lighted a cigar  his position seemed a weak one but he had no thought of surrender  well you have given me some interesting information but theres one thing you havent mentioned and that is your reason for doing so  cant you guess  i shouldnt have suspected you of being so diffident but i dare say you thought this was a chance for earning some money easily  yes said clarke  for five thousand pounds ill undertake that no word of what ive told you will ever pass my lips again  and do you suppose id pay five thousand pounds to see my nephew wronged  i believe you might do so to save your son challoner controlled his anger for he wished to lead the man on and learn something about his plans  out of the question he said briefly  then ill make you an alternative offerand its worth considering take or get your friends to subscribe for ten thousand pounds worth of shares in a commercial syndicate im getting up  youll never regret it  if you wish ill make you a director so that you can satisfy yourself that the money will be wisely spent  youll get it back several times over  challoner laughed  this is to salve my feelings to make the thing look like a business transaction  oh no clarke declared leaning forward and speaking eagerly  its a genuine offer  ill ask your attention for a minute or two canadas an undeveloped country we have scarcely begun to tap its natural resources and theres wealth ready for exploitation all over it  we roughly know the extent of the farming land and the value of the timber but the minerals still to a large extent await discovery while perhaps the most readily and profitably handled product is oil now i know a belt of country where its oozing from the soil and with ten thousand pounds ill engage to bore wells that will give a remarkable yield  his manner was impressive and though challoner had no cause to trust him he thought the man sincere  one understands that in canada all natural commodities belong to the state and any person discovering them can work them on certain terms challoner said  it seems to follow that if your knowledge of the locality is worth anything it must belong to you alone  how is it that nobody else suspects the belt contains oil  a shrewd objection but easily answered  the country in question is one of the most rugged tracts in canadadifficult to get through in summer in winter the man who enters it runs a serious risk  ill admit that what you know about me is not likely to prejudice you in my favor but on your promise to keep it secret ill give you information that must convince you  why dont you make your offer to some company floater or stockjobber  clarke smiled in a pointed manner  because ive a damaging record and no friends to vouch for me  i came here because i felt that i had some claim on you  you were mistaken said challoner curtly  hear me out try to consider my proposition on its merits  for a number of years ive known the existence of the oil and have tried to prospect the country  it was difficult to transport enough food and tools meant a costly expedition and the attracting of undesirable attention  i went alone living with primitive russian settlers and afterward with the indians  to gain a hold on them i studied the occult sciences and learned tricks that impose upon the credulous  to the white men im a crank to the indians something of a magician but my search for the oil has gone on and now while i already know where boring would be commercially profitable im on the brink of tapping a remarkable flow  what will you do if it comes up to your expectations challoner asked for he had grown interested in spite of his disbelief in the man  turn it over to a company strong enough to exact good terms from the american producers or failing that to work the wells  then id go back to london where with money and the standing it would buy me id take up my old profession  i believe ive kept abreast of medical progress and could still make my mark and reinstate myself  it has been my steadfast object ever since i became an outcast ive schemed and cheated to gain it besides risking my life often in desolate muskegs and the arctic frost  now i ask you to make it possibleand you cannot refuse  challoner was silent for a minute or two while clarke smoked impassively  the colonel knew that he had a determined man to deal with and he believed moreover that he had spoken the truth  still the fellow although in some respects to be pitied was obviously a dangerous rascal embittered and robbed of all scruples by injustice there was something malignant in his face that testified against him but worse than all he had come there resolved to extort money as the price of his connivance in a wrong  well clarke said breaking the pause  so far as i can judge your ultimate objects creditable but i cant say as much for the means you are ready to employ in raising the money if you go on with the scheme it must be without any help of mine  clarkes face grew hard and there was something forbidding in the way he knitted his brows  have you gaged the consequences of your refusal  its more to the purpose that ive tried to estimate the importance of your version of what happened during the night attack  it has one fatal weakness which you seem to have overlooked  ah said clarke with ironical calm  you will no doubt mention it  you suggest blakes innocence  you cannot prove it in the face of his own denial  to challoners surprise clarke smiled  so you have seen that  the trouble is that your nephew may never have an opportunity for denying it  he left for the north very badly equipped and he has not come back yet  the country he meant to cross is rugged and covered deep with snow all winter  food is hard to get and the temperature varies from forty to fifty degrees below  then he rose with an undisturbed air  well as it seems we cant come to terms i neednt waste my time and its a long walk to the station  i must try some other market  while i think you have made a grave mistake that is your affair  when clarke had gone challoner left the house in a restless mood and paced slowly up and down among his shrubbery  he wished to be alone in the open air  bright sunshine fell upon him the massed evergreens cut off the wind and in a sheltered border spearlike green points were pushing through the soil in promise of the spring  challoner knew them all the veined crocus blades the tightclosed heads of the hyacinths and the twin shoots of the daffodils but fond as he was of his garden he gave them scanty attention  clarkes revelation had been a shock  with his sense of duty and family pride the colonel had when the news of the frontier disaster first reached him found it almost impossible to believe that his nephew had been guilty of shameful cowardice and now it looked as if the disgrace might be brought still closer home  bertram would presently take his place and retiring from active service rule the estate in accordance with challoner traditions and perhaps exert some influence in politics  clarke had however shown him that bertram from whom so much was expected had proved himself a poltroon and what was even worse had allowed an innocent man to suffer for his baseness  challoner remembered that bertram had shown timidity in his younger daysthey had had some trouble in teaching him to rideand there was no doubt that his was a highly strung and nervous temperament  he had not the calm which marked the challoners in time of strain  on the other hand dick blake was recklessly generous and loved his cousin it would be consistent with his character if he were willing to suffer in bertrams stead  moreover there were reasons which might have had some effect in inducing bertram to consent because challoner knew the affection his son bore him and that he would shrink from involving him in his disgrace  what bertram would certainly not have done to secure his own escape he might have done for the sake of his father and the girl he was to marry  admitting all this challoner could not take his sons guilt for granted  there was room for doubt  blake must be summoned home and forced to declare the truth  then challoners thoughts went back to the man whose tale had so disturbed him  there had been nothing forcible or obviously threatening in clarkes last few remarks but their effect was somehow sinister  challoner wondered whether he had done well in suggesting that blakes denial would prove the mans greatest difficulty  after all he had a strong affection for his nephew and he knew that the wilds of northern canada might prove deadly to a weak party unprovided with proper sleds and provisions  clarke had hinted that blakes party was in danger  surely aid could reach them even in that frozen land by a wellequipped expedition  realizing what delay might mean to his nephew challoner hastened indoors and sent a cableletter to a friend in montreal asking him to spare no effort to follow blakes trail into the northern wilds     chapter xv  the frozen north  a bitter wind swept the snowy prairie and the cold was arctic when clarke shivering in his furs came into sight of his homestead as he walked back from sweetwater  he had gone there for his mail which included an english newspaper and had taken supper at the hotel  it was now about two hours after dark but a full moon hung in the western sky and the cluster of wooden buildings formed a shadowy blur on the glittering plain  there was no fence not a tree to break the white expanse that ran back to the skyline and it struck clarke that the place looked very dreary  he walked on with the fine dry snow the wind whipped up glistening on his furs  on reaching the homestead he went first to the stablebuilt of sod which was cheaper and warmer than sawed lumberand lighting a lantern fed his teams  the heavy clydesdales and lighter driving horses were all valuable for clarke was a successful farmer and had found that the purchase of the best animals and implements led to economy though it was said that he seldom paid the full market price for them  he had walked home because it was impossible to keep warm driving and he now felt tired and morose  the man had passed his prime and was beginning to find the labor he had never shirked more irksome than it had been  he dispensed with a hired hand in winter when there was less to be done for clarke neglected no opportunity to save a dollar  when he had finished in the stable he crossed the snow to the house which was dark and silent  after the bustle and stir of london where he had spent some time it was depressing to come back to the empty dwelling and he was glad that he had saved himself the task of getting supper  shaking the snow from his furs he lighted the lamp and filled up the stove before he sat down wearily  the small room was not a cheerful place in which to spend the winter nights alone  walls and floor were uncovered and were roughly boarded with heatcracked lumber the stove was rusty and gave out a smell of warm iron while a black distillate had dripped from its pipe  there were however several wellfilled bookcases and one or two comfortable chairs  clarke lighted his pipe and drawing his seat as near the stove as possible opened the english newspaper which contained some news that interested him  a short paragraph stated that captain bertram challoner then stationed at delhi had received an appointment which would shortly necessitate his return from india  this clarke imagined might be turned to good account but the matter demanded thought and for a long time he sat motionless deeply pondering  his farming had prospered though the bare and laborious life had tried him hard and he had made some money by more questionable means lending to unfortunate neighbors at extortionate interest and foreclosing on their possessions  no defaulter got any mercy at his hands and shrewd sellers of seed and implements took precautions when they dealt with him  his money however would not last him long if he returned to england and attempted to regain a footing in his profession and he had daringly schemed to increase it  glancing across the room his eyes rested with a curious smile on one of the bookcases  it contained works on hypnotism telepathy and psychological speculations in general he had studied some of them with ironical amusement and others with a quickening of his interest  amid much that he thought of as sterile chaff he saw germs of truth and once or twice he had been led to the brink of a startling discovery  there the elusive clue had failed him though he felt that strange secrets might be revealed some day  after all the books had served his purpose as well as kept him from brooding when he sat alone at nights while the icy wind howled round his dwelling  he passed for a sage and something of a prophet with the primitive dubokars his indian friends regarded him as medicineman and both unknowingly had made easier his search for the petroleum then contrary to his expectations he had found speculators in london willing to venture a few hundred pounds on his scheme but the amount was insufficient and the terms were exacting  it would pay him better to get rid of his associates  he was growing old it would be too late to return to his former life unless he could do so soon but he must make a fair start with ample means  the man had no scruples and no illusions money well employed would buy him standing and friends people were charitable to a man who had something to offer them and the blot on his name must be nearly forgotten  first of all however the richest spot of the oil field must be found and money enough raised to place him in a strong position when the venture was put on the market  he had failed to extort any from challoner but he might be more successful with his son  the man who was weak enough to allow his cousin to suffer for his fault would no doubt yield to judicious pressure  it was fortunate that bertram challoner was coming to england where he could more easily be reached this led clarke to think of blake for he realized that challoner was right in pointing out that the man was his greatest difficulty  if blake maintained that the fault was his nothing could be done it was therefore desirable that he should be kept out of the way  there was another person to whom the same applied  clarke had preyed on bensons weakness but if the fellow had overcome it and should return to farm industriously his exploitation would no longer be possible  on the other hand if he failed to pay off his debts clarke saw how he could with much advantage seize his possessions  thus both blake and benson were obstacles and now that they had ventured into the icy north it would be better if they did not reappear  clarke refilled his pipe and his face wore a sinister look as he took down a rather sketchy map of the wilds beyond the prairie belt  after studying it keenly he sank into an attitude of concentrated thought the stove crackled its pipe glowing red driving snow lashed the shiplap walls and the wind moaned drearily about the house  its occupant however was oblivious to his surroundings  he sat very still in his chair with pouches under his fixed eyes and his lips set tight  he looked malignant and dangerous  perhaps his mental attitude was not quite normal for close study and severe physical toil coupled with free indulgence had weakened him there were drugs to which he was addicted and he had long been possessed by one fixed idea  by degrees it had become a mania and he would stick at nothing that might help him to carry out his purpose  when at last he got up with a shiver to throw wood into the stove he thought he saw how his object could be secured   a month before clarke spent the evening thinking about them blake and his comrades camped at sunset in a belt of small spruces near the edge of the open waste that runs back to the polar sea  they were worn and hungry for the shortage of provisions had been a constant trouble and such supplies as they obtained from indians who seldom had much to spare soon ran out  once or twice they had feasted royally after shooting a big bull moose but the frozen meat they were able to carry did not last long and again they were threatened with starvation  it was a calm evening with a coppery sunset flaring across the snow but intensely cold and though the men had wood enough and sat close beside a fire with their ragged blankets wrapped round them they could not keep warm  harding and benson were openly dejected but blake had somehow preserved his cheerful serenity  as usual after finishing their scanty supper they began to talk for during the day conversation was limited by the toil of the march  no good harding said taking a few bits of resin out of a bag its common fir gum such as i could gather a carload of in the forests of michigan  guess theres something wrong with my theory about the effects of extreme cold  he took a larger lump from a neat leather case  this is the genuine article and its certainly the product of a coniferous tree  the fellow i got it from said it was found in the coldest parts of north america  seems to me we have tried all the varieties of the firs but were as far from finding what we want as when we started  hard luck benson remarked gloomily  harding broke off a fragment and lighted it  notice the smell  its characteristic  the fellow may have been right on one point said blake  when i was in india i once got some incense which was brought down in small quantities from the himalayas and i understood came from near the snowline  the smell was the same one doesnt forget a curious scent  thats so  talking about it reminds me that i was puzzled by a smell i thought i ought to know when i brought clarke out of the tepee  i know now what it was and the things significant  it was gasoline  they extract it from crude petroleum dont they  yes its called petrol on your side  clarkes out for coaloil and i guess hes struck it  then hes lucky but his good fortune doesnt concern us and we have other things to think about  what are you going to do now that we dont seem able to find the gum  its a difficult question harding answered in a troubled voice id hate to go back with nothing accomplished and all my money spent mariannas paying for this journey in many ways and i havent the grit to tell her were poorer than when i left  she wouldnt complain but when you have to live on a small commission thats hard to make its the woman who meets the bill  blake made a sign of sympathy  he had never shared hardings confidence in the success of his search and had joined in it from love of adventure and a warm liking for his comrade  well he said i have no means except a small allowance which is so tied up that its difficult to borrow anything on it but its at your disposal as far as it goes  suppose we keep on with our prospecting  if clarkes mortgage doesnt stop me i might raise a few dollars on my farm benson volunteered  ill throw it in with pleasure because im pretty deep in your debt  thanks harding responded  im sorry i cant agree but i wouldnt take your offer when you first made it and i cant do so now that my plans a failure  anyway were doing some useless talking because i dont see how were to go on prospecting or get south again when we have only three or four days food in hand  he stated an unpleasant truth which the others had characteristically shirked for blake was often careless and benson had taken the risks of the journey with frank indifference  after nearly starving once or twice they had succeeded in getting fresh supplies but now their hearts sank as they thought of the expanse of frozen wilderness that lay between them and the settlements  well said blake theres a hudson bay factory somewhere to the east of us  i cant tell how far off it is though it must be a long way but if we could reach it the agent might take us in  how are you going to find the place  i dont know but a hudson bay post is generally fixed where there are furs to be got  there will no doubt be indians trapping in the neighborhood and we must take our chances of hitting their tracks  but we cant make a long march without food benson objected  the trouble is that we cant stay here without it blake pointed out with a short laugh  this was undeniable and neither of his companions answered  they were unkempt worn out and ragged and in the past week they had traveled a long way through fresh snow on short rations  ahead of them lay a vast and almost untrodden desolation behind them a rugged wilderness which there seemed no probability of their being able to cross  lured by the hope of finding what they sought they had pushed on from point to point and now it was too late to return  presently blake got up  our best chance is to kill a caribou and this is the kind of country they generally haunt  the sooner we look for one the better so i may as well start at once  therell be a moon tonight  he threw off his blanket and picking up a marlin rifle which was their only weapon strode out of camp and as he was a good shot and tracker they let him go  it was getting dark when he left the shelter of the trees and the cold in the open struck through him like a knife the moon had not yet risen and the waste stretched away before him its whiteness changed to a soft bluegray  in the distance scattered bluffs rose in long dark smears but there was nothing to indicate which way blake should turn and he had no reason to believe there was a caribou near the camp  as a matter of fact they had found the larger deer remarkably scarce  blake was tired after breaking the trail since sunrise and the snow was loose beneath his big net shoes but he plodded toward the farthest bluff feeling that he was largely to blame for the partys difficulties  knowing something of the country he should have insisted on turning back when he found they could obtain no dog teams to transport their supplies  occasionally hudson bay agents and patrols of the northwest police made long journeys in arctic weather but they were provided with proper sleds and sufficient preserved food indeed blake was astonished that he and his comrades had got so far he had given way to harding who hardly knew the risks he ran and now he supposed that he must take the consequences  this did not daunt him badly  after all life had not much to offer an outcast he had managed to extract some amusement from it but he had nothing to look forward to  there was no prospect of his making moneyhis talents were not commercialand the hardships he could bear now would press on him more heavily as he grew older  these considerations however were too philosophical for him to dwell on  he was essentially a man of action and was feeling unpleasantly hungry and he quickened his pace knowing that the chance of his getting a shot at a caribou in the open was small  the moon had not risen when he reached the bluff but the snow reflected a faint light and he noticed a row of small depressions on its surface  kneeling down he examined them but there had been wind during the day and the marks were blurred  he felt for a match but his fingers were too numbed to open the watertight case and he proceeded to measure the distance between the footprints  this was an unreliable test as a big deers stride varies with its pace but he thought the tracks indicated a caribou  then he stopped without rising and looked about  near in front the trees rose in a shadowy wall against the clear blue sky there was no wind and it was oppressively still the darkness of the woods was impenetrable and its silence daunting  the row of tracks was the only sign of life blake had seen for days  while he listened a faint howl came out of the distance and was followed by another  after the deep silence the sound was startling blake recognized the cry of the timber wolves and knew his danger the big gray brutes would make short work of a lonely man  his flesh crept as he wondered whether they were on his trail  on the whole it did not seem likely though they might get scent of him  rising to his feet he felt that the rifle magazine was full before he set off at his highest speed  the snow was loose however and his shoes packed and sank his breath got shorter and he began to feel distressed  there was no sound behind him but that somehow increased his uneasiness and now and then he anxiously turned his head  nothing moved on the sweep of bluegray shadow and he pressed on knowing how poor his speed was compared with that the wolves were capable of making  at last with keen satisfaction he saw a flicker of light break out from the dark mass of a bluff ahead and a few minutes later he came breathing hard into camp  you havent stayed out long benson observed  i suppose you saw nothing  i heard wolves blake answered dryly  you had better gather wood enough to keep a big fire going because ive no doubt theyll pick up my trail  however its a promising sign  i guess we could do without it hording broke in  ive no use for wolves  they must live on something blake said  since theyre here there are probably moose or caribou in the neighborhood  ill have another try tomorrow  but the wolves  theyre not so bold in daylight  anyway it seems to me we must take some risks  this was obvious and when they had heaped up a good supply of wood harding and blake went to sleep leaving benson to keep watch     chapter xvi  the trail of the caribou  when blake was awakened by harding the cold was almost unendurable and it cost him a determined effort to rise from the hollow he had scraped out of the snow and lined with spruce twigs close beside the fire  he had not been warm there and it was significant that the snow was dry but sleep had brought him relief from discomfort and he had found getting up the greatest hardship of the trying journey  in answer to his drowsy questions harding said he had once or twice heard a wolf howl in the distance but that was all and then he lay down leaving blake on guard  blake sat with his back to a snowbank which afforded a slight shelter he imagined from his sensations that the temperature must be about fifty degrees below zero  the frost bit through him stiffening his muscles until he felt that if vigorous movement were demanded of him he would be incapable of it  his brain was dulled he could not reason clearly though he had things to consider and he looked about with heavy eyes trying to forget his physical discomfort while his mind wandered through a maze of confused thought  there was a halfmoon in the sky which was pitilessly clear for cloudiness might have made it warmer when the firelight sank the slender spruce trunks cut sharply against the silvery radiance and the hard glitter of the snow  everything was tinted with blue and white and the deathly cold coloring was depressing  blake began to consider their position which was serious  they were worn out and halffed their furs were ragged and shortage of money and the difficulty of transport had forced them to cut down their camp equipment  indeed looking back on the long march blake was surprised that they had escaped crippling frostbite although both benson and harding were somewhat lame from the strain which the use of snowshoes puts on the muscles of the leg  there was moreover a risk of this becoming dangerous and it was probably two hundred miles to the hudson bay post  the chances of their reaching it seemed very slight  just then a howl rang harsh and ominous through the frosty air  with a nervous start blake grabbed his rifle  the wolves had scented them turning his back to the light he spent some minutes gazing fixedly at the glistening white patches among the straggling trees but he could make out none of the stealthy flitting shapes he had half expected to see  it was encouraging that the wolves had not overcome their timidity of the fire  keen hunger would have driven them to an attack and blake had no illusions about the result of that  however the fierce brutes were not starving they must have found something to eat and what a wolf could eat would feed men who were by no means fastidious  seeing nothing that alarmed him blake resumed his musing  their search for the gum had proved useless  he pitied harding who had staked his future upon its success  the man had not complained much but blake knew what he must feel and he thought with compassion of the lonely woman who had bravely sent her husband out and was now waiting for him in the mean discomfort of a cheap tenement  it was not difficult to imagine her anxiety and suspense  next he began to ponder his own affairs which were not encouraging though he did not think he really regretted the selfsacrificing course he had taken  his father had died involved in debt and blake suspected that it had cost colonel challoner something to redeem the share of his mothers property which brought him in a small income that it had been carefully tied up was not he thought enough to guard it from the blake extravagance and ingenuity in raising money afterward the colonel had brought him up and sent him into the army doing so with a generous affection which was very different from cold charity and which demanded some return  then bertram had never been jealous of the favor shown his cousin but had given him warm friendship and blake who was much the stronger had now and then stood between the lad and harm  he had done so again in bertrams greatest need and now he must not grumble at the consequences  of late they had seemed heavier than formerly for in tempting him clarke had made a telling suggestionsuppose he married  this appeared improbable for one thing no girl that he was likely to care for would look with favor on a man with his reputation but he had thought a good deal about millicent graham during the long weary march  he imagined that she had inherited enough of her fathers reckless character to make her willing to take a risk  she would not have a man betray his friend for an advantage that he might gain she had a courage that would help her for loves sake to tread a difficult path  still there was no reason to believe that she had any love for him or indeed that she thought of him except as a stranger to whom she had perhaps some reason to be grateful  resolutely breaking off this train of thought he threw fresh wood on the fire and sat shivering and making plans for the march to the factory until benson relieved him  when the gray dawn broke above the trees he got up stiff with cold and after eating his share of a very frugal breakfast he carefully examined his rifle  though he kept it clean of superfluous grease there was some risk of the striker and magazineslide freezing and a missfire might prove disastrous glancing up between the branches he noticed the low dingy sky although he thought it was not quite so cold  im going to look for a caribou he said  ill be back by dark  well have snow harding warned him  if theres much youll find it hard to get home  id find it harder to do without breakfast and supper which is what may happen very soon  anyway you had better take one of us along  with the ax blake said laughing  its bad enough to reach a caribou with a rifle  bensons as poor a hand at stalking as i know while a days rest may save you from getting a snowshoe leg  as we havent a sled it would be awkward to carry you to the factory  they let him go but when he reached the open his face hardened  the sky had a threatening look the snow was soft and there were wolves about but he was comparatively safe while daylight lasted and food must be found  during the morning he saw wolf tracks but no sign of a deer and at noon he sat down for a few minutes in a sheltered hollow and managed to light the halffrozen pipe he kept in an inner pocket he had brought nothing to eat for they had decided that it would be prudent to dispense with a midday meal  getting stiffly on his feet after he had smoked a while he plodded from bluff to bluff throughout the afternoon  for the most part they were thin and the trees very small while the country between them seemed to be covered with slabs of rocks and stones  it was utterly empty with no sign of life in it but blake continued his search until the light began to fail when he stopped to look about  no snow had fallen but the sky was very thick and a stinging wind had risen  he would have trouble in reaching camp if his trail got drifted up  he knew that he should have turned back earlier but there was what seemed to be an extensive woods in front and he could not face the thought of returning emptyhanded to his halfstarved companions the gray trees were not far away he might reach them and make a mile or two on the back trail before dark though he was weary and hunger had given him a distressing pain in his left side  quickening his pace he neared the bluff  it looked very black and shadowy against the snow which now was fading to a curious lifeless gray  the trees were stunted and scattered that made it possible for him to get through though there were halfcovered fallen branches which entangled his big snowshoes  he could see no tracks of any animal and hardly expected to do so but in a savage mood he held on without much caution until he entered a belt of broken ground strewn with rocky hillocks  here he could not see where he was going and it was almost dark in the hollows but he had learned that chance sometimes favors the hunter as much as careful stalking  stopping for breath a moment halfway up a steep ascent he started for a shadowy object unexpectedly appeared on the summit  it was barely distinguishable against the background of trees but blake saw the broadtined horns in an opening and knew it for a caribou  there was no time to lose the swift creature would take flight in an instant and almost as he caught sight of it the rifle went up to his shoulder  for a moment the foresight wavered across the indistinct form and then his numbed hands grew steady and trusting that nothing would check the frostclogged action he pressed the trigger  he felt the jar of the butt a little smoke blew in his eyes and he could make out nothing on the crest of the ridge  it seemed impossible however that he had missed and the next moment he heard a heavy floundering in the snow among the rocks above  he went up the slope at a savage run and plunged down a precipitous hollow on the farther side of which a halfseen object was moving through the gloom of the trees  stopping a moment he threw up the rifle and after the thin red flash the deer staggered and collapsed  running on in desperate haste he fell upon it with his hunting knife and then stopped feeling strangely limp and breathless with the long blade dripping in his hand  now that the caribou lay dead before him the strain of the last few minutes made itself felt  surprised by a sudden and unexpected opportunity when he was exhausted and weak from want of food he had forced upon himself sufficient steadiness to shoot  it had cost him an effort the short fierce chase had tried him hard and now the reaction had set in  for all that he was conscious of a savage exultant excitement  here was food and food meant life  his first impulse was to light a fire and feast but as he grew calmer he began to think  he was a long way from camp and he feared that if he rested he could not force himself to resume the march  besides there were the wolves to reckon with and he could not escape if they followed him in the dark  prudence suggested that he should cut off as much meat as possible and after placing it out of reach in a tree set off for camp at his best speed without taking any of the raw flesh to scent the air but this was more than he could bring himself to do his comrades were very hungry and some animal might climb to the frozen meat  it was unthinkable that he should run any risk of losing the precious food  he decided to take as much as he could carry and store the rest in a tree and he set to work with the hunting knife in anxious haste  it was now quite dark he could not see what he was cutting and if he gashed his hand which was numbed and almost useless the wound would not heal  then the haft of the knife grew slippery and tough skin and bone turned the wandering blade  it was an unpleasant business but the man could not be fastidious and he tore the flesh off with his fingers knowing that he was in danger while he worked  there were wolves in the neighborhood and their scent for blood was wonderfully keen it was a question whether they would reach the spot before he had left it  when he stopped to clean the knife in the snow he cast a swift glance about  he could see nothing farther off than a fallen trunk about a dozen yards away beyond that the trees had faded into a somber mass  a biting wind wailed among them causing the needles to rustle harshly but except for this there was a daunting silence  blake began to feel a horror of the lonely wood and a longing to escape into the open though he would be no safer there  but to give way to this weakness would be dangerous and pulling himself together he went to work more calmly  it was difficult to reach the branches of the spruce he chose and when he had placed the first load of meat in safety he was tempted to flight  indeed for some moments he stood irresolute struggling to hold his fears in subjection and then he went back for another supply he climbed the tree three times before he was satisfied that he had stored enough and afterward he gathered up as much of the flesh as he could conveniently carry  it would soon freeze but not before it had left a scent that any wolf which might happen to be near could follow  he left the woods with a steady stride refraining from attempting a faster pace than he could keep up but when he had gone a mile he felt distressed  his load which included the rifle was heavy and he had been exerting himself since early morning  the wind was in his face lashing it until the cold became intolerable the dry snow was loose and had drifted over his outward trail  still he was thankful that no more had fallen and he thought that he knew the quarter he must make for  now that he was in the open he could see some distance for the snow threw up a dim light  it stretched away before him a sweep of glimmering gray and the squeaking crunch it made beneath his shoes emphasized the overwhelming silence  skirting a bluff he did not remember he stopped in alarm until a taller clump of trees which he thought he knew caught his searching eyes  if he were right he must incline farther to the east to strike the shortest line to camp and he set off breathing heavily and longing to fling away his load  cold flakes stung his face and a creeping haze obscured his view in the direction where he expected to find the next woods  he was within a hundred yards of the nearest trees when he saw them and as he left the woods it was snowing hard his heart sank as he launched out into the open for he had now no guide and having neither ax nor blanket he could not make a fire and camp in a bluff even if he could find one  it looked as if he must perish should he fail to reach the camp  he had only a hazy recollection of floundering on passing a bluff he could not locate and here and there a white rock while the snow fell thicker and its surface got worse  then when he felt he could go no farther he heard a howl behind him and then another  with the wolves on his trail blake quickened his speed to his utmost limit  as a last resort he could throw away the meat and they would stop for that but they were still some distance back of him and he held on grimly to his precious load  it meant life to him and to his starving companions  his feet sank into the soft snow the wind blew him back cruelly a cloud had come over the moon obscuring what little light he had but worst of all one of his snowshoes was loose  with the cry of the wolves behind him he did not dare stop to tighten it although it impeded his progress greatly  he struggled forward as the howls drew nearer and then when it seemed that he would have to give up a faint glow of light broke out and he turned toward it with a hoarse cry  an answer reached him the light grew brighter and he was in among the trees  benson met him and a minute later he flung himself down exhausted by the fire  ive brought you your supper boys he gasped but the wolves are on my trail  harding grabbed the rifle while benson poked at the fire until a larger flame swept up lighting clearly a radius of several yards but the wolves fearing the fire or scenting some other prey had branched off to the right and the men could hear their howls growing fainter in the distance  well have a feast tonight boys benson said hastily preparing the meal  they ate with keen appetite and afterward went to sleep and when they reached the woods the next morning nothing was left of the caribou except the meat in the tree and a few cleanpicked bones  with a sufficient quantity of meat to stave off their anxiety regarding the question of food the men spent two days enjoying a badly needed rest and then they pushed on making forced marches which severely taxed their strength  part of their way however lay across open country for they were near the northern edge of the timber belt and the straggling trees dwarfed and bent by the wind ran east and west in a deeply indented line  in some places they boldly stretched out toward the pole in long promontories in others they fell back in wide bays which blake steering by compass held straight across afterward plunging again into the scrub  three days were spent in struggling through the broadest tongue but as a rule a few hours arduous march brought them out into the open  even there the ground was very rough and broken and they were thankful for the numerous frozen creeks and lakes which provided an easier road  pushing on stubbornly camping where they could find shelter and wood for they could hardly have survived a night spent in the open without a fire they made by calculation two hundred miles and blake believed that they must surely be near the hudson bay post     chapter xvii  a respite  light snow was driving across the waste before a savage wind when the party sat at breakfast one morning  day had broken but there was little light and blake looking out from behind a slab of rock in the shelter of which a few junipers clung thought that three or four miles would be the longest distance that he could see  this was peculiarly unfortunate because an indian trapper whom they had met two days before had told them that their course led across a wide untimbered stretch on the opposite side of which one or two isolated bluffs would indicate the neighborhood of the factory  disastrous consequences might follow the missing of these woods  a pannikin of weak tea made from leaves which already had been twice infused stood among the embers and benson was leaning over a log dividing the last of the meat  he held up a small piece  i had thought of saving this but it hardly seems worth while he said  if we make the factory tonight well get a good supper  you dont mention what will happen if we miss it harding commented with grim humor  anyway that piece of meat wont make much difference  what do you think blake  blake forced a cheerful laugh  put it all in were going to make the post as a matter of fact we have to  hows the leg this morning  i dont think its worse than it was last night harding answered if im careful how i go it ought to stand another journey  he made a grimace as he stretched out the limb  it was very sore for during the last few days the strain the snowshoe threw on the muscles had nearly disabled him  now he knew it would be difficult to hold out for another journey but he had grown accustomed to pain and weariness and hunger  they were he imagined the lot of all who braved the rigors of winter in the northern wilds  well said benson theres no use in carrying anything thats not strictly needful and the empty grubbag may stay behind  then heres a pair of wornout moccasins i was keeping as a stand by  i should be able to get new ones at the factory  its still some distance off harding reminded him  if we dont make it the chances are that i wont need the things but what about your collection of gum  nothing had been said on this point for some time but hardings face wore a curious look as he took up a bag which weighed three or four pounds  some of the stuff might be used for lowgrade varnish but thats not what im out for  ive been trying to believe that a few of the specimens might prove better on analysis but i guess its a delusion  with a quick resolute movement he threw the bag into the fire and when the resin flared up with a thick brown smoke the others regarded him with silent sympathy  this was the end of the project from which he had expected so much but it was obvious that he could meet failure with fortitude  nothing that would serve any purpose could be said and they quietly strapped on their blankets  there was not much snow when they set off and fortunately the wind blew behind them but the white haze narrowed in the prospect and blake breaking the trail kept his eyes on the compass  he was not at all sure of the right line but he had the satisfaction of knowing that he was at least going straight  after a few minutes harding glanced behind  their camping place had vanished they were out in an open waste and he knew that he had started on the last march he was capable of making  where it would lead him he could not tell though the answer to the question was of vital importance  for a time he thought of his wife and wondered with keen anxiety what would become of her if his strength gave way before they reached the post but he drove these cares out of his mind  it was dangerous to harbor them and it served no purpose his part was to struggle on swinging the net snowshoes while he grappled with the pain each step caused him  he shrank from contemplating the distance yet to be covered it seemed vast to him in his weakness and he felt himself a feeble crippled thing  soft snow and arctic cold opposed his advance with malignant force but his wornout body still obeyed the spur of his will and he roused himself to fight for the life that had some value to another  he must march dividing up the distance into short stages that had less effect upon the imagination limping forward from the iceglazed rock abreast of him to the white hillock which loomed up dimly where the snow blurred the horizon then again he would look ahead from some patch of scrub to the most prominent elevation that he could see  the marks he chose and passed seemed innumerable but the wilderness still ran on pitilessly empty  his leg was intensely painful he knew that he must break down soon and they had seen nothing of a stony rise for which they watched eagerly  to find it would simplify matters for the indian had made them understand that the bluffs about the post lay nearly east of it  noon passed and they still pressed forward without a halt for there was little more than three hours daylight left and it was unthinkable that they should spend the night without food or shelter  the horizon steadily narrowed as the snow thickened there was a risk of their passing the guidingmarks or even the factory  it was nearly three oclock when harding stumbled and fell into the snow  he found himself unable to get up until benson helped him and in his attempt to rise he further strained his weakened leg  for a moment he leaned on his companion his face contorted with pain  the fall seems to have hurt you benson said sympathetically  ill have to go on harding gasped and setting his teeth he strode forward but he made only a few paces  the pain was severe his head reeled his strength gave way and he sank down on his knees  benson and blake stopped in consternation  if ive kept the right line we cant be far from the factory blake said encouragingly  im played out harding declared  youll have to leave me here  if you make the post you can come back with a sled  no  how are we to find you with our trail drifting up  besides youd be frozen in a few hours  if you cant walk youll have to be carried  get hold of him benson  benson lifted him to his feet blake seized his arm and both supporting him they resumed the march  leaning on them heavily harding was dragged along and they silenced the feeble protests he made now and then  stop talking that rot  we see this out together blake told him roughly  none of them had much doubt as to what the end would be but they stubbornly held on  nothing further was said  blake and benson themselves were nearly exhausted and their pinched faces were set and stern and hardings was drawn up in a ghastly fashion by suffering still their overtaxed muscles somehow obeyed the relentless call on them  at last when the light had almost gone benson stepped into a slight depression that slanted across their path  hold on he cried hoarsely  look at this  blake stooped while harding swaying awkwardly with bent leg held on to him  the hollow was small a smooth groove of slightly lower level than the rest of the snow  a sledge trail he cried in an exultant voice  drifted up a bit but theyve been hauling lumber over it and that means a good deal to us  he indicated a shallow furrow a foot or two outside the groove thats been made by the butt of a trailing log  the indian said there were bluffs near the post and they wouldnt haul their cordwood farther than necessary  they stood silent for a few moments overcome by relief  they had a guide to shelter and safety  when they had gathered breath blake steadied harding who found standing difficult  we must make a move and hustle all we can he said eagerly  it will be dark in half an hour and the snow wont take long in filling up the trail  the risk of missing the factory which might be near at hand was not to be faced and they pulled themselves together for a last effort blake and benson breathing hard as they dragged harding along  the light was rapidly going now that they had changed their course the snow lashed their faces making it difficult to see and they plodded forward with lowered heads and eyes fixed on the guidingline  it grew faint in places and vanished altogether after a while  then they stopped in dismay and blake went down on his knees scraping with ragged mittens in the snow  i cant see which way it runs but it certainly doesnt end here he said  go ahead and look for it benson but dont get out of call  benson moved forward and when he faded into the cloud of driving flakes those he left behind were conscious of a keen uneasiness  they could see only a few yards it was blowing fresh and the wind might carry their voices away and if this happened the chances were against their comrades being able to rejoin them  after a few minutes blake shouted and the answer was reassuring  they waited a little longer and then when they cried out a hail came back very faintly  nothing yet  keep closer blake shouted but it seemed that benson did not hear him for there was no reply  hadnt you better go after him harding suggested  no blake snapped  it would make things worse to scatter  he raised his voice  come back before your tracks fill up  the silence that followed filled them with alarm but while they listened in strained suspense a faint call came out of the snow  the words were indistinguishable but the voice had an exultant note in it  he has found the trail blake exclaimed with deep relief  it was difficult to see the print of bensons shoes and harding could not move a step alone but they called out at intervals as blake slowly helped him along and at last a shadowy object loomed in front of them as they came up benson pointed to a slight depression  we can follow it if it gets no fainter but theres no time to lose he said  it might be safer if i went first and kept my eye on the trail  he shuffled forward with lowered head while blake came behind helping harding as best he could  all three long remembered the next halfhour  once they lost the trail and were seized with despair but searching anxiously they found it again  at last a pale elusive light appeared amid the snow ahead and they watched it with keen satisfaction as it grew clearer  when it had changed to a strong yellow glow they passed a broken white barrier which blake supposed was a ruined stockade and the hazy mass of a building showed against the snow  then there was a loud barking of dogs and while they sought for the door a stream of light suddenly shone out with a mans dark figure in the midst of it  the next minute they entered the house and harding lurching forward across the floor of a large room clutched at a table and then fell with a crash into a chair  after the extreme cold outside the air was suffocatingly hot  overcome by the change and pain harding leaned back with flushed face and halfclosed eyes while his companions stood still with the snow glistening on their ragged furs  the man shut the door before he turned to them  a rough night he said calmly  ye might as weel sit down  where do ye hail from  blake laughed as he found a seat  he imagined that their appearance must have been somewhat startling but he knew it takes a good deal to disturb the equanimity of a hudson bay scot  from sweetwater but we have been up in the timber belt since winter set in  now we have run out of provisions and my partners lamed by snowshoe trouble  ay said the man i suspected something o the kind  but maybe yell be wanting supper  i believe if we were put to it we could eat half a caribou benson told him with a grin  its no to be had the scot answered in a matteroffact tone  i can give ye a good thick bannock and some whitefish  our stores are no so plentiful the now  they took off their furs and glanced about the place while their host was busy at the stove  the room was large and its walls of narrow logs were chinked with clay and moss  guns and steel traps hung upon them the floor was made of uneven boards which had obviously been split in the nearest bluff and the furniture was of the simplest and rudest description  the room had however an air of supreme comfort to the famishing newcomers and after the first few minutes they found it delightfully warm  they ate ravenously the food given them and afterward the agent brought harding some warm water and examined his leg  yell no walk far for a while im thinking he commented  rest it on the chair here and sit ye still  harding was glad to comply and lighting their pipes the men began to talk  their host who told them his name was robertson was a rather hardfeatured man of middle age  im all my lone my clerks away with the breeds at the swan lake he said  where are ye making for  for the south blake answered  we came here for shelter badly tired and we want to hire a dog team and a halfbreed guide if possible as soon as my partners fit to travel  then we want provisions  im afraid i cannot supply ye  our stores are lowwe got few fish and caribou the year and we have not a team to spare  well said benson i dont suppose youll turn us out and wed be glad to pay for our accommodation  we have no wish to take the trail again without food or transport  robertson looked thoughtful  ye might wait a week or two and then well maybe see better what can be done  he asked them a few questions about their journey and then harding took the piece of gum from its case  i guess you have seen nothing like this round here  no said robertson after examining it carefully  i have made it my business to study the natural products o the district and its my opinion yell find no gum of this kind in the northern timber belt  i suppose youre right  leaving furs out if the countrys rich in anything its probably minerals  theres copper and some silver but ive seen no ore that would pay for working when ye consider the transport  i dont suppose youre anxious to encourage prospecting benson suggested  robertson smiled  if there was a rich strike we would no object  were here to trade and supplying miners is no quite so chancy as dealing in furs but to have a crowd from the settlements disturbing our preserves and going away after finding nothing o value would not suit us  still im thinking its no likely the distance and the winter will keep them out  did you ever see signs of oil  no here theres petroleum three hundred miles south but no enough in my opinion to pay for driving wells  onyway the two prospecting parties that once came up didna come back again  he left them presently and when they heard him moving about an adjoining room harding made a suggestion  well stay here for a while and then look for that petroleum on our way to the settlements  blake agreed readily the determination he thought was characteristic of his comrade  hardings project had failed but instead of being crushed by disappointment he was already considering another     chapter xviii  the back trail  blake and his friends spent three weeks at the hudson bay post and throughout the first fortnight an icy wind hurled the snow against the quivering building  it was dangerous to venture as far as a neighboring bluff where fuel had been cut benson and the agent who were hauling cordwood home narrowly escaped from death one evening in the suddenly freshening storm  none of the halfbreeds could reach the factory and robertson confessed to some anxiety about them  there was little that could be done and they spent the dreary days lounging about the redhot stove and listening to the roar of the gale  in the long evenings robertson told them grim stories of the north  then there came a week of still clear weather with intense frost and when several of the trappers arrived robertson suggested that his guests had better accompany a man who was going some distance south with a dog team  he could however spare them only a scanty supply of food and they knew that a long forced march lay before them when they left their guide  day was breaking when the dogs were harnessed to the sled and harding and his companions shivering in their furs felt a strong reluctance to leave the factory  it was a rude place and very lonely but they had enjoyed warmth and food there and their physical nature shrank from the toil and the bitter cold  none of them wished to linger in the northharding least of allbut it was daunting to contemplate the distance that lay between them and the settlements  strong effort and stern endurance would be required of them before they rested beside a hearth again  there was no wind the smoke went straight up and spreading out hung above the roof in a motionless cloud the snow had a strange ghostly glimmer in the creeping light and the cold bit to the bone  it was with a pang that they bade their host farewell and followed the halfbreed who ran down the slope from the door after his team robertson was going back to sit warm and wellfed by his stove but they could not tell what hardships awaited them  their depression however vanished after a while  the snow was good for traveling the dogs trotted fast and the halfbreed grunted approval of their speed as he pointed to landmarks that proved it when they stopped at noon  after that they held on until dark and made camp among a few junipers in the shelter of a rock  all had gone well the first day hardings leg no longer troubled him and there was comfort in traveling light with their packs on the sled  the journey began to look less formidable  gathering close round the fire they prepared their supper cheerfully while the dogs fought over scraps of frozen fish  harding however had misgivings about their ability to keep up the pace he thought that in a day or two it would tell on the white men  they slept soundly for the cold has less effect on the man who is fresh and properly fed  breakfast was quickly despatched and after a short struggle with the dogs they set out again  it was another good day and they traveled fast over a rolling tableland on which the snow smoothed out the inequalities among the rocks  bright sunshine streamed down on them the sled ran easily up the slopes and down the hollows and the men found no difficulty in keeping the pace  looking back when they nooned harding noticed the straightness of their course  picked out in delicate shades of blue against the unbroken white surface surrounding it the sled trail ran back with scarcely a waver to the crest of a rise two miles away  this was not how they had journeyed north with the icy wind in their faces laboriously struggling round broken ridges and through tangled woods  harding was a sanguine man but experience warned him to prepare for much less favorable conditions  it was not often the wilderness showed a smiling face  still the fine weather held and they were deep in the timber when they parted from their guide on a frozen stream which he must follow while they pushed south across a rugged country  he was not a companionable person and he spoke only a few words of barbarous french but they were sorry to see the last of him when he left them with a friendly farewell  he had brought them speedily a long distance on their way but they must now trust to the compass and their own resources while the loads they strapped on were unpleasantly heavy before this task was finished dogs and driver had vanished up the white riband of the stream and they felt lonely as they stood in the bottom of the gorge with steep rocks and dark pines hemming them in blake glanced at the high bank with a rueful smile  there are advantages in having a good guide he said  we havent had to face a climb like that all the way  but wed better get up  it cost them some labor and when they reached the summit they stopped to look for the easiest road  ahead as far as they could see small ragged pines grew among the rocks and breaks in the uneven surface hinted at troublesome ravines  it looks rough said benson  theres rather a high ridge yonder it might save trouble to work round its end  what do you think  when im not sure harding replied i mean to go straight south  benson gave him an understanding nod  you have better reasons for getting back than the rest of us though ive no particular wish to loiter up here  break the trail blake due south by compass  they plunged deeper into the broken belt clambering down ravines crossing frozen lakes and snowy creeks  indeed they were thankful when a strip of level surface indicated water for the toil of getting through the timber was heavy  after two days of travel there was a yellow sunset and the snow gleamed in the lurid light with an ominous brilliance while as they made their fire a moaning wind got up  these things presaged a change in the weather and they were rather silent over the evening meal they missed the halfbreed and the snarling dogs and it looked as if the good fortune that had so far attended them were coming to an end  the next morning there was a low brooding sky and at noon snow began to fall but they kept on until evening over very rough ground and then they held a council round the fire  the situation requires some thought blake said  first of all our provisions wont carry us through the timber belt  now the shortest course to the prairie where the going will be easier is due south but after we get there well have a long march to the settlements  id partly counted on our killing a caribou or perhaps a moose but so far weve seen no tracks  there must be some smaller animals that the indians eat benson suggested  none of us knows where to look for them and we havent much time to spare for hunting  thats so harding agreed  whats your plan  im in favor of heading southwest  it may mean an extra hundred miles or more but it would bring us nearer the stony village and afterward the logging camp on the edge of the timber where we might get supplies  its understood that the indians are often half starved in winter benson reminded him  for all that they might have had good luck and anyway we couldnt cross the prairie with an empty grubsack  my votes for striking off to the west  harding concurred though his leg had threatened further trouble during the last day or two and he would have preferred the shorter route  what about the petroleum blake asked  we cant stop to look for it unless we can lay in a good stock of food and i dont suppose we could do much prospecting with the snow on the ground harding paused with a thoughtful air  when we reach the settlement i must go home but if the money can be raised ill be back as soon as the thaw comes to try for the oil clarkes an unusually smart man and theres no doubt hes on the trail  well raise enough money somehow benson declared  harding smiled  yes well raise the money somehow he agreed  it has been my experience that when you want a thing badly enough theres always some way to get it  he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and stood up stretching and yawning  right now i want sleep he said  when dawn came the next morning it was snowing hard and for a week they made poor progress with a bitter gale driving the flakes in their faces  each day the distance covered steadily lessened and rations were cut down accordingly  hardings leg was getting sore but he did not mean to speak of it unless it became necessary  they were however approaching the neighborhood of the indian village and blake began to speculate upon the probability of their finding its inhabitants at home  he understood that the stonies wandered about and he realized with uneasiness that it would be singularly unfortunate if they were away on a hunting trip  at last after spending all of one blustering day laboriously climbing the rough but gently rising slope of a long divide they camped on a high tableland and lay awake too cold to sleep beside a sulky greenwood fire  in the morning it was difficult to get up on their feet but as the light grew clearer the prospect ahead of them seized their attention  the hill summits were wrapped in leaden cloud but a valley opened up below  it was wider and deeper than any they had come across since leaving the factory the bottom looked unusually level and it ran roughly south  they gazed at it in silence for a time and then harding spoke  ive an idea that this is the valley where blake fell sick and its going to straighten things out for us if im right  thats so benson agreed we would be sure of striking the stony village and we could afterward follow the low ground right down to the river  with the muskegs frozen solid it ought to make an easy road  blake was conscious of keen satisfaction but there was still a doubt  well know more about it after another march he said  no snow fell that morning and as their packs were ominously light they made good speed across the hill benches and down a ravine where they scrambled among the boulders of a frozen creek  it was a gray day without the rise in temperature that often accompanies cloudiness and the light was strangely dim  rocks and pines melted into one another at a short distance and leaden haze obscured the lower valley  blake was becoming sure however that it was the one they had traveled up and dispensing with the usual noon halt they pushed on as fast as possible  all were anxious to set their doubts at rest for there was now a prospect of obtaining food and shelter in a few days but they recognized no landmarks and with the approach of evening the frost grew very keen  the haze drew in closer and the scattered pines they passed wailed drearily in a rising wind  the men were tired but they could see no suitable camping place and they pushed on looking for thicker timber  it was getting dark when a belt of trees stretched across the valley and they decided to stop there  benson leading the way suddenly cried out  what is it harding asked  benson hesitated  well he said the thing doesnt seem probable but i believe i saw a light  anyway its gone  they stopped gazing eagerly into the gloom  a light meant that there were men not far off and after the grim desolation through which they had traveled all were conscious of a longing for human society besides the strangers would no doubt have something to eatthey might even be cooking a plentiful supper  there was however nothing to be seen until blake moved a few yards to one side  then he turned to benson with a cheerful laugh  you were right  i can see a glimmer about a mile ahead  i wonder who the fellows are  they set off as fast as they could go though traveling among the fallen branches and the slanting trees was difficult in the dark  now and then they lost their beacon but the brightening glow shone out again and when it was visible blake watched it with surprise  it was low hardly large enough he thought for a fire and it had a curious irregular flicker  drawing nearer they dipped into a hollow where they could distinguish only a faint brightness beyond the rising ground ahead  they eagerly ascended that and reaching the summit they saw the light plainly but it was very small and there were no figures outlined against it  benson shouted and all three felt a shock of disappointment when no answer came to them  he ran as fast as his snowshoes would let him smashing through brush floundering over snowy stories with blake and harding stumbling short of breath behind and then he stopped with a hoarse cry  he stood beside the light there was nobody about the blaze sprang up mysteriously from the frozen ground  a blower of natural gas harding exclaimed excitedly  in a sense weve had our run for nothing but this may be worth a good deal more than your supper  if i had the option id trade all the natural gas in canada for a thick red moose steak and a warm place to sleep in benson said savagely  anyway it will help us to light our fire and we have a bit of whitefish and a few hard bannocks left  blake shared his comrades disappointment  he was tired and hungry and he felt irritated by hardings satisfaction  for all that he chopped wood and made camp and their frugal supper was half eaten before he turned to the optimistic american  now he said maybe you will tell us why you were so cheerful about this gas  first of all harding answered goodhumoredly it indicates that theres oil somewhere aboutthe two generally go together  anyway if there were only gas it would be worth exploiting so long as we found enough of it but judging by the pressure theres not much here  what would you do with gas in this wilderness  in due time i or somebody else would build a town  fuels power and if you could get it cheap youd find minerals that would pay for working  men with money in montreal and new york are looking for openings like this no place is too remote to build a railroad to if you can ensure freight  youre the most sanguine man i ever met blake commented  take care your optimism doesnt ruin you  i wonder harding went on whether clarke knows about this gas  on the whole i think it probable  we cant be very far from the stony camp and theres reason to believe hes been prospecting this district  its oil hes out for  how did the thing get lighted benson asked in an indifferent tone  harding smiled as he gave him a sharp glance  he had failed in his search for the gum and he did not expect his companions to share his enthusiasm over a new plan  they had however promised to support him and that was enough for he believed he might yet show them the way to prosperity  well he said i guess i cant blame you for not feeling very keen but thats not the point  i cant answer what you ask and i believe our forest wardens are now and then puzzled about how bush fires get started  we have crossed big belts of burned trees in a country where we saw no signs of indians  if this blower has been burning long the stonies must know of it blake said  isnt it curious that no news of it has reached the settlements  im not sure  they may venerate the thing and anyway theyre smart in some respects  they know that where the white men come their people are rounded up on reservations and i guess theyd rather have the whole country to themselves for trapping and fishing  then clarke may have persuaded them to say nothing  its possible blake agreed thoughtfully  well push on for their camp the first thing tomorrow     chapter xix  the deserted tepees  starting at daybreak they reached a hillside overlooking the stony village on the third afternoon  surrounded by willows and ragged spruces the conical tepees rose in the plain beneath but blake stopped abruptly as he caught sight of them  they were white to the apex where the escaping heat of the fire within generally melted the snow and no curl of smoke floated across the clearing  the village was ominously silent and had a deserted look  im very much afraid clarkes friends are not at home blake said with forced calm  well know more about it in half an hour that is if you think it worth while to go down  harding and benson were silent a moment struggling with their disappointment  they had made a toilsome journey to reach the village their food was nearly exhausted and it would cost them two days to return to the valley which was their best road to the south  now that were here we may as well spend another hour over the job harding decided  its possible they havent packed all their food along  his companions suspected that they were wasting time but they followed him down the hill until benson who was a short distance to one side of them called out  when they joined him he indicated a row of footsteps leading up the slope  that fellow hasnt been gone very long there was snow yesterday he said  by the line he took he must have passed near us  i wonder why he stayed on after the others  blake examined the footsteps carefully and compared them with the impress of his own snowshoes  its obvious that they cant be older than yesterday afternoon he said  from their depth and sharpness i should judge that the fellow was carrying a good load which probably means that he meant to be gone some time  the stride suggests a white man  clarke said harding  he seems to be up here pretty often though i cant see how hed do much prospecting in the winter  its possible blake replied  but im anxious to find out whether theres anything to eat in the tepees  they hurried on and when they reached the village they discovered only a few skins in the first tent  then separating they eagerly searched the others without result and when they met again they were forced to the conclusion that there was no food in the place  it was about three oclock and a threatening afternoon  the light was dim and a savage wind blew the snow about  the three men stood with gloomy faces in the shelter of the largest tepee feeling that luck was hard against them  these northern indians often have to put up with short rations while the snow lies benson remarked  no doubt they set off for some place where games more plentiful when they found their grub running out and as theyve all gone the chances are that they wont come back soon  weve had our trouble for nothing but we may as well camp here  with a big fire going one could make this tepee warm  blake and harding felt strongly tempted to agree  the cold had been extreme the last few nights and weary and scantily fed as they were they craved shelter  still they had misgivings  we have wasted too much time already blake said with an effort and theres only a few days rations in the bag  we have got to get back to the valley and we ought to make another three hours march before we stop  yes harding slowly assented i guess that would be wiser  setting off at once they wearily struggled up the hill and it had been dark some time when they made camp in a hollow at the foot of a great rock  the rock kept off the wind and the spruces which grew close about it further sheltered them but blake told his companions to throw up a snow bank while he cut wood  im afraid were going to have an unusually bad night and we may as well take precautions he said  his forecast proved correct for soon after they had finished supper a cloud of snow swept past the hollow and the spruces roared among the rocks above  then there was a crash and the top of a shattered tree plunged down between the men and fell on the edge of the fire scattering a shower of sparks  another foot would have made a difference to two of us harding said coolly  however its fallen where it was wanted help me heave the thing on  it crackled fiercely as the flame licked about it  sitting between the snowbank and the fire the men kept fairly warm but a white haze drove past their shelter and eddying in now and then covered them with snow  in an hour the drifts were level with the top of the bank but this was a protection and they were thankful that they had found such a camping place for death would have been the consequence of being caught in the open  the blizzard gathered strength but though they heard the crash of broken trees through the roar of the wind no more logs fell and after a while they went to sleep secure in the shelter of the rock  when day broke it was long past the usual hour and the cloud of driving flakes obscured even the spruces a few yards away  the hollow at the foot of the crag was shadowy and the snow had piled up several feet above the bank and lapped over at one end  still with wood enough they could keep warm and had their supplies been larger they would have been content to rest  as things were however they were confronted with perhaps the gravest peril that threatens the traveler in the norththe possibility of being detained by bad weather until their food ran out  none of them spoke of this but by tacit agreement they made a very sparing breakfast and ate nothing at noon  when night came and the storm still raged their hearts were very heavy  it lasted three days and on the fourth morning it seemed scarcely possible to face the somewhat lighter wind and break a trail through the fresh snow  however they dare risk no further delay  strapping on their packs they struggled up the range  at nightfall they were high among the rocks and it was piercingly cold but they got a few hours sleep in a clump of junipers and struck the valley late the next day  finding shelter they made camp and after dividing a small bannock between them they sat talking gloomily  their fire had been lighted to lee of a cluster of willows and it burned sulkily because the wood was green  pungent smoke curled about them and they shivered in the draughts  how far do you make it to the logging camp benson asked  im taking it for granted that the lumber gangs still there  a hundred and sixty miles said blake  and we have food enough for two days say forty miles  about that it depends on the snow  benson made no answer and harding was silent a while sitting very still with knitted brows  i cant see any way out he said at last  can you  well blake answered quietly well go on as long as we are able though i havent had a rosy time i have faith in my luck  conversation languished after this  the men had a small cake of tobacco left and they sat smoking and hiding their fears while the wind moaned among the willows and thin snow blew past  the camp was exposed and hungry and dejected as they were they felt the stinging cold  after an hour of moody silence harding suddenly leaned forward with a lifted hand  whats that he said sharply  didnt you hear it  for a few moments they heard only the rustle of the willows and the swishing sound of driven snow then a faint patter caught their ears and a crack like the snapping of a whip  a dog team cried benson  springing to his feet he set up a loud shout  it was answered in english and while they stood shaken by excitement and intense relief several low shadowy shapes emerged from the gloom then a tall figure appeared and after it two more  somebody shouted harsh orders in uncouth french the dogs sped toward the fire and stopped  their driver hurrying after them began to loose the traces while another man walked up to blake  we saw your fire and thought wed make for it he explained  i see your cooking outfits still lying round  its at your service blake responded  im sorry we cant offer you much supper though theres a bit of a bannock and some flour  well soon fix that the man declared  guess youre up against it but our grubs holding out he turned to the driver  come and tend to the cooking when youre through emile  though the order was given goodhumoredly there was a hint of authority in his voice and the man to whom he spoke quickened his movements  then another man came up and while the dogs snapped at each other and rolled in the snow the halfbreed driver unloaded a heavy provision bag and filled hardings fryingpan  dont spare it said the first comer  i guess these men are hungry fix up your best menoo  sitting down by the fire shapeless in his whitened coat with his bronzed face half hidden by his big fur cap he had nevertheless a soldierly look  youre wondering who we are he asked genially  oh no blake smiled  i can make a guess theres a stamp on you i recognize  youre from regina  youve hit it first time  im sergeant lane rnwmp  thishe indicated his companionis private walthew  weve been up on a special patrol to copper lake and left two of the boys there to make some inquiries about the indians  now were on the back trail  he looked as if he expected the others to return his confidence and blake had no hesitation about doing so  he knew the high reputation of the royal northwest mounted police a force of wellmounted and carefully chosen frontier cavalry  its business is to keep order on a vast stretch of plain to watch over adventurous settlers who push out ahead of the advancing farming community and to keep a keen eye on the reservation indians  men from widely different walks of life serve in its ranks and the private history of each squadron is rich in romance but one and all are called upon to scour the windy plains in the saddle in the fierce summer heat and to make adventurous sled journeys across the winter snow  their patrols search the lonely north from hudson bay to the mackenzie living in the open in arctic weather and the peaceful progress of western canada is due largely to their unrelaxing vigilance blake gave them a short account of their journey and explained his partys present straits  well said the sergeant i figure that we have provisions enough to see us down to the settlements all right and well be glad of your company  the stronger the party the smoother the trail and after what youve told me i guess you can march  where did you find the halfbreed benson asked  your chiefs at regina dont allow you hired packers  they surely dont  hes a hudson bay man working his passage  going back to his friends somewhere about lake winnipeg and decided hed come south with us and take the cars to selkirk  i was glad to get him im not smart at driving dogs  we found it hard to understand the few indians we met said harding the farther north you go the worse it must be  how will the fellows you left up yonder get on  the sergeant laughed  when we want a thing done we can find a man in the force fit for the job  one of the boys i took up can talk to them in cree or assiniboin and it wouldnt beat us if they spoke hebrew or greek  theres a trooper in my detachment who knows both  benson did not doubt this  he turned to private walthew whose face upon which the firelight fell suggested intelligence and refinement  what do you specialize in  farriery answered the young man he might have added that extravagance had cut short his career as veterinary surgeon in the old country  knows a horse all over outside and in sergeant lane interposed  i allow thats why they sent him when i asked for a good dog driver though in a general way our bosses arent given to joking  walthew will tell you theres a difference between physicking a horse and harnessing a sled team  its marked walthew agreed with a chuckle  when i first tried to put the traces on i thought theyd eat me  even now i have some trouble and ill venture to remind my superior that hed be short of some of his fingers if they didnt serve us out good thick mittens  thats right admitted lane goodhumoredly  im sure no good at dogs  if youre going to drive them you want to speak karalit or french  plain english cussins no blame use  emile announced that supper was ready and the police watched their new acquaintances devour it with sympathetic understanding for they had more than once covered long distances on very short rations in the arctic frost  afterward they lighted their pipes and emile being tactfully encouraged told them in broken english stories of the barrens  these were so strange and gruesome that it was only because they had learned something of the wilds that harding and his friends could believe him  had they been less experienced they would have denied that flesh and blood could bear the things the halfbreed calmly talked about  while emile spoke there broke out behind the camp a sudden radiance which leaped from the horizon far up the sky  it had in it the scintillation of the diamond for the flickering brilliance changed from pure white light to evanescent blue and rose  spreading in a vast irregular arc it hung like a curtain wavering to and fro and casting off luminous spears that stabbed the dark  for a time it blazed in transcendental splendor then faded and receded dying out with unearthly glimmering far back in the lonely north  thats pretty fine lane commented mildly  blake smiled but made no answer  he and his comrades were getting drowsy and although a stinging wind swept the camp and the green wood burned badly they were filled with a serene content  the keen bodily craving was satisfied they had eaten and could sleep and it looked as if their troubles were over  the dogs were obviously fit for travel for they were still engaged in a vigorous quarrel over some caribou bones the toil of the journey would be lightened by carrying their loads on the sled and the party was strong enough to assist any member of it whose strength might give way  there was no reason to apprehend any difficulty in reaching the settlements and in their relief at the unexpected rescue their thoughts went no farther  after the hunger and the nervous strain they had borne they were blissfully satisfied with their present ease  there would be time enough to consider the future  sergeant lane got up and shook the snow from his blanket  ive seen a better fire boys but ive camped with none at all on as cold a night he said  so far as i can figure we have grub enough but now that there are three more of us we dont want to lose time youll be ready to pull out by seven in the morning  they lay down in the most comfortable places they could find and slept soundly although once during the night harding was awakened by a dog that crept up to him for warmth     chapter xx  a startling discovery  it was getting light the next morning when the reinforced party entered a belt of thicker timber where they first clearly realized the fury of the storm  the trees were small and sprang from a frozen muskeg so that they could not be uprooted but the gale had snapped the trunks and laid them low in swaths  even in the spots where some had withstood its force the ground was strewn with split and broken branches and to lee of them the snow had gathered in billowy drifts the scene of ruin impressed the men who were forced to make long rounds in search of a passage for the sled  about as fierce a blizzard as i remember sergeant lane remarked we were held up three days and thought ourselves lucky in making a ravine with a steep bank but the wind couldnt have been quite so strong back north a piece  thered have been two names less on the roster if wed been caught down here  harding thought this was probable  he had had a protecting rock at his back but in the valley there was no shelter from the storm that had leveled the stoutest trees  even the fourfooted inhabitants of the wilds could hardly have escaped  as he stumbled among the wreckage harding thought about the man whose footsteps they had seen near the indian village  unless he had found some secure retreat he must have had to face the fury of the gale  harding felt convinced that the man was clarke  it was curious that he should have been living alone among the empty tepees but harding imagined that he was in some way accountable for the indians departure and he wondered where he was going when he crossed the range  there was a mystery about the matter and if an explanation could be arrived at it would be of interest to him and his friends  even before clarke had sent them into the muskeg when he knew it was practically impassable harding had entertained a deep distrust of him  blake called him to help in dragging the sled over an obstacle and the difficulties of the way afterward occupied his attention  when they found clearer ground they made good progress and late in the afternoon seeing a rocky spur running out from the hillside they headed for it to look for a sheltered camping place  there was still some daylight but a cold wind had sprung up blowing the loose snow into their faces  as they neared the spur the dogs swerved as if attracted by something and the halfbreed struck the nearest dog and drove them on  that was curious said private walthew  it was old chasseur who led them off and hes not given to playing tricks  a dead mink or beaver in the snow the sergeant suggested  i didnt notice anything but they have a keen scent  anyhow lets get into camp  they found a nook among the rocks and emile loosed the dogs and threw them some frozen fish while the men had supper  it was a heavy lowering evening and the bitter air was filled with the murmur of the spruces as the wind passed over them  though the light was fading they kept their sharpness of outline rising black and ragged from a sweep of chill lifeless gray  when the meal was nearly finished lane looked round the camp  where are the dogs he asked  theyre very quiet  i leaf zem la bas explained emile waving his hand toward a neighboring hollow  then moving a few paces forward he exclaimed ah les coquins  looks as if theyd bolted walthew said  i think i know where to find them  he left the camp with emile and presently they heard the halfbreed threatening the dogs then walthews voice reached them and there was a hoarse and urgent tone in it  springing up they ran back along the trail and found emile keeping off the dogs while walthew bent over a dark object that lay half revealed in the clawed up snow  at first harding saw only a patch or two of ragged fur that looked as if it belonged to an animal then with a shock he caught the outline of a mans shoulder and arm  the rest of the party gathered round breathless after their haste and when lane spoke there was grave authority in his voice  give me a hand boys  we have to get him out  they did so with mingled compassion and reluctance though harding was sensible of a curious strained expectation  soon the body lay clear of the snow and the dim light fell on the frozen face  its clarke blake cried  sure said harding gravely  im not surprised  then you knew him  lanes tone was sharp  benson answered him  yes i knew him pretty well  he lived at sweetwater where were going  i can give you any particulars you want  ill ask you later  the sergeant knelt down and carefully studied the dead mans pose  looks as if hed been caught in the blizzard and died of exposure but thats a thing ive got to ascertain  ill want somebodys help in getting him out of this big coat  none of them volunteered but when lane gave walthew a sharp order blake and harding joined them and harding afterward held the fur coat blake noticed that he folded and arranged it on his arm with what seemed needless care though he first turned his back toward the others  lane was now engaged in examining the body and the men stood watching him impressed by the scene  all round the narrow opening the spruces rose darkly against the threatening sky and in its midst the sergeant bent over the still form  it made a dark blot on the pale glimmer of the snow and the white patch of the face was faintly distinguishable in the fading light  the spruce tops stirred shaking down loose snow which fell with a soft patter and the wind blew trails of it about  i can find nothing wrong lane said at last  considering that you came across the man lying frozen after one of the worst storms you remember what did you expect to find harding asked  well the sergeant answered dryly its my duty to make investigations  though i didnt think it likely there might have been a knife cut or a bullet hole  one of you had better bring up the sled we cant break this ground without dynamite but there are some loose rocks along the foot of the spur  the sled was brought and clarke was gently placed on it wrapped in his fur coat  then they took the traces and started for the ridge where they built up a few stones above the hollow in which they laid him  it was quite dark when they had finished and lane made a gesture of relief  well he said thats done and hell lie safely there  rough on him but its a hard country and many a good man has left his bones in it  i guess well get back to camp  they crossed the snow in silence trailing the empty sled and for a while after they reached camp nobody spoke  lane sat near the fire where the light fell on the book in which he wrote with a pencil held awkwardly in his mittened hand while blake watched him and mused  he had no cause to regret clarkes death but he felt some pity for the man  gifted with high ability he had through no fault of his own been driven out of a profession in which he was keenly interested and made an outcast  his subsequent life had been a hard and evil one but it had ended in a tragic manner and this was made all the more impressive because blake and his companions had narrowly escaped the same fate  in spite of the cheerful fire the camp had a lonely air and blake shivered as he glanced at the gleaming snow and the dusky trees that shut it in  there was something in the desolate north that daunted him  hardings reflections also centered on the dead man and he had food for thought  there was a mystery to be explained  he imagined that he had a clue to it in his pocket though he could not follow it up for the present  he waited with some anxiety until lane closed his book  now said the sergeant there are one or two points i want explained and as you know the man its possible that you can help me how did he come to be here with only about three days rations  i can answer that said harding  he was in the habit of staying at the indian village we told you of  we saw tracks coming from it when we were there the day before the blizzard began  a white mans tracks  why did you go to the village  i believe they were  we went to look for provisions and didnt get them because the place was empty  then how do you account for the fellows being there alone  i cant account for it blake said quietly  lane turned to harding  the american had a theory but he was not prepared to communicate it to the police  its certainly curious he said evasively  well start for the village tomorrow  as the indians are away there wont be much to be learned benson suggested  they may have come back  anyway its my business to find out all i can  soon afterward they went to sleep and rising an hour or two before daylight they broke camp and turned back across the hills  the march was rough and toilsome and when they camped at night fatigue and drowsiness checked conversation but blake and his comrades were sensible of a difference in lanes manner  it had become reserved and he had a thoughtful look  reaching the village one evening they were surprised to find that some of the indians had returned  after supper lane summoned them into the tepee he occupied  emile interpreted but he had some difficulty in making himself understood for which harding was inclined to be thankful  the sergeant began by explaining the authority and business of the northwest police of whom it appeared one or two of the indians had heard  then he made emile ask them if they knew clarke  one of them said that they did and added that he stayed with them now and then lane next asked why they took him in and the indian hesitated  he was a big medicine man and cured us when we were ill he answered cautiously  do you know these white men lane asked indicating blakes party  an indian declared that they had never seen them though he added that it was known that they were in the neighborhood  being questioned about this he explained that about the time of clarkes arrival one of the tribe had come in from the north where he had met a halfbreed who told him that he had traveled some distance with three white men who were going to the settlements  knowing the country they had calculated that the white men could not be very far off  harding felt anxious  he saw where lanes questions led and realized that the sergeant meant to sift the matter thoroughly  there was not much cause to fear that he and his friends would be held responsible for clarkes death but he suspected things he did not wish the police to guess and the indians might mention having seen a white mans footprints on the occasion when he had forcibly taken clarke away owing perhaps to their difficulty in making themselves understood nothing however was said of this  how was it you left the white man in your village by himself lane asked  the indians began to talk to one another and it was with some trouble that emile at last elicited an answer  it is a thing that puzzles us said one  the white man came alone and told us he had seen tracks of caribou three days journey back  as we had no meat and our fish was nearly done six of us went to look for the deer  six of you  where are the rest  these tepees would hold a good many people  they are hunting farther north the indian explained  when we got to the place the white man told us of we could see no caribou tracks as he was a good hunter we thought this strange but we went on because there was another muskeg like the one he spoke of and we might not have understood him  then the snow came and we camped until it was over and afterward came back finding no deer  when we reached the tepees he had gone and we do not know what has become of him  we could not follow because the snow had covered his trail  he is dead lane said abruptly  i found him frozen a few days ago  their surprise was obviously genuine and lane was quick to notice signs of regret  he imagined that clarke had been a person of some importance among them  tell them i dont want them any more he said to emile and when the indians went out he turned to benson  give me all the information you are able to about the man  benson told him as much as he thought judicious and lane sat silent for a while  there is no reason to doubt that he came to his death by misadventure he decided  i dont quite understand what led him to visit these fellows but after all that doesnt count  it isnt very plain benson replied  is there anything else you wish to know  no said lane looking at him steadily  you can take it that this inquiry is closed well pull out the first thing tomorrow  he beckoned walthew  now that were here we may as well find out what we can about these fellows and how they live  it will fill up our report and they like that kind of information at regina  when the police had left the tepee harding turned to his companions with a smile  sergeant lane is a painstaking officer but his shrewdness has its limits and there are points he seems to have missed  it would have been wiser not to have let clarkes coat out of his hands until he had searched it  ah  blake exclaimed sharply  you emptied the pockets  i did  my action was hardly justifiable perhaps but i thought it better that the police shouldnt get on the track of matters that havent much bearing on clarkes death  i found two things and theyre both of interest to us  well take this one first  he drew out a metal flask and when he unstoppered it a pungent smell pervaded the tepee  crude petroleum he explained  i should imagine the flashpoint is low  i cant say how clarke got the stuff when the grounds hard frozen but here it is  isnt a low flashpoint a disadvantage benson asked  it must make the oil explosive  it does but all petroleums refined and the byproducts they take off which includes gasoline fetch a remarkably good price  shake a few drops on the end of a hot log and well see how it lights  a fire burned in a ring of stones in the middle of the tepee and benson carefully did as he was told  hardly had the oil fallen on the wood before it burst into flame  as i thought exclaimed harding  i suspect the presence of one or two distillates that should be worth as much as the kerosene  well get the stuff analyzed later but you had better stopper the flask because we dont want the smell to rouse lanes curiosity  the important point is that as ive reasons for believing the oil is fresh from the ground clarke must have found it shortly before the blizzard overtook him  that fixes the locality and we shouldnt have much trouble in striking the spot when we come back again  his eyes sparkled  its going to be well worth while this is a big thing  blake did not feel much elation  he had all along thought his comrade too sanguine though he meant to back him  in a way it was very hard luck for clarke he said  if youre right in your conclusions hes been searching for the oil for several years and now hes been cut off just when it looks as if hed found it  you dont owe him much pity  what would have happened if we hadnt met the police  its unpleasant to think of  no doubt wed have starved to death  a sure thing said harding  it hasnt struck you that this was what he meant us to do  blake started  are you making a bold guess or have you any ground for what youre saying  i see youll have to be convinced  very well in the first place the man would have stuck at nothing  ive already tried to show you that he had something to gain by bensons death  i suspected when we took you away from him that you were running a big risk benson  i was running a bigger one before that if you can call a thing a risk when the results inevitable benson replied  the pace i was going would have killed me in another year or two and even now im half afraid  he paused for a few moments with somber face and knitted brows  i believe youre right harding he went on thoughtfully but you havent told us how he proposed to get rid of me  im coming to that  there was however another member of this party who was in his way and he made his plans to remove you both  you mean me blake broke in  i dont see how hed profit by my death  first lets look at what he did  as soon as he reached the village he heard that we had started from the hudson bay post  it wouldnt be difficult to calculate how long the food we could carry would last and hed see that the chances were in favor of our calling at the village for provisions  presuming on that he sent his friends away to look for caribou which they couldnt find  they admitted that they were puzzled because he was a good hunter  then he cleared out by himself and i believe that if there was any food left in the place he carefully hid it  harding took out a letter and handed it to blake  that he said will show you how he would have profited  i found it in his pocket  blake started  it was colonel challoners handwriting and was addressed to clarke  read it benson advised its justifiable  blake read it aloud holding the paper near the fire where the light showed up the grimness of his face   in reply to your letter i have nothing further to say  i believe i have already made my intentions plain  it would be useless for you to trouble me with any further proposals   blake folded the letter and put it into his pocket before he spoke  i think i see he said very quietly  the man has been trying to bleed the colonel and has got his answer  is that all harding asked  well i believe it proves that your conclusions are right  i wont go into particulars but where my uncle and cousin are threatened im so to speak the leading witness for the defense and it wouldnt have suited clarke to let me speak  no doubt thats why he took rather drastic measures to put me out of the way  then you mean never to question the story of the indian affair  what do you know about it blake asked curtly  harding laughed  i know the truth  havent i marched and starved and shared my plans with you  if there had been any meanness in you wouldnt i have found it out  whats more benson knows what really happened and so does colonel challoner  how else could clarke have put the screw on him  he doesnt seem to have made much impression you have heard the colonels answer  blake frowned  well drop this subject  if challoner attached any importance to what you think clarke told him his first step would have been to send for me  i expect youll find a letter waiting for you at sweetwater harding replied  blake did not answer and soon afterward sergeant lane came in with walthew     chapter xxi  a matter of duty  the campfire burned brightly in a straggling bluff at the edge of the plain  the scattered trees were small and let in the cold wind and the men were gathered close round the fire in a semicircle on the side away from the smoke  sergeant lane held a notebook in his hand while emile repacked a quantity of provisions the weight of which they had been carefully estimating  the sergeants calculations were not reassuring and he frowned  the time we lost turning back to the stony village has made a big hole in our grub he said  guess well have to cut the menoo down and do a few more miles a day  our partys used to that blake answered with a smile  i suggest another plan  you have brought us a long way and sweetwaters a bit off your line  suppose you give us food enough to last us on half rations and let us push on  no sir said lane decidedly  we see this trip through together for another thing the dogs are playing out and after the way theyve served us i want to save them  with your help at the traces we make better time  blake could not deny this  the snow had been in bad condition for the last week and the men had relieved each other in hauling the sled the police camp equipment was heavy but it could not be thrown away for the men preferred some degree of hunger to lying awake at nights half frozen  moreover neither blake nor his comrades desired to leave their new friends and once more face the rigors of the wilds alone  then well have to make the best speed we can he said  they talked about the journey still before them for another hour  it was a clear night and very cold but there was a crescent moon in the sky  the wind had fallen the fragile twigs of the birches which shot up among the poplars were still and deep silence brooded over the wide stretch of snow  ah emile exclaimed suddenly  you hear someting  they did not though they listened hard but the halfbreed had been born in the wilderness and they could not think him mistaken  for a minute or two his pose suggested strained attention and then he smiled  white man come from ze sout  mais oui  he come sure ting  lane nodded  i guess hes right  i can hear it now but i cant figure on the kind of outfit  then blake heard a sound which puzzled him  it was not the quick patter of a dog team nor the sliding fall of netted shoes  the noise was dull and heavy and as the snow would deaden it whoever was coming could not be far away  bobsled emile exclaimed with scorn  vla la belle chose arrive ze great horse of ze plow  the fellows sure a farmer coming up with a clydesdale team lane laughed  one wouldnt have much trouble in following his trail  a few minutes later three men appeared carefully leading two big horses through the trees  saw your fire a piece back said one when they had hauled up a clumsy sled  im mighty glad to find you blake we were wondering how far we might have to go  then you came up after me tom exclaimed blake  you wouldnt have got much farther with that team but who sent you  i dont quite know  it seems that gardner got orders from somebody that you were to be found and he hired me and the boys  we had trouble in getting here but we allowed we could bring up more grub and blankets on the sled and we could send jake back with the team when we struck the thick bush  then we were going to make a cache and pack along as much stuff as we could carry  but i have a letter which may tell you something  blake opened it and harding noticed that his face grew intent but he put the letter into his pocket and turned to the man  its from a friend in england he said  you were lucky in finding me and well go back together in the morning  after attending to their horses the new arrivals joined the others at the fire and explained that at the hotelkeepers suggestion they had meant to head for the indian village and make inquiries on their way up at the logging camp  though blake talked to them he had a preoccupied look and harding knew that he was thinking of the letter he had however no opportunity for questioning him and he waited until the next day when emile whom they were helping chose a shorter way across a ravine than that taken by the police and the men with the bobsled  when they reached the bottom of the hollow blake told the halfbreed to stop and he took his comrades aside  theres something i must tell you he said  it was colonel challoner who sent the boys up from the settlement with food for us and he begs me to come home at once  thats a point on which id like your opinion but you shall hear what he has to say  sitting down on a log he began to read from his letter   a man named clarke whom you have evidently met lately called on me and suggested an explanation of the indian affair  as the price of his keeping silence on the subject he demanded that i should take a number of shares in a syndicate he is forming for the exploitation of some petroleum wells   it was a good offer harding interrupted  clarke must have had reason for believing he was about to make a big strike hed have kept quiet until he was sure of it   the fellows story was plausible blake continued reading  it seems possible that you have been badly wronged and i have been troubled  he omitted the next few lines and went on after giving the matter careful thought i feel that the man may have hit upon the truth  it would of course afford me the keenest satisfaction to see you cleared but the thing must be thoroughly sifted because  blake stopped and added quietly  he insists on my going home  his difficulty is obvious benson remarked  if you are blameless his son must be guilty  blake did not answer but sat musing with a disturbed expression there was now no sign of the men with the bobsled and no sound reached them from the plain above  emile stood patiently waiting some distance off and though they were sheltered from the wind it was bitterly cold  in some ways it might be better if i went home at once blake said at last  i could come back and join you as soon as i saw how things were going  the colonel would feel easier if i were with him but all the same im inclined to stay away  why harding asked  for one thing if i were there he might insist on taking some quite unnecessary course that would only cause trouble  im going to give you my opinion said harding curtly  i take it that your uncle is a man who tries to do the square thing  blakes face relaxed and his eyes twinkled  hes what you call white and as obstinate as theyre made  convince him that a things right and hell see it done no matter how many people it makes uncomfortable  thats why i dont see my way to encourage him  heres a man whos up against a point of honor he has i understand a long clean record and now hes prepared to take a course that may cost him dear  are you going to play a lowdown game on him to twist the truth sos to give him a chance for deceiving himself  arent you and benson taking what you mean by the truth too much for granted  harding gave him a searching look  i havent heard you deny it squarely youre a poor liar  its your clear duty to go back to england right away and see your uncle through with the thing he means to do  after all ill go to england blake answered with significant reserve  however wed better get on or we wont catch the others until theyve finished dinner  emile started the dogs and when they had toiled up the ascent they saw the men with the bobsled far ahead on the great white plain  we may not have another chance for a private talk until we reach the settlement blake said  what are you going to do about the petroleum  ill come back and prospect the muskeg as soon as the frost goes harding answered promptly  it will cost a good deal to do that thoroughly  we must hire transport for a full supply of all the tools and food we are likely to need one experience of the kind weve had this trip is enough  how are you going to get the money  im not going to the city men for it until our positions secure  the thing must be kept quiet until were ready to put it on the market  you were doubtful about taking me for a partner once benson interposed  i dont know that i could blame you but now i mean to do all i can to make the scheme successful and i dont think youll have as much reason for being afraid that i might fail you  call it a deal said harding  youre the man we want  i ought to be back before you start blake said and if i can raise any money in england ill send it over  youre satisfied that this is a project i can recommend to my friends  i believe its such a chance as few people ever get harding answered in a tone of firm conviction  then well see what can be done  it wont be your fault if the venture fails  harding smiled  theres hard work and perhaps some trouble ahead but you wont regret you faced it  youll be a rich man in another year or two  blake smiled at his enthusiasm  emile and the dogs are leaving us behind he said  well have to hustle     chapter xxii  the girl and the man  it was a clear winter afternoon and the sunshine that entered a window of the big hall at hazlehurst fell upon millicent as she sat in one of the recesses reading a book  blake thought she looked very beautiful as she raised her eyes and caught sight of him she started and dropping the book she rose with a tingle of heightened color while blake felt his heart beat fast  thrown off her guard as she had been he caught the gladness in her eyes before she could hide it  you are surprised at my turning up he asked holding her hand an unnecessarily long time and smiling into her eyes  the color was still in millicents cheeks and she was conscious of an unusual shyness but she tried to answer naturally  i knew that colonel challoner had given orders for you to be traced if possible and i knew that you had been found but that was all mrs keith told me  i suppose she didnt knowdidnt think i meanthat i was interested  i shall believe that was very foolish of her blake said softly with a question in his voice  millicent smiled  it really was foolish  but you must have some tea and wait until she comes  i dont think she will be long  she has gone out with mrs foster  the tea was brought in and millicent studied blake unobtrusively as he sat opposite her at the small table  he had grown thin his bronzed face was worn and he looked graver  she could not imagine his ever becoming very solemn but it was obvious that something had happened in canada which had had its effects on him  looking up suddenly blake surprised her attentive glance  you have changed she said  thats not astonishing blake laughed  we didnt get much to eat in the wilds and i was thinking how pleasant it is to be back again  he examined his prettily decorated cup  its remarkable how many things one can do without  in the bush we drank our tea when we had any out of a blackened can and the rest of our table equipment was similar  but well take it that the change in me is an improvement  it was an excuse for looking at her as if demanding a reply but she answered readily  in a sense it is  then i feel encouraged to continue starving myself  theres a limit extremes are to be avoided  but did you starve yourselves in canada  i must confess that the thing wasnt altogether voluntary  im afraid we were rather gluttonous when we got the chance  he smiled but millicents eyes were full of compassion  did you find what you were looking for she asked softly  no i think it was a serious disappointment for harding and i was very sorry for him at first  so am i millicent responded  it must have been very hard after leaving his wife alone and badly provided for and risking everything on his success  but why did you say you were sorry for him  arent you sorry now  though we didnt find what we were looking for we found something else which harding seems firmly convinced is quite as valuable  of course hes a bit of an optimist but it looks as if he were right this time  anyway im plunging on his scheme  you mean you will stake all you have on it  yes blake answered with a humorous twinkle  its true that what i have doesnt amount to much but im throwing in what i should like to getand thats a great deal  millicent noticed his expression suddenly grow serious  tell me about your adventures up in that wilderness she begged  oh he protested theyre really not interesting  let me judge  is it nothing to have gone where other men seldom venture  he began rather awkwardly but she prompted him with tactful questions and he saw that she wished to hear his story  by degrees he lost himself in his subject and being gifted with keen imagination she followed his journey into the wilds  it was not his wish to represent himself as a hero and now and then he spoke with deprecatory humor but he betrayed something of his character in doing justice to his theme  millicents eyes sparkled as she listened for she found the story moving he was the man she had thought him capable of grim endurance determined action and steadfast loyalty  so you carried your crippled comrade when you were exhausted and starving she exclaimed when he came to their search for the factory one likes to hear of such things as that  but what would you have done if you hadnt found the post  i cant answer he said soberly  we didnt dare think of it a starving mans will gets weak  then his expression grew whimsical besides if one must be accurate we dragged him  still said millicent softly i cant think you would have left him  something in her voice made blake catch his breath  she looked very alluring as she sat there with the last of the sunshine sprinkling gold over her hair and her face and her light gown  he leaned forward quickly and then he remembered his disgrace  im flattered miss graham he said but you really havent very strong grounds for your confidence in me  please go on with your story millicent begged disregarding his remark  how long did you stay at the factory  blake told of their journey back of the days when starvation faced them and of the blizzard though he made no reference to clarkes treachery and millicent listened with close attention  it grew dark but they forgot to ring for lights neither of them heard the door open when he was near the conclusion nor saw mrs keith entering quietly with mrs foster stop a moment in surprise  the room was shadowy but mrs keith could see the man leaning forward with an arm on the table and the girl listening with intent face  there was something that pleased her in the scene  as mrs keith moved forward millicent looked up quickly and blake rose  so you have come back mrs keith said  how was it you didnt go straight to sandymere where your uncle is eagerly awaiting you  i sent him a cablegram just before i sailed but on landing i found there was an earlier train  as he wont expect me for another two hours i thought id like to pay my respects to you  mrs keith smiled as she glanced at millicent  well im flattered she responded and as it happens i have something to say to you  mrs foster joined them and it was some time before mrs keith had a chance to take blake into the empty drawingroom  im glad you have come home she said abruptly  i think you are needed  that replied blake is how it seemed to me  his quietness was reassuring  mrs keith knew that he was to be trusted but she felt some misgivings about supporting him in a line of action that would cost him much  still she could not be deterred by compassionate scruples when there was an opportunity for saving her old friend from suffering  troubled by a certain sense of guilt but determined she tried to test his feelings  you didnt find waiting for us tedious she said lightly  i suppose you and millicent were deep in your adventures when we came inplaying othello and desdemona  blake laughed  as you compare me to the moor you must admit that i have never pretended to be less black than im painted  ah mrs keith exclaimed with marked gentleness  you neednt pretend to me dick  i have my own opinion about you  i knew you would come home as soon as you could be found  then you must know what has been going on in my absence  i have a strong suspicion  your uncle has been hard pressed by unscrupulous people with an end to gain  how much impression they have made on him i cannot tell but hes fond of you dick and in trouble its a cruel position for an honorable man with traditions like those of the challoners behind him  thats true i hate to think of it  you know what i owe to him and bertram  hes old continued mrs keith  it would be a great thing if he could be allowed to spend his last years in quietness  i fear thats impossible although perhaps to some extent it lies in your hands she looked steadily at blake  now that you have come back what do you mean to do  whatever is needful im for the defense  the colonels position cant be stormed while im on guard and this time therell be no retreat  dont add that dick it hurts me  im not so hard as i sometimes pretend  i never doubted your staunchness but i wonder whether you quite realize what the defense may cost you  have you thought about your future  you ought to know that the blakes never think of the future  were a happygolucky irresponsible lot  but suppose you wished to marry  its a difficulty that has already been pointed out  if i ever marry the girl i choose will believe in me in spite of appearances  in fact shell have to i have no medals and decorations to bring her  you have much thats worth more  mrs keith declared warmly moved by his steadfastness  still its a severe test for any girl  she laid her hand gently on his arm  in the end you wont regret the course you mean to take  i have lived a long while and have lost many pleasant illusions but i believe that loyalty like yours has its reward  i loved you for your mothers sake when you were a boy afterward when things looked blackest i kept my faith in you and now im proud that i did so  blake looked confused  confidence like yours is an embarrassing gift  it makes one feel that one must live up to it and that isnt easy  mrs keith regarded him affectionately  its yours dick given without reserve  but i think theres nothing more to be said and the colonel will be expecting you  they moved toward the hall as she spoke and when blake had gone mrs keith looked searchingly at millicent  the girls face shone with a happiness which she could not conceal she knew that blake loved her and she knew too that she loved blake but she was not ready to admit this to mrs keith     chapter xxiii  solving the problem  dinner was finished at sandymere miss challoner had gone out and in accordance with ancient custom the cloth had been removed from the great mahogany table  its glistening surface was broken only by a decanter two choice wineglasses and a tall silver candlestick lighting a cigar blake looked about while he braced himself for the ordeal that must be faced  he knew the big room well but its air of solemnity with which the heavy georgian furniture was in keeping impressed him  the ceiling had been decorated by a french artist of the eighteenth century and the faded delicacy of the design bearing as it did the stamp of its period helped to give the place a look of age  challoner could trace his descent much farther than his house and furniture suggested but the family had first come to the front in the east india companys wars and while maintaining its position afterward had escaped the modernizing influence of the countrys awakening in the early victorian days  it seemed to blake fresh from the new and democratic west that his uncle shrewd and wellinformed man as he was was very much of the type of wellingtons officers  for all that he pitied him  challoner looked old and worn and round his eyes there were wrinkles that hinted at anxious thought  his life was lonely his unmarried sister who spent much of her time in visits was the only relative who shared his home  now that age was limiting his activities and interests he had one great source of gratification the career of the soldier son who was worthily following in his steps  his nephew determined that this should be saved for him as he remembered the benefits he had received at the colonels hands  dick challoner said earnestly im very glad to see you home  i should like to think you have come to stay  thank you sir  ill stay as long as you need me  i feel that i need you altogether  its now doubtful whether bertram will leave india after all  his regiment has been ordered into the hills where theres serious trouble brewing and he has asked permission to remain  even if he comes home he will have many duties and i have nobody left  blake did not answer immediately and his uncle studied him  dick had grown thin but he looked very strong and the evening dress set off his fine muscular figure  his face was still somewhat pinched but its deep bronze and the steadiness of his eyes and the firmness of his lips gave him a very soldierly look and a certain air of distinction there was no doubt that he was true to the challoner type  i must go back sooner or later blake said slowly there is an engagement i am bound to keep  besides your pressing me to stay raises a question  the last time we met you acquiesced in my decision that i had better keep out of the country and i see no reason for changing it  the question must certainly be raised that is why i sent for you you can understand my anxiety to learn what truth there is in the story i have heard  it might be better if you told me all about it  very well the task is painful but it cant be shirked  challoner carefully outlined clarkes theory of what had happened during the night attack and blake listened quietly  of course challoner concluded the man had an obvious end to serve and i dare say he was capable of misrepresenting things to suit it ill confess that i found the thought comforting but i want the truth dick  i must do whats right  clarke once approached me about the matter but he will never trouble either of us again  i helped to bury him up in the wilds  dead exclaimed challoner  frozen  in fact it was not his fault that we escaped his fate  he set a trap for us intending that we should starve  but why  his motive was obvious  there was a man with us whose farm and stock would in the event of his death fall into clarkes hands and its clear that i was a serious obstacle in his way  cant you see that he couldnt use his absurd story to bleed you unless i supported it  challoner felt the force of this  he was a shrewd man but just then he was too disturbed to reason closely and he failed to perceive that his nephews refusal to confirm the story did not necessarily disprove it  that clarke had thought it worth while to attempt his life bulked most largely in his uncles eyes  he urged me to take some shares in a petroleum syndicate he said  then i believe you missed a good thing blake seized upon the change of topic  the shares would probably have paid you well  he found the oil and put us on the track of it though of course he didnt have any wish to do that  we expect to make a good deal out of the discovery  it looks like justice challoner declared  but we are getting away from the point  id better tell you that after my talk with the man i felt that he might be dangerous and that i must send for you  why didnt you send for bertram  challoner hesitated  when i cabled out instructions to find you there was no word of his leaving india then you must see how hard it would have been to hint at my suspicions  it would have opened a breach between us that could never be closed  yes said blake leaning forward on the table and speaking earnestly your reluctance was very natural  im afraid of presuming too far but i cant understand how you could believe this thing of your only son  it lies between my son and my nephew dick there was emotion in the colonels voice  i had a great liking for your father and i brought you up  then i took a keen pride in you there were respects in which i found you truer to our type than bertram  you heaped favors on me blake replied  that i bitterly disappointed you has been my deepest shame in fact its the one thing that counts  for the rest i cant regret the friends who turned their backs on me and poverty never troubled the blakes  but the taintthe stain on your name  i have the advantage of bearing it alone and to tell the truth it doesnt bother me much  that a man should go straight in the present is all they ask in canada and homeless adventurers with no possessionsthe kind of comrades ive generally metare charitable as a rule it wouldnt become them to be fastidious  anyway sir you must see the absurdity of believing that bertram could have failed in his duty in the way the tale suggests  i once felt that strongly the trouble is that the objection applies with equal force to you  do you deny the story this man told me  blake felt that his task was hard  he had to convict himself and he must do so logically challoner was by no means a fool  as he nerved himself to the effort he was conscious of a rather grim amusement  i think it would be better if i tried to show you how the attack was made  is the old set of indian chessmen still in the drawer  i believe so  it must be twenty years since they were taken out its strange you should remember them  a stirring of halfpainful emotions troubled blake  he loved the old house and all that it contained and had a deepseated pride in the challoner traditions  now he must make the colonel believe that he was a degenerate scion of the honored stock and could have no part in them  i have forgotten nothing at sandymere but we must stick to the subject  crossing the floor he came back with the chessmen which he carefully arranged setting up the white pawns in two separate ranks to represent bodies of infantry with the knights and bishops for officers  the colored pieces he placed in an irregular mass  now he began this represents the disposition of our force pretty well  i was here at the top of the ravinehe laid a cigar on the table to indicate the spotbertram on the ridge yonder  this bunch of red pawns stands for the ghazee rush  it agrees with what ive heard said challoner surveying the roughly marked scene of battle with critical eyes  you were weak in numbers but your position was strong   it could have been held  blake began to move the pieces  the ghazees rolled straight over our first line my mine which might have checked them wouldnt go offa broken circuit in the firing wires i suppose  we were hustled out of the trenches it was too dark for effective rifle fire  the trench the second detachment held should have been difficult to rush  but blake insisted you must remember that the beggars were ghazees theyre hard to stop  then our men were worn out and had been sniped every night for the last week or two  however the buglers the key to my explanation ill put this dab of cigar ash here to represent him  this bishops bertram and you can judge by the distance whether the fellow could have heard the order to blow cease fire through the row that was going on  he resumed his quick moving of the chessmen accompanying it by a running commentary  heres another weak point in the tale which must be obvious to any one who has handled troops these fellows couldnt have gained a footing in this hollow because it was raked by our fire  there was no cover and the range was short  then you see the folly of believing that the section with which the bugler was could have moved along the ridge they couldnt have crossed between the ghazees and the trench theyd have been exposed to our own fire in the rear  he added more to much the same effect and then swept the chessmen up into a heap and looked at his companion  i think you ought to be convinced he said  it all turns upon the buglers movements challoner contended  and he was killed  ive tried to show you that he couldnt have been where clarkes account had him  challoner was silent for a while and blake watched him anxiously until he looked up  i think you have succeeded dick though i feel that with a trifling alteration here and there you could have cleared yourself  now well let the painful matter drop for good unless indeed some fresh light is ever thrown on it  that cant happen blake declared staunchly  challoner rose and laid a hand on his arm  if you were once at fault you have since shown yourself a man of honor  though the thing hurt me at the time im glad you are my nephew  had there been any baseness in you some suspicion must always have rested on your cousin  well we are neither of us sentimentalists but i must say that you have amply made amends  he turned away and blake went out into the open air to walk up and down  the face of the old house rose above him dark against the clear night sky in front the great oaks in the park rolled back in shadowy masses  blake loved sandymere he had thought of it often in his wanderings and now he was glad that through his action his cousin would enjoy it without reproach  after all it was some return to make for the favors he had received  for himself there remained the charm of the lonely trail and the wide wilderness  for all that he had been badly tempted  poverty and disgrace were serious obstacles to marriage and had he been free to do so he would eagerly have sought the hand of millicent graham  it was hard to hold his longing for her in check  however harding was confident that they were going to be rich and that would remove one of his disadvantages thinking about the girl tenderly he walked up and down the terrace until he grew calm and then he went in to talk to miss challoner     chapter xxiv  a womans advice  a fortnight later blake met millicent in a fieldpath and turned back with her to hazlehurst  it was a raw day and the wind had brought a fine color into the girls face and she wore a little fur cap and furtrimmed jacket which he thought became her very well  you have not been over often she said mr foster was remarking about it  blake had kept away for fear of his resolution melting if he saw much of her  my uncle seems to think he has a prior claim he explained and i may not be able to stay with him long  you are going back to canada  the quick way the girl looked up and something in her tone suggested unpleasant surprise for she had been taken off her guard  i shall have to go when harding needs me  i havent heard from him since i arrived but ill get my summons sooner or later  i thought you had come home for good millicents color deepened and she added quickly do you like the life in the northwest  it has its charm  there are very few restrictionsone feels free the fences havent reached us yet you can ride as far as you can see over miles of grass and through the clumps of bush  theres something attractive in the wide horizon the riband of trail that seems to run forward forever draws you on  but the arctic frost and the snow  after all theyre bracing  our board shacks with the big stoves in them are fairly warm and no one can tell what developments may suddenly come about in such a country  a railroad may be run through wheatland opened up minerals found and wooden cities spring up from the empty plain  lifes rapid and strenuous one is swept along with the stream  but you were in the wilds  blake laughed  we were indeed but not far behind us the tide of population pours across the plain and if we had stayed a year or two in the timber it would have caught us up  that flood wont stop until it reaches the polar sea  but how can people live in a rugged land covered with snow that melts only for a month or two  the climate doesnt count so long as the country has natural resources  one hears of precious metals and some are being mined he paused and added in a tone of humorous confidence my partner believes in oil  they were now close to hazlehurst and as they left the highway mrs keith joined them  dick she said laying her hand affectionately on his arm i have had a talk with your uncle  you have convinced him thoroughly and have taken a great load off his mind  admiration shone in her eyes none of the challoners ever did so fine a thing dick  blake felt embarrassed and millicents face glowed with pride in him no further reference was made to the subject however and he spent a pleasant hour in the great hall at hazlehurst where mrs keith left him with millicent when tea was brought in  that night blake sat with challoner in the library at sandymere  the colonel was in a big leather chair near a good fire but he had a heavy rug wrapped about him and it struck blake that he looked ill  he turned and regarded blake affectionately  you have been a good nephew dick and since you came home i have felt that i ought to make some provision for you  that of course was my intention when you were young but when the break occurred you cut yourself adrift and refused assistance  blake colored for there were he thought adequate reasons why he should take no further favors from his uncle  if the truth about the frontier affair ever came out it would look as if he had valued his honor less than the money he could extort and the colonel would bear the stigma of having bought his silence  im grateful sir but i must still refuse he said  im glad you made me the offer because it shows i havent forfeited your regard but im sorry i cannot consent  have you any plan for the future  my partner has blake answered smiling  i leave that kind of thing to him  i told you about the oil  yes and clarke had something to say on the subject  however he gave me to understand that capital was needed  that is true blake replied unguardedly for he did not see where his uncles remark led  boring plant is expensive and transport costs something  then you have to spend a good deal beforehand if you wish to float a company  but you believe this venture will pay you  harding is convinced of it and hes shrewd  personally i dont know enough about the business to judge but if i had any money to risk id take his word for it  challoner made no reply and when blake left him he grew thoughtful his nephews demonstration with the chessmen had lifted a weight off his mind but he was troubled by a doubt about the absolute correctness of his explanation  moreover when he dwelt upon it the doubt gathered strength but there was nothing that he could do dick obviously meant to stick to his story and bertram could not be questioned  in the meanwhile blake sought miss challoner  i dont think my uncles looking well  mightnt it be better to send for dr onslow he said  he wouldnt be pleased miss challoner answered dubiously  still he sometimes enjoys a talk with onslow whos a tactful man  if he looked in as it were casually  yes assented blake well give him a hint  ill send the groom with a note at once  the doctor came and left without expressing any clear opinion but when he returned the next day he ordered challoner to bed and told blake he feared a sharp attack of pneumonia  his fears were justified for it was several weeks before challoner was able to leave his room during his illness he insisted on his nephews company whenever the nurses would allow it and when he began to recover he again begged him to remain at sandymere  he had come to lean upon the younger man and he entrusted him with all the business of the estate which he no longer was able to attend to  dick he said one day when blake thought he was too ill to perceive that he was casting a reflection on his son i wish my personal means were larger so that i could give bertram enough and leave sandymere to you then id know the place would be in good hands  on the surface youre a happygolucky fellow but thats deceptive  in reality you have a surprising grip of thingshowever you know my opinion of you but you wont go away dick  the nurse interrupted them and blake was glad that he had written to harding stating his inability to rejoin him  a week or two later he had received a cable message no hurry  when spring came he was still at sandymere for challoner got better very slowly and would not let his nephew go  blake saw millicent frequently during those days  at first he felt that it was a weakness as he had nothing to offer her except a tainted name but his love was getting beyond control and his resistance feebler  after all he thought the story of the indian disaster must be almost forgotten and harding had a good chance for finding the oil  if he had not already started for the north he would do so soon but blake had had no news from him since his cabled message  then after a quiet month blake suggested that as the colonel was getting stronger again he ought to go back to canada  if you feel that you must go ill have to consent challoner said  i have a duty to my partner  its probable that he has already set off but i know where to find him and therell be plenty to do  for one thing as transport is expensive well have to relay our supplies over very rough country and that means the same stage several times then i dont suppose harding will have been able to buy very efficient boring plant  he may have done better than you imagine challoner suggested with a smile  a man as capable as he seems to be would somehow get hold of what was needful  blake was surprised at this because his uncle understood their financial difficulties  well theres a fast boat next saturday he said  i think ill go by her  wait another week to please me challoner urged him  you have had a dull time since ive been ill and now id like you to get about  i shall miss you badly dick  blake agreed  he felt that he ought to have sailed earlier but the temptation to remain was strong  he now met millicent every day and it might be a very long time before he returned to england  he feared that he was laying up trouble for himself but he recklessly determined to make the most of the present and in spite of his misgivings the next eight or nine days brought him many delightful hours  now that she knew he was going millicent abandoned the reserve she had sometimes shown  she was sympathetic interested in his plans and he thought altogether charming  they were rapidly drawn closer together and the more he learned of her character the stronger his admiration grew  at times he imagined he noticed a tender shyness in her manner and though it delighted him he afterward took himself to task  he was not acting honorably he had no right to win this girls love as he was trying to do but there was the excuse that she knew his history and it had not made her cold to him  mrs keith looked on with observant eyes  she had grown very fond of her companion and she made many opportunities for throwing the two together  one afternoon a day or two before blakes departure she called millicent into her room  have you ever thought about your future she asked her abruptly  not often since i have been with you millicent answered  before that it used to trouble me  then im afraid youre imprudent  you have no relatives you could look to for help and while my health is pretty good i cant of course live for ever  i might leave you something but it would not be much because my property is earmarked for a particular purpose  millicent wondered where this led but mrs keith went on abruptly  as you have found out i am a frank old woman and not afraid to say what i think  now i want to ask you a question  if you liked a man who was far from rich would you marry him  it would depend millicent replied with the color flaming up in her cheeks  why do you ask  i cant give you a general answer  then give me a particular one i want to know  the girl was embarrassed but she had learned that her employer was not to be put off easily  i suppose his being poor wouldnt daunt me if i loved him enough  then well suppose something else  if he had done something to be ashamed of  millicent looked up with a flash in her eyes  people are so ready to believe the worst  he did nothing that he need blush forthats impossible  then she saw the trap into which her generous indignation had led her but instead of looking down in confusion she boldly faced mrs keith  yes she added if he wanted me i would marry him in spite of what people are foolish enough to think  and you would not regret it  mrs keith laid her hand on the girls arm with a caressing touch  my dear if you value your happiness you will tell him so  remember that he is going away in a day or two  how can i tell him millicent cried with burning face  i onlyi mean you tricked me into telling you  it shouldnt be difficult to give him a tactful hint and that wouldnt be a remarkably unusual course mrs keith smiled  the idea that a proposal comes quite spontaneously is to some extent a convention nowadays  i dont suppose you need reminding that we dine at sandymere tomorrow  millicent made no reply she seemed rather overwhelmed by her employers frankness and mrs keith took pity on her and let her go with a final bit of advice  think over what i told you  millicent thought of nothing else  she knew that blake loved her and she believed that she understood why he had not declared himself  now he might go away without speaking  it was hateful to feel that she must make the first advances and reveal her tenderness for him  she felt that she could not do so and yet the alternative seemed worse     chapter xxv  love and victory  millicent accompanied mrs keith to sandymere in a troubled mood and dinner was a trying function  she sat next to foster and she found it hard to smile at his jokes and she noticed that blake was unusually quiet  it was his last evening in england  when they went into the drawingroom challoner sat talking with her for a while and then she was asked to sing  an hour passed before blake had an opportunity for exchanging a word with her  theyll make you sing again if you stay here he said softly  she understood that he wanted her to himself and she thrilled at something in his voice  youre interested in eastern brasswork i think he went on  i hardly know said millicent  i havent seen much of it  she was vexed with herself for her prudish weakness  an opportunity that might never be repeated was offered her and she could not muster the courage to seize it  blake however did not seem daunted  you said you were delighted with the things my uncle showed you the last time you were here and a friend has just sent him a fresh lot from benares  he gave her an appealing look  it struck me you might like to see them  the blood crept up into millicents face but she answered with forced calm  yes i really think i should  will you give me the key to the indian collection blake asked challoner  here it is said the colonel and then turned to mrs keith  that reminds me you havent seen my new treasures yet  dryhurst has lately sent me some rather good things among others theres a small buddha exquisitely carved  shall we go and look at them  mrs keith felt angry with him for a marplot  wouldnt it be better to wait until im here in the daylight  if i try to examine anything closely with these spectacles they strain my eyes  ive had a new lamp placed in front of the case challoner persisted and mrs keith found it hard to forgive him for his obtuseness  very well she said in a resigned tone and when millicent and blake had gone out she walked slowly to the door with challoner  they were halfway up the staircase which led rather sharply from the hall when she stopped and grasped the banister  its obvious that you have recovered she said  i certainly feel much better but what prompted your remark  these stairs  you dont seem to feel them but if you expect me to run up and down youll have to make them shallower and less steep ive been up twice since i came  i must confess to a weakness in my knee  challoner gave her a sharp glance  im sorry he said  mrs foster mentioned something about your not walking much i should have remembered  its the weather i find the damp troublesome  if you dont mind i think well go down  challoner gave her his arm and millicent standing in the picture gallery noticed their return  she suspected that it was the result of some maneuver of mrs keiths intended for her advantage and she tried to summon her resolution  the man she loved would sail the next day believing that his poverty and the stain he had not earned must stand between them unless she could force herself to give him a hint to the contrary  this was the only sensible course but she timidly shrank from it  blake unlocked a glass case and taking out two shelves he carefully laid them on a table  there they are he said with a rather nervous smile  ive no doubt the things are interesting and if our friends come up they can look at them  but it wasnt benares brassware that brought me up here  wasnt it millicent asked demurely  certainly not  one couldnt talk with foster enlarging upon the only rational way of rearing pheasants  he paused a moment  you know im going away the first thing tomorrow he added softly  yes i know  im sorry  truly sorry  you mean that  he gave her a searching glance and then laid his hand on her shoulder holding her a little away from him  dear little girl he said you dont know what a struggle it is between the knowledge of the duty i owe you and my own selfish longingmy uncontrollable longing for you  you are very young and beautiful and i love youbut i am a broken man  does that matter when it is through no fault of yours  she smiled up at him as she spoke  for one instant he hesitated then all his good resolutions forgotten he gathered the girl in his arms  millicent he breathed  then after a long silence well laugh at coldblooded prudence and take our chances  its a wide world and well find a nook somewhere if we go out and look for it  all my care will be to smooth the trail for you dear  they spent a halfhour in happy talk and blake murmured when millicent protested that they must go back and she feared that her lovers exultant air would betray them as they entered the drawingroom  wheres the key challoner asked  im afraid i forgot it sir blake confessed  very sorry but im not even sure i put the things away  challoner rang a bell and gave an order to a servant  did you see the buddha he asked millicent  no she said  i dont think so  or the brass plate with the fantastic serpent pattern round the rim  im afraid i didnt millicent answered in confusion  challoner looked hard at blake and then his eyes twinkled  well he laughed perhaps it wasnt to be expected  there was a moments silence  millicent looked down with the color in her face blake stood very straight smiling at the others  we are all friends here he said and im proud to announce that millicent has promised to marry me as soon as i return from canada he bowed to mrs keith and the colonel  as you have taken her guardians place madam and you sir are the head of the house i should like to think we have your approval  how formal dick mrs keith laughed  i imagine that my consent is very much a matter of form but i give it with the greatest satisfaction  challoner put one arm round millicent  my dear i am very glad and i think dick has shown great wisdom  i wish you both all happiness  mrs foster and her husband offered their congratulations and for the next hour they discussed blakes future plans  then they were interrupted by the entrance of a servant with a small silver tray  cablegram sir for mr blake he said  hopkins was at the postoffice and they gave it to him  blake took the envelope and looked at miss challoner for permission to open it  when he had read it he started and gave the cablegram to millicent  oh dick she cried with sparkling eyes  how splendid  blake explained to the others  its from my partner in canada and im sure youll be interested to bear it  he read the message aloud come  struck it  tell challoner  he folded the paper and replaced it in its envelope  i dont understand the last part of it he said to challoner  why does he wish you to know  the colonel chuckled  i sent mr harding five hundred pounds to buy anything he needed for his prospecting and told him to give me an option on a good block of shares in the new syndicate at par  youre very independent dick but i cant see why you should object to your relatives putting money into what looks like a promising thing  ive no doubt it was mainly through your help that harding found the oil blake said gratefully  soon afterward the fosters rose to go but they waited a few moments in the hall while millicent lingered with blake in the drawingroom  dick she said blushing in a way that he thought quite charming you made a rash statement  i didnt really promise to marry you as soon as you came back  then it was understood blake answered firmly  and i shant let you off  well if it will bring you home any quicker dear  but how long must you stay  i cant tell there may be much to do  if harding needs me i must see him out  but i wont delay a minute more thans needful you may be sure  you know we may have to live in canada  i wont object  where you are will be home she said shyly and once more he gathered her to him  blake sailed the next day and he found on reaching the timber belt that there was much to be done  after some months of hard work harding left him in charge while he set off for the cities to arrange about pipes and plant and the raising of capital  it was early winter when he returned satisfied with what he had accomplished and confident that the oil would pay handsomely and blake saw that he would be able to visit england in a few weeks  he was sitting in their office shack one bitter day when a sled arrived with supplies and the teamster brought him a cablegram  his face grew grave as he read it aloud to harding  bertram killed in action  challoner  that sets you free doesnt it harding asked after expressing his sympathy  i cant tell blake answered  i havent thought of it in that light  i was very fond of my cousin   when blake reached england millicent met him at the station  mrs keith she told him had taken a house near sandymere  she looked grave when he asked about his uncle  im afraid you will see a marked change in him dick  he has not been well since you left and the news of bertrams death was a shock  she was with him when he met challoner who looked very frail and forlorn  its a comfort to see you back dick you are all i have now he said and went on with a break in his voice after all it was a good end my boy madea very daring thing  the place was supposed to be unassailable by such a force as he had but he stormed it  in spite of his fondness for painting he was true to the strain  when blake was alone with millicent in the dimly lighted drawingroom he took her into his arms very gently  my secret must still be kept dear he said i cant speak  no she agreed not while your uncle lives  its hard when i want everybody to know what you are  he kissed her  perhaps its natural for you to be prejudiced in my favorbut i like it  one reason for my loving you dick she said softly with her face close against his is that you are brave enough to take this generous part    the end
