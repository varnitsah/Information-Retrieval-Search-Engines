83523831	harry heathcote of gangoil  a tale of australian bushlife  by  anthony trollope  author of the warden barchester towers orley farm the small house at arlington the eustace diamonds c c  illustrated       harry heathcote     chapter i  gangoil   just a fortnight before christmas 1871 a young man twentyfour years of age returned home to his dinner about eight oclock in the evening he was married and with him and his wife lived his wifes sister at that somewhat late hour he walked in among the two young women and another much older woman who was preparing the table for dinner the wife and the wifes sister each had a child in her lap the elder having seen some fifteen months of its existence and the younger three months he has been out since seven and i dont think hes had a mouthful the wife had just said oh harry you must be half starved she exclaimed jumping up to greet him and throwing her arm round his bare neck  im about whole melted he said as he kissed her in the name of charity give me a nobbler i did get a bit of damper and a pannikin of tea up at the germans hut but i never was so hot or so thirsty in my life were going to have it in earnest this time old bates says that when the gum leaves crackle as they do now before christmas there wont be a blade of grass by the end of february  i hate old bates said the wife he always prophesies evil and complains about his rations  he knows more about sheep than any man this side of the mary said her husband from all this i trust the reader will understand that the christmas to which he is introduced is not the christmas with which he is intimate on this side of the equatora christmas of blazing fires indoors and of sleet arid snow and frost outsidebut the christmas of australia in which happy land the christmas fires are apt to be lightedor to light themselveswhen they are by no means needed  the young man who had just returned home had on a flannel shirt a pair of moleskin trowsers and an old straw hat battered nearly out of all shape he had no coat no waistcoat no braces and nothing round his neck round his waist there was a strap or belt from the front of which hung a small pouch and behind a knife in a case and stuck into a loop in the belt made for the purpose there was a small brierwood pipe as he dashed his hat off wiped his brow and threw himself into a rockingchair he certainly was rough to look at but by all who understood australian life he would have been taken to be a gentleman he was a young squatter well known west of the mary river in queensland harry heathcote of gangoil who owned 30000 sheep of his own was a magistrate in those parts and able to hold his own among his neighbors whether rough or gentle and some neighbors he had very rough who made it almost necessary that a man should be able to be rough also on occasions if he desired to live among them without injury heathcote of gangoil could do all that men said of him that he was too imperious too masterful too much inclined to think that all things should be made to go as he would have them young as he was he had been altogether his own master since he was of ageand not only his own master but the master also of all with whom he was brought into contact from day to day in his life he conversed but seldom with any but those who were dependent on him nor had he done so for the last three years at an age at which young men at home are still subject to pastors and masters he had sprung at once into patriarchal power and being a man determined to thrive had become laborious and thoughtful beyond his years  harry heathcote had been left an orphan with a small fortune in money when he was fourteen for two years after that he had consented to remain quietly at school but at sixteen he declared his purpose of emigrating boys less than himself in stature got above him at school and he had not liked it for a twelvemonth he was opposed by his guardian but at the end of the year he was fitted forth for the colony the guardian was not sorry to be quit of him but prophesied that he would be home again before a year was over the lad had not returned and it was now a settled conviction among all who knew him that he would make or mar his fortune in the new land that he had chosen  he was a tall wellmade young fellow with fair hair and a goodhumored smile but ever carrying in his countenance marks of what his enemies called pigheadedness his acquaintances obstinacy and those who loved him firmness his acquaintances were perhaps right for he certainly was obstinate he would take no mans advice he would submit himself to no man and in the conduct of his own business preferred to trust to his own insight than to the experience of others it would sometimes occur that he had to pay heavily for his obstinacy but on the other hand the lessons which he learned he learned thoroughly and he was kept right in his trade by his own indefatigable industry that trade was the growth of wool he was a breeder of sheep on a queensland sheeprun and his flocks ran far afield over a vast territory of which he was the only lord his house was near the river mary and beyond the river his domain did not extend but around him on his own side of the river he could ride for ten miles in each direction without getting off his own pastures he was master as far as his mastership went of 120000 acresalmost an english countyand it was the pride of his heart to put his foot off his own territory as seldom as possible he sent his wool annually down to brisbane and received his stores tea and sugar flour and brandy boots clothes tobacco etc once or twice a year from thence but the traffic did not require his own presence at the city so selfcontained was the working of the establishment that he was never called away by his business unless he went to see some lot of highly bred sheep which he might feel disposed to buy and as for pleasure it had come to be altogether beyond the purpose of his life to go in quest of that when the work of the day was over he would lie at his length upon rugs in the veranda with a pipe in his mouth while his wife sat over him reading a play of shakspeare or the last novel that had come to them from england  he had married a fair girl the orphan daughter of a bankrupt squatter whom he had met in sydney and had brought her and her sister into the queensland bush with him his wife idolized him his sisterinlaw kate daly loved him dearlyas she had cause to do for he had proved himself to be a very brother to her but she feared him also somewhat the people about the mary said that she was fairer and sweeter to look at even than the elder sister mrs heathcote was the taller of the two and the largerfeatured she certainly was the higher in intellect and the fittest to be the mistress of such an establishment as that at gangoil  when he had washed his hands and face and had swallowed the very copious but weak allowance of brandyandwater which his wife mixed for him he took the eldest boy on his lap and fondled him by george he said old fellow you shant be a squatter  why not harry asked his wife  because i dont want him to break his heart every day of his life  are you always breaking yours i thought your heart was pretty well hardened now  when a man talks of his heart you and kate are thinking of loves and doves of course  i wasnt thinking of loves and doves harry said kate i was thinking how very hot it must have been today we could only bear it in the veranda by keeping the blinds always wet i dont wonder that you were troubled  that comes from heaven or providence or from something that one knows to be unassailable and therefore one can put up with it even if one gets a sunstroke one does not complain the sun has a right to be there and is no interloper like a freeselector i cant understand why freeselectors and mosquitoes should have been introduced into the arrangements of the world  i spose the poor must live somewheres and squiters too said mrs growler the old maidservant as she put a boiled leg of mutton on the table now mr harry if youre hungered theres something for you to eat in spite of the freeselectors  mrs growler said the master excuse me for saying that you jump to conclusions  my jumping is pretty wellnigh done said the old woman  by no means i find that old people can jump quite as briskly as young you have rebuked me under the impression that i was grudging something to the poor let me explain to you that a freeselector may be and very often is a rich man he whom i had in my mind is not a poor man though i wont swear but what he will be before a year is over  i know who you mean mr harry you mean the medlicots a very nice gentleman is mr medlicot and a very nice old lady is mrs medlicot and a deal of good theyre going to do by all accounts  now mrs growler that will do said the wife  the dinner consisted of a boiled leg of mutton a large piece of roast beef potatoes onions and an immense pot of tea no glasses were even put upon the table the two ladies had dressed for dinner and were bright and pretty as they would have been in a country house at home but harry heathcote had sat down just as he had entered the room  i know you are tired to death said his wife when i see you eat your dinner like that  it isnt being tired mary im not particularly tired but i must be off again in about an hour  out again tonight  yes indeed  on horseback  how else old bates and mickey are in their saddles still i dont want to have my fences burned as soon as theyre put up its a ticklish thing to think that a spark of fire any where about the place might ruin me and to know at the same time that every man about the run and every swagsman that passes along have matches in their pocket there isnt a pipe lighted on gangoil this time of the year that mightnt make a beggar of you and me thats another reason why i wouldnt have the young un a squatter  i declare i think that squatters have more trouble than any people in the world said kate daly  freeselectors have their own troubles too kate said he  it must be explained as we go on that heathcote felt that he had received a great and peculiar grievance from the hands of one medlicot a stranger who had lately settled near him and that this last remark referred to a somewhat favorable opinion which had been expressed about this stranger by the two ladies it was a little unfair as having been addressed specially to kate intending as it did to imply that kate had better consider the matter well before she allowed her opinion of the stranger to become dangerously favorable for in truth she had said no more than her sister  the medlicots troubles will never trouble me harry she said  i hope not kate nor mine either more than we can help  but they do said mary they trouble me and her too very much  a mans back should be broad enough to bear all that for himself said harry i get ashamed of myself when i grumble and yet one seems to be surly if one doesnt say what ones thinking  i hope youll always tell me what youre thinking dear  well i suppose i shalltill this fellow is old enough to be talked to and to be made to bear the burden of his fathers care  by that time harry you will have got rich and we shall all be in england shant we  i dont know about being rich but we shall have been freeselected off gangoilnow mrs growler weve done dinner and ill have a pipe before i make another start is jacko in the kitchen send him through to me on to the veranda  gangoil was decidedly in the bushaccording to common australian parlance all sheep stations are in the bush even though there should not be a tree or shrub within sight they who live away from the towns live a bush life small towns as they grow up are called bush towns as we talk of country towns the bush indeed is the country generally but the heathcotes lived absolutely and actually in the bush there are australian pastures which consist of plains on which not a tree is to be seen for miles but others are forests so far extending that their limits are almost unknown gangoil was surrounded by forest in some places so close as to be impervious to men and almost to animals in which the undergrowth was thick and tortuous and almost platted through which no path could be made without an axe but of which the greater portions were open without any underwood between which the sheep could wander at their will and men could ride with a sparse surface of coarse grass which after rain would be luxuriant but in hot weather would be scorched down to the ground at such timesand those times were by far the more commona stranger would wonder where the sheep would find their feed immediately round the house or station as it was called about one hundred acres had been cleared or nearly cleared with a few trees left here and there for ornament or shade further afield but still round the home quarters the trees had been destroyed the run of the sap having been stopped by ringing the bark but they still stood like troops of skeletons and would stand very ugly to look at till they fell in the course of nature by reason of their own rottenness there was a man always at work about the placeboscobel he was calledwhose sole business was to destroy the timber after this fashion so that the air might get through to the grasses and that the soil might be relieved from the burden of nurturing the forest trees  for miles around the domain was divided into paddocks as they were there called but these were so large that a stranger might wander in one of them for a day and never discover that he was inclosed there were five or six paddocks on the gangoil run each of which comprised over ten thousand acres and as all the land was undulating and as the timber was around you every where one paddock was exactly like another the scenery in itself was fine for the trees were often large and here and there rocky knolls would crop up and there were broken crevices in the ground but it was all alike a stranger would wonder that any one straying from the house should find his way back to it there were sundry bush houses here and there and the socalled road to the coast from the wide pastoral districts further west passed across the run but these roads and tracks would travel hither and thither new tracks being opened from time to time by the heavy wool drays and store wagons as in wet weather the ruts on the old tracks would become insurmountable  the station itself was certainly very pretty it consisted of a cluster of cottages each of which possessed a groundfloor only no such luxury as stairs was known at gangoil it stood about half a mile from the mary river on the edge of a creek which ran into it the principal edifice that in which the heathcotes lived contained only one sittingroom and a bedroom on each side of it but in truth there was another room very spacious in which the family really passed their time and this was the veranda which ran along the front and two ends of the house it was twelve feet broad and of course of great length here was clustered the rockingchairs and sofas and worktables and very often the cradle of the family here stood mrs heathcotes sewingmachine and here the master would sprawl at his length while his wife or his wifes sister read to him it was here in fact that they lived having a parlor simply for their meals behind the main edifice there stood each apart various buildings forming an irregular quadrangle the kitchen came first with a small adjacent chamber in which slept the chinese mancook sing sing as he had come to be called then the cottage consisting also of three rooms and a small veranda in which lived harrys superintendent commonly known as old bates a man who had been a squatter once himself and having lost his all in bad times now worked for a small salary in the cottage two of the rooms were devoted to hospitality when as was not unusual guests known or unknown came that way and here harry himself would sleep if the entertainment of other ladies crowded the best apartments then at the back of the quadrangle was the store perhaps of all the buildings the most important in here was kept a kind of shop which was supposed according to an obsolete rule to be open for custom for half a day twice a week the exigencies of the station did not allow of this regularity but after some fashion the shop was maintained tea was to be bought there and sugar tobacco and pickles jam nails boots hats flannel shirrs and moleskin trowsers any body who came might buy but the intention was to provide the station hands who would otherwise have had to go or send thirty miles for the supply of their wants very little money was taken here generally none but the quantity of pickles jam and tobacco sold was great the men would consume large quantities of these bush delicacies and the cost would be deducted from their wages the tea and sugar and flour also were given out weekly as rationsso much a weekand meat was supplied to them after the same fashion for it was the duty of this young autocratic patriarch to find provisions for all who were employed around him for such luxuries as jam and tobacco the men paid themselves  on the fourth side of the quadrangle was a rough coachhouse and rougher stables the carriage part of the establishment consisted of two buggiesso called always in the bushopen carriages on four wheels one of which was intended to hold two and the other four sitters a londoner looking at them would have declared them to be hopeless ruins but harry heathcote still made wonderful journeys in them taking care generally that the wheels were sound and using ropes for the repair of dilapidations the stables were almost unnecessary as the horses of which the supply at gangoil was very large roamed in the horse paddock a comparatively small inclosure containing not above three or four hundred acres and were driven up as they were wanted one horse was always kept close at home with which to catch the others but this horse for handiness was generally hitched to a post outside the kitchen door harry was proud of his horses and was sometimes heard to say that few men in england had a lot of thirty at hand as he had out of which so many would be able to carry a man eighty miles in eight hours at a moments notice but his stable arrangements would not have commanded respect in the shires the animals were never groomed never fed and many of them never shod they lived upon grass and harry always said cut their own breadandbutter for themselves  gangoil was certainly very pretty the veranda was covered in with striped blinds so that when the sun shone hot or when the rains fell heavily or when the mosquitoes were more than usually troublesome there might be something of the protection of an inclosed room up all the posts there were flowering creepers which covered the front with greenery even when the flowers were wanting from the front of the house down to the creek there was a pleasant failing gardenheartbreaking indeed in regard to vegetables for the opossums always came first and they who followed the opossums got but little but the garden gave a pleasant homelike look to the place and was very dear to harry who was perhaps indifferent in regard to pease and tomatoes harry heathcote was very proud of the place for he had made it all himself having pulled down a wretched barrack that he had found there but he was far prouder of his woolshed which he had also built and which he regarded as first and foremost among woolsheds in those parts byandby we shall be called on to visit the woolshed though heathcote had done all this for gangoil it must be understood that the vast extent of territory over which his sheep ran was by no means his own property he was simply the tenant of the crown paying a rent computed at so much a sheep he had indeed purchased the ground on which his house stood but this he had done simply to guard himself against other purchasers these other purchasers were the bane of his existence the one great sorrow which as he said broke his heart  while he was speaking a roughlooking lad about sixteen years of age came through the parlor to the veranda dressed very much like his master but unwashed uncombed and with that wild look which falls upon those who wander about the australian plains living a nomad life this was jackoso called and no one knew him by any other namea lad whom heathcote had picked up about six months since and who had become a favorite the old woman says as you was wanting me suggested jacko going to be fine tonight jacko  jacko went to the edge of the veranda and looked up to the sky my word little squall acoming he said  i wish it would come from ten thousand buckets said the master  no buckets at all said jacko want the horses master  of course i want the horses and i want you to come with me there are two horses saddled there ill ride hamlet     chapter ii  a nights ride   harry jumped from the ground kissed his wife called her old girl and told her to be happy and got on his horse at the garden gate both the ladies came off the veranda to see him start its as dark as pitch said kate daly  thats because you have just come out of the light  but it is darkquite dark you wont be late will you said the wife  i cant be very early as its near ten now i shall be back about twelve so saying he broke at once into a gallop and vanished into the night his young groom scampering after him  why should he go out now kate said to her sister  he is afraid of fire  but he cant prevent the fires by riding about in the dark i suppose the fires come from the heat  he thinks they come from enemies and he has heard something one wretched man may do so much when every thing is dried to tinder i do so wish it would rain  the night in truth was very dark it was now midsummer at which time with us the days are so long that the coming of the one almost catches the departure of its predecessor but gangoil was not far outside the tropics and there were no long summer nights the heat was intense but there was a low soughing wind which seemed to moan among the trees without moving them as they crossed the little home inclosure and the horse paddock the track was just visible the trees being dead and the spaces open about half a mile from the house while they were still in the horse paddock harry turned from the track and jacko of course turned with him you can sit your horse jumping jacko he asked  my word jump like glory answered jacko he was soon tried harry rode at the bush fencewhich was not indeed much of a fence made of logs lengthways and crossways about three feet and a half highand went over it jacko followed him rushing his horse at the leap losing his seat and almost falling over the animals shoulders as he came to the ground my word said jacko just saving himself by a scramble who ever saw the like of that  why dont you sit in your saddle you stupid young duffer  sit in my saddle why dont he jump proper well you go on i dont know that im a duffer duffer indeed my word heathcote had turned to the left leaving the track which was indeed the main road toward the nearest town and the coast and was now pushing on through the forest with no pathway at all to guide him to ordinary eyes the attempt to steer any course would have been hopeless but an australian squatter if he have any wellgrounded claim to the character of a bushman has eyes which are not ordinary and he has probably nurtured within himself unconsciously topographical instincts which are unintelligible to the inhabitants of cities harry too was near his own home and went forward through the thick gloom without a doubt jacko following him faithfully in about half an hour they came to another fence but now it was too absolutely dark for jumping harry had not seen it till he was close to it and then he pulled up his horse my word why dont you jump away mr harry whos a duffer now  hold your tongue or ill put my whip across your back get down and help me pull a log away the horses couldnt see where to put their feet jacko did as he was bid and worked hard but still grumbled at having been called a duffer the animals were quickly led over the logs were replaced and the two were again galloping through the forest  i thought you were making for the woolshed said jacko  were eight miles beyond the woolshed said harry they had now crossed another paddock and had come to the extreme fence on the run the gangoil pastures extended much further but in that direction had not as yet been inclosed here they both got off their horses and walked along the fence till they came to an opening with a slip panel or movable bars which had been heathcotes intended destination hold the horses jacko till i come back he said  jacko when alone nothing daunted by the darkness or solitude seated himself on the top rail took out a pipe and struck a match when the tobacco was ignited he dropped the match on the dry grass at his feet and a little flame instantly sprang up the boy waited a few seconds till the flames began to run and then putting his feet together on the ground stamped out the incipient fire my word said jacko to himself its easy done anyway  harry went on to the left for about half a mile and then stood leaning against the fence it was very dark but he was now looking over into an inclosure which had been altogether cleared of trees and which as he knew well had been cultivated and was covered with sugarcanes where he stood he was not distant above a quarter of a mile from the river and the field before him ran down to the banks this was the selected land of giles medlicottwo years since a portion of his own run which had now been purchased from the governmentfor the loss of which he had received and was entitled to receive no compensation and the matter was made worse for him by the fact that the interloper had come between him and the river but he was not standing here near midnight merely to exercise his wrath by straining his eyes through the darkness at his neighbors crops he put his finger into his mouth to wet it and then held it up that he might discover which way the light breath of wind was coming there was still the low moan to be heard continually through the forest and yet not a leaf seemed to be moved after a while he thought he caught a sound and put his ear down to the ground he distinctly heard a footstep and rising up walked quickly toward the spot whence the noise came  whos that he said as he saw the figure of a man standing on his side of the fence and leaning against it with a pipe in his month  who are you replied the man on the fence my name is medlicot  oh mr medlicot is it  is that mr heathcote goodnight mr heathcote you are going about at a late hour of the night  i have to go about early and late but i aint later than you  im close at home said medlicot  i am at any rate on my own run said harry  you mean to say that i am trespassing said the other because i can very soon jump back over the fence  i didnt mean that at all mr medlicot any body is welcome on my run night or day who knows how to behave himself  i hope im included in that list  just so of course considering the state that every thing is in and all the damage that a fire would do i rather wish that people would be a little more careful about smoking  my canes mr heathcote would burn quite as quickly as your grass  it is not only the grass ive a hundred miles of fencing on the run which is as dry as tinder not to talk of the station and the woolshed  they shant suffer from my neglect mr heathcote  you have men about who maynt be so careful the wind such as it is is coming right across from your place if there were light enough i could show you three or four patches where there has been fire within half a mile of this spot there was a log burning there for two or three days not long ago which was lighted by one of our men  that was a fortnight since there was no heat then and the men were boiling their kettle i spoke about it  a log like that mr medlicot will burn for weeks sometimes ill tell you fairly what im afraid of theres a man with you whom i turned out of the shed last shearing and i think he might put a match downnot by accident  you mean nokes as far as i know hes a decent man you wouldnt have me not employ a man just because you had dismissed him  certainly not that is i shouldnt think of dictating to you about such a thing  well no mr heathcote i suppose not nokes has got to earn his bread though you did dismiss him i dont know that hes not as honest a man as you or i  if so theres three of us very bad thats all mr medlicot goodnight and if youll trouble yourself to look after the ash of your tobacco it might be the saving of me and all i have so saying he turned round and made his way back to the horses  medlicot had placed himself on the fence during the interview and he still kept his seat of course he was now thinking of the man who had just left him whom he declared to himself to be an ignorant prejudiced illconstituted cur i believe in his heart he thinks that im going to set fire to his run he said almost aloud and because he grows wool he thinks himself above every body in the colony he occupies thousands of acres and employs three or four men i till about two hundred and maintain thirty families but he is such a pig that he cant understand all that and he thinks that i must be something low because ive bought with my own money a bit of land which never belonged to him and which he couldnt use such was the nature of giles medlicots soliloquy as he sat swinging his legs and still smoking his pipe on the fence which divided his sugarcane from the other young mans run  and harry heathcote uttered his soliloquy also i wouldnt swear that he wouldnt do it himself after all meaning that he almost suspected that medlicot himself would be an incendiary to him in his way of thinking a man who would take advantage of the law to buy a bit of another mans landor become a freeselector as the term goeswas a public enemy and might be presumed capable of any iniquity it was all very well for the girlsmeaning his wife and sisterinlawto tell him that medlicot had the manners of a gentleman and had come of decent people women were always soft enough to be taken by soft hands a goodlooking face and a decent coat this medlicot went about dressed like a man in the towns exhibiting as harry thought a contemptible unmanly finery of what use was it to tell him that medlicot was a gentleman what harry knew was that since medlicot had come he had lost his sheep that the heads of three or four had been found buried on medlicots side of his run and that if he dismissed a hand medlicot employed hima proceeding which in harry heathcotes aristocratic and patriarchal views of life was altogether ungentlemanlike how were the hands to be kept in their place if one employer of labor did not back up another  he had been warned to be on his guard against fire the warnings had hardly been implicit but yet had come in a shape which made him unable to ignore them old bates whom he trusted implicitly and who was a man of very few words had told him to be on his guard the german at whose hut he had been in the morning karl bender by name and a servant of his own had told him that there would be fire about before long  why should any one want to ruin me harry had asked did i ever wrong a man of a shilling  the german had learned to know his young master had made his way through the crust of his masters character and was prepared to be faithful at all pointsthough he too could have quarreled and have avenged himself had it not chanced that he had come to the point of loving instead of hating his employer  you like too much to be governor over all said the german as he stooped over the fire in his own hut in his anxiety to boil the water for heathcotes tea  somebody must be governor or every thing would go to the devil said harry  dats trueonly fellows dont like be made feel it said the german nokes he was made feel it when you put him over de gate  but neither would bates nor the german express absolute suspicion of any man that medlicots hands at the sugarmill were stealing his sheep harry thought that he knew but that was comparatively a small affair and he would not have pressed it as he was without absolute evidence and even he had a feeling that it would be unwise to increase the anger felt against himselfat any rate during the present heats  jacko had his pipe still alight when heathcote returned you young monkey said he have you been using matches  why not mr harry dont the grass burn ready mr harry my word then jacko stooped down lit another match and showed heathcote the burned patch  was it so when we came harry asked with emotion jacko still kneeling on the ground and holding the lighted match in his hand shook his head and tapped his breast indicating that he had burned the grass you dropped the match by accident  my word no did it o purpose to see its all just one as gunpowder mr harry  harry got on his horse without a word and rode away through the forest taking a direction different from that by which he had come and the boy followed him he was by no means certain that this young fellow might not turn against him but it had been a part of his theory to make no difference to any man because of such fears if he could make the men around him respect him then they would treat him well but they could never be brought to respect him by flattery he was very nearly right in his views of men and would have been right altogether could he have seen accurately what justice demanded for others as well as for himself as far as the intention went he was minded to be just to every man  it seemed as they were riding that the heat grew fiercer and fiercer though there was still the same moaning sound there was not a breath of air they had now got upon a track very well known to heathcote which led up from the river to the woolshed and so on to the station and they had turned homeward when they were near the woolshed suddenly there fell a heavy drop or two of rain harry stopped and turned his face upward when in a moment the whole heavens above them and the forest around were illumined by a flash of lightning so near them that it made each of them start in his saddle and made the horses shudder in every limb then came the roll of thunder immediately over their heads and with the thunder rain so thick and fast that harrys ten thousand buckets seemed to be emptied directly over their heads  god amighty has put out the fires now said jacko  harry paused for a moment feeling the rain through to his bonesfor he had nothing on over his shirtand rejoicing in it yes he said we may go to bed for a week and let the grass grow and the creeks fill and the earth cool half an hour like this over the whole run and there wont be a dry stick on it  as they went on the horses splashed through the water it seemed as though a deluge were falling and that already the ground beneath their feet were becoming a lake  we might have too much of this jacko  my word yes  i dont want to have the mary flooded again  my word no  but by the time they reached the woolshed it was over from the first drop to the last there had hardly been a space of twenty minutes but there was a noise of waters as the little streams washed hither and thither to their destined courses and still the horses splashed and still there was the feeling of an incipient deluge when they reached the woolshed harry again got off his horse and jacko dismounting also hitched the two animals to the post and followed his master into the building harry struck a wax match and holding it up strove to look round the building by the feeble light which it shed it was a remarkable edifice built in the shape of a great t open at the sides with a sharppitched timber roof covered with felt which came down within four feet of the ground it was calculated to hold about four hundred sheep at a time and was divided into pens of various sizes partitioned off for various purposes if harry heathcote was sure of any thing he was sure that his woolshed was the best that had ever been built in this district  by jimini whats that said jacko  did you hear any thing  jacko pointed with his finger down the centre walk of the shed and harry striking another match as he went rushed forward but the match was out as soon as ignited and gave no glimmer of light nevertheless he saw or thought that he saw the figure of a man escaping out of the open end of the shed the place itself was black as midnight but the space beyond was clear of trees and the darkness outside being a few shades lighter than within the building allowed something of the outline of a figure to be visible and as the man escaped the sounds of his footsteps were audible enough harry called to him but of course received no answer had he pursued him he would have been obliged to cross sundry rails which would have so delayed him as to give him no chance of success  i knew there was a fellow about he said one of our own men would not have run like that  jacko shook his head but did not speak  he has got in here for shelter out of the rain but he was doing no good about the place  jacko again shook his head  i wonder who he was  jacko came up and whispered in his ear bill nokes  you couldnt see him  seed the drag of his leg now it was well known that the man nokes had injured some of his muscles and habitually dragged one foot after another  i dont think you could have been sure of him by such a glimpse as that  maybe not said the boy only im sure as sure  harry heathcote said not another word but getting again upon his horse galloped home it was past one when he reached the station but the two girls were waiting up for him and at once began to condole with him because he was wet wet said harry if you could only know how much i prefer things being wet to dry just at present but give jacko some supper i must keep that young fellow in good humor if i can  so jacko had half a loaf of bread and a small pot of jam and a large jug of cold tea provided for him in the enjoyment of which luxuries he did not seem to be in the least impeded by the fact that he was wet through to the skin harry heathcote had another nobblerbeing only the second in the dayand then went to bed     chapter iii  medlicots mill   as harry said they might all now lie in bed for a day or two the rain had set aside for the time the necessity for that urgent watchfulness which kept all hands on the station hard at work during the great heat there was not generally much rest during the year at gangoil lambing in april and may washing and shearing in september october and november with the fear of fires and the necessary precautions in december and january did not leave more than sufficient intervals for looking after the waterdams making and mending fences procuring stores and attending to the ailments of the flocks no man worked harder than the young squatter but now there had suddenly come a day or two of restrest from work which was not of itself productive but only remedial and which therefore was not begrudged  but it soon was apparent that the rest could be only for a day or two the rain had fallen as from ten thousand buckets but it had fallen only for a space of minutes on the following morning the thirsty earth had apparently swallowed all the flood the water in the creek beneath the house stood two feet higher than it had done and harry when he visited the dams round the run found that they were fall to overflowing and the grasses were already springing so quick is the all but tropical growth of the country they might be safe perhaps for eightandforty hours fire would run only when the ground was absolutely dry and when every twig or leaf was a combustible but during those eightandforty hours there might be comparative ease at gangoil  on the day following the night of the ride mrs heathcote suggested to her husband that she and kate should ride over to medlicots mill as the place was already named and call on mrs medlicot it isnt christian she said for people living out in the bush as we are to quarrel with their neighbors just because they are neighbors  neighbors said harry i dont know any word that theres so much humbug about the samaritan was the best neighbor i ever heard of and he lived a long way off i take it anyway he wasnt a freeselector  harry thats profane  every thing i say is wicked you can go of course if you like it i dont want to quarrel with any body  quarreling is so uncomfortable said his wife  thats a matter of taste there are people whom i find it very comfortable to quarrel with i shouldnt at all like not to quarrel with the brownbies and im not at all sure it maynt come to be the same with mr giles medlicot  the brownbies live by sheepstealing and horsestealing  and medlicot means to live by employing sheepstealers and horsestealers you can go if you like it you wont want me to go with you will you have the baggy  but the ladies said that they would ride the air was cooler now than it had been and they would like the exercise they would take jacko with them to open the sliprails and they would be back by seven for dinner so they started taking the track by the woolshed the woolshed was about two miles from the station and medlicots mill was seven miles farther on the bank of the river  mr giles medlicot though at gangoil he was still spoken of as a newcomer had already been located for nearly two years on the land which he had purchased immediately on his coming to the colony he had come out direct from england with the intention of growing sugar and whether successful or not in making money had certainly succeeded in growing crops of sugarcanes and in erecting a mill for crushing them it probably takes more than two years for a man himself to discover whether he can achieve ultimate success in such an enterprise and medlicot was certainly not a man likely to talk much to others of his private concerns the mill had just been built and he had lived there himself as soon as a watertight room had been constructed it was only within the last three months that he had completed a small cottage residence and had brought his mother to live with him hitherto he had hardly made himself popular he was not either fish or fowl the squatters regarded him as an interloper and as a man holding opinions directly averse to their own interestsin which they were right and the small freeselectors who lived on the labor of their own handsor as was said of many of them by stealing sheep and cattleknew well that he was not of their class but medlicot had gone his way steadfastly if not happily and complained aloud to no one in the midst of his difficulties he had not perhaps found the paradise which he had expected in queensland but he had found that he could grow sugar and having begun the work he was determined to go on with it  heathcote was his nearest neighbor and the only man in his own rank of life who lived within twenty miles of him when he had started his enterprise he had hoped to make this man his friend not comprehending at first how great a cause for hostility was created by the very purchase of the land he had been a newcomer from the old country and being alone had desired friendship he was harry heathcotes equal in education intelligence and fortune if not in birthwhich surely in the australian bush need not count for much he had assumed when first meeting the squatter that goodfellowship between them on equal terms would be acceptable to both but his overtures had been coldly received then he too had drawn himself up had declared that heathcote was an ignorant ass and had unconsciously made up his mind to commence hostilities it was in this spirit that he had taken nokes into his mill of whose character had he inquired about it he would certainly have heard no good he had now brought his mother to medlicots mill she and the gangoil ladies had met each other on neutral ground and it was almost necessary that they should either be friends or absolute enemies mrs heathcote had been aware of this and bad declared that enmity was horrible  upon my word said harry i sometimes think that friendship is more so i suppose im fitted for bush life for i want to see no one from years end to years end but my own family and my own people and yet this young patriarch in the wilderness was only twentyfour years old and had been educated at an english school  medlicots cottage was about a hundred and fifty yards from the mill looking down upon the mary the banks of which at this spot were almost precipitous the site for the plantation had been chosen because the river afforded the means of carriage down to the sea and the mill had been so constructed that the sugar hogsheads could be lowered from the buildings into the river boats here mrs heathcote and kate daly found the old lady sitting at work all alone in the veranda she was a handsome old woman with gray hair seventy years of age with wrinkled face and a toothless mouth but with bright eyes and with no signs of the infirmity of age  this is gey kind of you to run so far to see an auld woman she said  mrs heathcote declared that they were used to the heat and that after the rain the air was pleasant  youre two bright lassies and youre hearty she said im auld and just out of cumberland and i find its hot enoughand im no guid at horseback at all i dinna know how im to get aboot  then mrs heathcote explained that there was an excellent track for a buggy all the way to gangoil  giles is aye telling me that im to gang aboot in a bouggey but i dinna feel sure of thae bouggeys  mrs heathcote of course praised the country carriages and the country roads and the country generally tea was brought in and the old lady was delighted with her guests since she had been at the mill week had followed week and she had seen no womans face but that of the uncouth girl who waited upon her did ye ever see rain like that she said putting up her hands i thought the lord was sending his clouds down upon us in a lump like then she told them that some of the men had declared that if it went on like that for two hours the mary would rise and take the cottage away giles however had declared that to be trash as the cottage was twenty feet above the ordinary course of the river  they were just rising to take their leave when giles medlicot himself came in out of the mill he was a man of good presence dark and tall like heathcote but stoutly made with a strongly marked face given to frowning much when he was eager brighteyed with a broad foreheadcertainly a man to be observed as far as his appearance was concerned he was dressed much as a gentleman dresses in the country at home and was therefore accounted to be a fop by harry heathcote who was rarely seen abroad in other garb than that which has been described harry was an aristocrat and hated such innovations in the bush as cloth coats and tweed trowsers and neckhandkerchiefs  medlicot had been full of wrath against his neighbor all the morning there had been a tone in heathcotes voice when he gave his parting warning as to the fire in medlicots pipe which the sugar grower had felt to be intentionally insolent nothing had been said which could be openly resented but offense had surely been intended and then he had remembered that his mother had been already some months at the mill and that no mark of neighborly courtesy had been shown to her the heathcotes had he thought chosen to assume themselves to be superior to him and his and to treat him as though he had been some laboring man who had saved money enough to purchase a bit of land for himself he was therefore astonished to find the two young ladies sitting with his mother on the very day after such an interview as that of the preceding night  the leddies from gangoil giles have been guid enough to ride over and see me said his mother  medlicot of course shook hands with them and expressed his sense of their kindness but he did it awkwardly he soon however declared his purpose of riding part of the way back with them  mr heathcote must have been very wet last night he said when they were on horseback addressing himself to kate daly rather than to her sister  indeed he waswet to the skin were you not  i saw him at about eleven before the rain began i was close home and just escaped he must have been under it all does he often go about the run in that way at night  only when hes afraid of fires said kate  is there much to be afraid of i dont suppose that any body can be so wicked as to wish to burn the grass then the ladies took upon themselves to explain the fires might be caused from negligence or trifling accidents or might possibly come from the unaided heat of the sun or there might be enemies  my word yes enemies rather said jacko who was riding close behind and who had no idea of being kept out of the conversation merely because he was a servant medlicot turning round looked at the lad and asked who were the enemies  freeselectors said jacko  im a freeselector said medlicot  did not jist mean you said jacko  jacko youd better hold your tongue said mrs heathcote  hold my tongue my word well you go on  medlicot came as far as the woolshed and then said that he would return he had thoroughly enjoyed his ride kate daly was bright and pretty and winning and in the bush when a man has not seen a lady perhaps for months brightness and prettiness and winning ways have a double charm to ride with fair women over turf through a forest with a woman who may perhaps some day be wooed can be a matter of indifference only to a very lethargic man giles medlicot was by no means lethargic he owned to himself that though heathcote was a pigheaded ass the ladies were very nice and he thought that the pigheaded ass in choosing one of them for himself had by no means taken the nicest  youll never find your way back said kate if youve not been here before  i never was here before and i suppose i must find my way back then he was urged to come on and dine at gangoil with a promise that jacko should return with him in the evening but this he would not do heathcote was a pigheaded ass who possibly regarded him as an incendiary simply because he had bought some land this boy of heathcotes whose services had been offered to him had not scrupled to tell him to his face that he was to be regarded as an enemy much as he liked the company of kate daly he could not go to the house of that stupid arrogant pigheaded young squatter im not such a bad bushman but what i can find my way to the river he said  find it blindful said jacko who did not relish the idea of going back to medlicots mill as guide to another man there was a weakness in the idea that such aid could be necessary which was revolting to jackos sense of bush independence  they were standing on their horses at the entrance to the woolshed as they discussed the point when suddenly harry himself appeared out of the building he came up and shook hands with medlicot with sufficient courtesy but hardly with cordiality and then asked his wife as to her ride we have been very jolly havent we kate of course it has been hot but every thing is not so frightfully parched as it was before the rain as mr medlicot has come back so far with us we want him to come on and dine  pray do mr medlicot said harry but again the tone of his voice was not sufficiently hearty to satisfy the man who was invited  thanks no i think ill hardly do thatgoodnight mrs heathcote goodnight miss daly and the two ladies immediately perceived that his voice which had hitherto been pleasant in their ears had ceased to be cordial  i am very glad he has gone back said heathcote  why do you say so harry you are not given to be inhospitable and why should you grudge me and kate the rare pleasure of seeing a strange face  ill tell you why its not about him at this moment but ive been disturbedjacko go on to the station and say were coming do you hear me go on at once then jacko somewhat unwillingly galloped off toward the house get off your horses and come in  he helped the two ladies from their saddles and they all went into the woolshed harry leading the way in one of the side pens immediately under the roof there was a large heap of leaves the outside portion of which was at present damp for the rain had beaten in upon it but which had been as dry as tinder when collected and there was a row or ridge of mixed brushwood and leaves so constructed as to form a line from the grass outside on to the heap the fellow who did that was an ass said harry a greater ass than i should have taken him to be not to have known that if he could have gotten the grass to burn outside the woolshed must have gone without all that preparation but there isnt much difficulty now in seeing what the fellow has intended  was it for a fire asked kate  of course it was he wouldnt have been contented with the grass and fences but wanted to make sure of the shed also hed have come to the house and burned us in our beds only a fellow like that is too much of a coward to run the risk of being seen  but harry why didnt he light it when hed done it said mrs heathcote  because the almighty sent the rain at the very moment said harry striking the top rail of one of the pens with his fist im not much given to talk about providence but this looks like it does it not  he might have put a match in at the moment  rain or no rain yes he might but he was interrupted by more than the rain i got into the shed myself just at the momenti and jacko it was last night when the rain was pouring i heard the man and dark as was the night i saw his figure as he fled away  you didnt know him said miss daly  but that boy who has the eyes of a cat he knew him  jacko  jacko knew him by his gait i should have hardly wanted any one to tell me who it was i could have named the man at once but for the fear of doing an injustice  and who was it  our friend medlicots prime favorite and new factotum mr william nokes mr william stokes is the gentleman who intends to burn us all out of house and home and mr medlicot is the gentleman whose pleasure it is to keep mr nokes in the neighborhood  the two women stood awestruck for a moment but a sense of justice prevailed upon the wife to speak that may be all true she said perhaps it is as you say about that man but you would not therefore think that mr medlicot knows any thing about it  it would be impossible said kate  i have not accused him said harry but he knows that the man was dismissed and yet keeps him about the place of course he is responsible     chapter iv  harry heathcotes appeal   for the first mile between the woolshed and the house heathcote and the two ladies rode without saying a word there was something so terrible in the reality of the danger which encompassed them that they hardly felt inclined to discuss it harrys dislike to medlicot was quite a thing apart that some one had intended to burn down the woolshed and had made preparation for doing so was as apparent to the women as to him and the man who had been balked by a shower of rain in his first attempt might soon find an opportunity for a second harry was well aware that even jackos assertion could not be taken as evidence against the man whom he suspected in all probability no further attempt would be made upon the woolshed but a fire on some distant part of the run would be much more injurious to him than the mere burning of a building the fire that might ruin him would be one which should get ahead before it was seen and scour across the ground consuming the grass down to the very roots over thousands of acres and destroying fencing over many miles such fires pass on leaving the standing trees unscathed avoiding even the scrub which is too moist with the sap of life for consumption but licking up with fearful rapidity every thing that the sun has dried he could watch the woolshed and house but with no possible care could he so watch the whole run as to justify him in feeling security there need be no preparation of leaves a match thrown loosely on the ground would do it and in regard to a match so thrown it would be impossible to prove a guilty intention  ought we not to have dispersed the heap said mrs heathcote at last the minds of all of them were full of the matter but these were the first words spoken  ill leave it as it is said harry giving no reason for his decision he was too full of thought too heavily laden with anxiety to speak much come lets get on youll want your dinner and its getting dark so they cantered on and got off their horses at the gate without another word and not another word was spoken on the subject that night harry was very silent walking up and down the veranda with his pipe in his mouthnot lying on the ground in idle enjoymentand there was no reading the two sisters looked at him from time to time with wistful anxiouseyes half afraid to disturb him by speech  as for him he felt that the weight was all on his own shoulders he had worked hard and was on the way to be rich i do not know that he thought much about money but he thought very much of success and he was by nature anxious sanguine and impulsive there might be before him within the next week such desolation as would break his heart he knew men who had been ruined and had borne their ruin almost without a wailwho had seemed contented to descend to security and mere absence from want there was his own superintendent old bates who though he grumbled at every thing else never bewailed his own fate but he knew of himself that any such blow would nearly kill himsuch a blow that is as might drive him from gangoil and force him to be the servant instead of the master of men not to be master of all around him seemed to him to be misery the merchants at brisbane who took his wool and supplied him with stores had advanced money when he first bought his run and he still owed them some thousands of pounds the injury which a great fire would do him would bring him to such a condition that the merchants would demand to have their money repaid he understood it all and knew well that it was after this fashion that many a squatter before him had been ruined  speak a word to me about it his wife said to him imploringly when they were alone together that night  my darling if there were a word to say i would say it i must be on the watch and do the best i can at present the earth is too damp for mischief  oh that it would rain again  there will be heat enough before the summer is over we need not doubt that but i will tell you of every thing as we go on i will endeavor to have the man watched god bless you go to sleep and try to get it out of your thoughts  on the following morning he breakfasted early and mounted his horse without saying a word as to the purport of his journey this was in accordance with the habit of his life and would not excite observation but there was something in his manner which made both the ladies feel that he was intent on some special object when he intended simply to ride round his fences or to visit the hut of some distant servant a few minutes signified nothing he would stand under the veranda and talk and the women would endeavor to keep him from the saddle but now there was no loitering and but little talking he said a word to jacko who brought the horse for him and then started at a gallop toward the woolshed  he did not stop a moment at the shed not even entering it to see whether the heap of leaves had been displaced during the night but went on straight to medlicots mill he rode the nine miles in an hour and at once entered the building in which the canes were crushed the first man he met was nokes who acted as overseer having a gang of polynesian laborers under himsleek swarthy fellows from the south sea islands with linen trowsers on and nothing elsewho crept silently among the vats and machinery shifting the sugar as it was made  well nokes said harry how are you getting on is mr medlicot here  nokes was a big fellow with a broad solid face which would not have condemned him among physiognomists but for a bad eye which could not look you in the face he had been a boundary rider for heathcote and on an occasion had been impertinent refusing to leave the yard behind the house unless something was done which those about the place refused to do for him during the discussion harry had come in the man had been drinking and was still insolent and harry had ejected him violently thrusting him over a gate the man had returned the next morning and had then been sent about his business he had been employed at medlicots mill but from the day of his dismissal to this he and harry had never met each other face to face  im pretty well thank ye mr heathcote i hope youre the same and the ladies the masters about somewhere i take itpicky go and find the master picky was one of the polynesians who at once started on his errand  have you been over to gangoil since you left it said harry looking the man full in the face  not i mr heathcote i never go where ive had words and to tell you the truth sugar is better than sheep im very comfortable here and i never liked your work  you havent been at the woolshed  what the gangoil shed what the blazes d i go there for its a matter of ten miles from here  seven nokes  seven is it it is a longish seven miles mr heathcote how could i get that distance i aint so good at walking as i was before i was hurt you should have remembered that mr heathcote when you laid hands on me the other day  youre not much the worse for what i did nor yet for the accident i take it at any rate youve not been at gangoil woolshed  no ive not said the man roughly what the mischief should i be doing at your shed at nighttime  i said nothing about nighttime  im here all day aint i if youre going to palm off any story against me mr heathcote youll find yourself in the wrong box what i does i does on the square  heathcote was now quite sure that jacko had been right he had not doubted much before but now he did not doubt at all but that the man with whom he was speaking was the wretch who was endeavoring to ruin him and he felt certain also that jacko was true to him he knew too that he had plainly declared his suspicion to the man himself but he had resolved upon doing this he could in no way assist himself in circumventing the mans villainy by keeping his suspense to himself the man might be frightened and in spite of all that had passed between him and medlicot he still thought it possible that he might induce the sugar grower to cooperate with him in driving nokes from the neighborhood he had spent the night in thinking over it all and this was the resolution to which he had come  theres the master said nokes if youve got any thing to say about any thing youd better say it to him  harry had never before set his foot upon medlicots land since it had been bought away from his own run and had felt that he would almost demean himself by doing so he had often looked at the canes from over his own fence as he had done on the night of the rain but he had stood always on his own land now he was in the sugarmill never before having seen such a building youve a deal of machinery here mr medlicot he said  its a small affair after all said the other i hope to get a good plant before ive done  can i speak a word with you  certainly will you come into the office or will you go across to the house  harry said that the office would do and followed medlicot into a little boxlike inclosure which contained a desk and two stools  not much of an office is it what can i do for you mr heathcote  then harry began his story which he told at considerable length he apologized for troubling his neighbor at all on the subject and endeavored to explain somewhat awkwardly that as mr medlicot was a newcomer he probably might not understand the kind of treatment to which employers in the bush were occasionally subject from their men on this matter he said much which had he been a better tactician he might probably have left unspoken he then went on to the story of his own quarrel with nokes who had in truth been grossly impudent to the women about the house but who had been punished by instant and violent dismissal from his employment it was evidently harrys idea that a man who had so sinned against his master should be allowed to find no other masterat any rate in that district an idea with which the other man who had lately come out from the old country did not at all sympathize  do you want me to dismiss him said medlicot in a tone which implied that that would be the last thing he would think of doing  you havent heard me yet then harry went on and told of the fires in the heat of summer and of their terrible effectsof the easy manner of revenge which they supplied to angry unscrupulous men and of his own fears at the present moment  i can believe it all said medlicot and am very sorry that it should be so but i can not see the justice of punishing a man on the merest vaguest suspicion your only ground for imputing this crime to him is that your own conduct to him may have given him a motive  harry had schooled himself vigorously during the ride as to his own demeanor and had resolved that he would be cool i was going on to tell you he said what occurred that night after i saw you up by the fence then he described how he and his boy had entered the shed and had both seen and heard a man as he escaped from it how the boy had at once declared that the man was nokes how the following day he had discovered the leaves which nokes no doubt had deposited there just before the rain intending to burn the place at once and how nokess manner to him within the last half hour had corroborated his suspicions  is he the boy you call jacko  thats the name he goes by  you dont know his real name  i have never heard any other name  nor any thing about him harry owned in answer to half a dozen such questions that jacko had come to gangoil about six months agohe did not know whencehad been kept for a weeks job and had then been allowed to remain about the place without any regular wages you admit it was quite dark continued medlicot  harry did not at all like the crossexamination and his resolution to be cool was quickly fading i told you that i saw myself the figure of a man  but that you barely saw a figure you did not form any opinion of your own as to the mans identity  harry heathcote was as honest as the sun much as he disliked being crossexamined he found himself compelled not only to say the exact truth but the whole truth certainly not i barely saw a glimpse of a figure and till i spoke to nokes just now i almost doubted whether the lad could have distinguished him i am sure he was right now  really mr heathcote i cant go along with you you are accusing a man of committing an offense which i believe is capital on the evidence of a boy of whom you know nothing who may have his own reasons for spiting the man and whom you yourself did not believe till you had looked this man in the face i think you allow yourself to be guided too much by your own power of intuition  no i dont said harry who hated his neighbors methodical argument  at any rate i cant consent to take a mans bread out of his mouth and to send him away tainted as he would be with this suspicion either because jacko thought that he saw him in the dark or because  i have never asked you to send him away  what is it you want then  i want to have him watched so that he may feel that if he attempts to destroy my property his guilt will be detected  who is to watch him  he is in your employment  he lives in the hut down beyond the gate am i to keep a sentry there all night and every night  i will pay for it  no mr heathcote i dont pretend to know this country yet but ill encourage no such espionage as that at any rate it is not english i dare say the man misbehaved himself in your employment you say he was drunk i do not doubt it but he is not a drunkard for he never drinks here a man is not to starve forever because he once got drunk and was impertinent nor is he to have a spy at his heels because a boy whom nobody knows chooses to denounce him i am sorry that you should be in trouble but i do not know that i can help you  harrys passion was now very high and his resolution to be cool was almost thrown to the winds medlicot had said many things which were odious to him in the first place there had been a tone of insufferable superiority so harry thought and that too when he himself had divested himself of all the superiority naturally attached to his position and had frankly appealed to medlicot as a neighbor and then this newfangled sugar grower had told him that he was not english and had said grand words and had altogether made himself objectionable what did this man know of the australian bush that he should dare to talk of this or that as being wrong because it was unenglish in england there were police to guard mens property here out in the australian forests a man must guard his own or lose it but perhaps it was the indifference to the ruin of the women belonging to him that harry heathcote felt the strongest the stranger cared nothing for the utter desolation which one unscrupulous ruffian might produce felt no horror at the idea of a vast devastating fire but could be indignant in his mock philanthropy because it was proposed to watch the doings of a scoundrel  goodmorning said harry turning round and leaving the office brusquely medlicot followed him but harry went so quickly that not another word was spoken to him the idea of a neighbor in the bush refusing such assistance as he had asked was as terrible as to us is the thought of a ship at sea leaving another ship in distress he unhitched his horse from the fence and galloped home as fast as the animal would carry him  medlicot when he was left alone took two or three turns about the mill as though inspecting the work but at every turn fixed his eyes for a few moments on nokes face the man was standing under a huge caldron regulating the escape of the boiling juice into the different vats by raising and lowering a trap and giving directions to the polynesians as he did so he was evidently conscious that he was being regarded and as is usual in such a condition manifestly failed in his struggle to appear unconscious medlicot acknowledged to himself that the man could not look even him in the face was it possible that he had been wrong and that heathcote though he had expressed himself badly was entitled to some sympathy in his fear of what might be done to him by an enemy medlicot also desired to be just being more rational more logical and less impulsive than the other being also somewhat too conscious of his own superior intelligence he knew that heathcote had gone away in great dudgeon and he almost feared that he had been harsh and unneighborly after a while he stood opposite nokes and addressed him  do the squatters suffer much from fires he said  heathcote has been talking to you about that said the man  cant you say mr heathcote when you speak of a gentleman whose bread you have eaten  mr heathcote if you like it we aint particular to a shade out here as you are at home he has been telling you about fires has he  well he has  and talking of me i suppose  you were talking of having a turn at mining some day how would it be with you if you were to be off to gympie  you mean to say im to go mr medlicot  i dont say that at all  look here mr medlicot my going or staying wont make any difference to heathcote theres a lot of em about here hates him that much that he is never to be allowed to rest in peace i tell you that fairly it aint any thing as i shall do thems not my ways mr medlicot but he has enemies here asll never let him rest  who are they  pretty nigh every body round he has carried himself that high they wont stand him whos heathcote  name some who are his enemies  theres the brownbies  oh the brownbies well its a bad thing to have enemies after that he left the sugarhouse and went across to the cottage     chapter v  boscobel   two days and two nights passed without fear of fire and then harry heathcote was again on the alert the earth was parched as though no drop of rain had fallen the fences were dry as tinder and the ground was strewed with broken atoms of timber from the trees each of which a spark would ignite two nights harry slept in his bed but on the third he was on horseback about the run watching thinking endeavoring to make provision directing others and hoping to make it believed that his eyes were every where in this way an entire week was passed and now it wanted but four days to christmas he would come home to breakfast about seven in the morning very tired but never owning that he was tired and then sleep heavily for an hour or two in a chair after that he would go out again on the run would sleep perhaps for another hour after dinner and then would start for his nights patrol during this week he saw nothing of medlicot and never mentioned his name but once on that occasion his wife told him that during his absence medlicot had been at the station  what brought him here harry asked fiercely  mrs heathcote explained that he had called in a friendly way and had said that if there were any fear of fire he would be happy himself to lend assistance  then the young squatter forgot himself in his wrath confound his hypocrisy said harry aloud i dont think hes a hypocrite said the wife  im sure hes not said kate daly  not a word more was spoken and harry immediately left the house the two women did not as usual go to the gate to see him mount his horse not refraining from doing so in any anger or as wishing to exhibit displeasure at harrys violence but because they were afraid of him they had found themselves compelled to differ from him but were oppressed at finding themselves in opposition to him  the feeling that his wife should in any way take part against him added greatly to heathcotes trouble it produced in his mind a terrible feeling of loneliness in his sorrow he bore a brave outside to all his men and to any stranger whom in these days he met about the runto his wife and sister also and to the old woman at home he forced upon them all an idea that he was not only autocratic but selfsufficient alsothat he wanted neither help nor sympathy he never cried out in his pain being heartily ashamed even of the appeal which he had made to medlicot he spoke aloud and laughed with the men and never acknowledged that his trials were almost too much for him but he was painfully conscious of his own weakness he sometimes felt when alone in the bush that he would fain get off his horse and lie upon the ground and weep till he slept it was not that he trusted no one he suspected no one with a positive suspicion except nokes and medlicot as the supporter of nokes but he had no one with whom he could converse freelynone whom he had not been accustomed to treat as the mere ministers of his willexcept his wife and his wifes sister and now he was disjoined from them by their sympathy with medlicot he had chosen to manage every thing himself without contradiction and almost without counsel but like other such imperious masters he now found that when trouble came the privilege of dictatorship brought with it an almost unsupportable burden  old bates was an excellent man of whose fidelity the young squatter was quite assured no one understood footrot better than old bates or was less sparing of himself in curing it he was a second mother to all the lambs and when shearing came watched with the eyes of argus to see that the sheep were not wounded by the shearers or the wool left on their backs but he had no conversation none of that imagination which in such a time as this might have assisted in devising safeguards and but little enthusiasm shepherds so called harry kept none upon the run and would have felt himself insulted had any one suggested that he was so backward in his ways as to employ men of that denomination he had fenced his run and dispensed with shepherds and shepherding as oldfashioned and unprofitable he had two mounted men whom he called boundary riders one an irishman and the other a germanand them he trusted fully the german altogether and the irishman equally as regarded his honesty but he could not explain to them the thoughts that loaded his brain he could instigate them to eagerness but he could not condescend to tell karl bender the german that if his fences were destroyed neither his means nor his credit would be sufficient to put them up again and that if the scanty herbage were burned off any large proportion of his run he must sell his flocks at a great sacrifice nor could he explain to mickey odowd the irishman that his peace of mind was destroyed by his fear of one man he had to bear it all alone and there was heavy on him also the great misery of feeling that every thing might depend on own exertions and that yet he did not know how or where to exert himself when he had ridden about all night and discovered nothing he might just as well have been in bed and he was continually riding about all night and discovering nothing  after leaving the station on the evening of the day on which he had expressed himself to the women so vehemently respecting medlicot he met bates coming home from his days work it was then past eight oclock and the old man was sitting wearily on his horse with his head low down between his shoulders and the reins hardly held within his grasp  youre late mr bates said harry you take too much out of yourself this hot weather  ive got to move slower mr heathcote as i grow older thats about it and the beast im on is not much good now mr bates was always complaining of his horse and yet was allowed to choose any on the run for his own use  if you dont like him why dont you take another  there aint much difference in em mr heathcote better the devil you know than the devil you dont its getting uncommon close shaving for them wethers in the new paddock theyre down upon the roots pretty well already  theres grass along the bush on the north side  they wont go there its rank and sour they wont feed up there as long as they can live lower down and nearer the water weather like this theyd sooner die near the water than travel to fill their bellies its about the hottest day weve had and the nights amost hotter are you going to be out mr heathcote  i think so  whats the good of it mr heathcote there is no use in it lord love you what can yon do you cant be every side at once  fire can only travel with the wind mr bates  and there isnt any wind and so there cant be any fire i never did think and i dont think now there ever was any use in a man fashing himself as you fash yourself you cant alter things mr heathcote  but thats just what i can dowhat a man has to do if a match were thrown there at your feet and the grass was aflame couldnt you alter that by putting your foot on it if you find a ewe on her back cant you alter that by putting her on her legs  yes i can do that i suppose  what does a man live for except to alter things when a man clears the forest and sows corn does he not alter things  thats not your line mr heathcote said the cunning old man  if i send wool to market i alter things  youll excuse me mr heathcote of course im old but i just give you my experience  im much obliged to you though we cant always agree you know goodnight go in and say a word to my wife and tell them you saw me all right  ill have a crack with em mr heathcote before i turn in  and tell mary i sent my love  i will mr heathcote i will  he was thinking always of his wife during his solitary rides and of her fear and deep anxiety it was for her sake and for the children that he was so careworn not for his own had he been alone in the world he would not have fretted himself in this fashion because of the malice of any man but how would it be with her should he be forced to move her from gangoil and yet with all his love they had parted almost in anger surely she would understand the tenderness of the message he had just sent her  of a sudden as he was riding he stopped his horse and listened attentively from a great distance there fell upon his accustomed ear a sound which he recognized though he was aware that the place from whence it came was at least two miles distant it was the thud of an axe against a tree he listened still and was sure that it was so and turned at once toward the sound though in doing so he left his course at a right angle he had been going directly away from the river with his back to the woolshed but now he changed his course riding in the direction of the spot at which jacko had nearly fallen in jumping over the fence as he continued on the sounds became plainer till at last reining in his horse he could see the form of the woodman who was still at work ringing the trees this was a job which the man did by contract receiving so much an acre for the depopulation of the timber it was now bright moonlight almost as clear as daya very different night indeed from that on which the rain had comeand harry could see at a glance that it was the man called boscobel still at work now there were as he thought very good reasons why boscobel at the present moment should not be so employed boscobel was receiving wages for work of another kind  bos said the squatter riding up and addressing the man by the customary abbreviation of his nickname i thought you were watching at brownbies boundary boscobel lowered his axe and stood for a while contemplating the proposition made to him you are drawing three shillings a night for watching isnt that so  yes thats so anyways i shall draw it  then why aint you watching  theres nothing to watch that i knows onnot just now  then why should i pay you for it im to pay you for ringing these trees aint i  certainly mr heathcote  then youre to make double use of your time and sell it twice over are you dont try to look like a fool as though you didnt understand you know that what youre doing isnt honest  nobody ever said as i wasnt honest before  i tell you so now youre robbing me of the time youve sold to me and for which im to pay you  there aint nothing to watch while the winds as it is now and that chap aint any where about tonight  what chap  oh i know im all right whats the use of dawdling about up there in the broad moonlight and the wind like this  thats for me to judge if you engage to do my work and take my money youre swindling me when you go about another job as you are now you neednt scratch your head you understand it all as well as i do  i never was told i swindled before and i aint agoing to put up with it you may ring your own trees and watch your own fences and the whole place may be burned for me i aint agoing to do another turn in gangoil swindle indeed so boscobel shouldered his axe and marched off through the forest visible in the moonlight till the trees hid him  there was another enemy made he had never felt quite sure of this man but had been glad to have him about the place as being thoroughly efficient in his own business it was only during the last ten days that he had agreed to pay him for nightwatching leaving the man to do as much additional daywork as he pleasedfor which of course he would be paid at the regular contract price there was a double purpose intended in this watchingas was well understood by all the hands employed first that of preventing incendiary fire by the mere presence of the watchers and secondly that of being at hand to extinguish fire in case of need now a man ringing trees five or six miles away from the beat on which he was stationed could not serve either of these purposes boscobel therefore had been fraudulently at work for his own dishonest purposes and knew well that his employment was of that nature all this was quite clear to heathcote and it was clear to him also that when he detected fraud he was bound to expose it had the man acknowledged his fault and been submissive there would have been an end of the matter heathcote would have said no word about it to any one and would not have stopped a farthing from the weeks unearned wages that he had to encounter a certain amount of ill usage from the rough men about him and to forgive it he could understand but it could not be his duty either as a man or a master to pass over dishonesty without noticing it no that he would not do though gangoil should burn from end to end he did not much mind being robbed he knew that to a certain extent he must endure to be cheated he would endure it but he would never teach his men to think that he passed over such matters because he was afraid of them or that dishonesty on their part was indifferent to him  but now he had made another enemyan enemy of a man who had declared to him that he knew the movements of that chap meaning nokes how hard the world was it seemed that all around were trouble to him he turned his horse back and made again for the spot which was his original destination as he cantered on among the trees twisting here and there and regulating his way by the stars he asked himself whether it would not be better for him to go home and lay himself down by his wife and sleep and await the worst that these men could do to him this idea was so strong upon him that at one spot he made his horse stop till he had thought it all out no one encouraged him in his work every one about the place friend or foe bates his wife medlicot and this boscobel spoke to him as though he were fussy and fidgety in his anxiety if fires must come they will come and if they are not to come you are simply losing your labor this was the upshot of all they said to him why should he be wiser than they if the ruin came let it come old bates had been ruined but still had enough to eat and drink and clothes to wear and did not work half as hard as his employer he thought that if he could only find some one person who would sympathize with him and support him he would not mind but the mental loneliness of his position almost broke his heart  then there came across his mind the dim remembrance of certain old school words and he touched his horse with his spur and hurried onward let there be no steps backward a thought as to the manliness of persevering of the want of manliness in yielding to depression came to his rescue let him at any rate have the comfort of thinking that he had done his best according to his lights after some dim fashion he did come to recognize it as a fact that nothing could really support him but selfapprobation though he fell from his horse in utter weariness he would persevere  as the night wore on he came to the germans hut and finding it empty as he expected rode on to the outside fence of his run when he reached this he got off his horse and taking a key out of his pocket whistled upon it loudly a few minutes afterward the german came up to him  theres been no one about i suppose he asked  not a one said the man  youve been across on brownbies run  were on it now mr eathcote they were both on the side of the fence away from gangoil station  i dont know how that is karl i think gangoil goes a quarter of a mile beyond this but we did not quite strike the boundary when we put up the fence  brownbies cattle is allays here mr eathcote and is knocking down the fence every day brownbie is a rascal and is cattle as bad as isself  never mind that karl now when weve got through the heats well put a mile or two of better fencing along here you know boscobel  in course i know bos  what sort of a fellow is he then harry told his german dependent exactly what had taken place between him and the other man  hes in and in wid all them young brownbies said karl  the brownbies are a bad lot but i dont think theyd do any thing of this kind said harry whose mind was still dwelling on the dangers of fire  they likes muttons mr eathcote  i suppose they do take a sheep or two now and then they wouldnt do worse than that would they  noting too ot for em noting too eavy said karl smoking his pipe the vind vat there is comes just here mr eathcote and the man lifted up his arm and pointed across in the direction of brownbies run  and you dont think much of boscobel  karl bender shook his head  he was always well treated here said harry and has had plenty of work and earned large wages the man will be a fool to quarrel with me  karl again shook his head with karl bender harry was quite sure of his man but not on that account need he be quite sure of the correctness of the mans opinion  thence he went on till he met his other lieutenant odowd and so having completed his work he made his way home reaching the station at sunrise  did bates tell you hed met me he asked his wife  yes harry kiss me harry i was so glad you sent a word promise me harry not to think that i dont agree with you in every thing     chapter vi  the brownbies of boolabong   old brownbie as he was usually called was a squatter also but a squatter of a class very different from that to which heathcote belonged he had begun his life in the colonies a little under a cloud having been sent out from home after the perpetration of some peccadillo of which the law had disapproved  in colonial phrase he was a laghaving been transported but this was many years ago when he was quite young and he had now been a free man for more than thirty years it must be owned on his behalf that he had worked hard had endeavored to rise and had risen but there still stuck to him the savor of his old life every one knew that he had been a convict and even had he become a man of high principlea condition which he certainly never achievedhe could hardly have escaped altogether from the thralldom of his degradation he had been a butcher a drover part owner of stock and had at last become possessed of a share of a cattlerun and then of the entire property such as it was he had four or five sons uneducated illconditioned drunken fellows who had all their fathers faults without his energy some of whom had been in prison and all of whom were known as pests to the colony their place was called boolabong and was a cattlerun as distinguished from a sheeprun but it was a poor place was sometimes altogether unstocked and was supposed to be not unfrequently used as a receptable for stolen cattle  the tricks which the brownbies played with cattle were notorious throughout queensland and new south wales and by a certain class of men were much admired they would drive a few head of cattle perhaps forty or fifty for miles around the country across one station and another traveling many hundreds of miles and here and there as they passed along they would sweep into their own herd the bullocks of the victims whose lands they passed if detected on the spot they gave up their prey they were in the right in moving their own cattle and were not responsible for the erratic tendencies of other animals if successful they either sold their stolen beasts to butchers on the road or got them home to boolabong there were dangers of course and occasional penalties but there was much success it was supposed also that though they did not own sheep they preferred mutton for their daily uses and that they supplied themselves at a very cheap rate  it may be imagined how such a family would be hated by the respectable squatters on whom they preyed still there were men old stagers who had know moreton bay before it was a colonyin the old days when convicts were commonwho almost regarded the brownbies as a part of the common order of things and who were indisposed to persecute them men must live and what were a few sheep of some such it might be said that though they were above the arts by which the brownbies lived they were not very scrupulous themselves and it perhaps served them to have within their ken neighbours whose morality was lower even than their own but to such a one as harry heathcote the brownbies were utterly abominable he was for the law and justice at any cost to his thinking the colonial government was grossly at fault because it did not weed out and extirpate not only the identical brownbies but all brownbieism wherever it might be found a dishonest workman was a great evil but to his thinking a dishonest man in the position of master was the incarnation of evil as to the difficulties of evidence and obstacles of that nature harry heathcote knew nothing the brownbies were rascals and should therefore be exterminated  and the brownbies knew well the estimation in which their neighbour held them harry had made himself altogether disagreeable to them they were squatters as well as heor at least so they termed themselves and though they would not have expected to be admitted to home intimacies they thought that when they were met outofdoors or in public places they should be treated with some respect on such occasions harry treated them as though they were dirt beneath his feet the brownbies would be found whenever a little money came among them at the public billiardrooms and racecourses within one hundred and fifty miles of boolabong at such places harry heathcote was never seen it would have been as easy to seduce the bishop of brisbane into a bet as harry heathcote he had never even drank a nobbler with one of the brownbies to their thinking he was a proud stuckup unsocial young cub whom to rob was a pleasure and to ruin would be a delight  the old man at boolabong was now almost obsolete property that he could keep in his grasp there was in truth none he was the tenant of the run under the crown and his sons would not turn him out of the house the cattle when there were cattle belonged to them they were in no respect subject to his orders and he would have had a bad life among them were it not that they quarreled among themselves and that in such quarrels he could belong to one party or to the other the house itself was a wretched placeout of order with doors and windows and floors shattered broken and decayed there were none of womankind belonging to the family and in such a house a decent womanservant would have been out of her place sometimes there was one hag there and sometimes another and sometimes feminine aid less respectable than that of the hags there had been six sons one had disappeared utterly so that nothing was known of him one had been absolutely expelled by the brethren and was now a vagabond in the country turning up now and then at boolabong and demanding food of the whole lot georgie brownbie the vagabond was the worst the eldest son was at this time in prison at brisbane having on some late occasion been less successful than usual in regard to some acquired bullocks the three youngest were at homejerry jack and joe tom who was in prison was the only stanch friend to the father who consequently at this time was in a more than usually depressed condition  christmasday would fall on a tuesday and on the monday before it jerry brownbie the eldest of those now at home was sitting with a pipe in his mouth on a brokendown stool on the brokendown veranda of the house and the old man was seated on a stuffy wornout sofa with three legs which was propped against the wall of the house and had not been moved for years old brownbie was a man of gigantic frame and had possessed immense personal powera man too of will and energy but he was now worn out and dropsical and could not move beyond the confines of the home station the veranda was attached to a big room which ran nearly the whole length of the house and which was now used for all purposes there was an exterior kitchen in which certain processes were carried onsuch as salting stolen mutton and boiling huge masses of meat when such work was needed but the cookery was generally done in the big room and here also two or three of the sons slept on beds made upon stretchers along the wall they were not probably very particular as to which owned each bed enjoying a fraternal communism in that respect at the end of this chamber the old man had a room of his own boolabong was certainly a miserable place and yet such as it was it was frequented by many guests the vagabondism of the colonies is proverbial vagabonds are taken in almost every where throughout the bush but the welcome given to them varies sometimes they are made to work before they are fedto their infinite disgust but no such cruelty was exercised at boolabong boolabong was a very paradise for vagabonds there was always flour and meat to be had generally tobacco and sometimes even the luxury of a nobbler the brownbies were wise enough to have learned that it was necessary for their very existence that they should have friends in the land on the sunday the father and jerry brownbie were sitting out in the veranda at about noon and the other two sons jack and joe were lying asleep on the beds within  the heat of the day was intense there was a wind blowing but it was that which is called there the hot wind which comes dry scorching sometimes almost intolerable over the burning central plain of the country no one can understand without feeling it how much a wind can add to the sufferings inflicted by heat the old man had on a dirty wretched remnant of a dressinggown but jerry was clothed simply in trowsers and an old shirt only that the mosquitoes would have flayed him he would have dispensed probably with these he had been quarreling with his father respecting a certain horse which he had sold of the price of which the father demanded a share jerry had unblushingly declared that he himself had shaken the horseanglice had stolen himtwelve months since on darnley downs and was therefore clearly entitled to the entire plunder the father had rejoined with animation that unless half a quidor ten shillingswere given him as his contribution to the keep of the animal he would inform against his son to the squatter on the darnley downs and had shown him that he knew the very run from which the horse had been taken then the sons within had interfered from their beds swearing that their father was the noisiest old cuss unhung they having had their necessary slumbers disturbed  at this moment the debate was interrupted by the appearance of a man outside the veranda well mr jerry how goes it asked the stranger what bos is that you what brings you up to boolabong i thought you was ringing trees for that young scut at gangoil ill be even with him some of these days he had the impudence to send a man of his up here last week looking for sheepskins  he wasnt that soft mr jerry was he well ive dropped working for himhow are you mr brownbie i hope i see you finely sir its stiffish sort of weather mr brownbie aint it sir  the old man grunted out some reply and then asked boscobel what he wanted  ill just hang about for the day mr brownbie and get a little grub you never begrudged a workingman that yet  old brownbie again grunted but said no word of welcome that however was to be taken for granted without much expression of opinion  no mr jerry continued boscobel ive done with that fellow  and so has nokes done with him  nokes is at work on medlicots mill that sugar business wouldnt suit me  an axe in your hand is what youre fit for bos  theres a many things i can turn my hand to mr jerry you couldnt give a fellow such a thing as a nobbler mr jerry could you id offer money for it only i know it would be taken amiss its that hot that a fellows very inards get parched up  upon this jerry slowly rose and going to a cupboard brought forth a modicum of spirits which he called battleaxe but which was supposed to be brandy this boscobel swallowed at a gulp and then washed it down with a little water  come jerry said the old man somewhat relenting in his wrath you might as well give us a drop as its going about the two brothers who had now been thoroughly aroused from their sleep and who had heard the enticing sound of the spirit bottle joined the party and so they drank all round  heathcotes in an awful state about them fires aint he asked jerry  boscobel who had squatted down on the veranda and was now lighting his pipe bobbed his head  i wish he was clean burned outover head and ears said jerry  boscobel bobbed his head again sucking with great energy at the closely staffed pipe  if he treated me like he does you fellows continued jerry he shouldnt have a yard of fencing or a blade of grass leftnor a ewe nor a lamb nor a hogget i do hate fellows who come here and want to be better than any one about emyoung chaps especially sending up here to look for sheepskins cuss his impudence i sent that german fellow of his away with a flea in his ear  karl bender  its some such name as that  hes all in all with the young squire said boscobel and theres a chap there called jackohes another he gets em down there to gangoil and the ladies talks to em and then theyd go through fire and water for him theres mickeyhes another jist the same way i dont like them ways myself  too much of master and man about it aint there bos  just that mr jerry that aint my idea of a free country i can work as well as another but i aint going to be told that im a swindler because im making the most of my time  he turned nokes out by the scruff of his neck said jerry boscobel again bobbed his head i didnt think nokes was the sort of fellow to stand that  no more he aint said boscobel  heathcotes a good plucked un all the same said joe  its like you to speak up for such a fellow is that said jerry  i say hes a good plucked un im not standing up for him nokes is half a stone heavier than him and ought to have knocked him over thats what youdve done wouldnt you bos i know i would  hed ve had my axe at his head said boscobel  we all know joes game to the backbone said jerry  im game enough for you anyway said the brother and you can try it out any time you like  thats right fight like dogs do said the old man  the quarrel at this point was interrupted by the arrival of another man who crept up round the corner on to the veranda exactly as boscobel had done this was nokes of whom they had that moment been speaking there was silence for a few moments among them as though they feared that he might have heard them and nokes stood hanging his head as though half ashamed of himself then they gave him the same kind of greeting as the other men had received nobody told him that he was welcome but the spirit jar was again brought into use jerry measuring out the liquor and it was understood that nokes was to stay there and get his food he too gave some account of himself which was supposed to suffice but which they all knew to be false it was sunday and they were off work at the sugarmill he had come across gangoil run intending to take back with him things of his own which he had left as benders hut and having come so far had thought that he would come on and get his dinner at boolabong as this was being told a good deal was said of harry heathcote nokes declared that he had come right across gangoil and explained that he would not have been at all sorry to meet master heathcote in the bush master heathcote had had his own way up at the station when he was backed by a lot of his own hands but a good time was coming perhaps then nokes gave it to be understood very plainly that it was the settled practice of his life to give harry heathcote a thrashing during all this there was an immense amount of bad language and a large portion of the art which in the colony is called blowing jerry boscobel and nokes all boasted each that on the first occasion he would give harry heathcote such a beating that a whole bone should hardly be left in the mans skin  there isnt one of you man enough to touch him said joe who was known as the freest fighter of the brownbie family  and youd eat him i suppose said jerry  hes not likely to come in my way said joe but if he does hell get as good as he brings thats all  this was unpleasant to the visitors who of course felt themselves to be snubbed boscobel affected to hear the slight put upon his courage with good humor but nokes laid himself down in a corner and sulked they were soon all asleep and remained dozing snoring changing their uncomfortable positions and cursing the mosquitoes till about four in the afternoon when boscobel got up shook himself and made some observation about grub the meal of the day was then prepared a certain quantity of flour and raw meat ample for their immediate wants was given to the two strangers with which they retired into the outer kitchen prepared it for themselves and there ate their dinner and each of the brothers did the same for himself in the big roomjoe the fighting brother providing for his fathers wants as well as his own one of them had half a leg of cold mutton so that he was saved the trouble of cooking but he did not offer to share this comfort with the others an enormous kettle of tea was made and that was common among them while this was being consumed boscobel put his head into the room and suggested that he and his mate wanted a drink whereupon jerry without a word pointed to the kettle and boscobel was allowed to fill two pannikins such was the welcome which was always accorded to strangers in boolabong  after their meal the men came back on to the veranda and there were more smoking and sleeping more boasting and snarling different allusions were made to the spirit jar especially by the old man but they were made in vain the battleaxe was jerrys own property and he felt that he had already been almost foolishly liberal but he had an object in view he was quite sure that boscobel and nokes had not come to boolabong on the same sunday by any chance coincidence the men had something to propose and in their own way they would make the proposition before they left and would make it probably to him boscobel intended to sleep at boolabong but nokes had explained that it was his purpose to return that night to medlicots mill the proposition no doubt would be made soona little after seven when the day was preparing to give way suddenly to night nokes first walked off sloping out from the veranda in a halfshy halfcunning manner looking nowhither and saying a word to no one quickly after him boscobel jumped up suddenly hitched up his trowsers and followed the first man at about a similar interval jerry passed out through the big room to the yard at the back and from the yard to a shed that was used as a shambles here he found the other two men and no doubt the proposition was made  theres something up said the old man as soon as jerry was gone  of course theres something up said joe those fellows didnt come all the way to boolabong for nothing  its something about young heathcote suggested the father  if it is said jack whats that to you  theyll get themselves hanged thats all about it  that be blowed said jack you go easy and hold your tongue if you know nothing nobody can hurt you  i know nothing said joe and dont mean if i had scores to quit with a fellow like harry heathcote i should do it after my own fashion i shouldnt get boscobel to help me nor yet such a fellow as nokes but its no business of mine heathcotes made the place too hot to hold him thats all about it there was no more said and in an hours time jerry returned to the family neither the father nor brother asked him any questions nor did he volunteer any information  boolabong was about fourteen miles from medlicots mill nokes had walked this distance in the morning and now retraced it at nightnot going right across gangoil as he had falsely boasted of doing early in the day but skirting it and keeping on the outside of the fence nearly the whole distance at about two in the morning he reached his cottage outside the mill on the riverbank but he was unable to skulk in unheard some dogs made a noise and presently he heard a voice calling him from the house is that you nokes at this time of night asked mr medlicot nokes grunted out some reply intending to avoid any further question but his master came up to the hut door and asked him where he had been  just amusing myself said nokes  its very late  its not later for me than for you mr medlicot  thats true ive just ridden home from  from gangoil i didnt know you were so friendly there mr medlicot  and where have you been  not to gangoil anyway goodnight mr medlicot then the man took himself into his hut and was safe from further questioning that night     chapter vii  i wish youd like me   all the saturday night heathcote had been on the run and he did not return home to bed till nearly dawn on the sunday morning at about noon prayers were read out on the veranda the congregation consisting of mrs heathcote and her sister mrs growler and jacko harry himself was rather averse to this performance intimating that mrs growler if she were so minded could read the prayers for herself in the kitchen and that as regarded jacko they would be altogether thrown away but his wife had made a point of maintaining the practice and he had of course yielded the service was not long and when it was over harry got into a chair and was soon asleep he had been in the saddle during sixteen hours of the previous day and night and was entitled to be fatigued his wife sat beside him every now and again protecting him from the flies while kate daly sat by with her bible in her hand but she too from time to time was watching her brotherinlaw the trouble of his spirits and the work that he felt himself bound to do touched them with a strong feeling and taught them to regard him for the time as a young hero  how quietly he sleeps kate said the fatigue of the last week must have been terrible  he is quite quite knocked up said the wife  i aint knocked up a bit said harry jumping up from his chair what should knock me up i wasnt asleep was i  just dozing dear  ah well there isnt any thing to do and its too hot to get out i wonder old bates didnt come in for prayers  i dont think he cares much for prayers said mrs heathcote  but he likes an excuse for a nobbler as well as any one did i tell you that they had fires over at jacksons yesterdayat goolaroo  was there any harm done  a deal of grass burned and they had to drive the sheep which wont serve them this kind of weather i dont know which i fear mostthe grass the fences or the sheep as for the buildings i dont think theyll try that again  why not harry  the risk of being seen is too great i can hardly understand that a man like nokes should have been such a fool as he was  you think it was nokes  oh yes certainly in the first place jacko is as true as steel i dont mean to swear by the boy though i think he is a good boy but im sure hes true in this and then the mans manner to myself was conclusive i can not understand a man in medlicots position supporting a fellow like that by heavens it nearly drives me mad to think of it thousands and thousands of pounds are at stake all that a man has in the world is exposed to the malice of a scoundrel like nokes and then a man who calls himself a gentleman will talk about it being unenglish to look after him hes a new chum i suppose thats his excuse  if its a sufficient excuse you should excuse him said kate with good feminine logic  thats just like you all over hes goodlooking and therefore its all right he ought to have learned better he ought at any rate to believe that men who have been here much longer than he has must know the ways of the country a great deal better  its christmastime harry said his wife and you should endeavor to forgive your neighbors  what sort of a christmas will it be if you and i and these young fellows here and kate are all burned out of gangoil heres bateswell mr bates how goes it  tremendous hot sir  weve found that out already you havent heard where that fellow boscobel has gone  no i havent heard but hell be over with some of those brownbie lads they say georgie brownbies about the country somewhere if so therell be a row among em  when thieves fall out mr bates honest men come by their own  so they say mr heathcote all the same i shouldnt care how far georgie was away from any place i had to do with then the young master and his old superintendent sauntered out to his back premises to talk about sheep and fires and plans for putting out fires and no doubt mr bates had the glass of brandyandwater which he had come to regard as one of his sunday luxuries from the back premises they went down to the creek to gauge the water then they sauntered on keeping always in the shade sitting down here to smoke and standing up there to discuss the pedigree of some particular ram till it was past six  you may as well come in and dine with us mr bates harry suggested as they returned toward the station  mr bates said that he thought that he would as the same invitation was given on almost every sunday throughout the year and was invariably answered in the same way there was not much excitement in this but mr bates would not have dreamed of going in to dinner without being asked  thats medlicots trap said mr bates as they entered the yard i heard wheels when they were in the horse paddock  harry looked at the trap and then went quickly into the house  he walked with a rapid step onto the veranda and there he found the sugar grower and his mother mrs heathcote looked at her husband almost timidly she knew from the very sound of his feet that he was perturbed in spirit under his own rooftree he would certainly be courteous but there is a constrained courtesy very hard to be borne of which she knew him to be capable he first went up to the old lady and to her his greeting was pleasant enough harry heathcote though he had assumed the bush mode of dressing still retained the manners of a highbred gentleman in his intercourse with women then turning sharply round he gave his hand to mr medlicot  i am glad to see you at gangoil he said i was not fortunate enough to be at home when you called the other day mrs medlicot must have found the drive very hot i fear  his wife was still looking into his face and was reading there as in a book the mingled pride and disdain with which her husband exercising civility to his enemy harrys countenance wore a look not difficult of perusal and medlicot could read the lines almost as distinctly as harrys wife  i have asked mrs medlicot to stay and dine with us she said so that she may have it cool for the drive back  i am almost afraid of the bush at night said the old woman  youll have a full moon said harry it will be as light as day so that was settled heathcote thought it odd that the man whom he regarded as his enemy whom he had left at their last meeting in positive hostility should consent to accept a dinner under his roof but that was medlicots affair not his  they dined at seven and after dinner strolled out into the horse paddock and down to the creek as they started the three men went first and the ladies followed them but bates soon dropped behind it was his rest day and he had already moved quite as much as was usual with him on a sunday  i think i was a little hard with you the other day said medlicot when they were alone together  i suppose we hardly understand each others ideas said harry he spoke with a constrained voice and with an almost savage manner engendered by a determination to hold his own he would forgive any offense for which an apology was made but no apology had been made as yet and to tell the truth he was a little afraid that if they got into an argument on the matter medlicot would have the best of it and there was too almost a claim to superiority in medlicots use of the word hard when one man says that he has been hard to another he almost boasts that on that occasion he got the better of him  thats just it said medlicot we do not quite understand each other but we might believe in each other all the same and then the understanding would come but it isnt just that which i want to say such talking rarely does any good  what is it then  you may perhaps be right about that man nokes  no doubt i may i know im right when i asked him whether hed been at my shed what made him say that he hadnt been there at nighttime i said nothing about nighttime but the man was there at nighttime or he wouldnt have used the word  im not sure that that is evidence  perhaps not in england mr medlicot but its good enough evidence for the bush and what made him pretend he didnt know the distances and why cant he look a man in the face and why should the boy have said it was he if it wasnt of course if you think well of him youre right to keep him but you may take it as a rule out here that when a man has been dismissed it hasnt been done for nothing men treated that way should travel out of the country its better for all parties it isnt here as it is at home where people live so thick together that nothing is thought of a man being dismissed i was obliged to discharge him and now hes my enemy  a man may be your enemy without being a felon  of course he may im his enemy in a way but i wouldnt hurt a hair of his head unjustly when i see the attempts made to burn me out of course i know that an enemy has been at work  is there no one else has got a grudge against you  harry was silent for a moment what right had this man to crossexamine him about his enmitiesthe man whose own position in the place had been one of hostility to him whom he had almost suspected of harboring nokes at the mill simply because nokes had been dismissed from gangoil that suspicion was indeed fading away there was something in medlicots voice and manner which made it impossible to attribute such motives to him nevertheless the man was a freeselector and had taken a bit of the gangoil run after a fashion which to heathcote was objectionable politically morally and socially let medlicot in regard to character be what he might he was a freeselector and a squatters enemy and had clinched his hostility by employing a servant dismissed from the very run out of which he had bought his land it is hard to say he replied at length who have grudges as against whom or why i suppose i have a great grudge against you if the truth is to be known but i shant burn down your mill  im sure you wont  nor yet say worse of you behind your back than i will to your face  i dont want you to think that you have occasion to speak ill of me either one way or the other what i mean is thisi dont quite think that the evidence against nokes is strong enough to justify me in sending him away but ill keep an eye on him as well as i can it seems that he left our place early this morning but the men are not supposed to be there on sundays and of course he does as he pleases with himself  the conversation then dropped and in a little time harry made some excuse for leaving them and returned to the house alone promising however that he would not start for his nights ride till after the party had come back to the station there is no hurry at all he said i shant stir for two hours yet but mickey will be waiting there for stores for himself and the german  that means a nobbler for mickey said kate either of those men would think it a treat to ride ten miles in and ten miles back with a horseload of sugar and tea and flour for the sake of a glass of brandyandwater  and so would you said harry if you lived in a hut by yourself for a fortnight with nothing to drink but tea without milk  the old lady and mrs heathcote were soon seated on the grass while medlicot and kate daly roamed on together kate was a pretty modest girl timid withal and shy unused to society and therefore awkward but with the natural instincts and aptitudes of her sex what the glass of brandyandwater was to mickey odowd after a fortnights solitude in a bush hut with tea dampers and lumps of mutton a young man in the guise of a gentleman was to poor kate daly a brotherinlaw let him be ever so good is after all no better than tea without milk no doubt mickey odowd often thought about a nobbler in his thirsty solitude and so did kate speculate on what might possibly be the attractions of a lover medlicot probably indulged in no such speculations but the nobbler when brought close to his lips was grateful to him as to others that kate daly was very pretty no man could doubt  isnt it sad that he should have to ride about all night like that said kate to whom as was proper harry heathcote at the present moment was of more importance than any other human being  i suppose he likes it  oh no mr medlicot how can he like it it is not the hard work he minds but the constant dread of coming evil  the excitement keeps him alive  theres plenty on a station to keep a man alive in that way at all times  and plenty to keep ladies alive too  oh ladies i dont know that ladies have any business in the bush harrys trouble is all about my sister and the children and me he wouldnt care a straw for himself  do you think hed be better without a wife  kate hesitated for a moment well no i suppose it would be very rough without mary and hed be so lonely when he came in  and nobody to make his tea  or to look after his things said kate earnestly i know it was very rough before we came here he says that himself there were no regular meals but just food in a cupboard when he chose to get it  that is not comfortable certainly  horrid i should think i suppose it is better for him to be married youve got your mother mr medlicot  yes ive got my mother  that makes a difference does it not  a very great difference shell save me from having to go to a cupboard for my bread and meat  i suppose having a woman about is better for a man they havent got any thing else to do and therefore they can look to things  do you help to look to things  i suppose i do something i often feel ashamed to think how very little it is as for that im not wanted at all  so that youre free to go elsewhere  i didnt mean that mr medlicot only i know im not of much use  but if you had a house of your own  gangoil is my home just as much as it is marys and i sometimes feel that harry is just as good to me as he is to mary  your sister will never leave gangoil  not unless harry gets another station  but you will have to be transplanted some day  kate merely chucked up her head and pouted her lips as though to show that the proposition was one which did not deserve an answer  youll marry a squatter of course miss daly  i dont suppose i shall ever marry any body mr medlicot  you wouldnt marry any one but a squatter i can quite understand that the squatters here are what the lords and the country gentlemen are at home  i cant even picture to myself what sort of life people live at home both medlicot and kate daly meant england when they spoke of home  there isnt so much difference as people think classes hang together just in the same way only i think theres a little more exclusiveness here than there was there  in answer to this kate asserted with innocent eagerness that she was not at all exclusive and that if ever she married any one shed marry the man she liked  i wish youd like me said medlicot  thats nonsense said kate in a low timid whisper hurrying away to rejoin the other ladies she could speculate on the delights of the beverage as would mickey odowd in his hut but when it was first brought to her lips she could only fly away from it in this respect mickey odowd was the more sensible of the two no other word was spoken that night between them but kate lay awake till morning thinking of the one word that had been spoken but the secret was kept sacredly within her own bosom  before the medlicots started that night the old lady made a proposition that the heathcotes and miss daly should eat the christmas dinner at medlicots mill mrs heathcote thinking perhaps of her sister thoroughly liking what she herself had seen of the medlicots looked anxiously into harrys face if he would consent to this an intimacy would follow and probably a real friendship be made  its out of the question he said the very firmness however with which he spoke gave a certain cordiality even to his refusal i must be at home so that the men may know where to find me till i go out for the night then after a pause he continued as we cant go to you why should you not come to us  so it was at last decided much to harrys own astonishment much to his wifes delight kate therefore when she lay awake thinking of the one word that had been spoken knew that there would be an opportunity for another word  medlicot drove his mother home safely and after he had taken her into the house encountered nokes on his return from boolabong as has been told at the close of the last chapter     chapter viii  i do wish he would come   on the monday morning harry came home as usual and as usual went to bed after his breakfast i wouldnt care about the heat if it were not for the wind he said to his wife as he threw himself down  the wind carries it so i suppose  yes and it comes from just the wrong sidefrom the northwest there have been half a dozen fires about today  during the night you mean  no yesterdaysunday i can not make out whether they come by themselves they certainly are not all made by incendiaries  accidents perhaps  well yes somebody drops a match and the sun ignites it but the chances are much against a fire like that spreading care is wanted to make it spread as far as i can learn the worst fires have not been just after midday when of course the heat is greater but in the early night before the dews have come all the same i feel that i know nothing about itnothing at all dont let me sleep long  in spite of this injunction mrs heathcote determined that he should sleep all day if he would even the nights were fearfully hot and sultry and on this monday morning he had come home much fatigued he would be out again at sunset and now he should have what rest nature would allow him but in this resolve she was opposed by jacko who came in at eleven and requested to see the master jacko had been over with the german and as he explained to mrs heathcote they two had been in and out sometimes sleeping and sometimes watching but now he wanted to see the master and under no persuasion would impart his information to the mistress the poor wife anxious as she was that her husband should sleep did not dare in these perilous times to ignore jacko and his information and therefore gently woke the sleeper in a few minutes jacko was standing by the young squatters bedside and harry heathcote quite awake was sitting up and listening george brownbies at boolabong that at first was the gravamen of jackos news  i know that already jacko  my word exclaimed jacko in those parts georgie brownbie was regarded almost as the evil one himself and jacko knowing what mischief was as it were in the word thought that he was entitled to bread and jam if not to a nobbler itself in bringing such tidings to gangoil  is that all asked heathcote  and bos is at boolabong and bill nokes was there all sunday and jerry brownbies been out with bos and georgie  the old man wouldnt say any thing of that kind jacko  the old man he knows nothing about it my word they dont tell him about nothing  or tom  toms away in prison they always cotches the best when they want to send em to prison if theyd lock up jerry and georgie and jack my word yes  you think theyre arranging it all at boolabong  in course they are  i dont see why boscobel shouldnt be at boolabong without intending me any harm of course hed go there when he left gangoil thats where they all go  and bill nokes mr harry  and bill nokes too though why he should travel so far from his work this weather i cant say  my word no mr harry  did you see any fires about your way last night  jacko shook his head  you go into the kitchen and get something to eat and wait for me i shall be out before long now  though heathcote had made light of the assemblage of evil spirits at boolabong which had seemed so important to jacko he by no means did regard the news as unessential of nokess villany he was convinced of boscobel he had imprudently made a second enemy at a most inauspicious time georgie brownbie had long been his bitter foe he had prosecuted and perhaps persecuted georgie for various offenses but as georgie was supposed to be as much at war with his own brethren as with the rest of the world at large heathcote had not thought much of that miscreant in the present emergency but if the miscreant were in truth at boolabong and if evil things were being plotted against gangoil georgie would certainly be among the conspirators  soon after noon harry was on horseback and jacko was at his heels the heat was more intense than ever mrs heathcote had twisted round harrys hat a long white scarf called a puggeree though we are by no means sure of our spelling jacko had spread a very dirty fragment of an old white handkerchief on his head and wore his hat over it mrs heathcote had begged harry to take a large cotton parasol and he had nearly consented being unable at last to reconcile himself to the idea of riding with such an accoutrement even in the bush the heats a bore he said but im not a bit afraid of it as long as i keep moving yes ill be back to dinner though i wont say when and i wont say for how long it will be the same thing all day tomorrow i wish with all my heart those people were not coming  he rode straight away to the germans hut which was on the northwestern extremity of his further paddock in that direction from thence the western fence ran in a southerly direction nearly straight to the river beyond the fence was a strip of land in some parts over a mile broad in others not much over a quarter of a mile which he claimed as belonging to gangoil but over which the brownbies had driven their cattle since the fence had been made under the pretense that the fence marked the boundary of two runs against this assumption heathcote had remonstrated frequently had driven the cattle back and had exercised the ownership of a crown tenant in such fashion as the nature of his occupation allowed beyond this strip was boolabong the house at boolabong being not above three miles distant from the fence and not above four miles from the germans hut so that the brownbies were in truth much nearer neighbors to the german than was heathcote and his family but between the german and the brownbies there raged an internecine feud no doubt harry heathcote in his heart liked the german all the better on this account but it behooved him both as a master and a magistrate to regard reports against boolabong coming from the german with something of suspicion now jacko had been introduced to gangoil under german auspices and had soon come to a decision that it would be a good thing and a just to lock up all the brownbies in the great jail of the colony at brisbane he probably knew nothing of law or justice in the abstract but he greatly valued law when exercised against those he hated the western fence of which mention has been made ran down to the mary river hitting it about four miles west of medlicots mill so that there was a considerable portion of the gangoil run having a frontage to the water as has been before said medlicots plantation was about fourteen miles distant from the house at boolabong and the distance from the gangoil house to that of the brownbies was about the same  the oppressiveness of the day was owing more to the hot wind than to the sun itself this wind coming from the arid plains of the interior brought with it a dry suffocating heat on this occasion it was odious to harry heathcote not so much on account of its own intrinsic abominations as because it might cause a fire to sweep across his run from its western boundary just beyond the boundary there lay boolabong and there were collected his enemies a fire that should have passed for a mile or so across the pastures outside and beyond his own farm would be altogether unextinguishable by the time that it had reached his paddock the brownbies as he knew well would care nothing for burning a patch of their own grass their stock if they had any at the present moment were much too few in number to be affected by such a loss the brownbies had not a yard of fencing to be burned and a fire if once it got a hold on the edge of their run would pass on away from them right across harrys pastures and harrys fences if such were the case he would have quite enough to do to drive his sheep from the fire and it might be that many of them also would perish in the flames the catastrophe might even be so bad so frightful that the shed and station and all should go though in thinking of all the fires of which he had heard he could remember none that had spread with fatality such as that  he found karl bender in his hut asleep the man was soon up apologizing for his somnolence and preparing tea for his masters entertainment it is not christmas like at home at all is it mr eathcote dear no them red divils is there ready to give us a christmas roasting then he told how he had boldly ridden up to boolabong that morning and had seen georgie and boscobel with his own eyes when asked what they had said to him he replied that he did not wait till any thing had been said but had hurried away as fast as his horse could carry him  ill go up to boolabong myself said harry  my word theyll just about knock your head off suggested jacko  karl bender also thought that the making of such a visit would be a source of danger but heathcote explained that any personal attack was not to be apprehended from these men thats not their game he said arguing that men who premeditated a secret outrage would not probably be tempted into personal violence the horror of the position lay in thisthat though a fire should rise up almost under the feet of men who were known to be hostile to him and whose characters were acknowledged to be bad still would there be no evidence against them it was known to all men that at periods of heat such as that which was now raging fires were common every day the pastures were in flames here there and every where it was said indeed that there existed no evidence of fires in the bush till men had come with their flocks but then there had been no smoking no boiling of pots no camping out till men had come and no matches every one around might be sure that some particular fire had been the work of an incendiary might be able to name the culprit who had done the deed and yet no jury could convict the miscreant watchfulness was the best security watchfulness day and night till rain should come and heathcote calculated that it would be better for him that his enemies should know that he was watchful he would go up among them and show them that he was not ashamed to speak to them of his anxiety they could hear nothing by his coming which they did not already know they were well aware that he was on the watch and it might be well that they should know also how close his watch was kept he took the german and jacko with him but left them with their horses about a mile on the boolabong side of his own fence nigh to the extreme boundary of the debatable land they knew his whistle and were to ride to him at once should he call them  he had left the house about noon saying that he would be home to dinnerwhich however on such occasions was held to be a feast movable over a wide space of time but on this occasion the women expected him to come early as it was his intention to be out again as soon as it should be dark mrs growler was asked to have the dinner ready at six during the day mrs heathcote was backward and forward in the kitchen then was something wrong she knew but could not quite discern the evil sing sing the cook was more than ordinarily alert but sing sing the cook was not much trusted mrs growler was as good as the bank as far as that went having lived with old mr daly when he was prosperous but she was apt to be downhearted and on the present occasion was more than usually low in spirits whenever mrs heathcote spoke she wept at six oclock she came into the parlor with a budget of news sing sing the cook had been gone for the last half hour leaving the leg of mutton at the fire it soon became clear to them that he had altogether absconded  them rats always does leave a falling house said mrs growler  at seven oclock the sun was down though the gloom of the tropical evening had not yet come the two ladies went out to the gate which was but a few yards from the veranda and there stood listening for the sound of harrys horse the low moaning of the wind through the trees could be heard but it was so gentle continuous and unaltered that it seemed to be no more than a vehicle for other sounds and was as deathlike as silence itself the gate of the horse paddock through which heathcote must pass on his way home was nearly a mile distant but the road there was hard and they knew that they could hear from there the fall of his horses feet there they stood from seven to nearly eight whispering a word now and then to each other listening always but in vain looking away to the west every now and then they fancied that they could see the sky glow with flames and then they would tell each other that it was fancy the evening grew darker and still darker but no sound was heard through the moaning wind from time to time mrs growler came out to them declaring her fears in no measured terms well marm i do declare i think wed better go away out of this  go away mrs growler what nonsense where can we go to  the mill would be nearest maam and we should be safe there im sure mrs medlicot would take us in  why should you not be safe here said kate  that wretched chinese hasnt gone and left us for nothing miss and what would we three lone women do here if all them brownbies came down upon us why dont master come back he ought to come back oughtnt he maam he never do think what lone women are  mrs heathcote took her husbands part very strongly and gave mrs growler as hard a scolding as she knew how to pronounce but her own courage was giving way much as mrs growlers had done we are bound to stay here she said and if the worst comes we must bear it as others have done before us then mrs growler was very sulky and retreating to the kitchen sobbed there in solitude oh kate i do wish he would come said the elder sister  are you afraid  it is so desolate and he may be so far off and we couldnt get to him if any thing happened and we shouldnt know  then they were again silent and remained without exchanging more than a word or two for nearly half an hour they took hold of each other and every now and then went to the kitchen door that the old woman might be comforted by their presence but they had no consolation to offer each other the silence of the bush and the feeling of great distances and the dread of calamity almost crushed them at last there was a distant sound of horses feet i hear him said mrs heathcote rushing forward toward the outer gate of the horse paddock followed by her sister  her ears were true but she was doomed to disappointment the horseman was only a messenger from her husbandmickey odowd the irish boundary rider  he had great tidings to tell and was so long telling them that we will not attempt to give them in his own words the purport of his story was as follows harry had been to boolabong house but had found there no one but the old man returning home thence toward his own fence he had smelled the smoke of fire and had found within a furlong of his path a long ridge of burning grass according to mickeys account it could not have been lighted above a few minutes before heathcotes presence on the spot as it was it had got too much ahead for him to put it out singlehanded a few yards he might have managed butso mickey said probably exaggerating the matterthere was half a quarter of a mile of flame he had therefore ridden on before the fire had called his own two men to him and had at once lighted the grass himself some two hundred yards in front making a second fire but so keeping it down that it should be always under control before the hinder flames had caught him bender and jacko had been with him and they had thus managed to consume the fuel which had it remained there would have fed the fire which was too strong to be mastered by watching the extremities of the line of fire they overpowered it and so the damage was for the moment at an end  the method of dealing with the enemy was so well known in the bush and had been so often canvassed in the hearing of the two sisters that it was clearly intelligible to them the evil had been met in the proper way and the remedy had been effective but why did not harry come home  mickey odowd after his fashion explained that too the ladies were not to wait dinner the master felt himself obliged to remain out at night and had gotten food at the germans hut he mickey was commissioned to return with a flask full of brandy as it would be necessary that harry with all the men whom he could trust should be on the rampage all night this small body was to consist of harry himself of the german of jacko and according to the story as at present told especially of mickey odowd much as she would have wished to have kept the man at the station for protection she did not think of disobeying her husbands orders so mickey was fed and then sent back with the flaskwith tidings also as to the desertion of that wretched cook sing sing  i shall sit here all night said mrs heathcote to her sister as things are i shall not think of going to bed  kate declared that she would also sit in the veranda all night and as a matter of course they were joined by mrs growler they had been so seated about an hour when kate daly declared that the heavens were on fire the two young women jumped up flew to the gate and found that the whole western horizon was lurid with a dark red light     chapter ix  the bush fight   harry heathcote had on this occasion entertained no doubt whatever that the fire had been intentional and premeditated a lighted torch must have been dragged along the grass so as to ignite a line many yards long all at the same time he had been luckily near enough to the spot to see almost the commencement of the burning and was therefore aware of its form and circumstances he almost wondered that he had not seen the figure of the man who had drawn the torch or at any rate heard his steps pursuit would have been out of the question as his work was wanted at the moment to extinguish the flames the miscreant probably had remembered this and had known that he might escape stealthily without the noise of a rapid retreat  when the work was over when he had put out the fire he had himself lighted and had exterminated the lingering remnants of that which had been intended to destroy him he stood still a while almost in despair his condition seemed to be hopeless what could he do against such a band of enemies knowing as he did that had he been backed even by a score of trusty followers one foe might still suffice to ruin him at the present moment he was very hot with the work he had done as were also jacko and the german odowd had also come up as they were completing their work their mode of extinguishing the flames had been to beat them down with branches of gumtree loaded with leaves by sweeping these along the burning ground the low flames would be scattered and expelled but the work was very hard and hot the boughs they used were heavy and the air around them sultry enough from its own properties was made almost unbearable by the added heat of the fires  the work had been so far done but it might be begun again at any moment either near or at a distance no doubt the attempt would be made elsewhere along the boundary between gangoil and boolabongwas very probably being made at this moment the two men whom he could trust and jacko were now with him they were wiping their brows with their arms and panting with their work  he first resolved on sending mickey odowd to the house the distance was great and the mans assistance might be essential but he could not bear to leave his wife without news from him then after considering a while he made up his mind to go back toward his own fence making his way as he went southerly down toward the river they who were determined to injure him would he thought repeat their attempt in that direction he hardly said a word to his two followers but rode at a footpace to the spot at his fence which he had selected as the site of his bivouac for the night  it wont be very cheery bender he said to the german but we shall have to make a night of it till they disturb us again  the german made a motion with his arms intended to signify his utter indifference one place was the same as another to him jacko uttered his usual ejaculation and then having hitched his horse to the fence threw himself on his back upon the grass  no doubt they all slept but they slept as watchers sleep with one eye open it was harry who first saw the light which a few minutes later made itself visible to the ladies at the home station karl he exclaimed jumping up theyre at it againlook there  in less than half a minute and without speaking another word they were all on their horses and riding in the direction of the light it came from a part of the boolabong run somewhat nearer to the river than the place at which they had stationed themselves where the strip of ground between harrys fence and the acknowledged boundary of brownbies run was the narrowest as they approached the fire they became aware that it had been lighted on boolabong on this occasion harry did not ride on up to the flames knowing that the use or loss of a few minutes might save or destroy his property he hardly spoke a word as he proceeded on his business feeling that they upon whom he had to depend were sufficiently instructed if only they would be sufficiently energetic  keep it well under but let it run was all he said as lighting a dried bush with a match he ran the fire along the ground in front of the coming flames  a stranger seeing it all would have felt sure that the remedy would have been as bad as the disease for the fire which harry himself made every now and again seemed to get the better of those who were endeavoring to control it there might perhaps be a quarter of a mile between the front of the advancing fire and the line at which harry had commenced to destroy the food which would have fed the coming flames he himself as quickly as he lighted the grass which in itself was the work but of a moment would strain himself to the utmost at the much harder task of controlling his own fire so that it should not run away from him and get as it were out of his hands and be as bad to him as that which he was thus seeking to circumvent the german and jacko worked like heroes probably with intense enjoyment of the excitement and after a while found a fourth figure among the flames for mickey had now returned  you saw them harry said panting with his work  theys all right said mickey flopping away with a great bough but that tarnation chinese has gone off  my word sing sing find him at boolabong said jacko  the german whose gumtree bough was a very big one and whose every thought was intent on letting the fire run while he still held it in hand had not breath for a syllable  but the back fire was extending itself so as to get round them every now and then harry extended his own line moving always forward toward gangoil as he did so though he and his men were always on brownbies territory he had no doubt but that where he could succeed in destroying the grass for a breadth of forty or fifty yards he would starve out the inimical flames the trees and bushes without the herbage would not enable it to travel a yard wherever the grass was burned down black to the soil the fire would stop but should they who were at work once allow themselves to be outflanked their exertions would be all in vain and then those wretches might light a dozen fires the work was so hard so hot and often so hopeless that the unhappy young squatter was more than once tempted to bid his men desist and to return to his homestead the flames would not follow him there he could at any rate make that safe and then when he had repudiated this feeling as unworthy of him he began to consider within himself whether he would not do better for his property by taking his men with him on to his run and endeavoring to drive his sheep out of danger but as he thought of all this he still worked still fired the grass and still controlled the flames presently he became aware of what seemed to him at first to be a third fire through the trees in the direction of the river he could see the glimmering of low flames and the figures of men but it was soon apparent to him that these men were working in his cause and that they too were burning the grass that would have fed the advancing flames at first he could not spare the minute which would be necessary to find out who was his friend but as they drew nearer he knew the man it was the sugar planter from the mill and with him his foreman  weve been doing our best said medlicot but weve been terribly afraid that the fire would slip away from us  its the only thing said harry too much excited at the moment to ask questions as to the cause of medlicots presence so far from his home at that time of the evening its getting round us im afraid all the same  i dont know but it is its almost impossible to distinguish how hot the fire makes it  hot indeed said harry its killing work for men and then all for no good to think that men creatures that call themselves men should do such a thing as this it breaks ones heart he had paused as he spoke leaning on the great battered bough which he held but in an instant was at work with it again do you stay here mr medlicot with the men and ill go on beyond where you began if i find the fire growing down ill shout and they can come to me so saying he rushed on with a lighted bush torch in his band  suddenly he found himself confronted in the bush by a man on horseback whom he at once recognized as georgie brownbie he forgot for a moment where he was and began to question the reprobate as to his presence at that spot  thats like your impudence said georgie youre not only trespassing but youre destroying our property willfully and you ask me what business i have here youre a nice sort of young man  harry checked for a moment by the remembrance that he was in truth upon boolabong run did not at once answer  put that bush down and dont burn our grass continued georgie or you shall have to answer for it what right have you to fire our grass  who fired it first  it lighted itself thats no rule why you should light it more you give over or i punch your head for you  harrys men and medlicot were advancing toward him trampling out their own embers as they came and georgie brownbie who was alone when he saw that there were four or five men against him turned round and rode back  did you ever see impudence like that said harry hes probably the very man who set the match and yet he comes and brazens it out with me  i dont think hes the man who set the match said medlicot quietly at any rate there was another  who was it  my man nokes i saw him with the torch in his hand  heaven and earth  yes mr heathcote i saw him put it down you were about right you see and i was about wrong  harry had not a word to say unless it were tell the man that he loved him for the frankness of his confession but the moment was hardly auspicious for such a declaration there was no excuse for them to pause in their work for the fire was still crackling at their back and they did no more than pause  ah said harry there it goes we shall be done at last for he saw that he was being outflanked by the advancing flames but still they worked drawing lines of fire here and there and still they hoped that there might be ground for hope nokes had been seen but pregnant as the theme might be with words it was almost impossible to talk questions could not be asked and answered without stopping in their toil there were questions which harry longed to ask could medlicot swear to the man did the man know that he had been seen if he knew that he had been watched while he lit the grass he would soon be far away from medlicots mill and gangoil harry felt that it would be a consolation to him in his trouble if he could get hold of this man and keep him and prosecute himand have him hung even in the tumult of the moment he was able to reflect about it and to think that he remembered that the crime of arson was capital in the colony of queensland he had endeavored to be good to the men with whom he had dealings he had not stinted their food or cut them short in their wages or been hard in exacting work from them and this was his return ideas as to the excellence of absolute dominion and power flitted across his brainsuch power as abraham no doubt exercised in abrahams time the people were submissive and the world was happy harry heathcote at least had never heard that it was not happy but as he thought of all this he worked away with his bush and his matches extinguishing the flames here and lighting them there striving to make a cordon of black bare ground between boolabong and gangoil surely abraham had never been called on to work like this  he and his men were in a line covering something above a quarter of a mile of ground of which line he was himself the nearest to the river and medlicot and his foreman the farthest from it the german and odowd were in the middle and jacko was working with his master if harry had just cause for anger and sorrow in regard to nokes and boscobel he certainly had equal cause to be proud of the stanchness of his remaining satellites the men worked with a will as though the whole run had been the personal property of each of them nokes and boscobel would probably have done the same had the fires come before they had quarreled with their master it is a small and narrow point that turns the rushing train to the right or to the left the rushing man is often turned off by a point as small and narrow  my word said jacko on a sudden here they are all o horseback and as he spoke there was the sound of half a dozen horsemen galloping up to them through the bush why theres bos his own self said jacko  the two leading men were joe and jerry brownbie who for this night only had composed their quarrels and close to them was boscobel there were others behind also mountedjack brownbie and georgie and nokes himself but they though their figures were seen could not be distinguished in the gloom of the night nor indeed did harry at first discern of how many the party consisted it seemed that there was a whole troop of horsemen whose purpose it was to interrupt him in his work so that the flames should certainly go ahead and it was evident that the men thought that they could do so without subjecting themselves to legal penalties as far as harry heathcote could see they were correct in their view he could have no right to burn the grass on boolabong he had no claim even to be there it was true that he could plead that he was stopping the fire which they had purposely made but they could prove his handiwork whereas it would be almost impossible that he should prove theirs  the whole forest was not red but lurid with the fires and the air was laden with both the smell and the heat of the conflagration the horsemen were dressed as was harry himself in trowsers and shirts with old slouch hats and each of them had a cudgel in his hand as they came galloping up through the trees they were as uncanny and unwelcome a set of visitors as any man was ever called on to receive harry necessarily stayed his work and stood still to bear the brunt of the coming attack but jacko went on with his employment faster than ever as though a troop of men in the dark were nothing to him  jerry brownbie was the first to speak whats this youre up to heathcote firing our grass its arson you shall swing for this  ill take my chance of that said harry turning to his work again  no im blessed if you do ride over him bos while i stop these other fellows  the brownbies had been aware that harrys two boundary riders were with him but had not heard of the arrival of medlicot and the other man nokes was aware that some one on horseback had been near him when he was firing the grass but had thought that it was one of the party from gangoil by the time that jerry brownbie had reached the german medlicot was there also  who the deuce are you asked jerry  what business is that of yours said medlicot  no business of mine and you firing our grass ill let you know my business pretty quickly  its that fellow medlicot from the sugarmill said joe the man that nokes is with  i thought you was a horse of another color continued jerry who had been given to understand that medlicot was heathcotes enemy anyway i wont have my grass fired if god amighty chooses to send fires we cant help it but im not going to have incendiaries here as well youre a new chum and dont understand what youre about but you must stop this  as medlicot still went on putting out the fire jerry attempted to ride him down medlicot caught the horse by the rein and violently backed the brute in among the embers the animal plunged and reared getting his head loose and at last came down he and his rider together in the mean time joe brownbie seeing this rode up behind the sugar planter and struck him violently with his cudgel over the shoulder medlicot sank nearly to the ground but at once recovered himself he knew that some bone on the left side of his body was broken but he could still fight with his right hand and he did fight  boscobel and georgie brownbie both attempted to ride over harry together and might have succeeded had not jacko ingeniously inserted the burning branch of gumtree with which he had been working under the belly of the horse on which boscobel was riding the animal jumped immediately from the ground bucking into the air and boscobel was thrown far over his head georgie brownbie then turned upon jacko but jacko was far too nimble to be caught and escaped among the trees  for a few minutes the fight was general but the footmen had the best of it in spite of the injury done to medlicot jerry was bruised and burned about the face by his fall among the ashes and did not much relish the work afterward boscobel was stunned for a few moments and was quite ready to retreat when he came to himself nokes during the whole time did not show himself alleging as a reason afterward the presence of his employer medlicot  im blessed if your cowardice shant hang you said joe brownbie to him on their way home do you think were going to fight the battles of a fellow like you who hasnt pluck to come forward himself  ive as much pluck as you answered nokes and am ready to fight you any day but i know when a man is to come forward and when hes not hang me im not so near hanging as some folks at boolabong we may imagine therefore that the night was not spent pleasantly among the brownbies after these adventures  there were of course very much cursing and swearing and very many threats before the party from boolabong did retreat their great point was of coarse thisthat heathcote was willfully firing the grass and was therefore no better than an incendiary of course they stoutly denied that the original fire had been intentional and denied as stoutly that the original fire could be stopped by fires but at last they went leaving heathcote and his party masters of the battlefield jerry was taken away in a sad condition and in subsequent accounts of the transaction given from boolabong his fall was put forward as the reason of their flight he having been the general on the occasion and boscobel had certainly lost all stomach for immediate fighting immediately behind the battlefield they come across nokes and sing sing the runaway cook from gangoil the poor chinaman had made the mistake of joining the party which was not successful  but harry though the victory was with him was hardly in a mood for triumph he soon found that medlicots collarbone was broken and it would be necessary therefore that he should return with the wounded man to the station and the flames as he feared had altogether got ahead of him during the fight as far as they had gone they had stopped the fire having made a black wilderness a mile and a half in length which during the whole distance ceased suddenly at the line at which the subsidiary fire had been extinguished but while the attack was being made upon them the flames had crept on to the southward and had now got beyond their reach it had seemed however that the mass of fire which had got away from them was small and already the damp of the night was on the grass and harry felt himself justified in hoping not that there might be no loss but that the loss might not be ruinous  medlicot consented to be taken back to gangoil instead of to the mill perhaps he thought that kate daly might be a better nurse than his mother or that the quiet of the sheep station might be better for him than the clatter of his own millwheels it was midnight and they had a ride of fourteen miles which was hard enough upon a man with a broken collarbone the whole party also was thoroughly fatigued the work they had been doing was about as hard as could fall to a mans lot and they had now been many hours without food before they started mickey produced his flask the contents of which were divided equally among them all including jacko  as they were preparing to start home medlicot explained that it had struck him by degrees that heathcote might be right in regard to nokes and that he had determined to watch the man himself whenever he should leave the mill on that monday he had given up work somewhat earlier than usual saying that as the following day was christmas he should not come to the mill from that time medlicot and his foreman had watched him  yes said he in answer to a question from heathcote i can swear that i saw him with the lighted torch in his hand and that he placed it among the grass there were two others from boolabong with him and they must have seen him too     chapter x  harry heathcote returns in triumph   when the fight was quite over and heathcotes party had returned to their horses medlicot for a few minutes was faint and sick but he revived after a while and declared himself able to sit on his horse there was a difficulty in getting him up but when there he made no further complaint this said he as he settled himself in his saddle is my first christmasday in australia i landed early in january and last year i was on my way home to fetch my mother  its not much like an english christmas said harry  nor yet as in hanover said the german  its cork you should go to or galway bedad if you want to see christmas kep after the ould fashion said mickey  i think we used to do it pretty well in cumberland said medlicot there are things which cant be transplanted they may have roast beef and all that but you should have cold weather to make you feel that it is christmas indeed  we do it as well as we can harry pleaded ive seen a great pudding come into the room all afirejust to remind one of the old countrywhen it has been so hot that one could hardly bear a shirt on ones shoulders but yet theres something in it one likes to think of the old place though one is so far away how do you feel now does the jolting hurt you much if your horse is rough change with me this fellow goes as smooth as a lady medlicot declared that the pain did not trouble him much theyd have ridden over us only for you continued harry  my word wouldnt they said jacko who was very proud of his own part in the battle i say mr medlicot did you see bos and his horse part company you did mr harry didnt he fly like a bird all in among the bushes i owed bos one i did my word and now ive paid him  i saw it said harry he was riding at me as hard as he could come i cant understand boscobel nokes is a sly bad slinking follow whom i never liked but i was always good to bos and when he cheated me as he did about his time i never even threatened to stop his money  you told him of it too plain said the german  i did tell himof courseas i should you it has come to that now that if a man robs youyour own manyou are not to dare to tell him of it what would you think of me karl if i were to find you out and was to be afraid of speaking to you lest you should turn against me and burn my fences karl bender shrugged his shoulders holding his reins up to his eyes i know what you ought to think and i wish that every man about gangoil should be sure that i will always say what i think right i dont know that i ever was hard upon any man i try not to be  thrue for you mr harry said the irishman  im not going to pick my words because men like nokes and boscobel have the power of injuring me im not going to truckle to rascals because im afraid of them id sooner be burned out of house and home and go and work on the wharves in brisbane than that  my word yes said jacko and i too  if the devil is to get ahead he must but i wont hold a candle to him you fellows may tell every man about the place what i say as long as im master of gangoil ill be master and when i come across a swindle ill tell the man who does it hes a swindler i told bos to his face but i didnt tell any body else and i shouldnt if hed taken it right and mended his ways  they all understood him very wellthe german the irishman medlicots foreman medlicot himself and even jacko and though no doubt there was a feeling within the hearts of the men that harry heathcote was imperious still they respected him and they believed him  the masther should be the masther no doubt said the irishman  a man that is a man vill not sell hisself body and soul said the german slowly  do i want dominion over your soul karl bender asked the squatter with energy you know i dont nor over your body except so far as it suits you to sell your services what you sell you part with readilylike a man and its not likely that you and i shall quarrel but all this row about nothing cant be very pleasant to a man with a broken shoulder  i like to hear you said medlicot im always a good listener when men have something really to say  well then ive something to say cried harry there never was a man came to my house whom id sooner see as a christmas guest than yourself  thankee sir  its more than i could have said yesterday with truth  its more than you did say  yes by george but youve beat me now when youre hard pressed for hands down yonder you send for me and see if i wont turn the mill for you or hoe canes either  so ll i my word yes just for my rations  they had by this time reacted the gangoil fence having taken the directest route for the house but harry in doing this had not been unmindful of the fire had medlicot not been wounded he would have taken the party somewhat out of the way down southward following the flames but medlicots condition had made him feel that he would not be justified in doing so now however it occurred to him that he might as well ride a mile or two down the fence and see what injury had been done the escort of the men would be sufficient to take medlicot to the station and he would reach the place as soon as they if the flames were still running ahead he knew that he could not now stop then but he could at least learn how the matter stood with him if the worst came to the worst he would not now lose more than three or four miles of fencing and the grass off a corner of his run nevertheless tired as he was he could not bear the idea of going home without knowing the whole story so he made his proposal medlicot of course made no objection each of the men offered to go with him but he declined their services there is nothing to do said he and nobody to catch and if the fire is burning it must burn so he went alone  the words that he had uttered among his men had not been lightly spoken he had begun to perceive that life would be very hard to him in his present position or perhaps altogether impossible as long as he was at enmity with all those around him old squatters whom he knew respectable men who had been in the colony before he was born had advised him to be on good terms with the brownbies you neednt ask them to your house or go to them but just softsawder them when yon meet an old gentleman had said to him he certainly hadnt taken the old gentlemans advice thinking that to softsawder so great a reprobate as jerry brownbie would be holding a candle to the devil but his own plan had hardly answered well he was sure at any rate of thisthat he could do no good now by endeavoring to be civil to the brownbies he soon came to the place where the fire had reached his fence and found that it had burned its way through and that the flames were still continuing their onward course the fence to the north or rather to the northwestwardthe point whence the wind was comingstood firm at the spot at which the fire had struck it dry as the wood was the flames had not traveled upward against the wind but to the south the fire was traveling down the fence to stop this he rode half a mile along the burning barrier till he had headed the flames and then he pulled the bushes down and rolled away the logs so as to stop the destruction as regarded his fence there was less than a mile of it destroyed and that he could now leave in security as the wind was blowing away from it as for his grass that must now take its chance he could see the dark light of the low running fire but there was no longer a mighty blaze and he knew that the dew of the night was acting as his protector the harm that had been as yet done was trifling if only he could protect himself from further harm after leaving the fire he had still a ride of seven or eight miles through the gloom of the forestall alone not only was he weary but his horse was so tired that he could hardly get him to canter for a furlong he regretted that he had not brought the boy with him knowing well the service of companionship to a tired beast he was used to such troubles and could always tell himself that his back was broad enough to bear them but his desolation among enemies oppressed him medlicot however was no longer an enemy then there came across his mind for the first time an idea that medlicot might marry his sisterinlaw and become his fast friend if he could have but one true friend he thought that he could bear the enmity of all the brownbies hitherto he had been entirely alone in his anxiety it was between three and four when he reached gangoil and he found that the party of horsemen had just entered the yard before him the sugar planter was so weak that he could hardly get off his horse  the two ladies were still watching when the cavalcade arrived though it was then between three and four in the morning it was harrys custom on such occasions to ride up to the little gate close to the veranda and there to hang his bridle till some one should take his horse away but on this occasion he and the others rode into the yard seeing this mrs heathcote and her sister went through the house and soon learned how things were mr medlicot from the mill had come with a bone broken and it was their duty to nurse him till a doctor could be procured from maryborough now maryborough was thirty miles distant some one must be dispatched at once jacko volunteered but in such a service jacko was hardly to be trusted he might fall asleep on his horse and continue his slumbers on the ground mickey and the german both offered but the men were so beaten by their work that heathcote did not dare to take their offer  ill tell you what it is mary he said to his wife there is nothing for it but for me to go for jackson jackson was the doctor and i can see the police at the same time  you shant go harry yon are so tired already you can hardly stand this moment  get me some strong coffeeat once you dont know what that man has done for us ill tell you all another time i owe him more than a ride into maryborough ill make the men get yorkie upyorkie was a favorite horse he hadwhile you make the coffee and ill lead colonelcolonel was another horse well esteemed at gangoil jackson will come quicker on him than on any animal he can get at maryborough and so it was arranged in spite of the wifes tears and entreaties harry had his coffee and some food and started with his two horses for the doctor  nature is so good to us that we are sometimes disposed to think we might have dispensed with art in the bush where doctors can not be had bones will set themselves and when doctors do come but come slowly the broken bones suit themselves to such tardiness medlicot was brought in and put to bed let the reader not be shocked to hear that kate dalys room was given up to him as being best suited for a sick mans comfort and the two ladies took it in turn to watch him mrs heathcote was of course the first and remained with him till dawn then kate crept to the door and asked whether she should relieve her sister medlicot was asleep and it was agreed that kate should remain in the veranda and look in from time to time to see whether the wounded man required aught at her hands she looked in very often and then at last he was awake  miss daly he said i feel so ashamed of the trouble im giving  dont speak of it it is nothing in the bush every body of course does any thing for every body when the words were spoken she felt that they were not as complimentary as she would have wished you were to have come today you know but we did not think youd come like this did we  i dont know why i didnt go home instead of coming here  the doctor will reach gangoil sooner than he could the mill you are better here and we will send for mrs medlicot as soon as the men have had a rest how was it all mr medlicot harry says that there was a fight and that you came in just at the nick of time and that but for you all the run would have been burned  not that at all  he said so only he went off so quickly and was so busy with things that we hardly understood him is it not dreadful that there should be such fighting and then these horrid fires you were in the middle of the fire were you not it suited kates feelings that medlicot should be the hero of this occasion  we were lighting them in front to put them out behind  and then while you were at work these men from boolabong came upon you oh mr medlicot we shall be so very very wretched if you are much hurt my sister is so unhappy about it  its only my collarbone miss daly  but that is so dreadful she was still thinking of the one word he had spoken when he hadwell not asked her for her love but said that which between a young man and a young woman ought to mean the same thing perhaps it had meant nothing she had heard that young men do say things which mean nothing but to her living in the solitude of gangoil the one word had been so much her heart had melted with absolute acknowledged love when the man had been brought through into the house with all the added attraction of a broken bone while her sister had watched she had retiredto rest as mary had said but in truth to think of the chance which had brought her in this guise into familiar contact with the man she loved and then when she had crept up to take her place in watching him she had almost felt that shame should restrain her but was her duty and of course a man with a collarbone broken would not speak of love  it will make your christmas so sad for you he said  oh as for that we mind nothing about itfor ourselves we are never very gay here  but you are happy  oh yes quite happy except when harry is disturbed by these troubles i dont think any body has so many troubles as a squatter it sometimes seems that all the world is against him  we shall be allies now at any rate  oh i do so hope we shall said kate putting her hands together in her energy and then retreating from her energy with sad awkwardness when she remembered the personal application of her wish that is i mean you and harry she added in a whisper  why not i and others besides harry  it is so much to him to have a real friend things concern us of course only just as they concern him women are never of very much account i think harry has to do every thing and every thing ought to be done for him  i think you spoil harry among you  dont you say so to mary or she will be fierce  i wonder whether i shall ever have a wife to stand up for me in that way  kate had no answer to make but she thought that it would be his own fault if he did not have a wife to stand up for him thoroughly  he has been very lucky in his wife  i think he has mr medlicot but you are moving about and you ought to lie still there i hear the horses thats the doctor i do so hope he wont say that any thing very bad is the matter  she jumped up from her chair which was close to his bed and as she did so just touched his hand with hers it was involuntary on her part having come of instinct rather than will and she withdrew herself instantly the hand she had touched belonged to the arm that was not hurt and he put it out after her and caught her by the sleeve as she was retreating oh mr medlicot you must not do that you will hurt yourself if you move in that way  and so she escaped and left the room and did not see him again till the doctor had gone from gangoil  the bone had been broken simply as other bones are broken it was now set and the sufferer was of course told that he must rest he had suggested that he should be taken home and the heathcotes had concurred with the doctor in asserting that no proposition could be more absurd he had intended to eat his christmas dinner at gangoil and he must now pass his entire christmas there  the sugar can go on very well for ten days harry had said ill go over myself and see about the men and ill fetch your mother over  to this however mrs heathcote had demurred successfully youll kill yourself harry if you go on like this she said  bender therefore was sent in the buggy for the old lady and at last harry heathcote consented to go to bed  my belief is i shall sleep for a week he said as he turned in but he didnt begin his sleep quite at once i am very glad i went into maryborough he said to his wife rising up from his pillow ive sworn an information against nokes and two of the brownbies and the police will be after them this afternoon they wont catch nokes and they cant convict the other fellows but it will be something to clear the country of such a fellow and something also to let them know that detection is possible  do sleep now dear she said  yes i will i mean to but look here mary if any of the police should come here mind you wake me at once and mary look here do you know i shouldnt be a bit surprised if that fellow was to be making up to kate  mrs heathcote with some little inward chuckle at her husbands assumed quickness of apprehension reminded herself that the same idea had occurred to her some time ago mrs heathcote gave her husband full credit for more than ordinary intelligence in reference to affairs appertaining to the breeding of sheep and the growing of wool but she did not think highly of his discernment in such an affair as this she herself had been much quicker when she first saw mr medlicot she had felt it a godsend that such a man with the look of a gentleman and unmarried should come into the neighborhood and in so feeling her heart had been entirely with her sister for herself it mattered nothing who came or did not come or whether a man were a bachelor or possessed of a wife and a dozen children all that a girl had a right to want was a good husband she was quite satisfied with her own lot in that respect but she was anxious enough on behalf of kate and when a young man did come who might make matters so pleasant for them harry quarreled with him because he was a freeselector a free fiddlestick she had once said to katenot however communicating to her innocent sister the ambition which was already filling her own bosom harry does take things up soas though people werent to live some in one way and some in another as far as i can see mr medlicot is a very nice fellow kate had remarked that he was all very well and nothing more had been said  but mrs heathcote in spite of harrys aversion had formed her little projecta project which if then declared would have filled harry with dismay and now the young aristocrat as he turned himself in his bed made the suggestion to his wife as though it were all his own  i never like to think much of these things beforehand she said innocently  i dont know about thinking said harry but a girl might do worse if it should come up dont set yourself against it  kate of course will please herself said mrs heathcote now do lie down and rest yourself  his rest however was not of long duration as he had himself suggested two policemen reached gangoil at about three in the afternoon on their way from maryborough to boolabong in order that they might take mr medlicots deposition after heathcotes departure it had occurred to sergeant forrest of the policeand the suggestion having been transferred from the sergeant to the stipendiary magistrate was now produced with magisterial sanctionthat after all there was no evidence against the brownbies they had simply interfered to prevent the burning of the grass on their own run and who could say that they had committed any crime by doing so if medlicot had seen nokes with a lighted branch in his hand the matter might be different with him and therefore medlicots deposition was taken he had sworn that he had seen nokes drag his lighted torch along the ground he had also seen other horsementwo or three as he thoughtbut could not identify them jackos deposition was also taken as to the man who had been heard and seen in the woolshed at night jacko was ready to swear pointblank that the man was nokes the policemen suggested that as the night was dark jacko might as well allow a shade of doubt to appear thinking that the shade of doubt would add strength to the evidence but jacko was not going to be taught what sort of oath he should swear  my word he said didnt i see his leg move you go away  armed with these depositions the two constables went on to boolabong in search of nokes and of nokes only much to the chagrin of harry who declared that the police would never really bestir themselves in a squatters cause as for nokes hell be out of queensland by this time tomorrow     chapter xi  sergeant forrest   the brownbie party returned after their midnight raid in great discomfiture to boolabong their leader jerry was burned about his hands and face in a disagreeable and unsightly manner joe had hardly made good that character for fighting it out to the end for which he was apt to claim credit boscobel was altogether disconcerted by his fall and nokes who had certainly shown no aptitude for the fray was abused by them all as having caused their retreat by his cowardice while sing sing the runaway cook who knew that he had forfeited his wages at gangoil was forced to turn over in his heathenish mind the ill effects of joining the losing side you big fool bos he said more than once to his friend the woodsman who had lured him away from the comforts of gangoil ill punch your head john if you dont hold your row boscobel would reply but sing sing went on with his reproaches and before they had reached boolabong boscobel had punched the chinamans head  youre not coming in here jerry said to nokes when they reached the yard gate  who wants to come in i suppose youre not going to send a fellow on without a bit of grub after such a nights work  give him some bread and meat jack and let him go on therell be somebody here after him before long he cant hurt us but i dont want people to think that we are so fond of him that we cant do without harboring him here georgie youll go too if you take my advice that young cur will send the police here as sure as my name is brownbie and if they once get hold of you theyll have a great many things to talk to you about  georgie grumbled when he heard this but he knew that the advice given him was good and he did not attempt to enter the house so nokes and he vanished away into the bush togetheras such men do vanishwandering forth to live as the wild beasts live it was still a dark night when they went and the remainder of the party took themselves to their beds  on the following afternoon they were lying about the house sometimes sleeping and sometimes waking up to smoke when the two policemen who had already been at gangoil appeared in the yard these men were dressed in flat caps with short blue jackets hunting breeches and long black bootsvery unlike any policemen in the old country and much more picturesque they leisurely tied their horses up as though they had been in the habit of making weekly visits to the place and walked round to the veranda  well mr brownbie and how are you said the sergeant to the old man  the head of the family was gracious and declared himself to be pretty well considering all things he called the sergeant by his name and asked the men whether theyd take a bit of something to eat joe also was courteous and after a little delay in getting a key from his brother brought out the jar of spirits which in the bush is regarded as the best sign known of thorough goodbreeding the sergeant said that he didnt mind if he did and the other man of course followed his officers example  so far every thing was comfortable and the constables seemed in no hurry to allude to disagreeable subjects they condescended to eat a bit of cold meat before they proceeded to business and at last the matter to be discussed was first introduced by one of the brownbie family  i suppose youve heard that there was a scrimmage here last night said joe the brownbie party present consisted of the old man joe and jack brownbie and boscobel jerry keeping himself in the background because of his disfigurement the sergeant as he swallowed his food acknowledged that he had heard something about it and thats what brings you here continued joe  there aint nothing wrong here said old brownbie  i hope not mr brownbie said the sergeant i hope not we havent got any thing against you at any rate sergeant forrest was a graduate of oxford the son of an english clergyman who having his way to make in the world had thought that an early fortune would be found in the colonies he had come out had failed had suffered some very hard things and now at the age of thirtyfive enjoyed life thoroughly as a sergeant of the colonial police  you havent got any thing against anybody here i should think said joe  if you want to get them as begun it said jack and them as ought to be took up youll go to gangoil  hold your tongue jack said his brother sergeant forrest knows where to go better than you can tell him  then the sergeant asked a string of questions as to the nature of the fight who had been hurt and how badly had any body been hurt and what other harm had been done the answers to all these questions were given with a fair amount of truth except that the little circumstance of the origin of the fire was not explained both boscobel and joe had seen the torch put down but it could hardly have been expected that they should have been explicit as to such a detail as that nor did they mention the names of either their brother george or nokes  and who was there in the matter asked the sergeant  there was young heathcote and a boy he has got there and the two chaps as he calls boundary rulers and medlicot the sugar fellow from the mill and a chap of medlicots i never set eyes on before they must have expected something to be up or heathcote would not have been going about at night with a tribe of men like that  and who were your party  well there were just ourselves four of us for georgie was here and this fellow boscobel georgie never stays long and he wouldnt be welcome if he did he turned up just by chance like and now hes off again  that was all eh  of course they all knew that the sergeant knew that nokes had been with them well then that wasnt all said old brownbie bill nokes was here whom heathcote dismissed ever so long ago and that chinese cook of his he dismissed him too i suppose and he dismissed boscobel here  no one can live at gangoil any time said jack every body knows that he wants to be lord amighty over every thing but he aint going to be lord amighty at boolabong  and he aint going to burn our grass either said joe its like his impudence coming on to our ran and burning every thing before him he calls hisself a magistrate but hes not to do just as he pleases because hes a magistrate i suppose we can swear against him for lighting our grass sergeant there isnt one of us that didnt see him do it  and where is nokes asked the sergeant paying no attention to the application made by mr brownbie junior for redress to himself  well said joe nokes isnt any where about boolabong  hes away with your brother george  i shouldnt wonder said joe  its a serious matter lighting a fire you know said the sergeant a man would have to swing for it  then why isnt young heathcote to swing demanded jack  there is such a thing as intent you know when heathcote lighted the fire where would the fire have gone if he hadnt kept putting it out as fast as he kept lighting it on to his own run not to yours and where would the other fire have gone which somebody lit and which nobody put out if he hadnt been there to stop it the less you say against heathcote the better so nokes is off is he  he aint here anyways said joe when the row was over we wouldnt let him in we didnt want him about here  i dare say not said the sergeant now let me go and see the spot where the fight was so the two policemen with the two young brownbies rode away leaving boscobel with the old man  he knows every thing about it said old brownbie  if he do said boscobel it aint no odds  not a haporth of odds said jerry coming out of his hidingplace who cares what he knows a man may do what he pleases on his own run i suppose  he maynt light a fire as ll spread said the old man  bother whos to prove whats in a mans mind if id been nokes id have staid and seen it out id never be driven about the colony by such a fellow as heathcote with all the police in the world to back him  sergeant forrest inspected the ground on which the fire had raged and the spot on which the men had met but nothing came of his inspection and he had not expected that any thing would come of it he could see exactly where the fire had commenced and could trace the efforts that had been made to stop it he did not in the least doubt the way in which it had been lit but he did very much doubt whether a jury could find nokes guilty even if he could catch nokes jackos evidence was worth nothing and mr medlicot might be easily mistaken as to what he had seen at a distance in the middle of the night  all this happened on christmasday at about nine oclock the same evening the two constables reappeared at gangoil and asked for hospitality for the night this was a matter of course and also the reproduction of the christmas dinner mrs medlicot was now there and her son with his collarbone set had been allowed to come out on to the veranda the house had already been supposed to be full but room as a matter of course was made for sergeant forrest and his man its a queer sort of christmas weve all been having mr heathcote said the sergeant as the remnant of a real english plumpudding was put between him and his man by mrs growler  a little hotter than it is at home eh  indeed it is you must have had it hot last night sir  very hot sergeant we had to work uncommonly hard to do it as well as we did  it was not a nice christmas game sir was it  eh me said mrs medlicot theres nae christmas games or ony games here at all except just worrying and harrying like sae many dogs at each others throats  and you think nothing more can be done harry asked  i dont think we shall catch the men when they get out backward its very hard to trace them hes got a horse of his own with him and hell be beyond reach of the police by this time tomorrow indeed hes beyond their reach now however youll have got rid of him  but there are others as bad as he left behind i wouldnt trust that fellow boscobel a yard  he wont stir sir he belongs to this country and does not want to leave it and when a thing has been tried like that and has failed the fellows dont try it again they are cowed like by their own failure i dont think you need fear fire from the boolabong side again this summer  after this the sergeant and his man discreetly allowed themselves to be put to bed in the back cottage for in truth when they arrived things had come to such a pass at gangoil that the two additional visitors were hardly welcome but hospitality in the bush can be stayed by no such considerations as that let their employments or enjoyments on hand be what they may every thing must yield to the entertainment of strangers the two constables were in want of their christmas dinner and it was given to them with no grudging hand  as to nokes we may say that he has never since appeared in the neighborhood of gangoil and that none thereabouts ever knew what was his fate men such as he wander away from one colony into the next passing from one station to another or sleeping on the ground till they become as desolate and savage as solitary animals and at last they die in the bush creeping we may suppose into hidden nooks as the beasts do when the hour of death comes on them     chapter xii  conclusion   the constables had started from gangoil on their way to boolabong a little after four and from that time till he was made to get out of bed for his dinner harry heathcote was allowed to sleep he had richly earned his rest by his work and he lay motionless without a sound in the broad daylight with his arm under his head dreaming no doubt of some happy squatting land in which there were no freeselectors no fires no rebellious servants no floods no droughts no wild dogs to worry the lambs no grass seeds to get into the fleeces and in which the price of wool stood steady at two shillings and sixpence a pound his wife from time to time came into the room shading the light from his eyes protecting him from the flies and administering in her soft way to what she thought might be his comforts his sleep was of the kind which no light nor even flies can interrupt once or twice she stooped down and kissed his brow but he was altogether unconscious of her caress  during this time old mrs medlicot arrived but her coming did not awake the sleeper though it was by no means made in silence the old woman sobbed and cried over her son at the same time expressing her thankfulness that he should have turned up in the forest so exactly at the proper moment evidently taking part in the conviction that her giles had saved gangoil and all its sheep and then there were all the necessary arrangements to be made for the night in accordance with which almost every body had to give up his or her bed and sleep somewhere else but nothing disturbed harry for the present he was allowed to occupy his own room and he enjoyed the privilege  kate daly during this time was much disturbed in mind the reader may rememberkate at any rate remembered wellthat just as the doctor had arrived to set his broken bone mr medlicot disabled as he was had attempted to take her by the arm he had certainly chosen an odd time for a declaration of love just the moment in which he ought to have been preparing himself for the manipulation of his fractured limb but unless he had meant a declaration of love surely he would not have seized her by the arm it was a matter to her of great moment oh of what vital importance the english girl living in a town or even in what we call the country has no need to think of any special man till some special man thinks of her men are fairly plentiful and if one man does not come another will and there have probably been men coming and going in some sort since the girl left her schoolroom and became a young lady but in the bush the thing is very different it may be that there is no young man available within fifty milesno possible lover or future husband unless heaven should interfere almost with a miracle to those to whom lovers are as plentiful as blackberries it may seem indelicate to surmise that the thought of such a want should ever enter a girls head i doubt whether the defined idea of any want had ever entered poor kates head but now that the possible lover was therenot only possible but very probableand so eligible in many respects living so close with a house over his head and a good business and then so handsome and as kate thought so complete a gentleman of course she turned it much in her mind she was very happy with harry heathcote there never was a brotherinlaw so good but after all what is a brotherinlaw though he be the very best kate had already begun to fancy that a house of her own and a husband of her own would be essential to her happiness but then a man can not be expected to make an offer with a broken collarbonecertainly can not do so just when the doctor has arrived to set the bone  late on in the day when the doctor had gone and medlicot was according to instructions sitting out on the veranda in an armchair and his mother was with him and while harry was sleeping as though he never meant to be awake again kate managed to say a few words to her sister it will be understood that the ladies hands were by no means empty the christmas dinner was in course of preparation and sing sing that villainous chinese cook had absconded mrs growler no doubt did her best but mrs growler was old and slow and the house was full of guests it was by no means an idle time but still kate found an opportunity to say a word to her sister in the kitchen  what do you think of him mary  to the married sister him would naturally mean harry heathcote of whom as he lay asleep the young wife thought that he was the very perfection of patriarchal pastoral manliness but she knew enough of human nature to be aware that the him of the moment to her sister was no longer her own husband i think he has got his arm broken fighting for harry and that we are bound to do the best we can for him  oh yes thats of course im sure harry will feel that he used you know totothat is not just to like him because he is a freeselector  theyll drop all that now of course they could not be expected to know each other at the first starting i shouldnt wonder if they became regular friends  that would be nice after all though you may be so happy at home it is better to have something like a neighbor dont you think so  it depends on who the neighbors are i dont care much for the brownbies  they are quite different mary  i like the medlicots very much  i consider hes quite a gentleman said kate  of course hes a gentleman look here katei shall be ready to welcome mr medlicot as a brotherinlaw if things should turn out that way  i didnt mean that mary  did you not well you can mean it if you please as far as i am concerned has he said any thing to you dear  no  not a word  i dont know what you call a word not a word of that kind  i thought perhaps  i think he meant it oncethis morning  i dare say he meant it and if he meant it this morning he wont have forgotten his meaning tomorrow  theres no reason why he should mean it you know  none in the least kate is there  now youre laughing at me mary i never used to laugh at you when harry was coming i was so glad and i did every thing i could  yes you went away and left us in the botanical gardens i remember but you see there are no botanical gardens here and the poor man couldnt walk about if there were  i wonder what harry would say if it were to be so  of course hed be gladfor your sake  but he does so despise freeselectors and then he used to think that mr medlicot was quite as bad as the brownbies i wouldnt marry any one to be despised by you and harry  thats all gone by my dear said the wife feeling that she had to apologize for her husbands prejudices of course one has to find out what people are before one takes them to ones bosom mr medlicot has acted in the most friendly way about these fires and im sure harry will never despise him any more  he couldnt have done more for a real brother than have his arm broken  but you must remember one thing kate mr medlicot is very nice and like a gentleman and all that bat you never can be quite certain about any man till he speaks out plainly dont set your heart upon him till you are quite sure that he has set his upon you  oh no said kate giving her maidenly assurance when it was so much too late just at this moment mrs growler came into the kitchen and kates promises and her sisters cautions were for the moment silenced  how were to manage to get the dinner on the table i for one dont know at all said mrs growler theres mr batesll be here that will be six of em and that mr medlicot will want somebody to do every thing for him because hes been and got hisself smashed and theres the old lady has just come out from home and is as particular as any thing and mr harry himself never thinks of things at all one pair of hands and them very old cant do every thing for every body all of which was very well understood to mean nothing at all  household deficienciesand indeed all deficienciesare considerable or insignificant in accordance with the aspirations of those concerned when a man has a regiment of servants in his diningroom with beautifully cut glass a forest of flowers and an iceberg in the middle of his table if the weather be hot his guests will think themselves ill used and badly fed if aught in the banquet be astray there must not be a rose leaf ruffled a failure in the attendance a falling off in a dish or a fault in the wine is a crime but the same guests shall be merry as the evening is long with a leg of mutton and whisky toddy and will change their own plates and clear their own table and think nothing wrong if from the beginning such has been the intention of the giver of the feast in spite of mrs growlers prognostications though the cook had absconded and the chief guest of the occasion could not cut up his own meat that christmas dinner at gangoil was eaten with great satisfaction  harry had been so far triumphant he had stopped the fire that was intended to ruin him he had beaten off his enemies on their own ground and he was no longer oppressed by that sense of desolation which had almost overpowered him  well give one toast mrs medlicot he said when mrs growler and kate between them had taken away the relics of the plumpudding our friends at home  the poor lady drank the toast with a sob thats vera weel for you mr heathcote youre young and will win your way hame and see auld friends again nae doubt but ill never see ane of them mair except those i have here nevertheless the old lady ate her dinner and drank her toddy and made much of the occasion going in and out to her son upon the veranda  soon after dinner heathcote as was his wont strayed out with his prime minister bates to consult on the dangers which might be supposed still to threaten his kingdom and mrs heathcote with her youngest boy in her lap sat talking to mrs medlicot in the parlor such was not her custom in weather such as this kate had been sent out on to the veranda with special commands to attend to the wants of the sufferer and mrs heathcote would have followed her had she not remembered her sisters appeal i did every thing i could for you  in those happy days kate had been very good and certainly deserved requital for her services and therefore when the men had gone out mrs heathcote with her guest remained in the warm room and went so far as to suggest that at that period of the day the room was preferable to the veranda poor mrs medlicot was new to the ways of the bush and fell into the trap thus kate daly was left alone with her wounded hero  when told to take him out his glass of wine and when conscious that no one followed her she felt herself to have been guilty of some great sin and was almost tempted to escape she had asked her sister for help and this was the help that was forthcominghelp so palpable so manifest as to be almost indelicate would he think that plans were being made to catch him now that he was a captive and impotent the thought that it was possible that such an idea might occur to him was terrible to her she would rather lose him altogether than feel the stain of such a suggestion on her own conscience she put the glass of wine down on the little table by his side and then attempted to withdraw  stay a moment with me he said where are they all  mary and your mother are inside harry and mr bates have gone across to look at the horses  i almost feel as though i could walk too  you must not think of it yet mr medlicot it seems almost a wonder that you shouldnt have to be in bed and you with your collarbone broken only last night i dont know how you can bear it as you do  i shall be so glad i broke it if one thing will come about  what thing asked kate blushing  katemay i call you kate  i dont know she said  you know i love you do you not you must know it dearest kate can you love me and be my wife his left arm was bound up and was in a sling but he put out his right hand to take hers if she would give it to him kate daly had never had a lover before and felt the occasion to be trying she had no doubt about the matter if it were only proper for her to declare herself she could swear with a safe conscience that she loved him better than all the world  put your hand here kate he said  as the request was not exactly for the gift of her hand she placed it in his  may i keep it now  she could only whisper something which was quite inaudible even to him  i shall keep it and think that you are all my own stoop down kate and kiss me if you love me  she hesitated for a moment trying to collect her thoughts she did love him and was his own still to stoop and kiss a man who if such a thing were to be allowed at all ought certainly to kiss her she did not think she could do that but then she was bound to protect him wounded and broken as he was from his own imprudence and if she did not stoop to him he would rise to her she was still in doubt still standing with her hand in his half bending over him but yet half resisting as she bent when all suddenly harry heathcote was on the veranda followed by the two policemen who had just returned from boolabong she was sure that harry had seen her and was by no means sure that she had been quick enough in escaping from her lovers hand to have been unnoticed by the policemen also she fled away as though guilty and could hardly recover herself sufficiently to assist mrs growler in producing the additional dinner which was required  the two men were quickly sent to their rest as has been told before and harry who had in truth seen how close to his friend his sisterinlaw had been standing would had it been possible have restored the lovers to their old positions but they were all now on the veranda and it was impossible kate hung back half in and half out of the sittingroom and old mrs medlicot had seated herself close to her son harry was lying at full length on a rug and his wife was sitting over him then giles medlicot who was not quite contented with the present condition of affairs made a little speech  mrs heathcote he said i have asked your sister to marry me  dearie me giles said mrs medlicot  kate remained no longer half in and half out of the parlor but retreated altogether and hid herself harry turned himself over on the rug and looked up at his wife claiming infinite credit in that he had foreseen that such a thing might happen  and what answer has she given you said mrs heathcote  she hasnt given me any answer yet i wonder what you and heathcote would say about it  what kate has to say is much more important replied the discreet sister  i should like it of all things said harry jumping up its always best to be open about these things when you first came here i didnt like you you took a bit of my river frontagenot that it does me any great harmand then i was angry about that scoundrel nokes  i was wrong about nokes said medlicot and have therefore had my collarbone broken as to the land youll forgive my having it if kate will come and live there  by george i should think sokate why dont you come out come along my girl medlicot has spoken out openly and you should answer him in the same fashion so saying he dragged her forth and i fear that as far as she was concerned something of the sweetness of her courtship was lost by the publicity with which she was forced to confess her love will you go kate and make sugar down at the mill i have often thought how bad it would be for mary and me when you were taken away but we shant mind it so much if we knew that you are to be near us  speak to him kate said mrs heathcote with her arm round her sisters waist  i think shes minded to have him said mrs medlicot  tell me kateshall it be so pleaded the lover  she came up to him and leaned over him and whispered one word which nobody else heard but they all knew what the word was and before they separated for the night she was left alone with him and he got the kiss for which he was asking when the policemen interrupted them  thats what i call a happy christmas said harry as the party finally parted for the night
