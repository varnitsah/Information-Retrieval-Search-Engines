175759	old friends     preface    the studies in this volume originally appeared in the st jamess gazette  two from a friendly hand have been omitted here by the author of the rest as non sua poma  one was by mr richard swiveller to a boon companion and brother in the lyric apollo the other though purporting to have been addressed by messrs dombey  son to mr toots is believed on internal evidence to have been composed by the patron of the chicken himself  a few prefatory notes an introductory essay and two letters have been added  the portrait in the frontispiece copied by mr t hodge from an old painting in the club at st andrews is believed to represent the baron bradwardine addressing himself to his ball  a l    friends in fiction    every fancy which dwells much with the unborn and immortal characters of fiction must ask itself did the persons in contemporary novels never meet  in so little a world their paths must often have crossed their orbits must have intersected though we hear nothing about the adventure from the accredited narrators in historical fiction authors make their people meet real men and women of historylouis xi lazarus mary queen of scots general webbe moses the man in the iron mask marie antoinette the list is endless  but novelists in spite of mr thackerays advice to alexandre dumas and of his own example in rebecca and rowena have not introduced each others characters  dumas never pursued the fortunes of the master of ravenswood after he was picked up by that coasting vessel in the kelpies flow  sometimes a meeting between characters in novels by different hands looked all but unavoidable  pendennis and david copperfield came out simultaneously in numbers yet pen never encountered steerforth at the university nor did warrington in his life of journalism jostle against a reporter named david copperfield  one fears that the major would have called steerforth a tiger that pen would have been very loftily condescending to the nephew of betsy trotwood but captain costigan would scarcely have refused to take a sip of mr micawbers punch and i doubt not that litimer would have conspired darkly with morgan the majors sinister man  most of those delightful sets of old friends the dickens and thackeray people might well have met though they belonged to very different worlds  in older novels too it might easily have chanced that mr edward waverley of waverley honour came into contact with lieutenant booth or after the fortyfive with thomas jones or in scotland balmawhapple might have foregathered with lieutenant lismahagow  might not even jeanie deans have crossed the path of major lambert of the virginians and been helped on her way by that good man  assuredly dugald dalgetty in his wanderings in search of fights and fortune may have crushed a cup or rattled a dicebox with four gallant gentlemen of the kings mousquetaires it is agreeable to wonder what all these very real people would have thought of their companions in the region of romance and to guess how their natures would have acted and reacted on each other  this was the idea which suggested the following little essays in parody  in making them the writer though an assiduous and veteran novel reader had to recognise that after all he knew on really intimate and friendly terms comparatively few people in the paradise of fiction  setting aside the dramatic poets and their creations the children of moliere and shakspeare the reader of novels will find may be that his airy friends are scarce so many as he deemed  we all know sancho and the don by repute at least we have all our memories of gil blas manon lescaut does not fade from the heart nor her lover the chevalier des grieux from the remembrance  our mental picture of anna karenine is fresh enough and fair enough but how few can most of us recall out of the myriad progeny of george sand  indiana valentine lelia do you quite believe in them would you know them if you met them in the paradise of fiction  noun one might recognise but there is a haziness about la petite fadette  consuelo let it be admitted is not evanescent oblivion scatters no poppy over her but madame sands later ladies still more her men are easily lost in the forests of fancy  even their names with difficulty return to us and if we read the rollcall would horace and jacques cry adsum like the good colonel  there are living critics who have all mr george merediths heroines and heroes and oddities at their finger ends and yet forget that musical name like the close of a rich hexameter clare doria forey  but this is a digression it is perhaps admitted that george sand so great a novelist gave the world few characters who live in and are dear to memory  we can just fancy one of her dignified later heroines all self renunciation and rural sentiment preaching in vain to that real woman emma bovary  her we know her we remember as we remember few comparatively of balzacs thronging faces from la cousine bette to seraphitus seraphita  many of those are certain to live and keep their hold but it is by dint of long and elaborate preparation description analysis  a stranger intermeddleth not with them though we can fancy lucien de rubempre let loose in a country neighbourhood of george sands and making sonnets and love to some rural chatelaine while vautrin might stray among the ruffians of gaboriau a giant of crime  among m zolas people however it may fare with others i find myself remembering few the guilty hippolytus of la curee the poor girl in la fortune des rougon the abbe mouret the artist in loeuvre and the half idiotic girl of the farm house and helene in un page damour  they are not amongst m zolas most prominent creations and it must be some accident that makes them most memorable and recognisable to one of his readers  probably we all notice that the characters of fiction who remain our intimates whose words come to our lips often whose conduct in this or that situation we could easily forecast are the characters whom we met when we were young  we may be wrong in thinking them the best the most true and living of the unborn perhaps they only seem so real because they came fresh to fresh hearts and unworn memories  this at least we must allow for when we are tempted to say about novelists the old are better  it was we who long ago were young and better better fitted to enjoy and retain the pleasure of making new visionary acquaintances  if this be so what an argument it is in favour of reading the best books first and earliest in youth  do the ladies who now find scott slow and miss austen dull and dickens vulgar and thackeray prosy and fielding and richardson impossible come to this belief because they began early with the volumes of the circulating library  are their memories happily stored with the words and deeds of modern fictitious romps and passionate governesses and tremendous guardsmen with huge cigars  are the people ofwell why mention names of living authorsof whom you willare those as much to the young readers of 1890 as quentin durward and colonel newcome and sam weller and becky sharp and anne elliot and elizabeth bennett and jane eyre were to young readers of 1860  it may very well be so and we seniors will not regret our choice and the young men and maids will be pleased enough with theirs  yet it is not impossible that the old really are better and do not gain all their life and permanent charm merely from the unjaded memories and affections with which we came to them long ago  we shall never be certain for even if we tried the experiment of comparing we are no longer good judges our hearts are with our old friends whom we think deathless their birth is far enough off in time but they will serve us for ours  these friends it has been said are not such a very numerous company after all  most of them are children of our own soil their spirits were made in england or at least in great britain or perhaps came of english stock across the seas like our dear old leather stocking and madam hester prynne  probably most of us are insular enough to confess this limitation even if we be so unpatriotic to read far more new french than new english novels one may study m daudet and not remember his sidonie as we remember becky nor his petit chose or his jack as we remember david copperfield  in the paradise of fiction are folk of all nations and tongues but the english as swedenborg saw them doing in his vision of heaven keep very much to themselves  the american visitors or some of them disdain our old acquaintances and associate with russian spanish lithuanian armenian heroes and heroines conversing probably in some sort of french  few of us poor islanders are so cosmopolitan we read foreign novels and yet among all the brilliant persons met there we remember but a few  most of my own foreign friends in fiction wear lovelocks and large boots have rapiers at their side which they are very ready to draw are great trenchermen mighty fine drinkers and somewhat gallant in their conduct to the sex  there is also a citizen or two from furetieres roman bourgeois there is manon aforesaid and a company of picaroons and an archbishop and a lady styled marianne and a newly ennobled count of mysterious wealth and two grisettes named mimi and musette with their studentlovers  m balzac has introduced us to mystics and murderers and old maids and doctors and adventurers and poets and a girl with golden eyes and malefactors and bankrupts and mad old collectors peasants cures critics dreamers debauchees but all these are somewhat distant acquaintances many of them undesirable acquaintances  in the great comedie humaine have you a single real friend  some of charles de bernards folk are more akin to us such as la femme de quarante ans and the owner of the hound justinian and that drunken artist in gerfaut  but an englishman is rather friendless rather an alien and an outcast in the society of french fiction  monsieur de camors is not of our monde nor is the enfant du siecle indeed perhaps good monsieur sylvestre bonnard is as sympathetic as anyone in that populous country of modern french romance  or do you know fifi vollard  something must be allowed for strange manners for exotic ideas and ways not our own  more perhaps is due to what as englishmen think is the lack of humour in the most brilliant and witty of races  we have friends many in moliere in dumas in rabelais but it is far more difficult to be familiar at ease and happy in the circles to which madame sand m daudet m flaubert or m paul bourget introduce us  m bourgets old professor in le disciple we understand but he does not interest himself much in us and to us he is rather a curiosity a character than an intimate  we are driven to the belief that humour with its loving and smiling observation is necessary to the author who would make his persons real and congenial and above all friendly  now humour is the quality which dumas moliere and rabelais possess conspicuously among frenchmen  montaigne has it too and makes himself dear to us as the humorous novelists make their fancied people dear  without humour an author may draw characters distinct and clear and entertaining and even real but they want atmosphere and with them we are never intimate  mr alfred austin says that we know the hero or the heroine in prose romance far more familiarly than we know the hero or heroine in the poem or the drama  which of the serious characters in shakspeares plays are not indefinite and shadowy compared with harry esmond or maggie tulliver  the serious charactersthey are seldom very familiar or definite to us in any kind of literature  one might say to be sure that he knows hotspur a good deal more intimately than he knows mr henry esmond and that he has a pretty definite idea of iago othello macbeth king lear as definite as he has to follow mr austin of tito melema  but we cannot reckon othello or macbeth or king lear as friends nay we would rather drink with the honest ancient  all heroes and the heroines are usually too august and also too young to be friendly with us to be handled humorously by their creators  we know cuddie headrigg a great deal better than henry morton and le balafre better than quentin durward and dugald dalgetty better than anybody  humour it is that gives flesh and blood to the persons of romance makes mr lenville real while nicholas nickleby is only a walking gentleman  you cannot know oliver twist as you know the dodger and charlie bates  if you met edward waverley you could scarce tell him from another young officer of his time but there would be no chance of mistake about the dugald creature or bailie nicol jarvie or the baron bradwardine or balmawhapple  these ideas might be pushed too far it might be said that only the persons in character partsmore or less caricaturesare really vivid in the recollection  but colonel newcome is as real as captain costigan and george warrington as the chevalier strong the hero is commonly too much of a beau tenebreux to be actual scott knew it well and in one of his unpublished letters frankly admits that his heroes are wooden and no favourites of his own he had to make them as most authors make their heroes romantic amorous and serious few of them have the life of roland graeme or even of quentin durward  ivanhoe might put on the cloak of the master of ravenswood the master might wear the armour of the disinherited knight and the disguise would deceive the keenest nay mr henry esmond might pass for either if arrayed in appropriate costume  to treat a hero with humour is difficult in romance all but impossible  hence the heroes are rarely our friends except in fielding or now and then in thackeray  no book is so full of friends as the novel that has no hero but has rawdon crawley becky lady jane mr jim crawley macmurdo mrs major odowd and the rest  even dobbin is too much the hero to be admitted among our most kindly acquaintances  so unlucky are heroes that we know squire western and the philosopher square and parson adams far better than even that unheroic hero tom jones or joseph andrews the humour of fielding and his tenderness make amelia and sophia far more sure of our hearts than let us say rowena or the fair maid of perth or flora macivor or rose bradwardine  it is humour that makes mr collins immortal and mrs bennett and emma while a multitude of nice girls in fiction good girls too are as dead as queen tiah  perhaps after all this theory explains why it is so very hard to recall with vividness the persons of our later fiction  humour is not the strong point of novelists today  there may be amateurs who know mr howellss characters as their elders know sophia and amelia and catherine seytonthere may be  to the old reader of romance however earnestly he keeps up with modern fiction the salt of life seems often lacking in its puppets or its persons among the creations of living men and women i for one feel that i have two friends at least across the sea master thomas sawyer and his companion huckleberry finn  if these are not real boys then dr farrars eric is a real boy i cannot put it stronger  there is a lady on those distant shores for she never died of roman fever who i may venture to believe is not unfriendlymiss annie p millerand there is a daughter of mr silas lapham whom one cannot readily forget and there is a beery journalist in a modern instance an acquaintance a distant professional acquaintance not a friend  the rest of the fictitious white population of the states are shadowy to myself i have often followed their fortunes with interest but the details slip my aging memory which recalls topsy and uncle remus  to speak of new friends at home is a more delicate matter  a man may have an undue partiality for the airy children of his friends fancy  mr meredith has introduced me to an amiable countess to a strange country girl named rhoda to a wonderful old aeschylean nurse to some genuine boys to a wise youthbut that society grows as numerous as brilliant  mr besant has made us friends with twins of literary and artistic genius with a very highly cultured fellow of lothian with a son of vulcan with a bevy of fair but rather indistinguishable damsels like a group of agreeablelooking girls at a dance  but they are too busy with their partners to be friendly  we admire them but they are unconcerned with us  in mr blacks large family the whaup seems most congenial to some strangers the name of one of mr payns friendly lads is legion and miss broughtons dogs with their friend sara and mrs moberley welcome the casual visitor with hospitable care  among the kindly children of a later generation one may number a sailor man with a wooden leg a highland gentleman who though landless bears a kings name an irish chevalier who was out in the 45 a zulu chief who plied the axe well a private named mulvaney in her majestys indian army an elderly sportsman of agile imagination or unparalleled experience in remote adventure 1  all these a person who had once encountered them would recognise perhaps when he was fortunate enough to find himself in their company  there are children too of a dead author an author seldom lauded by critics who possibly have as many living friends as any modern characters can claim  a very large company of christian people are fond of lord welter charles ravenshoe flora and gus lady ascot the boy who played fives with a brass button and a dozen others of henry kingsleys men women and children whom we have laughed with often and very nearly cried with  for henry kingsley had humour and his children are dear to us while which of charles kingsleys far more famous offspring would be welcome unless it were salvation yeoif we met them all in the paradise of fiction  it is not very safe in literature as in life to speak well of our friends or of their families  other readers other people have theirs whom we may not care much for whom we may even chance never to have met  in the following letters from old friends mainly reprinted from the st jamess gazette a few of the writers may to some who glance at the sketches be unfamiliar when dugald dalgettys epistle on his duel with aramis was written a man of letters proposed to write a reply from aramis in a certain journal  but his editor had never heard of any of the gentlemen concerned in that affair of honour had never heard of dugald of athos porthos aramis nor dartagnan  he had not been introduced to them  this little book will be fortunate far beyond its deserts if it tempts a few readers to extend the circle of their visionary acquaintances of friends who like brahma know not birth nor decay sleep waking nor trance  a theme more delicate and intimate than that of our friends in fiction awaits a more passionate writer than the present parodist our loves in fiction are probably numerous and our choice depends on age and temperament  in romance if not in life we can be in love with a number of ladies at once  it is probable that beatrix esmond has not fewer knights than marie antoinette or mary stuart these ladies have been the marks of scandal  unkind things are said of all three but our hearts do not believe the evil reports sir walter scott refused to write a life of mary stuart because his opinion was not on the popular side nor on the side of his feelings  the reasoning and judicial faculties may be convinced that beatrix was other than a guid ane but reason does not touch the affections we see her with the eyes of harry esmond and like him remember a paragon  with similar lack of logic we believe that mrs wenham really had one of her headaches and that becky was guiltless on a notorious occasion  bad or not so bad what lady would we so gladly meet as mrs rawdon crawley whose kindness was so great that she even condescended to be amusing to her own husband  for a more serious and lifelong affection there are few heroines so satisfactory as sophia western and amelia booth nee harris  never before nor since did a mans ideal put on flesh and bloodout of poetry that isand apart from the ladies of shakspeare  fieldings women have a manly honour tolerance greatness in addition to their tenderness and kindness literature has not their peers and life has never had many to compare with them  they are not superior like romola nor flighty and destitute of taste like maggie tulliver among fieldings crowd of fribbles and sots and oafs they carry that pure moly of the lady in comus  it is curious indeed that men have drawn women more true and charming than women themselves have invented and the heroines of george eliot of george sand except consuelo and even of miss austen do not subdue us like di vernon nor win our sympathies like rebecca of york  they may please and charm for their hour but they have not the immortality of the first heroines of allof helen or of that alcmena who makes even comedy grave when she enters and even plautus chivalrous  poetry rather than prose fiction is the proper home of our spiritual mistresses they dwell where rosalind and imogen are with women perhaps as unreal or as ideal as themselves mens lost loves and unforgotten in a paradise apart    letter  from mr clive newcome to mr arthur pendennis    mr newcome a married man and an exile at boulogne sends mr arthur pendennis a poem on his undying

giovanelli of the bersaglieri young ponto of the kobs and myselfmen who never give a thought save to the gold embroidery of their pantoufles or the exquisite ebon laquer of their russia leather cricketshoes  suddenly we heard a clatter in the streets  the riderless chargers of the bersaglieri were racing down the santo croce and just turning with a swing and shriek of clattering spurs into the maremma  in the midst of the street under our very window was a little thing like a butterfly with yeux de pervenche  you remember camarada voltaires love of the pervenche we have plucked it have we not in his garden of les charmettes  nous nirons plus aux bois  basta  but to return  there she stood terrorstricken petrified like her who of old turned her back on zoar and beheld the

and muttering corpo di bacco quaffed a carafon of green chartreuse holding at least a quart which stood by him in its native pewter  young ponto merely muttered egad i leaped through the open window and landed at her feet  the racing steeds were within ten yards of us  calmly i cast my eye over their points  far the fleetest though he did not hold the lead was marmaladas charger the atys gelding by celerima out of sac de nuit  with one wave of my arm i had placed her on his crupper and with the same action swung myself into the saddle  then in a flash and thunder of flying horses we swept like tawny lightning down the pincian  the last words i heard from the club window through the heliotropescented air were thirty to one on atys half only if declared  they were wagering on our lives the slang of the paddock was on their lips  onward downward we sped the fair stranger lifeless in my arms past scarlet cardinals in mufti past brilliant greek text like those who swayed the city of the violet crown past pifferari dancing in front of many an albergo through the ghetto with its marmorine palaces over the fountain of trevi across the cascine down the streets of the vatican we flew among yells of owners up the gelding wins hard held from the excited bourgeoisie heaven and earth swam before my eyes as we reached the pons sublicia and heard the tawny waters of tiber swaying to the

moment that seemed an eternity  then we landed on the faroff further bank and for the first time i could take a pull at his head  i turned him on the rivers brim and leaped him back again  the runaway

stuart called alan breck and well known as the companion of mr david balfour in many adventures  mr barry at this time was in the pay of herr potzdorff of his prussian majestys police and was the associate of the chevalier his kinsman in the pursuit of fortune   berlin april 1 1748  uncle barryi dictate to pippi my right hand being wounded and that by no common accident  going down the linden strasse yesterday i encountered a mob and being curious in potzdorffs interest penetrated to the kernel of it  there i found two men of my old regimentkurz and anotherat words with a small dark nimble fellow who carried bright and dancing eyes in a pockmarked face  he had his iron drawn a heavy boxhandled cutandthrust blade and seemed ready to fall at once on the pair that had been jeering him for his strange speech  who is this lads i asked  ein englander answered they  no englishman says he in a curious accent not unlike our brogue but a plain gentleman though he bears a kings name and hath alan breck to his byname  come come says i in german let the gentleman go his way he is my own countryman  this was true enough for them and you should have seen the highlanders eyes flash and grow dim again  i took his arm for potzdorff will expect me to know all about the stranger and marched him down to the drei konige  i am your host sir what do you call for mr stuart of  said i knowing there is never a scot but has the name of his kailyard tacked to his own  a kings name is good enough for me i bear it plain  mr  said he reddening  they call me the chevalier barry of ballybarry  i am in the better company sir quoth he with a grand bow  when a bowl of punch was brought he takes off his hat and drinks very solemnly to the king  over the water i asked  nay sir on this side he said and i smoked the jacobite  but to shorten the story which amuses my tedium but may beget it in you i asked him if he knew the cards  im just daft when i get to the cartes he answered in his brogue and we fell to piquet  now my scot wore a very fine coat and on the same very large smooth silver buttons well burnished therefore perceiving such an advantage as a skilled player may enjoy i let him win a little to whet his appetite but presently used his buttons as a mirror wherein i readily detected the strength of the cards he held  before attempting this artifice i had solemnly turned my chair round thrice  you have changed the luck sir says mr breck or stuart presently and rising with a mighty grave air he turned his coat and put it on inside out  sir says i what am i to understand by this conduct  what for should not i turn my coat for luck if you turn your chair says he  but if you are not preceesely satisfied i will be proud to step outside with you  i answered that we were not in a highland wilderness and that if no malice were meant no affront was taken  we continued at the game till though deprived of my mirror i had won some 500 fredericks  on this he rose saying sir in this purse you will find the exact sum that i am owing you and i will call for my empty sporran the morn  it was rob roys before it was mine therewith he laid on the table a sort of goatskin pouch such as highlanders gird about their loins and marched forth  i set to work at opening his pouch that was fastened by a spring and button seeming easy enough of access  but i had scarce pressed the button when lo a flash a pistol shot and my right hand is grazed with a bullet that flew out of the bag  this highlander of the devil had some mechanism in his purse that discharged a small steel pistol when unwarily opened  my hand is but slightly wounded yet i cannot hold my sword nor hath my search brought me any news of alan breck  he has vanished like an emissary of the devil or the pretender as i doubt not he is  but i will have his blood if he is not one of their scotch fairies your loving nephew  redmond barry of ballybarry  psthe fredericks were in the bag all told    letter  from mrs gamp

often and often mrs harris have said it before me with the tears in her angel eyesone of them having a slight cast from an accident with the moderator lamp harris being quick in his temperoften and often have she said to me  ah sairey the quarrels of friends is affections best restorer  and good reason to know it she have with a husband as was ever true and never gave her no cause to form the wish to pizen them as has good looks but for i will not deceive you ready with his hands  and so between you and me may it be betsy prig as was constant partners afore them chuzzlewidges and nadgetts

soothing to the temper  so let bygones be bygones between us  for wanting of my betsy i am now in a nice state of confusion with a patient as was well beknown to me in younger days when there wasnt so much of a shadder on this mortial vial 2 meaning mr pecksniff  which you will not forget of him by reason of his daughter as married that jonadge and his collars as mints of money must have gone to

accustomed to but having had a turn  for will you believe it she was not a widger woman as has experience in the ways of men but a huzzy in a bragian cap like them the nuns wear in mariar monk as you may have seen it in the small sweetshops at a penny  and her hands as white as her papistry cap and she a turning up of her nose at what i had took and a presuming to give me advice about nussing as st pancradges churchyard wouldnt hold them ive seen comfortable to their long homes and no complaints made but ever the highest satigefaction  so i ups and gives her a bit of my mind and mrs todgers coming down its she goes or me says i for never will sairey gamp nuss sick or monthly with a pardner as has not confidence in me nor i in her but contrary  then she says shell go and speak to the doctor about it and out she tramps with her nose in the air and sneezing most awful not being accustomed to that which i take find it strengthening but as it have been a cause of sorrow and strife let it be nameless between you and me for to have the name snuffey brought forward it is what the heart can forgive but never forget in this valley of the shaddock  i have nussed a many lunacies betsy and in a general way am dispoged to humour them rather than set them right up agin the fire when fractious  but this pecksniff is the tryingest creature he having got it in his mind as he is somebody very high and talking about the house and bills and clauses and the sacred cause of universal anarchy for such was his bible language though meaning to me no more than the babe unborn  whereby mrs harris she have often said to me what do them blessed infants occupy their little minds with afore they are called into that condition where unless changed at nuss providence have appointed them and many a time have i said seek not mrs harris to diskiver for we know not wots hidden in our own hearts and the torters of the imposition should not make me diwulge it  but pecksniff is that aggravating as i can hardly heed the words i now put on the paper  some of my birds have left me says he for the strangers breast and one have took wing for the government benches 3  but i have ever sacrificed my countrys happiness to my own and i will not begin to regulate my life by other rules of conduct now  i know the purity of my own motives and while my merry my little sir william playful warbler prattles under this patriarchal wing and my cherry my darling morley supports the old mans tottering walk i can do without my goschy my dears i can do without him and wants to borrer my umbreller for them to rally round the bragian idgiot  a chattering creature he always were and will be but betsy i have this wery momink fixed him up with a shoehorn in his mouth as was lying round providential and the strings of my bonnet and the last word as he will say this blessed night was some lunacy about denouncing the clogeure as wont give much more trouble now  so having rung for a shillings worth of ginandwater warm and wishing you was here to take another of the same i puts my lips to it and drinks to one as was my frequent pardner in this mortial vale and am as in old days my betsys own  sairey gamp    letter  from herodotus of halicarnassus to sophocles the athenian    herodotus describes in a letter to his friend sophocles a curious encounter with a mariner just returned from unknown parts of africa   to sophocles the athenian greeting  yesterday as i was going down to the marketplace of naucratis i met nicarete who of all the hetairai in this place is the most beautiful  now the hetairai of naucratis are wont somehow to be exceedingly fair beyond all women whom we know  she had with her a certain phocaean mariner who was but now returned from a voyage to those parts of africa which lie below arabia and she saluted me courteously as knowing that it is my wont to seek out and inquire the tidings of all men who have intelligence concerning the ends of the earth  hail to thee nicarete said i verily thou art this morning as lovely as the dawn or as the beautiful rhodopis that died ere thou wert born to us through the favour of aphrodite 4  now this rhodopis was she who built they say the pyramid of mycerinus  wherein they speak not truly but falsely for rhodopis lived long after the kings who built the pyramids  rhodopis died not o herodotus said nicarete but is yet living and as fair as ever she was and he who is now my lover even this phanes of phocaea hath lately beheld her  then she seemed to me to be jesting like that scribe who told me of krophi and mophi for rhodopis lived in the days of king amasis and of sappho the minstrel and was beloved by charaxus the brother of sappho wherefore sappho reviled him in a song  how then could rhodopis who flourished more than a hundred years before my time be living yet  while i was considering these things they led me into the booth of one that sold wine and when nicarete had set garlands of roses on our heads phanes began and told me what i now tell thee but whether speaking truly or falsely i know not  he said that being on a voyage to punt for so the egyptians call that part of arabia he was driven by a north wind for many days and at last landed in the mouth of a certain river where were many seafowl and waterbirds  and thereby is a rock no common one but fashioned into the likeness of the head of an ethiopian  there he said that the people of that country found him namely the amagardoi and carried him to their village  they have this peculiar to themselves and unlike all other peoples whom we know that the woman asks the man in marriage  they then when they have kissed each other are man and wife wedded  and they derive their names from the mother wherein they agree with the lycians whether being a colony of the lycians or the lycians a colony of theirs phanes could not give me to understand  but whereas they are black and the lycians are white i rather believe that one of them has learned this custom from the other for anything might happen in the past of time  the amagardoi have also this custom such as we know of none other people that they slay strangers by crowning them with amphorae having made them redhot  now having taken phanes they were about to crown him on this wise when there appeared among them a veiled woman very tall and goodly whom they conceive to be a goddess and worship  by her was phanes delivered out of their hands and she kept him in her hollow caves having a desire that he should be her lover as homer says in the odyssey if the odyssey be homers  and phanes reports of her that she is the most beautiful woman in the world but of her coming thither whence she came or when she would tell him nothing  but he swore to me by him who is buried at thebes and whose name in such a matter as this it is not holy for me to utter that this woman was no other than rhodopis the thracian  for there is a portrait of rhodopis in the temple of aphrodite in naucratis and knowing this portrait well phanes recognised by it that the woman was rhodopis 5 therefore rhodopis is yet living being now about one hundred and fifty years of age  and phanes added that there is in the country of the amagardoi a fire and whoso enters into that fire does not die but is without age and immortal as homer says concerning the horses of peleus  now i would have deemed that he was making a mock of that sacred story which he knows who has been initiated into the mysteries of demeter at eleusis  but he and nicarete are about to sail together without delay to the country of the amagardoi believing that there they will enter the fire and become immortal  yet methinks that rhodopis will not look lovingly on nicarete when they meet in that land nor nicarete on rhodopis nay belike the amphora will be made hot for one or the other  such howbeit was the story of phanes the phocaean whether he spoke falsely or truly  the god be with thee

nee sharp but afterwards discovers the true character of this insidious and dangerous woman   the palace barchester july 17  dear letitiathe appearance of mumps in a small family of fourteen like yours is indeed one of those dispensations which teach us how mysterious are the ways  but i need not tell you to be most careful about cold which greatly adds to the virulence of the complaint and it is difficult for you in lodgings at brighton to keep a watchful eye on so many at once  may this discipline be blessed to you and to the dear children  i have much to tell you of barchester  the light worldly tone of some families in this place i will not mention the grantleys nor the arabins has been checked i hope by one of those accidents which surely surely are not to be considered accidents alone you know how strong is my objection to fancy fairs or bazaars too often rather scenes of giddy merriment than exhibitions of genuine christian feeling  yet by means of one of these how strangely are things ordered a happy change i trust is being brought about in our midst  you have heard of hogglestock though you may never have visited that benighted and outlying parish  indeed i was never there myself till last week when tom felt it his duty though woefully misdirected to my mind but we are fallible creatures to go and open a bazaar in that place for the restoration of the church 6 i accompanied him for i trusted that an opportunity might be made for me and that i might especially bear in on the mind of the rectors wife the absolute necessity of sabbathday schools  the rector is a mr crawley  he led us on our arrival into a scene of re d cloth wax dolls most indelicately displayed cushions antimacassars and similar idols  the bishops speech i composed it myself you will read in the barchester guardian which i send you  while approving the end he rebuked the means and took the opportunity to read a muchneeded lesson on jesuitry and the dangers of worldliness in high ecclesiastical places  let those wince who feel a sense of their own backslidings  when the bishop had ended i determined to walk once through the bazaar just to make sure that there were no lotteries nor games of chancea desecration of our mites now too too frequent  as i was returning through the throng alas of pleasureseekers and wishing that i might scourge them out of the schoolroom mr crawley met me in company with a lady who desired he said to be presented to me he is a distant relation of the wellknown county family the crawleys of queens crawley the present baronet sir rawdon having recently married miss jane dobbin daughter of colonel dobbin  the lady who was now introduced to me and whose still pleasing face wears an aspect of humble devoutness was lady crawley mother of the present baronet  madam she said i came here in the belief that i was discharging a pious duty  my life alas has been one of sore trial and i only try to do good     i was going to say that i had seen her name in a score of charity lists and knew her as a patroness of the destitute orangegirls the neglected washerwomen and the distressed muffinmen  but she shook her head and then looking up at me with eyes like a saints if our privileges permitted us to believe in these fabulous beings of the romish superstition she said ah no  i have always been in the wrong  the beautiful address of the bishop of barchester has awakened me and convinced me that the path does not lie through fancy fairs  i have to begin again  who shall guide me  i trust i am not subject to vanity but the news that i for i composed the charge as i may almost call it had been the instrument of so affecting a change did not fail to please me  i thanked lady crawley and expressed my deep interest in her altered convictions  finally she promised to come on a visit to us at the palace she usually resides at bath or cheltenham and has been three days an inmate  never have i met a more singular example of what the truth can do for one who as she admits was long ago a worldling  i have seen the vanity of it she tells me with tears in her eyes and from her example i expect an awakening among our worldlings  they will follow the path of a titled person  tom is much interested in his convert as he thinks her  not to me be the gloryyour assured friend  emily barnum 7   from mrs proudie to mrs quiverful   the palace barchester july 22  dear letitiamy hand trembles so with indignation that i can hardly direct my pen  pray burn my letter of july 17 at once if you have not already done so 8  we have been deceived in that woman  she is a brazenfaced painted daughter of heth and has no more right to the title of lady crawley than you have  i am told that she was at one time the paramour of lord steyne and that her conduct made it impossible for her husband to live with her  and this is the woman who has come within the gates of the palace of a christian prelate nay more who has secured his signature to a cheque of very considerable value  i think my suspicions were first excited by the disappearance of the brandy in the liqueur stand and by meeting her ladyships maid carrying the bottle up to her room  i spoke to the bishop but he would not listen to me quite unlike himself and even turned on me in her defence  entering his study hastily on the following day i found her kneeling at his feet her yellow hair dyed no doubt for she must be sixty if she is a day about her shoulders doing what do you suppose   confessing herself to the bishop of barchester  and he was listening to her confession with an appearance of interest and with one of her hands in his  serpent i saidand her green eyes glittered just like one unhand his lordship  she gave a little laugh and said dear mrs proudie do not let me monopolise the bishops time  perhaps i am in the way  and you shall go out of it i said  you are one of those who cause israel to sin  you bring the confessional for it is no better into the house of a prelate of the protestant church of england  would you believe that she had the assurance to answer me with a passage from the prayer book which i have often felt certain must be mistranslated  pack madam said i we know who can quote scripture for his own ends  and i pretty soon saw her out of the house though not in time for the infatuated bishop had already given her a cheque for a sum which i cannot bring myself to tell you for the funds of the destitute orangegirls  not a penny of it will they ever see nor do i approve of such ostentatious alms in any caseyours

that mr surtees of mainsforth not only palmed off on sir waiter scott several ballads of his own manufacture but also invented and pretended to have found in a document since burned the story of the duel with the spectre knight which occurs in marmion  in the following letter this ingenious antiquary plays the same game with mr jonathan oldbuck of monkbarns the celebrated antiquary  a note on the subject is published in the appendix   mainsforth may 9 1815  dear siri am something of the mussulmans humour as you know and never willingly pass by a scrap of printed paper however it comes in my way  i cannot indeed like the spectator mention a paper kite from which i have received great improvement nor a hatcase which i would not exchange for all the beavers in great britain  it is in a less unlikely place that i have made a little discovery which will interest you i hope for as it chances not only has a lost ballad been at least partially recovered but    however i will keep your learned patience on the tenterhooks for a while  business taking me to newcastle of late i found myself in bells little shop on the quay 9  you know the man by report at least he is more a collector than a bookseller though poor and i verily believe that he would sell all his childrendouglas bell percy bell hobbie bell and kinmont bellfor a song  ballads are his foible and he can hardly be made to part with one of the broadsides in his broken portfolios  well semel insanivimus omnes by the way did it ever strike you that the roman cribbed that line as the vulgar say from an epigram in the anthology and you and i will scarce throw the first stone at the poor mans folly  however i am delaying your natural eagerness  so now for the story of my great discovery  as our friend bell would scarce let his dusty broadsheet lumber out of his hands i was turning to leave him in no very good humour when i noticed a small and rather long octavo in dirty and crumpled vellum lying on the top of a heap of rubbish bostons crook in the lot the pilgrims progress and other chapbook trumpery  i do not know what good angel that watches over us collectors made me take up the thing which i found to be nothing less than a copy of old guillaume coquillart  it was not galliot du pres edition in lettres rondes but still more precious had it only been complete an example in black letter  i give you the whole title  first the motto in the frieze of an architectural design greek text then in small capitals    les oeuvres maistre gvil laume coquil lart en son vi vant official de reims  nov vellement re veves et corri gees m d xxxv  on les vend a lyon en la maison de francoys juste demourant devant nostre dame de confort   by bad or good luck this rare piece was imperfectthe back gaping and three sheets gone  but in turning over the leaves i saw something that brought my heart as they say into my mouth so beating down bell from his upset price of fourpence to six bawbees i pushed the treasure carelessly in my pocket and never stopped till i was in a lonely place by tyneside and secure from observation  then with my knife i very carefully uncased maistre guillaume and extracted the sheet of parchment printed in black letter with red capitals that had been used to line the binding a corner of it had crept out through the injuries of time and on that in bells crame for it is more a crame than a shop i had caught the mystic words runjt macht gunjt  and now i think monkbarns you prick up your ears and wipe your spectacles  that is the motto as every one of the learned family of antiquaries is well aware and as you have often told me of your great forbear the venerable and praiseworthy aldobrand oldenbuck the typographer who fled from the low countries during the tyrannical attempt of philip ii to suppress at once civil and religious liberty  as all the world knows he withdrew from nuremberg to scotland and set up his penates and what you may not hitherto have been aware of his printing press at fairport and under your ancestral roof of monkbarns  but what will surprise you yet more the parchment sheet which bears aldobrands motto in german contains printed matter in good scots  this excellent and enterprising man must have set himself to ply his noble art in his new home and in our unfamiliar tongue  yet even now we are not at the end of this most fortunate discovery  it would appear that there was little demand for works of learning and religion in scotland or at least at fairport for the parchment sheet contains fragments of a ballad in the scots tongue  none but a poor and struggling printer would then have lent his types to such work and fortunate for us has been the poverty of your great ancestor  here we have the very earliest printed ballad in the world and though fragmentary it is the more precious as the style proves to demonstration and against the frantic scepticism even of a ritson the antique and venerable character of those compositions  i send you a copy of the ballad with the gaps where the tooth of time or of the worm edax rerum hath impaired it filled up with conjectural restorations of my own  but how far do they fall short of the original simplicity non cuivis contingit  as the title is lacking as well as the imprint i have styled it   the fragment of the fause lover and the dead leman  o willie rade and willie gaed atween the shore and sea and still it was his dead lady that kept him company  o willie rade and willie gaed atween the loch and heather and still it was his dead lady that held his

seen that a dead leman kept lovers company  gae back gae back frae me he said for this day maun i wed and how can i kiss a living lass when ye come frae the dead  if ye maun haunt a living man your brither haunt says he for it was never my knife but his that twined thy life and thee      we are to understand i make no doubt that willie had been too fortunate a lover and that in his absencethe frailty of his lady becoming conspicuousher brother had avenged the family honour according to that old law of scotland which the courteous ariosto styles l aspra legge di scozia empia e severa  pray let me know at your leisure what you think of this trouvaille  it is of course entirely at your service if you think it worthy of a place in a new edition of the minstrelsy  i have no room to inflict

hath fortune been to you and in a secondary degree to myself  your letter must dispel the unreasoning and i fear envious scepticism of maccribb who has put forth a plaunflet i love that old spelling in which he derides the history of aldobrand oldenbuck as a fable  the ballad shall indeed have an honoured place in my poor collection whenever the public taste calls for a new edition  but the original what would i not give to have it in my hands to touch the very parchment which came from the press of my revered ancestor and gloating on the crabbed letters confute maccribb to his face ipso

mr warburton who destroyed his ancient manuscript plays hath invaded my sanctum and the original blackletter text of the ballad has gone to join shakspeares stephen and henry ii  she hath lit with it my study fire and it is fortunate indeed that i had made the copy of the ballad for you  but the volume of coquillart is alive to testify to the authenticity of the poem which after all is needless evidence as not even ritson could suspect of either the skill or the malice of such a forgery yours most faithfully  robert surtees    letter  from nicholas to the editor of the st jamess gazette    it is only too probable that a later generation has forgotten nicholas the sporting prophet of fun in the reign of mr hood the younger  the little work nicholass notes in which mr w j prowse collected the papers of the old prophet is indeed not an edition de looks as the aged seer says with his simple humour  from the paradise of fiction however and the paradise of touts nicholas has communicated perhaps to the psychical society the following epistle  his friendly mention of a brother journalist speaks well for the old mans head and heart   the paradise of fiction feb 9 1888  sirmy dear young friend it is ten to one and no takers that the public than whom between you and me i do not think much of them have forgotten nicholas or even never heard of the prophet youth will be served and it is now between twenty years since he left off vaticinating in fun during young mr hoods time of future sportive events for to come and came to live here with the other celebrated characters of fiction than whom i am sure a more mixed lot though perhaps a little gay  it having come to the prophets knowledge that some of them was writing letters to the st jamess gazette than which i am sure none more respectable though perhaps a little not quite so attentive to sportive interests as it might be he have decided that nicholas will take up his pen once more as of old  the state of the turf my dear young friend since an old but still handsome bird would freely alight when not warned off on newmarket heath have caused nicholas some anxiety  sir between you and me it is rapidly getting no better  here is lord  than whom a more sterling sportsman as good as saying to sir  than whom perhaps did you ever hear of a sporting character called swindells  and the prophet have been told that it may furnish matter for the gentlemen of the long robewhich in my time many of them was backers of horses  and all along of what  why of the inexplicable inandout running of horses as the standard says and as will often happen you perhaps having a likely dark one as you want to get light into a highclass autumn handicap  the days is long past since nicholas was nuts on the game little lecturer but still has the interests of the turf at heart and my dear young friend if horses never ran in and out where would be the glorious uncertainty of the sport  on the whole then if asked my opinion on this affair the prophet would sayputting it ambiguouslike gentlemen when theres so much dirty linen to wash cant you remember that were all pretty much tarred with the same brush  a great politicianwhich a lot of his family is here coningsby and the young duke and many other sportsmenused to say as what the turf was a gigantic engine of national demoralisation which nicholas is not quite sure but what he was right for him though his language on rather a large scale  horses running in and out is inexplicable  why gents all which of us wouldnt do it if he had the chance to put the pot on handsome human nature being what it is especially considering the lowness of the market odds as you have often and often to be content with  in short the more you stir it the more it wont exactly remind you of gales from araby the blest than which a more delightful country only not to be found on any atlas as nicholas ever cast a glance at the map however large  but enough of a subject than which perhaps one more painful to me the prophet having often and often in early days been warned off newmarket heath himself and called a disreputable old tout though only labouring in his vocation  make a new beginning here please printer  it have come to the knowledge of the prophet that his notes are not quite so much read as they once was partly owing no doubt to the book being not so much an edition de looks as rather a low lived lot to a casual eye at fourpence the picture outside representing nicholas rather as having had too much for to drink than as a prominent member of the blue ribbon society which it did not exist in his period nor would it have enjoyed to any considerable extent my personal or pecuniary support he having something else to do with his money  printer please put in a full stop somewhere here nicholas being a little out of the habit of writing for the periodical press  he have also heard that it is proposed in literary circles to start a nicholas society for the purpose of printing a limited edition of my works including my lost treatise of knur and spell on japanese paper illustrated with photogravelures they having come in since the prophets period though perhaps a little gay  but my dear though exquisite young friends is there no better way of rallying round the prophet than this  i have heard from characters in ancient literature such as agamemnonthan whom a more energetic soldier though perhaps a trifle arbitrarythe prophet have heard i say that a deal of liquor used to be poured on the graves of coves like him and me and that it did them good this may be the case and anyway the experiment is well worth trying though i would say do not let it be milk as i gather was customary in early times as didnt know any better but if possible a bottle or two of sherry wine to which as is well beknown nicholas was partial  he will now conclude and the prophet hopes that an experiment than which i am sure one more deeply interesting will not be deferred he not much taking to the liquor here though the company makes up for a great deal especially an irish officer by the name of costigan than whom a sweeter singer or a more honourable gentleman and signs himself with gratitude for past favours and kind respects to the editor of the guardian  nicholas    letter  from the earl of montrose to captain dugald dalgetty    whoever has read the memoirs of monsieur dartagnana marshal in the french kings serviceas they are published by monsieur alexandre dumas in les trois mousquetaires will not have forgotten that duel behind the luxembourg in which as is declared an englishman ran away from the chevalier dherblay called aramis in his regiment  englishmen have never held that monsieur dumas was well informed about this affair  the following letters of the great marquis and captain dalgetty from the kirkhope papers prove that englishmen were in the right    164  sirtouching that i did to your apprehension turn away from you with some show of coldness on your late coming it may be that you but little misread me  but for that no man is condemned without a hearing i would fain know under your own hand the truth concerning that whereof a shameful report is bruited abroad even in the gallo belgicus and the fliegender mercoeur of leipsicnamely that in a certain duel lately fought in paris behind the palace of the luxembourg four englishmen encountering as many musketeers of the french kings one out of this realm to our disgrace shamefully fled and he by report rittmaster dugald dalgetty till which bruit be either abolished and the stainas an ill blot on a clean scutcheonwiped away or as shamefully acknowledged as it is itself shameful i abide as i shall hear from yourself  montrose   from captain dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket to the most noble and puissant prince james earl of montrose commanding the musters of the king in scotland  these    my lordas touching the bruit or fama as we said at the mareschal college i shall forthwith answer and that peremptorie for this story of the duello as a man may say though indeed they that fought in it were not in the dual number as your grecian hath it but eight soldadosseven of them gallant men truly the story is of the longest but as your lordship will have it though more expert with the sword than the goosequill i must even buckle to  let your lordship conceive of your poor officer once lieutenant and rittmaster under that invincible monarch the bulwark of the protestant faith gustavus the victorious conceive i say dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket that should be in paris concerned with a matter of weight and moment not necessary to be mooted or minted of  as i am sitting at my tavern ordinary for i consider that an experienced cavalier should ever lay in provenant as occasion serveth comes in to me a stipendiary of my lord winter bidding me know that his master would speak to me  and that not coram populo as i doubt not your lordship said at st leonards college in st andrews but privily  thereon i rise and wait on him to be brief brevis esse laboro as we said lang synehis lordship would have me to be of his backers in private rencontre with four gentlemen of the kings musketeers  concerning the cause of this duello i may well say teterrima causa  his lordships own sister milady clarik was in question she being i fear me rather akin in her way of life to jean drocheils whom your lordship may remember for the baillies expulsing her from aberdeen she migrated to st andrews ad eundem as the saying is than like in her walk and conduct to a virtuous lady of a noble family  she was indeed as current rumour had it the light olove or belle amie of monsieur dartagnan his lordships adversary  but of siclike least said soonest mended  i take cloak and sword and follow with his lordship and two other experienced cavaliers unto the place of rencontre being a waste croft whereon a loon was herding goats behind the palace of the luxembourg  here we find waiting us four soldados proper tall men of their hands who receive us courteously  he that first gave cause of quarrel to my lord winter bore a worthy name enough out of gascony that is arida nutrix as we said at the mareschal college of honourable soldadosto wit as i said he was monsieur dartagnan  to his friends howbeit he gave sic heathen titles as i never saw or heard of out of the grecian books  namely monsieur porthos a very tall man albeit something of a lourdaud monsieur athos and he that was to be mine own opposite monsieur aramis  hearing these outlandish and insolent appellations i thought it becoming me as an honourable cavalier to resent this fashion of presenting  and demurred that a gentleman of the house of dalgetty of drumthwacket could neither take affront from nor give honourable satisfaction to a nameless landlouper  wherein your lordship i doubt me not will hold me justificate  lord winter homologating mine opinion he that called himself athos drew each of us apart and whispered the true names and qualities territorial of these gentlemen the whilk as may befall honourable soldados they had reason sufficient to conceal while serving as private gentlemen in a regiment though disdaining to receive halberds as unbecoming their birth  he that aligned himself forenenst me was styled the chevalier dherblay and the word being given we fell to  now mine adversary declining to fight comminus gladio but breaking ground in a manner unworthy of a gallant soldado and the place saving your presence being somewhat slippery and treacherous because of the goats that were fed there i delivered a sufficient onslaught and he fell his sword flying from his hand when i had taken his weaponthe spolia opima as we said at mareschal collegei bid him rise and then discoursed him on the dishonour of such a hasty defeat  then he confessing himself to me that though under arms he was a young fledgeling priest in popish orders i began upon him with such words on his disgracing the noble profession of arms as might have made him choose to return to his cloister when suddenly he fled and being young and lightfooted robbed me not only of such caduacs and casualties as an experienced cavalier might well take from his prisoner for ransom but also as now it appears of my good name  for i doubt not that this musketeer priest monsieur aramis or labbe dherblay for he hath as many names as i have seen campaigns was the loon that beguiled with a lying tale the newsman of the gallo belgicus  and i have ever seen that an honourable soldado will give the goby to these newsmen and their flying sheets as unworthy of the notice of honourable cavaliers of whom recommending your lordship for the truth of my tale to my lord winter now with his gracious majesty the king i am fain to subscribe myself one and your lordships poor officer as ye shall entreat him  dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket  late commander of the whole stift of dunklespiel on the lower rhine    letter  from mr lovelace to john belford esq    the following letter must have been omitted from the papers to which mr samuel richardson the editor of clarissa had access it was written apparently after the disgraceful success of lovelaces disgraceful adventure and shows us that scoundrel in company not choice indeed but better than he deserved the society of mr thomas jones a foundling  mr joness admirable wife nee western having heard of lovelaces conduct sent her husband to execute that revenge which should have been competed for by every man of heart  it will be seen that mr jones was no match for the perfidies of mr lovelace  the cynical reflections of that bad man on lord fellamar and his relations with mrs jones will only cause indignation and contempt among her innumerable and honourable admirers  they will remember the critical and painful circumstances as recorded in mr henry fieldings biography of mr jones

flashed through the window sword in hand as in my frightful dream nor hath the statue of the commandant visited me like don juan that rake of spain but a challenger came hither that is not akin to my

brawnybeefed chairman hath married a fortune and a delicious girl you dog miss sophia western of somerset and is now in train i doubt not to beget as goodly a tribe of chuckleheaded boys and wheyfaced wenches as you shall see round an old squires tomb in a parish church  wherefore does he not abide at this his appointed lawful husbandry i marvel but not a whit  our cursed adventure hath spread from the flippanti of both sexes down to the heathenish parts of somerset where it hath reached madam joness ears and inflamed this pretty vixen with a desire to avenge miss harlowe on me and by the cudgel of mr jones his sophia having sent him up to town for no other purpose  de la tour my man came to me yesterday morning with the tidings that the new giant as he supposes waits on me to solicit the favour of my patronage  i am in the powdering closet being bound for a rout and cry let the giant in  then a heavy tread  and looking up what do i see but a shoulderofmutton fist at my nose and lo a

you will but first inform me of the nature of our quarrel  would you blazon abroad yet further the malignant tales that have injured both me and a lady for whom i have none but the most hallowed esteem  i pray you sit down sir be calm the light is ill for any play with cudgel or sword  de la tour a bottle of right burgundy mr jones and i have business and he hath travelled far  in a trice there was a chicken a bottle a set of knives and forks a white cloth and a hungry oaf that did eat and swear  one bottle followed another  by the third mr jones embraced me saying that never had a man been more belied than i that it was lord fellamar not i was the villain  to this effect i own that i did myself drop a hint conceiving that the divine sophia must often have regretted our friend fellamar when once she was bound to the oaf and that jones was capable of a resentful jealousy  by midnight i had to call a chair for my besotted challenger and when the avenger was there safely bestowed i asked him where the men should carry him  his tongue being now thick and his brains bemused he could not find the sign of his inn in his noddle  so the merry devil prompting me i gave the men the address of his ancient flame my lady bellaston and off they jogged with jones  was there ever belford a stranger amoris redintegratio than this must have been when our lydia heard the old love

foundling too gone the way of all flesh  thy lovelace  no news of the dear fugitive  ah belford my conscience and my cousins call me a villain  minxes all    letter  from miss catherine morland to miss eleanor tilney    miss catherine morland of northanger abbey gives her account of a visit to mr rochester and of his governesss peculiar behaviour  mrs rochester nee eyre has no mention of this in her memoirs   thornfield midnight  at length my dear eleanor the terrors on which you have so often rallied me are become realities and your catherine is in the midst of those circumstances to which we may without exaggeration give the epithet horrible  i write as i firmly believe from the mansion of a maniac  on a visit to my aunt ingram and carried by her to thornfield the seat of her wealthy neighbour mr rochester how shall your catherines trembling pen unfold the mysteries by which she finds herself surrounded  no sooner had i entered this battlemented mansion than a cold chill struck through me as with a sense of some brooding terror  all indeed was elegance all splendour  the arches were hung with tyriandyed curtains  the ornaments on the pale parian mantelpiece were of red bohemian glass  everywhere were crimson couches and sofas  the housekeeper mrs fairfax pointed out to my notice some vases of fine purple spar and on all sides were turkey carpets and large mirrors  elegance of taste and fastidious research of ornament could do no more but what is luxury to the mind ill at ease or can a restless conscience be stilled by red bohemian glass or pale parian mantelpieces  no alas too plainly was this conspicuous when on entering the library we found mr rochesteralone  the envied possessor of all this opulence can be no happy man  he was seated with his head bent on his folded arms and when he looked up a morosealmost a malignantscowl blackened his features  hastily beckoning to the governess who entered with us to follow him he exclaimed oh hang it all in an accent of despair and rushed from the chamber we distinctly heard the doors clanging behind him as he flew  at dinner the same hollow reserve his conversation entirely confined to the governess a miss eyre whose position here your catherine does not understand and to whom i distinctly heard him observe that miss blanche ingram was an extensive armful  the evening was spent in the lugubrious mockery of pretending to consult an old gipsywoman who smoked a short black pipe and was recognised by all as mr rochester in disguise  i was conducted by miss eyre to my bedroomthrough a long passage narrow low and dim with two rows of small black doors all shut twas like a corridor in some blue beards castle  hurry hurry i hear the chains rattling said this strange girl whose position my eleanor in this house causes your catherine some natural perplexity  when we had reached my chamber be silent silent as death said miss eyre her finger on her lip and her meagre body convulsed with some mysterious emotion  speak not of what you hear do not remember what you see and she was gone  i undressed after testing the walls for secret panels and looking for assassins in the usual place but was haunted all the time by an unnatural sound of laughter  at length groping my way to the bed i jumped hastily in and would have sought some suspension of anguish by creeping far underneath the clothes  but even this refuge was denied to your wretched catherine  i could not stretch my limbs for the sheet my dear eleanor had been so arranged in some manner which i do not understand as to render this impossible  the laughter seemed to redouble  i heard a footstep at my door  i hurried on my frock and shawl and crept into the gallery  a strange dark figure was gliding in front of me stooping at each door and every time it stooped came a low gurgling noise  inspired by i know not what desperation of courage i rushed on the figure and seized it by the neck  it was miss eyre the governess filling the boots of all the guests with water which she carried in a can  when she saw me she gave a scream and threw herself against a door hung with a curtain of tyrian dye  it yielded and there poured into the passage a blue cloud of smoke with a strong and odious smell of cigars into which and to what company she vanished  i groped my way as well as i might to my own chamber  where each hour the clocks as they struck found an echo in the apprehensive heart of  the illfated catherine morland    letter  from montague tigg esq to mr david crimp    the following letter needs no explanation for any who have studied the fortunes and admired the style of that celebrated and sanguine financier mr montague tigg in martin chuzzlewit  his chance meeting with the romantic comte de monte cristo naturally suggested to him the plans and hopes which he unfolds to an unsympathetic capitalist   1542 park lane may 27 1848  my premium pomegranateoracles are not in it david with you my pippin as auspicious counsellors of ingenious indigence  the remark which you uttered lately when refusing to make the trumpery advance of halfacrown on a garment which had been near to the illustrious person of my friend chevy slime that remark was inspired  go to holborn you said and the longestbearded of early prophets never uttered aught more pregnant with destiny  i went to holborn to the humble establishment of the tuneful tonsor sweedlepipe  all things come the poet says to him who knows how to waitespecially i may add to him who knows how to wait behind thin partitions with a chink in them  ensconced in such an ambush in fact in the back shopi bided my time intending to solicit pecuniary accommodation from the barber and studying human nature as developed in his customers  there are odd customers in kingsgate street holbornforeign gents and refugees  such a cove my eagle eye detected in a man who entered the shop wearing a long black beard streaked with the snows of age and who requested poll to shave him clean  he was a sailorman to look at but his profile david might have been carved by a grecian chisel out of an iceberg and that steel grey eye of his might have struck a chill even through a chink into any heart less stout than beats behind the vest of montague tigg the task of rasping so hirsute a customer seemed to sit heavy on the soul of poll and threatened to exhaust the resources of his limited establishment  the barber went forth to command as i presume a fresher strop or more keenly tempered steel and glittering cans of water heated to a fiercer heat  no sooner was the coast clear than the streetdoor opened and my stranger was joined by a mantled form that glided into polls emporium  the newcomer doffed a swart sombrero and disclosed historic features that were not unknown to the concealed observermeaning me  yes david that aquiline beak that long and waxed moustache that impassible mask of a face i had seen them sir conspicuous though their owner be of alien and even hostile birth among englands special chivalry  the foremost he had charged on the ides of april i mean against the ungentlemanly chartist throng and in the storied lists of eglinton  the newcomer in short was the nephew of him who ate his heart out in an english gaol like our illustrious chivin fact he was prince louis n b  gliding to the seat where halflathered the more or less ancient mariner awaited polls return the prince muttered in the french lingo familiar to me from long exile in boulogne  hist goes all well  magnificently sire says the other chap  our passages taken  ay and private cabins paid for to boot in case of the storms inclemency  the prince nodded and seemed pleased then he asked anxiously  the bird  you have been to jamrachs  pardon me sire says the man who was waiting to be shaved i can slip from your jesses no mercenary eagle  these limbs have yet the pith to climb and this heart the daring to venture to the airiest crag of monte doro and i have ravished from his eyrie a true corsican eagle to be the omen of our expedition  wherever this eagle is your uncles legions will gather together  tis well and the gold  trust monte cristo says the bearded man and then david begad i knew i had them  we meet  at folkestone pier 745 tidal train  i shall be there without fail says the prince and sneaks out of the streetdoor just as poll comes in with the extra soap and strop  well david to make it as short as i can the man of the icy glance was cleanshaved at last and the mother who bore him would not have known him as he looked in the glass when it was done  he chucked poll a diamond worth about a million piastres and remarking that he would not trouble him for the change he walked out  by this characteristic swagger of course he more than confirmed my belief that he was indeed the celebrated foreigner the count of monte cristo whose name and history even you must be acquainted with though you may not be what i have heard my friend chevy slime call himself the most literary man alive  a desperate follower of the star of austerlitz from his youth a martyr to the cause in the chateau dif monte cristo has not deserted it now that he has come into his ownor anybody elses  of course i was after him like a shot  he walked down kingsgate street and took a fourwheeler that was loitering at the corner  i followed on foot escaping the notice of the police from the fact made only too natural by fortunes cursed spite that under the togalike simplicity of montague tiggs costume these minions merely guessed at a cabtout  well david he led me a long chase  he got out of the four wheeler it was dark now at the travellers throwing the cabman a purseof sequins no doubt  at the door of the travellers he entered a brougham and driving to the french embassy in albert gate he alighted in different togs quite the swell and let himself in with his own latchkey  in fact sir this conspirator of barbers shops this prisoner of the chateau dif this climber of corsican eyries is today the french minister accredited to the court of st jamess  and now perhaps david you begin to see how the land lies the promised land the land where there is corn and milk and honeydew i hold those eminent and highly romantic parties in the hollow of my hand  a letter from me to m lecoq of the rue jerusalem and their little game is up their eagle moults the history of europe is altered  but what good would all that do montague tigg  will it so much as put that delightful coin a golden sovereign in the pocket of his nether garments  no tigg is no informer a man who has charged at the head of his regiment on the coast of africa is no vulgar spy  there is more to be got by making the count pay through

should have known each other  it is a pleasant fancy to me that they may have met on the banks of ouse while john was meditating a sermon and izaak was attentive of his trembling quill   sirbeing now come into the land of beulah here whence i cannot so much as see doubting castle here where i am solaced with the sound of voices from the citymy mind that is now more at peace about mine own salvation misgives me sore about thine  thou wilt remember me perchance for him that met thee by a stream of the delectable mountains and took thee to be a man fleeing from the city of destruction  for beholding thee from afar methought that thou didst carry a burden on thy back even as myself before my deliverance did bear the burden of my sins and fears  yet when i drew near i perceived that it was but a fishermans basket on thy back and that thou didst rather seek to add to the weight of thy burden than to lighten it or fling it away  but when we fell into discourse i marvelled much how thou camest so far upon the way even among the sheep and the shepherds of that country  for i found that thou hadst little experience in conflict with apollyon and that thou hadst never passed through the slough of despond nor wandered in the valley of the shadow  nay thou hadst never so much as been distressed in thy mind with great fear nor hadst thou fled from thy wife and children to save if it might be thy soul for thyself as i have done  nay rather thou didst parley with the shepherds as one that loved their life and i remember even now that sweet carnal song   the shepherd swains shall dance and sing for thy delight each may morning if these delights thy mind may move then live with me and be my love   these are not the songs that fit the delectable country nay rather they are the mirth of wantons  yet didst thou take pleasure in them and therefore i make bold to ask how didst thou flee at all from the city of destruction and come so far upon thy way beware lest when thou winnest to that brook wherein no man casts angle even to that flood where there is no bridge to go over and the river is very deepbeware i say of one vain hope the ferryman  for i would not have thee lost because thou art a kindly man and a simple  yet for ignorance there is an ill way even from the very gates of the citythy fellowtraveller  christian   from piscator to christian   siri do indeed remember thee and i trust thou art amended of these gripings which caused thee to groan and moan even by the pleasant streams from the hills of the delectable mountains  and as for my burden twas pleasant to me to bear it for like not the least of the apostles i am a fisher and i carried trout  but i take no shame in that i am an angler for angling is somewhat like poetry men are to be born so and i would not be otherwise than my maker designed to have me  of the antiquity of angling i could say much but i misdoubt me that thou dost not heed the learning of ancient times but art a contemner of good learning and virtuous recreations  yet it may a little move thee that in the book of job mention is made of fishhooks and without reproof for let me tell you that in the scriptures angling is always taken in the best sense  touching my flight from the city of destruction i love that place no more than thou dost yet i fear not its evil communications nor would i so hastily desert it as to leave my wife and children behind therein  nor have i any experience of conflict with the evil one wherefore i thank him that hath set me in pleasant fields by clear waters where come no wicked whispers be they from apollyon or from our own hearts but there is calmness of spirit and a world of blessings attending upon it  and hence can no man see the towers of doubting castle for the green trees and the hedges white with may  this life is not wholly vile as some of thy friends declare thou who makest thy pilgrims dance to the lute knowest better and for myself i own that i love such mirth as does not make men ashamed to look upon each other next morning  let him that bears a heavy heart for his illdeeds turn him to better but not mourn as though the sun were taken out of the sky  what says the songnay tis as good balm for the soul as many a hymn   a merry heart goes all the day your sad one tires in a milea   he that made the world made man to take delight in it even as thou sawst me joyful with the shepherdsay with godly mr richard hooker he being then tending his small allotment of sheep in a common field as i recount in a brief life of a good man  as to what awaits me on the other side of that river i do expect it with a peaceful heart and in humble hope that a man may reach the city with a cheerful countenance no less than through groans and sighs and fears  for we have not a tyrant over us but a father that loveth a cheerful liver no less than a cheerful giver nevertheless i thank thee for thy kind thought of one that is not of thy company nor no nonconformist but a peaceful protestant and lest thou be troubled with apparitions of hobgoblins and evil spirits read that comfortable sermon of mr hookers to weak believers on the certainty of adherence though they want the inward testimony of it  but now falls there a sweet shower a singing shower saith old george chapman and methinks i shall have sport for i do note that the mayfly is up and seeing all these beautiful creatures playing in the air and water i feel my own heart play within me and i must out and dape under yonder sycamore tree  wherefore prithee pardon me a longer discourse as at this timethy friend  piscator    letter  from truthful james to mr bret harte    william nyes experiment angels  dear bret harte im in tears and the camps in the dust for with anguish it hears as poor william may bust and the last of the nyes is in danger of sleeping the sleep of the just  no revolver it was interfered with his health the convivial glass did not harm him by stealth it was nary  he fell by a scheme which he thought would accumulate wealth  for a moqui came round to the campinjun joe and the dollars was found in his pockets to flow for he played off some tricks with live snakes as was reckoned a competent show  they was rattlers a pair in his teeth he would hold and another hed wear like a scarf to enfold his neck with them dangerous critters as safe as the saint was of old  sez william that same is as easy as wink i am fly to his game for them rattlers i think has had all their incisors extracted theyre harmless as suthin to drink  so he betted his pile he could handle them snakes and he tried with a smile and a rattler he takes feeling safe as theyd somehow been doctored but bless you that sarpent awakes  waken snakes and they did and they rattled like mad for it was not a kid but some medicine he had injun joe for persuadin the critters but williams bit powerful bad  so theyve put him outside of a bottle of rye and theyve set him to ride a mustang as kin shy to keep up his poor circulation and thats the last chance for bill nye  but a near thing it is and the camps in the dust hes a pard as wed miss if poor bill was to bust  if the last of the nyes were asleepin the peaceable sleep of the just    letter  from professor forth to the rev mr casaubon    the delicacy of the domestic matters with which the following correspondence deals cannot be exaggerated  it seems that belinda whose memoirs we owe to miss rhoda broughton was at oxford while mr and mrs casaubon were also resident near that pleasant city so famed for its bodleian library  professor forth and mr casaubon were friends as may be guessed their congenial characters their kindred studies etruscology and mythology combined to ally them  their wives were not wholly absorbed in their learned pursuits and if mr ladislaw was dangling after mrs casaubon we know that mr rivers used to haunt with mrs forth the walks of magdalen  the regret and disapproval which mrs casaubon expresses and her desire to do good to mrs forth are it is believed not alien to her devoted and exemplary character   bradmoreroad oxford may 29  dear mr casaubonin the course of an investigation which my researches into the character of the etruscan involuti have necessitated i frequently encounter the root kad k2ad or qad schnitzlers recent and epochmaking discovery that d in etruscan  b2 has led me to consider it a plausible hypothesis that we may convert kad or qad into kab2 in which case it is by no means beyond the range of a cautious conjecture that the involuti are identical with the cabiri cabiri  though you will pardon me for confessing what you already know that i am not in all points an adherent to your ideas concerning a key to all mythologies at least as briefly set forth by you in kuhns zeitung yet i am deeply impressed with this apparent opportunity of bridging the seemingly impassable gulf between etrurian religion and the comparatively clear and comprehensible systems of the pelasgo phoenician peoples  that kad or kab can refer either as in quatuor to a fourfooted animal quadruped quad or to a four wheeled vehicle esseda celtic cab i cannot for a moment believe though i understand that this theory has the support of schrader penka and baunder 10  any information which your learning can procure and your kind courtesy can supply will be warmly welcomed and duly acknowledgedbelieve me faithfully yours  james forth  psi open this note which was written from my dictation by my secretary mrs forth to assure myself that her inexperience has been guilty of no error in matters of so much delicacy and importance  i have detected no mistake of moment and begin to hope that the important step of matrimony to which i was guided by your example may not have been a rash experiment   from the rev mr casaubon to james forth esq professor of etruscan oxford   dear mr forthyour letter throws considerable light on a topic which has long engaged my earnest attention  to my thinking the cab in cabiri  cav hollow as in cavus and refers to the ark of noah which of course before the entrance of every living thing according to his kind must have been the largest artificial hollow or empty space known to our adamite ancestors  thus the cabiri would answer naturally to the pataeci which as herodotus tells us were usually figured on the prows of ships  the cabiri or pataeci as children of noah and men of the great vessel or cavemen a wonderful anticipation of modern science would perpetuate the memory of arkite circumstances and would be selected as the sacred tradition faded from mens minds as the guides of navigation  i am sorry to seem out of harmony with your ideas but it is only a matter of seeming for i have no doubt that the etruscan involuti are also arkite and that they do not as max muller may be expected to intimate represent the veiled or cloudy dawns but rather the arkite patriarchs  we thus from different startingplaces arrive at the same goal the arkite solution of bryant  i am aware that i am oldfashionedlike eumaeus i dwell here among the swine and go not often to the city  your letters with little numerals as k2 may represent the exactness of modern philology but more closely remind me of the formulae of algebra a study in which i at no time excelled  it is my purpose to visit cambridge on june 3 to listen to a most valuable address by professor tosch of bonn on hittite and aztec affinities  if you can meet me there and accept the hospitality of my college the encounter may prove a turning

ever  d rivers   from mrs casaubon to william ladislaw esq stratfordonavon   dear friendyour kind letter from stratford is indeed interesting  ah when shall i have an opportunity of seeing these and so many other interesting places  but in a world where duty is so much and so always with us why should we regret the voids in our experience which after all life is filling in the experience of others  the work is advancing and mr casaubon hopes that the first chapter of the key to all mythologies will be fairly copied and completed by the end of autumn  mr casaubon is going to cambridge on saturday to hear professor tosch lecture on the pittites and some other party i really forget which 12 but it is not often that he takes so much interest in mere modern history how curious it sometimes is to think that the great spirit of humanity and of the world as you say keeps working its wayah to what wonderful goalby means of these obscure difficult politics  almost unworthy instruments one is tempted to think that was a true line you quoted lately from the vita nuova  we have no books of poetry here except a lithuanian translation of the rig veda  how delightful it must

to each other i may almost call them friends but we have met only once  you did not see me but i was at magdalen a few weeks ago and i could not help asking who you were so young so beautiful and when i saw you so lonely among all those learned men my heart went out to you for i too know what the learned are and how often when we are young we feel as if they were so cold so remote  ah then there come temptations but they must be conqueredwe are not born to live for ourselves only we must learn to live for othersah not for another  some one 13 we both know a lady has spoken to me of you lately she too though you did not know it was in magdalen walk on sunday evening when the bells were chiming and the birds singing  she saw you you were not alone  mr rivers i am informed that is his name was with you  ah stop and think and hear me before it is too late  a word i do not knowa word of mine may be listened to though i have no right to speak  but something forces me to speak and to implore you to remember that it is not for pleasure we live but for duty  we must break the dearest ties if they do not bind us to the stakethe stake of all we owe to all  you will understand you will forgive me will you not  you will forgive another woman whom your beauty and sadness have won to admire and love you  you will break these ties will you not and be free for only in renunciation is

both alike  though the rose be sweet yet will it prove less fragrant if it be wreathed about the skunk and so an ill weed from the land where that beast hath its habitation defileth a courteous knight

maitland 14    that dean maitland should have taken the political line indicated in mr rondelets letter will amaze no reader of the silence of dean maitland  that mr paul rondelet flew from his penny paper to a paradise meet for him is a matter of congratulation to all but his creditors  he really is now in the only true monastery of thelema and is simply dressed in an eyeglass and a cincture of pandanus flowers  the natives worship him and he is the first aesthetic beachcomber   teaiti the pacific  dear maitlandas my old friend and tutor at lothian you ask me to join the oxford home rule association  excuse my delay in answering  your letter was sent to that detested and longdeserted newspaper office in fleet street and from fleet street to tea iti thank heaven it is a long way  were i at home and still endeavouring to sway the masses i might possibly accept your invitation  i dislike crowds and i dislike shouting but if shout i must like you i would choose to chime in with the dingier and the larger and the more violent assembly  but having perceived that the masses were very perceptibly learning to sway themselves i have retired to teaiti  you have read epipsychidion my dear dean  and in your time no doubt you have loved 15   well this is the isle of love described as in a dream by the rapt fancy of shelley  urged perhaps by a reminiscence of the great aryan wave of migration i have moved westward to this paradise like obermann i hide my head from the wild tempest of the age but in a much dearer place than chalets near the alpine snow long ago i said to one who would not listen that all the religions of the world are based on false foundations resting on the family and fatally unsound  here the family in our sense has not been developed  here no rules trammel the best and therefore the most evanescent of our affections  and as for religion it is based upon me on rondelet of lothian  here nobody asks me why or how i am superior  the artless natives at once perceived the fact recognised me as a god and worship me do not shudder my good dean with floral services  in teaiti vain to look for it on the map i have found my placea place far from the babel of your brutal politics a place where i am addressed in liquid accents of adoration  you may ask whether i endeavour to raise the islanders to my own level  it is the last thing that i would attempt  culture they do not need  their dainty hieratic precisions of ritual are a sufficient culture in themselves  as i said once before it is an absurdity to speak of married people being one  here we are an indefinite number and no jealousy no ambitious exclusiveness mars the happiness of all  this is the higher life about which we used ignorantly to talk  here the gross temporal necessities are satisfied with a breadfruit a roasted fish and a few pandanus flowers  the rest is all climate and the affections  conceive my dear dean the undisturbed felicity of life without newspapers  empires may fall perhaps have fallen since i left fleet street alan dunlop may be a ditcher in good earnest on an estate no longer his but here we fleet the time carelessly as in the golden world  and you ask me to join a raucous political association for an object you detest in your heart merely because you want to swim with the turbid democratic current  you are an historian maitland  did you ever know this policy succeed  did you ever know the respectables prosper when they allied themselves with the vulgar  ah keep out of your secondhand revolutions keep your hands clean whether you keep your head on your shoulders or not  you will never i fear be bishop of winkum with all your historical handbooks and all your oxford liberalism  but i am losing my temper for the first time since i discovered teaiti  this must not beyours regretfully  paul rondelet  psdont give any one my address some of these oxford harpies are still unappeased  the only european i have seen was not an university man  he was a popular scotch novelist and carried shorter catechisms which he distributed to my flock  i only hope he wont make copy out of me and my situation  p r

skimpole lead only to cursitor street   coavinss cursitor street may 1  my dear honeymanit is mayday when even the chimneysweeper developing the pleasant unconscious poetry of his nature forgets the flues wreathes the flowers and persuades himself that he is jackinthegreen  jack who  was he jack sprat or the young swain who mated with jill  who knows  the chimneysweeper has all i ask all that the butterflies possess all that commonsense and business and society deny to harold skimpole  he lives he is free he is in the green  i am in coavinss  in cursitor street i cannot hear the streams warble the birds chant the music roll through the stately fane let us say of lady whittleseas coavinss as coavinss man says is a ouse but how unlike for example the hospitable home of our friend jarndyce  i can sketch coavinss but i cannot alter it  i can set it to music on coavinss piano but how melancholy are the jingling strains of that dilapidated instrument  at jarndyces house when i am there i am in possession of it  here coavinss is in possession of me of the person of harold skimpole  and why am i here  why am i far from landscape music conversation  why merely because i will follow neither fame nor fortune nor faith  they call to us in the marketplace but i will not dance  fame blows her trumpet and offers her shilling the queens  faith peals her bells and asks for my shilling fortune rattles her bankingscales  they call and the world joins the waltz but i will not march with them  go after glory commerce creeds i cry only let harold skimpole live 16 the world pursues the jangling music but in my ear sound the pipes of pan the voices of the river and the wood  yet i cannot be in the playground whither they invite me  harold skimpole is fetteredby what  by items  i regret my incapacity for details  it may be the tinker or the tailor at whose suit i am detained  i am certain it is not at that of the soldier or the sailor or the ploughboy or the thief  but for the apothecary why yesit may be the apothecary  in the dawn of life i loved who has noti wedded  i set about surrounding myself with rosy cheeks  these cheeks grow pallid  i call for the aid of science science sends in her bill  to the mixture as before so much to the tonic so much  the cheeks are rosy again  i pour forth the blessings of a fathers heart but there stands science inexorable with her bill her items  i vainly point out that the mixture has played its part the tonic has played its part and that in the nature of things the transaction is ended  the bill is unappeasable  i forget the details a certain number of pieces of yellow and white dross are spoken of  ah i see it is fifteen and some odd shillings and coppers  let us say twenty  my dear honeyman you who as i hear are about to follow the flutes of aphrodite into a temple where hymen gilds the horns of the victims 17you i am sure will hurry to my rescue  you may not have the specie actually in your coffers but with your prospects surely you can sign something or make over something or back something say a post obit or post vincula or employ some other instrument  excuse my inexperience or i should say excuse my

had providence placed it within my power to relieve your distress  but it cannot be  like the carthaginian queen of whom we read in happier days at dear old borhambury i may say that i am haud ignarus mali  but alas the very evils in which i am not unlearned make it impossible for me to add miseris succurrere disco  rather am i myself in need of succour  you my dear harold have fallen among thieves i may too truly add that in this i am your neighbour  the dens in which we are lodged are contiguous we are separated only by the bars  your note was sent on hither from my rooms in walpole street  since we met i have known the utmost that womans perfidy and the rich mans contumely can inflict  but i can bear my punishment  i loved i trusted  she to whose hand i aspired she on whose affections i had based hopes at once of happiness in life and of extended usefulness in the clerical profession she was less confiding  she summoned to her council a minion of the law one briggs  his estimate of my position and prospects could not possibly tally with that of one whose hopes are not set where the worldling places them  let him and such as he take thought for the morrow and chaffer about

agreez monsieur mes sentiments les plus distingues  miss harriet    letter  from s gandish esq to the newcome independent    the royal academy  it appears that mr gandish at a great agethough he was not older than several industrious academicanswithdrew from the active exercise of his art and employed his learning and experience as art critic of the newcome independent  the following critique appears to show traces of declining mental vigour in the veteran gandish   our great gallery has once more opened her doors if not to the public nor even to the fashionable elite at least to the critics they are a motley throng who lounge on press days in the sumptuous halls ladies small boys clergymen are there and among them but few perhaps who have received the training in high art of your correspondent and have had their eye through a lifetime more than commonly prolonged on the glorious antique  and what shall we say of the present academy  in some ways things have improved a little since my boadishia came back on my hands 1839 at a time when high art and the antique would not do in this country  they would not do  as far as the new exhibition shows they do better now than when the century was younger and portrait of the artist by s gandishat thirtythree years of agewas offered in vain to the jealously papist clique who then controlled the uffizi foreigners are more affable now they have taken mr poynters of himself  to return to the antique what the presidents captive andromache must have cost in models alone is difficult to reckon  when times were cheaper fifty years since my ancient britons in boadishia stood me in thirty pounds  the central figures however were members of my own family  to give every one his due andromache is high artyes it is highand the antique has not been overlooked  about the backview of the young party at the fountain mr horsley may have something to say  for my part there seems a want of muscle in vigorous action  where are the biceps where are the thews of michael angelo  the president is a touch too quiet for a taste framed in the best schools  as to his colour where is that nutty brown tone of the flesh  but the designs on the greek vase are carefully rendered though i have heard it remarked by a classical scholar that these kind of vases were not in use about homers time  still the intention is good though the costumes are not what we should have called ancient roman when the president was a boyay or earlier  then mr almatadema he has not turned his back on the glorious antique  the roses of heliogabalus are not explained in the catalogue  as far as i understand there has been an earthquake at a banquet of this unprincipled monarch  the king himself and his friends are safe enough at a kind of high table though which is heliogabalus he being a consumptivelooking character in his coins in the classical dictionary your critic has not made out  the earth having opened down below the heads of some women and of a man with a beard and his hair done up like a girl are tossing about in a quantity of roseleaves which had doubtless been strown on the floor as martial tells us was the custom dum regnat rosa so i overheard a very erudite critic remarking  the composition of the piece would be thus accounted for but i cannot pretend that mr tadema reminds one of either poussin or annibale carracci however rumour whispers that a high price has been paid for this curious performance  to my thinking the friends of heliogabalus are a little flat and leathery in the handling of the flesh  the silver work and the marble will please admirers of this eccentric artist but i can hardly call the whole effect high  but mr armitages siren will console people who remember the old school this beautiful girl somewhat careless in her attitude though she has been sensible enough not to sit down on the damp rock without putting her drapery beneath her would have been a true gem in one of the old books of beauty such as the honourable percy popjoy and my old friend miss bunnion used to contribute to in the palmy days of the english school  mr armitages juno standing in midair with the moon in the neighbourhood is also an example to youth and very unlike the way such things are generally done now mr burnejones who does not exhibit never did anything like this  poor haydon with whom i have smoked many a pipe would have acknowledged that mr goodalls davids promise to bathsheba and by the sea of galilee prove that his aspirations are nearly fulfilled  these are extremely large pictures yet well hung  the figure of abishag is a little too much in the french taste for an oldfashioned painter  ars longa nuda veritas  i hope and so will the liberal readers of the newcome independent that it is by an accident the catalogue readsthe traitor  earl spencer kg  the moonlighters  nos 220 221 225  some tory wag among the hanging committee may have taken this juxtaposition for wit  our readers will adopt a different view  there is a fine dog in mr briton rivieres requiescat but how did the relations of the dead knight in plate armour acquire the embroidery at least three centuries later on which he is laid to his last repose  this destroys the illusion but does not diminish the pathos in the attitude of the faithful hound  mr longs large picture appears to exhibit an oriental girl being tried by a jury of matronsat least not having my diodorus scriblerus by me i can arrive at no other conclusion  from the number of models engaged this picture must have been designed quite regardless of expense  it is a study of the antique but i doubt if smee would have called it high art  speaking of smee reminds me of portraits  i miss portrait of a lady portrait of a gentleman the names of the sitters are now always givena concession to the notorietyhunting proclivities of the present period  few portraits are more in the style of the palmy days of our school just after lawrence than a study of a lady by mr goodall 687  on the other hand young mr richmond goes back to the antiquated manner of reynolds in one of his representations  i must admit that i hear this work much admired by many to me it seems oldfashioned and lacking in blandness and affability  mr waterhouse has a study of a subject from a poem that mr pendennis the novelist whom i knew well was very fond of when he first came on the town  the lady of shalott  it represents a very delicate invalid in a boat under a counterpane i remember the poem ran it was by young mr tennyson   they crossed themselves their stars they blest knight minstrel abbot squire and guest there lay a parchment on her breast that puzzled more than all the rest the wellfed wits of camelot the web was woven curiously the charm is broken utterly draw near and fear not this is i the lady of shalott   i admit that the wonder and dismay of the wellfed wits if the lady was like mr waterhouses picture of her do not surprise me but i confess i do not understand modern poetry nor perhaps modern painting  where is historical art  where is alfred and the cakea subject which as is well known i discovered in my researches in history  where is udolpho in the tower or the duke of rothsay the fourth day after he was deprived of his victuals  or king john signing magna charta  they are gone with the red curtain the brown tree the storm in the background art is revolutionary like everything else in these times when treason itself in the form of a hoary apostate and reviewer of contemporary fiction glares from the walls and is painted by royalmark royalacademicians      from thomas potts esq of the newcome independent to s gandish esq newcome may 3   my dear siri am truly sorry to have to interrupt a connection with so old and respected a contributor  but i think you will acknowledge on reading the proof of your article on the academy which i enclose that the time has arrived when public criticism is no longer your province  i do not so much refer to the old fashioned tone of your observations on modern art  i know little about it and care not much more  but you have entirely forgotten towards the end of the notice that the newcome independent as becomes its name is a journal of liberty and progress  the very proper remarks on lord spencers portrait elsewhere show that you are not unacquainted with our politics but at the close expressing i fear your true sentiments you glide into language which makes me shudder and which if printed in the independent would spell ruin  send it by all means to the sentinel if you like  send your tory views i mean  as for your quotation from the lady of shalott i can find it nowhere in the poem of that name by the author you strangely style young mr tennyson 20  i enclose a cheque for a quarters salary and while always happy to meet you as man with man must get the notice of the academy written up in the office from the daily telegraph standard and times 21faithfully and with deep regret yours  thomas potts    letter  from monsieur lecoq rue jerusalem paris to inspector bucket scotland yard    this correspondence appears to prove that mistakes may be made by the most astute officers of police and that even so manifest a briton as mr pickwick might chance to find himself in the toils of international conspiracy   translated  may 19 1852  sir and dear fellowbrother confrerethe so cordial understanding between our countries ought to expand itself into a community of the political police  but the just susceptibilities of the old england forbid at this moment the restoration to a friendly power of political offenders  in the name of the french police of surety i venture to present to the famous officer bucket a prayer that he will shut his eyes for once on the letter and open his heart to the spirit of the laws  no one needs to teach monsieur bucket that a foreign miscreant can be given up under all reserves to the justice  a small vial of a harmless soporific a closed carriage a private cabin on board a channel steamerwith these and a little of the adroitness so remarked in the celebrated bucket the affair is in the bag dans le sac  all these things are in the cords dans les cordes of my esteemed english fellowbrother will he not employ them in the interest of a devoted colleague and a friendly administration  we seek a malefactor of the worst species un chenapan de la pire espece  this funny fellow drole calls himself count of fosco and he resides in wood road 5 st johns forest worth abode of a miscreant fit for the forest of bondy  he is a man bald stout fair and paying well in countenance il paie de mine conceiving himself to resemble the great napoleon  at the first sight you would say a philanthrope a friend of man  on his right arm he bears a small red mark round the brand of a society of the most dangerous  dear sir you will not miss him  when once he is in our hands faith of lecoq you shall tell us your news as to whether france can be grateful  of more words there is no needi remain all to you with the assurance of my most distinguished consideration  lecoq   from inspector bucket to m lecoq may 22   dear siryour polite favour to hand and contents noted  you are a man of the world i am a man of the world and proud to deal with you as between man and man  the little irregularity shall be no consideration all shall be squared and the man wanted run in with punctuality and despatch  expect him at calais on the 26th currentfaithfully yours  c bucket   from count fosco to samuel pickwick esq gcmpc goswell road 5 forest road st johns wood may 23   dear sirwhen we met lately at the hospitable board of our common friend benjamin allen esq lately elected professor of chemistry in the university of london our conversation turned if you can pass me the intoxicating favour of remembering it on the glorious science of chemistry  for me this knowledge has ever possessed irresistible attractions from the enormous power which it confers of heaping benefits on the suffering race of mankind  others may rejoice in the advantages which a knowledge of it bestowsthe power which can reduce a hannibal to the level of a drummer boy or an allpervading shakspeare to the intellectual estate of a vestryman though it cannot at present reverse those processes the consideration of the destructive as compared with the constructive forces of chemistry was present as i recollect to your powerful intellect on the festive occasion to which i refer yes you said permit me to repeat your very wordsyes count fosco alexanders morning draught shall make alexander run for his life at the first sound of the enemys trumpet  so much chemistry can achieve but can she help as well as harm  nay can she answer for it that the lemon which professor allen from the best and purest of motives has blended with this milkpunch shall not disagree with me tomorrow morning  can chemistry count fosco thus thwart malign constitutional tendency  these were your words sir and i am now ready to answer your deep searching question in the affirmative  prolonged assiduous application to my art has shown me how to preserve the lemon in milk punch and yet destroy or disengage the deleterious elements  will you so greatly honour science and fosco her servant as to sup with me on the night of the twentyfifth at nine oclock and prove you need not dread the test whether a true follower of knowledge or a vain babbler signsin exilethe name of  isidor ottavio baldassare fosco   from mr pickwick to the count fosco may 24   my dear sirmany thanks for your very kind invitation  apart from the interests of science the pleasure of your company alone would be more than enough to make me gladly accept it  i shall have the enjoyment of testing your milkpunch tomorrow night at nine with the confident expectation that your admirable studies will have overcome a tendency which for many years has prevented me from relishing as i could wish one of the best things in this good world  lemon in fact has always disagreed with me as professor allen or sir robert sawyer will be able to assure you so your valuable experiment can be put in my case to a crucial testvery faithfully yours  samuel pickwick   from inspector bucket to m lecoq may 26 1 am   my dear sirwe have taken your man without difficulty  bald benevolentlooking stout perhaps fancies himself like napoleon if so is deceived  we nabbed him asleep over his liquor and alone at the address you meant to give 5 forest road st johns wood  the house was empty servants out not a soul but him at home  he speaks english well for a foreigner and tries to make out he is a british subject  was rather confused when took and kept ejaculating cold punch apparently with the hope of persuading us that such was his name or alias  he also called for one samprobably an accomplice  he travels to calais today as a lunatic patient in a straitwaistcoat under charge of four keepers belonging to the force and i trust that you have made preparations for receiving your prisoner and that our management of the case has given satisfaction  what i like is doing business with a man like you  we may not be so smart nor so clever at disguises as the french profession but we flatter ourselves we are punctual and cautiousfaithfully yours  c bucket   from mr pickwick to mr perker solicitor grays inn sainte pelagie may 28   dear perkerfor heavens sake come over here at once bringing some one who can speak french and bail me out or whatever the process of their law may be  i have been arrested illegally and without warrant at the house of a scientific friend count fosco where i had been supping  as far as i can understand i am accused of a plot against the life of the emperor of the french but the whole proceedings have been unintelligible and arbitrary to a degree  i cannot think that an english citizen will be allowed to perish by the guillotineinnocent and practically unheard  please bring linen and brushes c but not sam who would be certain to embroil himself with the french police  i am writing to the times and lord palmerstonsincerely yours  samuel pickwick   from monsieur lecoq to inspector bucket may 27   sirthere has arrived a frightful misunderstanding  the man you have sent us is not fosco  of fosco he has only the baldness the air benevolent and the girth  the brand on his right arm is no more than the mark of vaccination  brought before the commissary of police the prisoner who has not one word of french was heard through an interpreter  he gives himself the name of piquouique rentier english and he appeals to his ambassador  of papers he had letters bearing the name samuel pickwick and on his buttons the letters pc which we suspect are the badge of a secret society  but this is not to the point for it is certain that whatever the crimes of this brigand he is not fosco but an englishman  that he should be found in the domicile of fosco when that droll had evaded is suspicious louche and his explanation does not permit itself to be understood  i have fear that we enjoy bad luck and that m palmerston will make himself to be heard on this matter  accept monsieur the assurance of my high consideration  lecoq  psour comrade the count smorltork of the police of manners police des moeurs has come to present himself  confronted with the bandit he gives him reason and offers his faith that the man is piquouique with whom he encountered himself when on a mission of secrecy to england it is now some years  what to do  que faire    letter  from mr allan quatermain to sir henry curtis    mr quatermain offers the correct account of two celebrated right and left shots also an adventure of the stranger in the story of an african farm   dear curtisyou ask me to give you the true account in writing of those right and left shots of mine at the two lions the crocodile and the eagle  the brutes are stuffed now in the hall at homethe lions each on a pedestal and the alligator on the floor with the eagle in his jawsmuch as they were when i settled them and saved the stranger  all sorts of stories have got into the papers about the business which was simple enough so though no hand with a pen i may as well write it all out  i was up on the knobkerry river prospecting for diamonds in omomborombungas country  i had nobody with me but poor jimjim who afterwards met with an awful death otherwise he would have been glad to corroborate my tale if it needed it  one night i had come back tired to camp when i found a stranger sitting by the fire  he was a dark fat frenchified little chap and you wont believe me but it is a fact that he wore gloves  i asked him to stay the night of course and inspanned the waggons in laager for omomborombungas impis were out swearing to wash their spears in the blood of the great white liara portuguese traveller probably if not i dont know who he can have been perhaps this stranger he gave no name  well we had our biltong together and the stranger put himself outside a good deal of the very little brandy i had left  we got yarning so to speak and i told him a few of the curious adventures that naturally fall to the lot of a man in those wild countries  the stranger did not say much but kept playing with a huge carved walkingstick that he had  presently he said look at this stick i bought it from a boy on a south african farm  do you understand what the carvings mean  hanged if i do i said after turning it about  well do you see that figure and he touched a thing like a noah out of a childs ark  that was a hunter like you my friend but not in all respects  that hunter pursued a vast white bird with silver wings sailing in the everlasting blue  everlasting bosh said i there is no bird of the kind on the veldt  that bird was truth says the stranger and judging from the anecdote you tell me about the babyan woman and the zulu medicine man it is a bird you dont trouble yourself with much my friend  this was a pretty cool thing to say to a man whose veracity is known like a proverb from shebas breasts to the zambesi  foide macumazahn the zulus say meaning as true as a yarn of allan quatermains  well my blood was up no man shall call allan quatermain a liar  the fellow was going on with a prodigious palaver about a white feather of truth and mount sinai and the land of absolute negation and i dont know what but i signified to him that if he did not believe my yarns i did not want his company  im sorry to turn you out i said for there are lions aroundindeed they were roaring to each otherand you will have a parroty time  but you apologise or you go  he laughed his short thick laugh  i am a man who hopes nothing feels nothing fears nothing and believes nothing that you tell me  i got up and went for him with my fists and whether he feared nothing or not i dont know but he scooted dropping a yellow french novel by one catulle mendes that i could make neither head nor tail of  i afterwards heard that there was something about this stranger in a book called the story of an african farm which i once began but never finished not being able to understand most of it and being vexed by the gross improbability of the girl not marrying the babys father he being ready and willing to make her an honest woman  however i am no critic but a plain man who tells a plain tale and i believe persons of soul admire the book very much  any way it does not say who the stranger wasan allegorical kind of bagman i fancy but i am not done with him yet  out he went into the dark where hundreds of lions could be plainly seen making love at which season they are very dangerous by the flashes of lightning  it was a terrific yet beautiful spectacle and one which i can never forget  the black of night would suddenly open like a huge silver flower deep within deep till you almost fancied you could see within the gates of heaven  the hills stood out dark against the illimitable splendour and on every koppie you saw the huge lions like kittens at play roaring till you could scarcely hear the thunder  the rain was rushing like a river all glittering like diamonds and then in the twinkling of an eye all was black as a wolfs mouth till the next flash  the lightning coming from all quarters appeared to meet above me and now was red now golden now silver again while the great catlike beasts as they leaped or lay looked like gold red and silver lions reminding me of the signs of publichouses in old england far away meantime the donga beneath roared with the flooded torrent that the rain was bringing down from the heights of umbopobekatanktshiu  i stood watching the grand spectacle for some time rather pitying the stranger who was out in it by no fault of mine  then i knocked the ashes out of my pipe ate a mealy or two and crept into my kartel 22 and slept the sleep of the just  about dawn i woke  the thunder had rolled away like a bad dream the long level silver shafts of the dawn were flooding the heights raindrops glittered like diamonds on every kopje and karroo bush leaving the deep donga bathed in the solemn pall of mysterious night  my thoughts went rapidly over the millions of leagues of land and sea where life that perpetual problem was now awaking to another day of struggle and temptation  then the golden arrows of the day followed fast  the silver and blue sky grew roseate with that wide wild blush which testifies to the modest delight of nature satisfied and grateful for her silent existence and her amorous repose  i breakfasted went down into the donga with a black boy poor jimjim who was afterwards as i said to perish by an awful fate otherwise he would testify to the truth of my plain story  i began poking among the rocks in the dry basin of the donga 23 and had just picked up a pebblei knew it by the soapy feel for a diamond  uncut it was about three times the size of the kohi noor say 1000 carats and i was rejoicing in my luck when i heard the scream of a human being in the last agony of terror  looking up i saw that on either side of the donga which was about twenty feet wide a great black lion and lioness were standing with open jaws while some fifty yards in front of me an alligator in a deep pool of the flooded donga was stretching his open snout and gleaming teeth greedily upwards  over head flew an eagle and in midair between as i am a living and honourable man a human being was leaping the chasm  he had been pursued by the lion on my left and had been driven to attempt the terrible leap but if he crossed he was certain to fall into the jaws of the lion on my right while if he fell short in his jump do you see the alligator was ready for him below and the great golden eagle watched the business from above in case he attempted to escape that way  all this takes long to tell though it was passing in a flash of time  dropping the diamond which must have rolled into a crevice of the rock for i never saw it again i caught up my double barrelled rifle one of wesson  smiths aimed at the lion on the right hand of the donga with my right barrel and then hastily fired my left at the alligator  when the smoke cleared away the man had reached the right side of the donga safe and sound  seeing that the alligator was dying i loaded again bowled over the lioness on the left settled the eagles business he fell dead into the jaws of the dying alligator which closed on him with a snap  i then climbed the wall of the donga and there lay fainting the stranger of last nightthe man who feared nothing the blood of the dead lion trickling over him  his celebrated allegorical walkingstick from the african farm had been broken into two pieces by the bullet after it the bullet had passed through the head of the lion  and as the ingoldsby legends say nobody was one penny the worse except the wild beasts  the man however had had a parroty time and it was a good hour before i could bring him round during which he finished my brandy  he still wore gloves  what he was doing in omuborumbungas country i do not know to this day  i never found the diamond again though i hunted long  but i must say that two better right and left shots considering that i had no time to aim and that they were really snapshots i never remember to have made in my long experience  this is the short and the long of the matter which was talked of a good deal in the colony and about which i am told some inaccurate accounts have got into the newspapers  i hate writing as you know and dont pretend to give a literary colour to this little business of the shots but merely tell a plain unvarnished tale as the ingoldsby legends say  as to the stranger what he was doing there or who he was or where he is now i can tell you nothing  he told me he was bound for the almighty mountains of dryfacts and realities which he kindly pointed out to me among the carvings of his walkingstick he then sighed wearily very wearily and scooted  i think he came to no good but he never came in my way again  and now you know the yarn of the two stuffed lions and the alligator with the eagle in his jaws  ever yours allan quatermain    letter  from the baron bradwardine to edward waverley esq of waverley honour    the baron explains the mysterious circumstances of his affair with his third cousin sir hew halbertwaverley chap xiv   tully veolan may 17 1747  son edwardtouching my quarrel with sir hew halbert anent which i told you no more than that it was settled in a fitting manner you have long teased me for an ampler explanation  this i have withheld as conceiving that it tended rather to vain quolibets and jesting than to that respect in which the duello or single combat should be regarded by gentlemen of name and coat armour but sir hew being dead and buried with his fathers the matter may be broached as among friends and persons of honour  the ground of our dispute as ye know was an unthinking scoff of sir hews he being my own third cousin by the mothers side anderson of ettrick hall having intermarried about the time of the solemn league and covenant with anderson of tushielaw both of which houses are connected with the halberts of dinniewuddie and with the bradwardines  but stemmata quid faciunt  sir hew being a young man and the maut as the vulgar say above the meal after a funeral of one of our kin in the cathedral kirkyard of st andrews we met at glasss inn where in the presence of many gentlemen occurred our unfortunate dissension  we encountered betimes next morning on a secluded spot of the sands hard by the town at the edenmouth 24  the weapons were pistols sir hew by a slight passing infirmity being disabled from the use of the sword  inchgrabbit was my second and strathtyrum did the same office for my kinsman sir hew  the pistols being charged and primed and we aligned forenent each other at the convenient distance of twelve paces the word was given to fire and both weapons having been discharged and the smoke having cleared away sir hew was discovered fallen to the ground procumbus humi and exanimate  the blood was flowing freely from a facewound and my unhappy kinsman was senseless  at this moment we heard a voice as of one clamantis in eremo cry fore to which paying no heed in the natural agitation of our spirits we hurried to lift my fallen opponent and examine his wound  upon a closer search it proved to be no shotwound but a mere clour or bruise whereof the reason was now apparent he having been struck by the ball of a golfer from us concealed by the dunes or bunkers of sand and not by the discharge of my weapon  at this moment a plebeian fellow appeared with his arma campestria or clubs cleeks irons and the like under his arm who without paying any attention to our situation struck the ball wherewith he had felled my kinsman in the direction of the hole reflection directed us to the conclusion that both pistols had missed their aim and that sir hew had fallen beneath a chance blow from this fellows golfball  but as my kinsman was still hors de combat and incapable of further action being unwitting too of the real cause of his disaster inchgrabbit and strathtyrum in their discretion as seconds or belli judices deemed it better that we should keep a still sough and that sir hew should never be informed concerning the cause of his discomfiture  this resolution we kept and sir hew wore till the day of his late lamented decease a bullet among the seals of his watch he being persuaded by strathtyrum that it had been extracted from his brainpan which certainly was of the thickest  but this was all a bam or bite among young men and a splore to laugh over by our three selves nor would i have it to go abroad now that sir hew is dead as being prejudicial to the memory of a worthy man and an honourable family connected with our own  wherefore i pray you keep a still sough hereanent as you love me who remainyour loving good father  bradwardine    appendix    note on letter of mr surtees to mr jonathan oldbuck p 64   no literary forgeries were ever much better done than the sham ballads which surtees of mainsforth imposed on sir walter scott the poems were spirited and good of their kind and though we wonder now that some of them could take in an expert it is by no means assured that we are even today acquainted with the whole of surtees frauds  why a man otherwise honourable kindly charitable and learned exercised his ingenuity so cruelly upon a trusting correspondent and a staunch friend it is hardly possible to guess  the biographers of surtees maintain that he wanted to try his skill on scott then only known to him by correspondence and that having succeeded he was afraid to risk scotts friendship by a confession  this is plausible and if good may come out of evil we may remember that two picturesque parts of marmion are due to one confessed and another certain supercherie of surtees  it cannot be said in his defence that he had no conception of the mischief of literary frauds in more than one passage of his correspondence he mentions ritsons detestation of these practices  to literary imposition as tending to obscure the path of inquiry ritson gave no quarter says this arch literary impostor  a brief account of surtees labour in the field of sham ballad writing may be fresh to many people who merely know him as the real author of barthrams dirge and of the slaying of anthony featherstonhaugh  in an undated letter of 1806 scott writing from ashestiel thanks surtees for his obliging communications surtees manifestly began the correspondence being attracted by the border minstrelsy  thus it appears that surtees did not forge hobbie noble in the first edition of the minstrelsy for he makes some suggestions as to the earl of whitfield dreaded by the hero of that ballad which scott had already published  but he was already deceiving scott who writes to him about ralph eure or lord eure and about a goth who melted lord eures gold chain  this lord eure is doubtless the lord eurie of the ballad in the later editions of the border minstrelsy a ballad actually composed by surtees  that wily person immediately sent scott a ballad on the feud between the ridleys and featherstones in which scott believed to the day of his death  he introduced it in marmion   the whiles a northern harper rude chaunted a rhyme of deadly feud how the fierce thirlwalls and ridleys all c   in his note border minstrelsy second edition 1808 p xxi scott says the ballad was taken down from an old womans recitation at the alston moor leadmines by the agent there and sent by him to surtees  consequently when surtees saw marmion in print he had to ask scott not to print the agent as he does not know even the name of colonel beaumonts chief agent there but an agent thus he hedged himself from a not impossible disclaimer by the agent at the mines  readers of marmion will remember how   once near norham there did fight a spectre fell of fiendish might in likeness of a scottish knight with brian bulmer bold and trained him nigh to disallow the aid of his baptismal vow   this legend is more of surtees fun  the most singular tale of this kind says sir walter is contained in an extract communicated to me by my friend mr surtees of mainsforth who copied it from a ms note in a copy of burthogge on the nature of spirits 1694 8vo which had been the property of the late mr gill  it was not in mr gills own hand  but probably an hundred years older and was said to be e libro convent  dunelm per t c extract this t c being thomas cradocke esq  scott adds that the passage which he gives in the latin suggested the introduction of the tourney with the fairy knight in marmion well where is cradockes extract  the original was lost before surtees sent his copy to sir walter  the notes had been carelessly or injudiciously shaken out of the book  surtees adds another editor confirms it that no such story exists in any ms of the dean and chapter of durham  no doubt he invented the whole story and wrote it himself in mediaeval latin  not content with two whoppers as mr jo gargery might call them surtees goes on to invent a perfectly incredible heraldic bearing he found it in a ms note in the gwillims heraldry of mr gyll or gillthe name is written both ways  he beareth per pale or and arg over all a spectre passant shrouded sablehe being newton of beverley in yorkshire  sir walter actually swallowed this amazing fib and alludes to it in rob roy 1818  but mr raine the editor of surtees life inherited or bought his copy of gwillim that of mr gill or gyll and i find in it no trace of such an entry  lord derwentwaters goodnight is probably entirely by surtees  a friend of mr taylors gave him a tynedale ballad hey willy ridley winna you stay which is also aut diabolus aut robertus  as to barthrams dirge from ann douglas a withered crone who weeds my garden copies with various tentative verses in surtees hand have been found  oddly enough sir walter had once discovered a small sepulchral cross upset in liddesdale near the nine stane rig and this probably made him more easily deceived  surtees very cleverly put some lines which could not have been original in brackets as his own attempt to fill up lacunae  such are   when the dew fell cold and still when the aspen grey forget to play and the mist clung to the hill   any one reading the piece would say it must be genuine for the confessed interpolations are not in the ballad style which the interpolator therefore could not write  an attempt which surtees made when composing the song and which he wisely rejected could not have failed to excite scotts suspicions  it ran    they buried him when the bonny may was on the flowring thorn and she waked him till the forest grey of every leaf was lorn  till the rowan tree of gramarye its scarlet clusters shed and the hollin green alone was seen with its berries glistening red   whether surtees brown man of the muirs to which scott also gave a place in his own poetry was a true legend or not the reader may decide for himself  concerning another ballad in the minstrelsyauld maitland professor child has expressed a suspicion which most readers feel what scott told ellis about it autumn 1802 was that he got it in the forest copied down from the recitation of an old shepherd by a country farmer  who was the farmer  will laidlaw had employed james hogg as shepherd  hoggs mother chanted auld maitland  hogg first met scott in the summer of 1801  the shepherd had already seen the first volume of the minstrelsy did he thereupon write auld maitland teach his mother it and induce laidlaw to take it down from her recitation  the old lady said she got it from andrew moir who had it frae auld baby mettlin who was said to have been another nor a gude ane  but we have hoggs own statement that aiblins ma granmither was an unco leear and this quality may have been hereditary  on the other side hogg could hardly have held his tongue about the forgery if forgery it was when he wrote his domestic manners and private life of sir walter scott 1834  the whole investigation is a little depressing and makes one very shy of unauthenticated ballads    footnotes  1  who knows what may happen  i may die before he sees the light so i will add among my friends

petrie has just discovered and sent to mr holly of trinity cambridge the wellknown traveller a wallpainting of a beautiful woman excavated by the egypt exploration society from the ruined site of the temple of aphrodite in naucratis  mr holly in an affecting letter to the academy states that he recognises in this picture an admirable though somewhat archaic portrait of she  there can thus be little or no doubt that she was rhodopis and therefore several hundred years older than she said  but few will blame her for being anxious not to claim her full age  this unexpected revelation appears to throw light on some fascinating peculiarities in the behaviour of she  6  the great intimacy between mrs proudie and mrs quiverful indicated by mrs proudies use of the bishops christian nameand that abbreviatedhas amazed the discoverer and editor of her correspondence  7  this signature of mrs proudies is so unusual an assumption of the episcopal style that it might well cast a doubt on the authenticity of her letter  but experts pronounce it genuine barnum of course is baronum castrum the rather odd roman name of barchester  8  it has been seen that mrs quiverful did not obey this injunction  9  this man was well known to sir walter scott who speaks of his curious habits in an unpublished manuscript  10  mr forth we are sure is quite wrong and none of the scholars he quotes has said anything of the kind  11  he clearly means not addison but professor forth the ladys husband  12  it was not asiatics but aztecs not pittites but hittites woman cares little for these studiesal
