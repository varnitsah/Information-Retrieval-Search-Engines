46538728	illustration elizabeth barrett browning     the letters of elizabeth barrett browning   edited with biographical additions by frederic g kenyon  with portraits   in two volumes  volume i  third edition   1898     preface   the writer of any narrative of mrs brownings life or the editor of a collection of her letters is met at the outset of his task by the knowledge that both mrs browning herself and her husband more than once expressed their strong dislike of any such publicity in regard to matters of a personal and private character affecting themselves the fact that expressions to this effect are publicly extant is one which has to be faced or evaded but if it could not be fairly faced and the apparent difficulty removed the present volumes would never have seen the light it would be a poor qualification for the task of preparing a record of mrs brownings life to be willing therein to do violence to her own expressed wishes and those of her husband but the expressions to which reference has been made are limited either formally or by implication to publications made during their own lifetime they shrank as any sensitive person must shrink from seeing their private lives their personal characteristics above all their sorrows and bereavements offered to the inspection and criticism of the general public and it was to such publications that their protests referred they could not but be aware that the details of their lives would be of interest to the public which read and admired their works and there is evidence that they recognised that the public has some claims with regard to writers who have appealed to and partly lived by its favour they only claimed that during their own lifetime their feelings should be consulted first when they should have passed away the rights of the public would begin  it is in this spirit that the following collection of mrs brownings letters has now been prepared in the conviction that the lovers of english literature will be glad to make a closer and more intimate acquaintance with oneor it may truthfully be said with twoof the most interesting literary characters of the victorian age it is a selection from a large mass of letters written at all periods in mrs brownings life which mr browning after his wifes death reclaimed from the friends to whom they had been written or from their representatives no doubt mr brownings primary object was to prevent publications which would have been excessively distressing to his feelings but the letters when once thus collected were not destroyed as was the case with many of his own letters but carefully preserved and so passed into the possession of his son mr r barrett browning with whose consent they are now published in this collection are comprised the letters to miss browning the poets sister whose consent has also been freely given to the publication mr hs boyd mrs martin miss mitford mrs jameson mr john kenyon mr chorley miss blagden miss haworth and miss thomson madame emil braun1 to these have been added a number of letters which have been kindly lent by their possessors for the purpose of the present volumes  footnote 1 mrs sutherlandorr had access to these letters for her biography of robert browning and quotes several passages from them with this exception none of the letters have been published previously and the published letters of miss barrett to mr rh horne have not been drawn upon except for biographical information   the duties of the editor have been mainly those of selection and arrangement with regard to the former task one word is necessary it may be thought that the almost entire absence of bitterness except on certain political topics of controversy of personal ill feeling of any kind is due to editorial excisions this is not the case the number of passages that have been removed for fear of hurting the feelings of persons still living is almost infinitesimal and in these the cause of offence is always something inherent in the facts recorded not in the spirit in which they are mentioned no person had less animosity than mrs browning it seems as though she could hardly bring herself to speak harshly of anyone the omissions that have been made are almost wholly of passages containing little or nothing of interest or repetitions of what has been said elsewhere and they have been made with the object of diminishing the bulk and concentrating the interest of the collection never with the purpose of modifying the representation of the writers character  the task of arranging the letters has been more arduous owing to mrs brownings unfortunate habit of prefixing no dates or incomplete ones to her letters many of them are dated merely by the day of the week or month and can only be assigned to their proper place in the series on internal evidence in some cases however the envelopes have been preserved and the date is then often provided by the postmarks these supply fixed points by which the others can be tested and ultimately all have fallen into line in chronological order and with at least approximate dates to each letter  the correspondence thus arranged in chronological order forms an almost continuous record of mrs brownings life from the early days in herefordshire to her death in italy in 1861 but in order to complete the record it has been thought well to add connecting links of narrative which should serve to bind the whole together into the unity of a biography it is a chronicle rather than a biography in the artistic sense of the term a chronicle of the events of a life in which there were but few external events of importance and in which the subject of the picture is for the most part left to paint her own portrait and that moreover unconsciously still this is a method which may be held to have its advantages in that it can hardly be affected by the feelings or prejudices of the biographer and if it does not present a finished portrait to the reader it provides him with the materials from which he can form a portrait for himself the external events are placed upon record either in the letters or in the connecting links of narrative the character and opinions of mrs browning reveal themselves in her correspondence and her genius is enshrined in her poetry and these three elements make up all that may be known of her personality all with which a biographer has to deal  it is essentially her character not her genius that is presented to the reader of these letters there are some letterwriters whose genius is so closely allied with their daily life that it shines through into their familiar correspondence with their friends and their letters become literature such in their very different ways with very different types of genius and very different habits of daily life are gray cowper lamb perhaps fitzgerald but letterwriters such as these are few more often the correspondence of men and women of letters is valuable for the light it throws upon the character and opinions of those whose character and opinions we are led to regard with admiration or respect or at least interest on account of their other writings in these cases it may be held that the publication is justifiable or not according as the character which it reveals is affected favourably or the reverse not all truth even about famous men is useful for publication but only such as enables us to appreciate better the works which have made them famous their highest selves are expressed in their literary work and it is a poor service to truth to insist on bringing to light the fact that they also had lower selvescommon dull it may be vicious what illustrates their genius and enhances our respect for their character may rightly be made known but what shakes our belief and mars our enjoyment in them is simply better left in obscurity  with regard to mrs browning however there is no room for doubt upon these points these letters familiarly written to her private friends without the smallest idea of publication treating of the thoughts that came uppermost in the ordinary language of conversation can lay no claim to make a new revelation of her genius on the other hand perhaps because the circumstances of mrs brownings life cut her off to an unusual extent from personal intercourse with her friends and threw her back upon letterwriting as her principal means of communication with them they contain an unusually full revelation of her character and this is not wholly unconnected with her literary genius since her personal convictions her moral character entered more fully than is often the case into the composition of her poetry her best poetry is that which is most full of her personal emotions the sonnets from the portuguese the cry of the children cowpers grave the dead pan aurora leigh and all the italian poems owe their value to the pure and earnest character the strong love of truth and right the enthusiasm on behalf of what is oppressed and the indignation against all kinds of oppression and wrong which were prominent elements in a personality of exceptional worth and beauty  an editor can generally serve his readers best by remaining in the background but he is allowed one moment for the expression of his personal feelings when he thanks those who have assisted him in his work in the present case there are many to whom it is a pleasure to offer such thanks in the first place i have to thank mr r barrett browning and miss browning most cordially for having accepted the proposal of the publishers messrs smith elder  co to whom likewise my gratitude is due to put so pleasant and congenial a task into my hands mr browning has also contributed a number of suggestions and corrections while the sheets have been passing through the press i have also to thank those who have been kind enough to offer letters in their possession for inclusion in these volumes lady alwyne compton for the letters to mr westwood mrs arthur severn for the letters to mr ruskin mr gl craik for the letters to miss mulock mrs commeline for the letters to miss commeline mr tj wise for the letters to mr cornelius mathews mr c aldrich for the letter to mrs kinney col tw higginson for a letter to miss channing and the rev g bainton for a letter to mr kenyon it has not been possible to print all the letters which have been thus offered but this does not diminish the kindness of the lenders nor the gratitude of the editor  finally i should wish to offer my sincere thanks to lady edmond fitzmaurice for much assistance and advice in the selection and revision of the letters a labour which her friendship with mr browning towards the close of his life has prompted her to bestow most freely and fully upon this memorial of his wife  fgk  july 1897     contents of the first volume   chapter i 18061835  birthhope endearly poemssidmouthprometheus

elizabeth barrett browning was born on march 6 1806 the eldest child of edward and mary moulton barrett i both the date and place of her birth have been matters of uncertainty and dispute and even so trustworthy an authority as the dictionary of national biography is inaccurate with respect to them all doubt has however been set at rest by the discovery of the entry of her birth in the parish register of kelloe church in the county of durham2 she was born at coxhoe hall the residence of mr barretts only brother samuel about five miles south of the city of durham her father whose name was originally edward barrett moulton had assumed the additional surname of barrett on the death of his maternal grandfather to whose estates in jamaica he was the heir of mr barrett it is recorded by mr browning in the notes prefixed by him to the collected edition of his wifes poems that on the early death of his father he was brought from jamaica to england when a very young child as a ward of the late chief baron lord abinger then mr scarlett whom he frequently accompanied in his postchaise when on circuit he was sent to harrow but received there so savage a punishment for a supposed offence burning the toastwhich indeed has been a supposed offence at other schools than harrowby the youth whose fag he had become that he was withdrawn from the school by his mother and the delinquent was expelled at the age of sixteen he was sent by mr scarlett to cambridge and thence for an early marriage went to northumberland his wife was miss mary grahamclarke daughter of j grahamclarke of fenham hall newcastleupontyne but of her nothing seems to be known and her comparatively early death causes her to be little heard of in the record of her daughters life  footnote 2 see notes and queries for july 20 1889 supplemented by a note from mr browning himself in the same paper on august 24  nothing is to be gained by trying to trace back the genealogy of the barrett family and it need merely be noted that it had been connected for some generations with the island of jamaica and owned considerable estates there3 it is a curious coincidence that robert browning was likewise in part of west indian descent and so too was john kenyon the lifelong friend of both by whose means the poet and poetess were first introduced to one another  footnote 3 these estates still remain in the family and mr charles barrett the eldest surviving brother of mrs browning now lives there  the family of mr edward barrett was a fairly large one consisting besides elizabeth of two daughters henrietta and arabel and eight sonsedward whose tragic death at torquay saddened so much of his sisters life charles the stormie of the letters samuel george henry alfred septimus and octavius mr barretts inventiveness having apparently given out with the last two members of his family reducing him to the primitive method of simple enumeration an enumeration in which it may be observed the daughters counted for nothing not many of these however can have been born at coxhoe for while elizabeth was still an infantapparently about the beginning of the year 1809mr barrett removed to his newly purchased estate of hope end in herefordshire among the malvern hills and only a few miles from malvern itself it is to hope end that the admirers of mrs browning must look as the real home of her childhood and youth here she spent her first twenty years of conscious life here is the scene of the childish reminiscences which are to be found among her earlier poems of hector in the garden the lost bower and the deserted garden and here too her earliest verses were written and the foundations laid of that omnivorous reading of literature of all sorts and kinds which was so strong a characteristic of her tastes and leanings  on this subject she may be left to tell her own tale in a letter written on october 5 1843 to mr rh horne she furnishes him with the following biographical details for his study of her in the new spirit of the age they supply us with nearly all that we know of her early life and writings  and then as to stories my story amounts to the knifegrinders with nothing at all for a catastrophe a bird in a cage would have as good a story most of my events and nearly all my intense pleasures have passed in my thoughts i wrote versesas i dare say many have done who never wrote any poemsvery early at eight years old and earlier but what is less common the early fancy turned into a will and remained with me and from that day to this poetry has been a distinct object with mean object to read think and live for and i could make you laugh although you could not make the public laugh by the narrative of nascent odes epics and didactics crying aloud on obsolete muses from childish lips the greeks were my demigods and haunted me out of popes homer until i dreamt more of agamemnon than of moses the black pony and thus my great epic of eleven or twelve years old in four books and called the battle of marathon and of which fifty copies were printed because papa was bent upon spoiling meis popes homer done over again or rather undone for although a curious production for a child it gives evidence only of an imitative faculty and an ear and a good deal of reading in a peculiar direction the love of popes homer threw me into pope on one side and into greek on the other and into latin as a help to greekand the influence of all these tendencies is manifest so long afterwards as in my essay on mind a didactic poem written when i was seventeen or eighteen and long repented of as worthy of all repentance the poem is imitative in its form yet is not without traces of an individual thinking and feelingthe bird pecks through the shell in it with this it has a pertness and pedantry which did not even then belong to the character of the author and which i regret now more than i do the literary defectiveness  all this time and indeed the greater part of my life we lived at hope end a few miles from malvern in a retirement scarcely broken to me except by books and my own thoughts and it is a beautiful country and was a retirement happy in many ways although the very peace of it troubles the heart as it looks back there i had my fits of pope and byron and coleridge and read greek as hard under the trees as some of your oxonians in the bodleian gathered visions from plato and the dramatists and eat and drank greek and made my head ache with it do you know the malvern hills the hills of piers plowmans visions they seem to me my native hills for although i was born in the county of durham i was an infant when i went first into their neighbourhood and lived there until i had passed twenty by several years beautiful beautiful hills they are and yet not for the whole worlds beauty would i stand in the sunshine and the shadow of them any more it would be a mockery like the taking back of a broken flower to its stalk4  footnote 4 rh horne letters of eb browning i 158161  so while the young robert browning was enthusiastically declaiming passages of popes homer and measuring out heroic couplets with his hand round the dining table in camberwell elizabeth barrett was drinking from the same fount of inspiration among the malvern hills and was already turning it to account in the production of her first epic the fifty copies of the battle of marathon which mr barrett proud of his daughters precocity insisted on having printed bear the date of 1819 only five of them are now known to exist and these are all in private hands even the british museum possesses only the reprint which the heroworship of the present generation caused to be produced in 1891 seven years later when she had just reached the age of twenty her first volume of verse was offered to the world in general it was entitled an essay on mind and other poems and included besides the didactic poem after the manner of pope which formed the pièce de rèsistance a number of shorter pieces several of which as she informed horne5 had been written when she was not more than thirteen  footnote 5 rh horne letters of eb browning i 164  it was during the years at hope end that elizabeth barrett was first attacked by serious illness at fifteen she says in her autobiographical letter already quoted in part i nearly died and this may be connected with a statement by mrs richmond ritchie to the effect that one day when elizabeth was about fifteen the young girl impatient for her ride tried to saddle her pony alone in a field and fell with the saddle upon her in some way injuring her spine so seriously that she was for years upon her back6 the latter part of this statement cannot indeed be quite accurate for her period of long confinement to a sickroom was of later date and began according to her own statement from a different cause mr r barrett browning states that the injury to the spine was not discovered for some time but was afterwards attributed not to a fall but to a strain whilst tightening her ponys girths no doubt this injury contributed towards the general weakness of health to which she was always subject  footnote 6 dict of nat biography vii 78  of her earliest letters belonging to the hope end period very few have been preserved and most of those which remain are of little interest the first to be printed here belongs to the period of her mothers last illness which ended in her death on october 1 1828 it is addressed to mrs james martin a lifelong friend whose name will appear frequently in these pages at the time when it was written she was living near tewkesbury within visiting distance of the barretts   to mrs martin hope end thursday about september 1828  my dear mrs martini am happy to be able to tell you that mr garden was here two days ago and that he has not thought it necessary to adopt any violent measure with regard to our beloved invalid he seems entirely to rely for her ultimate restoration upon a discipline as to diet and a course of strengthening medicine this is most satisfactory to us and her spirits have been soothed and tranquillised by his visit she has slept quietly for the last few nights and reports herself to be brisker and stronger and to be comparatively free from pain this account is perhaps too favorable7 and will appear so to you when you see her as i am afraid you will not looking much better much more cheerful than when you paid us your last visit but when we are very willing to hope we are apt to be too ready to hope though really without being too sanguine we may consider quiet nights and diminished pain to be satisfactory signs of amendment i know you will be glad to hear of them and i hope you will witness them very soon in spite of this repulsive snow it will do mama good and i am sure it will give us all pleasure to benefit by some of your charitable pilgrimages over the hill  with our best regards and sincerest thanks for your kind interest  believe me dear mrs martin most truly yours  eb barrett  footnote 7 mrs browning usually spells such words as favour honour and the like without the u after the fashion which one is accustomed to regard as american    to miss commeline hope end monday october 1828  my dear miss commelinethank you for the sympathy and interest which you have extended towards us in our heavy affliction even you cannot know all that we have lost but god knows and it has pleased him to take away the blessing that he gave and all must be right since he doeth all indeed we did not foresee this great grief if we had we could not have felt it less but i should not then have been denied the consolation of being with her at the last  it is idle to speak now of such thoughts and circumstances have unquestionably been rightly and mercifully ordered we are all well and composedpoor papa supporting us by his own surpassing fortitude it is an inexpressible comfort to me to witness his calmness  i cannot say that we shall not be glad to see you but the weather is dreary and the distance long and if you were to come we might not be able to meet you and to speak to you with calmness in that case you would receive a melancholy impression which i should like to spare you perhaps it would be better for you and less selfish in us if we were to defer this meeting a little while longerbut do what you prefer doing i can never forget the regard and esteem entertained for you by one whose tenderness and watchfulness i have felt every day and hour since she gave me that life which her loss embitterswhose memory is more precious to me than any earthly blessing left behind i have written what is ungrateful and what i ought not to have written and what i ought not to feel and do not always feel but i did not just then remember that i had so much left to love   to mrs boyd hope end saturday morning 18281832  my dear mrs boydyou were quite wrong in supposing that papa was likely to complain about the number of letters from malvern and as to my doing so why did you suggest that to fill up a sentence or to conjure up some kind of limping excuse for idle people among idle people perhaps you have written me down but the reason of my silence was far more reasonable than yours i have been engaged in alternately wishing in earnest and wishing in vain for the power of saying when i could go to malvernand in being unwell besides for the last week i have not been at all well and indeed was obliged yesterday to go to bed after breakfast instead of after tea where i contrived to abstract myself out of a good deal of pain into lord byrons life by moore today this abstraction is not necessary i am much better and indeed little remains of the indisposition but the vulgar fractions of a cough and cold i dare say and occyta8 agrees with me cold was at the bottom of it all for i was so very wise as to lie down upon the grass last monday when the sun was shining deceitfully though the snow was staring at me from the hedges with an expression anything but dogdaysical  henriettas faceache is quite well and i dont mean to give any more bulletins today i hope your tolerably well is turned into quite well too by this time  in reply to your query i will mention that the existence actually extended until thursday without the visit herea phenomenon in physics and metaphysics i was desired by a note a short time previously to embrace all my circle with the utmost tenderness as proxy considering the extent of the said circle this was a very comprehensive request and a very unreasonable one to offer to anyone less than the hundredarmed indian god baly i am glad that your alternative of a house is so near to the right side of the turnpikein which case a miss is certainly not as bad as a mile may place is to be vacated in may though its present inhabitants do not leave malvern i mention this to you but pray dont remention it to anybody the rent is 15£ mr boyd9 will not be angry with me for not going to see him sooner than i can at least i am sure he ought not though you are all kind enough to wish me to go i always think and know which is consolatory to everything but my vanity that no one can wish it half as much as i myself do  believe me dear mrs boyd affectionately yours  eb barrett  footnote 8 octavius her youngest brother  footnote 9 hugh stuart boyd the blind scholar whose friendship with elizabeth barrett is commemorated in her poem wine of cyprus and in three sonnets expressly addressed to him he was at this time living at great malvern where miss barrett frequently visited him reading and discussing greek literature with him especially the works of the greek christian fathers but to call him her tutor as has more than once been done is a mistake see miss barretts letter to him of march 3 1845 her knowledge of greek was due to her volunteering to share her brother edwards work under his tutor mr macswiney   the fear 1832 brought a great change in the fortunes of the barrett family and may be said to mark the end of the purely formative period in elizabeth barretts life hitherto she had been living in the home and among the surroundings of her childhood absorbing literature rather than producing it or if producing it still mainly for her own amusement and instruction rather than with any view of appealing to the general public but in 1832 this home was broken up by the sale of hope end10 and with the removal thence we seem to find her embarking definitely on literature as the avowed pursuit and occupation of her life sidmouth in devonshire was the place to which the barrett family now removed and the letters begin henceforth to be longer and more frequent and to tell a more connected tale  footnote 10 mr ingram in his life of eb browning eminent women series connects this fact with the abolition of colonial slavery and a consequent decrease in mr barretts income but since the abolition only took place in 1833 while hope end was given up in the preceding year this conclusion does not appear to be certain   to mrs martin sidmouth september 1832  how can i thank you enough dearest mrs martin for your letter how kind of you to write so soon and so very kindly the postmark and handwriting were in themselves pleasant sights to me and the kindness yet more welcome believe that i am grateful to you for all your kindnessfor your kindness now and your kindness in the days which are past some of those past days were very happy and some of them very sorrowfulmore sorrowful than even our last days at dear dear hope end then i well recollect though i could not then thank you as i ought how you felt for us and with us do not think i can ever forget that time or you i had written a note to you which the bearer of bummys and arabels to colwall11 omitted to take afterwards i thought it best to spare you any more farewells which are upon human lips of all words the most natural and of all the most painful  they told us of our having past your carriage in ledbury dear mrs martin i cannot dwell upon the pain of that first hour of our journey but you will know what it must have been the dread of it for some hours before was almost worse but it is all over now blessed be god before the first days journey was at end we felt inexpressibly relievedrelieved from the restlessness and anxiety which have so long oppressed usand now we are calmer and happier than we have been for very long if we could only have papa and bro and sette12 with us about half an hour before we set off papa found out that he could not part with sette who sleeps with him and is always an amusing companion to him papa was however unwilling to separate him perforce from his little playfellows and asked him whether he wished very much to go settes heart was quite full but he answered immediately oh no papa i would much rather stay with you he is a dear affectionate little thing he and bro being with poor papa we are far more comfortable about him than we should otherwise beand perhaps our going was his sharpest pang i hope it was as it is over do not think dear mrs martin that you or mr martin can ever intrudeyou know you use that word in your letter i have often been afraid on account of papa not having been for so long a time at colwall lest you should fancy that he did not value your society and your kindness do not fancy it painful circumstances produceas we have often had occasion to observedifferent effects upon different minds and some feeling with which i certainly have no sympathy has made papa shrink from society of any kind lately he would not even attend the religious societies in ledbury which he was so much pledged to support and so interested in supporting if you knew how much he has talked of you and asked every particular about you you could not fancy that his regard for you was estranged he has an extraordinary degree of strength of mind on most pointsand strong feeling when it is not allowed to run in the natural channel will sometimes force its way where it is not expected you will think it strange but never up to this moment has he even alluded to the subject before usnever at the moment of parting with us and yet though he had not power to say one word he could play at cricket with the boys on the very last evening  we slept at the york house in bath bath is a beautiful town as a town and the country harmonises well with it without being a beautiful country as mere country nobody would stand still to look at it though as town country many bodies would somersetshire in general seems to be hideous and i could fancy from the walls which intersect it in every direction that they had been turned to stone by looking at the gorgonic scenery the part of devonshire through which our journey lay is nothing very pretty though it must be allowed to be beautiful after somersetshire we arrived here almost in the dark and were besieged by the crowd of disinterested tradespeople who would attend us through the town to our house to help to unload the carriages this was not a particularly agreeable reception in spite of its cordiality and the circumstance of there being not a human being in our house and not even a rushlight burning did not reassure us people were tired of expecting us every day for three weeks nearly the whole way from honiton to this place is a descent poor dear bummy said she thought we were going into the bowels of the earth but suspect she thought we were going much deeper between you and me she does not seem delighted with sidmouth but her spirits are a great deal better and in time she will i dare say be better pleased we like very much what we have seen of it the town is small and not superfluously clean but of course the respectable houses are not a part of the town ours is one which the grand duchess helena had not at all grand but extremely comfortable and cheerful with a splendid sea view in front and pleasant green hills and trees behind the drawingrooms four windows all look to the sea and i am never tired of looking out of them i was doing so with a most hypocritical book before me when your letter arrived and i felt all that you said in it i always thought that the sea was the sublimest object in nature mont blancniagara must be nothing to it there the almightys form glasses itself in tempestsand not only in tempests but in calmin space in eternal motion in eternal regularity how can we look at it and consider our puny sorrows and not say we are dumbbecause thou didst it indeed dear mrs martin we must feel every hour and we shall feel every year that what he did is well doneand not only well but mercifully  mr and mrs h with whom papa is slightly acquainted have called upon us and shown us many kind attentions they are west india people not very polished but certainly very goodnatured we hear that the place is extremely full and gay but this is of course only an on dit to us at present i have been riding a donkey two or three times and enjoy very much going to the edge of the sea the air has made me sleep more soundly than i have done for some time and i dare say it will do me a great deal of good in every way  you may suppose what a southern climate this is when i tell you that myrtles and verbena three or four feet high and hydrangeas are in flower in the gardenseven in ours which is about a hundred and fifty yards from the sea i have written to the end of my paper give our kindest regards to mr martin and ever believe me  your affectionate and grateful ebb  footnote 11 the martins home near malvern about a mile from hope end  footnote 12 her brothers edward and septimus   to mrs martin sidmouth wednesday september 27 1832 postmark  how very kind of you dearest mrs martin to write to me so much at length and at such a time indeed it was exactly the time when if we were where we have been we should have wished you to walk over the hill and talk to us and although after all that the most zealous friends of letter writing can say for it it is not such a happy thing as talking with those you care for yet it is the next happiest thing i am sure i thought so when i read your letter   and now i must tell you about ourselves papa and bro and sette have made us so much happier by coming and we have the comfort of seeing dear papa in good spirits and not only satisfied but pleased with this place it is scarcely possible at least it seems so to me to do otherwise than admire the beauty of the country it is the very land of green lanes and pretty thatched cottages i dont mean the kind of cottages which are generally thatched with pigstyes and cabbages and dirty children but thatched cottages with verandas and shrubberies and sounds from the harp or piano coming through the windows when you stand upon any of the hills which stand round sidmouth the whole valley seems to be thickly wooded down to the very verge of the sea and these pretty villas to be springing from the ground almost as thickly and quite as naturally as the trees themselves there are certainly many more houses out of the town than in it and they all stand apart yet near hiding in their own shrubberies or behind the green rows of elms which wall in the secluded lanes on either side such a number of green lanes i never saw some of them quite black with foliage where it is twilight in the middle of the day and others letting in beautiful glimpses of the spreading heathy hills or of the sunny sea i am sure you would like the transition from the cliffs from the birds eye view to i was going to say the moles eye view but i believe moles dont see quite clearly enough to suit my purpose there are a great number of people here sam was at an evening party a week ago where there were a hundred and twenty people but they dont walk about the parade and show themselves as one might expect we know only the herrings and mrs and the miss polands and sir john kean mrs and miss weekes and mr and mrs james have called upon us but we were out when they came i suppose it will be necessary to return their visits and to know them and when we do you shall hear about them and about everybody whom we know i am certainly much better in health stronger than i was and less troubled with the cough every day i attend word torn out their walks on my donkey if we do not go in a boat which is still pleasanter i believe henrietta walks out about three times a day she is looking particularly well and often talks and i am sure still oftener thinks of you you know how fond of you she is papa walks out with herand us and we all down to  occyta breakfast and drink tea together the dining takes place at five oclock tomorrow if this lovely weather will stand still and be accommodating we talk of rowing to dawlish which is about ten miles off we have had a few cases of cholera at least suspicious cases one a fortnight before we arrived and five since in the course of a month all dead except one i confess a little nervousness but it is wearing away the disease does not seem to make any progress and for the last six days there have been no patients at all  do let us hear very soon my dear mrs martin how you arehow your spirits are and whether rome is still in your distance surely no plan could be more delightful for you than this plan and if you dont stay very long away i shall be sorry to hear of your abandoning it do you recollect your promise of coming to see us we do  you must have had quite enough now of my little hand and of my details do not go to matton or to the bartons or to eastnor without giving my love how often my thoughts are at home i cannot help calling it so still in my thoughts i may like other places but no other place can ever appear to me to deserve that name  dearest mrs martins affectionate eb barrett   to mrs martin sidmouth december 14 1832  my dearest mrs martini hope you are very angry indeed with us for not writing we are as penitent as we ought to bethat is i am for i believe i am the idle person yet not altogether idle but procrastinating and waiting for news rather more worthy of being read in rome than any which even now i can send you and now my dear mrs martin i mean to thank you as i ought to have done long ago for your kindness in offering to procure for me the archbishop of dublins13 valuable opinion upon my prometheus i am sure that if you have not thought me very ungrateful you must be very indulgent my mind was at one time so crowded by painful thoughts that they shut out many others which are interesting to me and among other things i forgot once or twice when i had an opportunity to thank you dear mrs martin i believe i should have taken advantage of your proposal but papa said to me if he criticises your manuscript in a manner which does not satisfy you you wont be easy without defending yourself and he might be drawn into taking more trouble than you have now any idea of giving him i sighed a little at losing such an opportunity of gaining a great advantage but there seemed to be some reason in what papa said i have completed a preface and notes to my translation and since doing so a work of exactly the same character by a mr medwin has been published and commended in bulwers magazine14 therefore it is probable enough that my trouble excepting as far as my own amusement went has been in vain but papa means to try mr valpy i believe he left us since i began to write this letter with a promise of returning before christmas day we do miss him mr boyd has made me quite angry by publishing his translations by rotation in numbers of the wesleyan magazine instead of making them up into a separate publication as i had persuaded him to do there is the effect you see of going even for a time out of my reach the readers of the wesleyan magazine are pious people but not cultivated nor for the most part capable of estimating either the talents of gregory or his translators i have begun already to insist upon another publication in a separate form and shall gain my point i dare say i have been reading bulwers novels and mrs trollopes libels and dr parrs works i am sure you are not an admirer of mrs trollopes she has neither the delicacy nor the candour which constitute true nobility of mind and her extent of talent forms but a scanty veil to shadow her other defects bulwer has quite delighted me he has all the dramatic talent which scott has and all the passion which scott has not and he appears to me to be besides a far profounder discriminator of character there are very fine things in his denounced we subscribe to the best library here but the best is not a good one i have however a tableload of my own books and with them i can always be satisfied do you know that mr curzon has left ledbury we were glad to receive your letter from dover although it told us that you were removing so far from us do let us hear of your enjoying italy is there much english society in rome and is it like english society here i can scarcely fancy an invitation card mrs hugginmuggin at home carried through the via sacra i am sure my little hand has done its duty today i shall leave the corners to henrietta give our kindest regards to mr martin and ever believe me my dear mrs martin  your affectionate ebb  footnote 13 archbishop whately  footnote 14 the new monthly magazine at this time edited by bulwer afterwards the first lord lytton   the letter just printed contains the first allusion in miss barretts letters to any of her own writings the translation of the prometheus bound of aeschylus was the firstfruits of the removal to sidmouth it was written as she told horne eleven years afterwards in twelve days and should have been thrown into the fire afterwardsthe only means of giving it a little warmth15 indeed so dissatisfied did she subsequently become with it that she did what she could to suppress it and in the collected edition of 1850 substituted another version written in 1845 which she hoped would secure the final oblivion of her earlier attempt16 the letter given above shows that the composition of the earlier version took place at the end of 1832 and in the following year it was published by mr valpy along with some shorter poems of which miss barrett subsequently wrote that a few of the fugitive poems may be worth a little perhaps but they have not so much goodness as to overcome the badness of the blasphemy of aeschylus the volume which was published anonymously received two sentences of contemptuous notice from the athenaeum in which the reviewer advised those who adventure in the hazardous lists of poetic translation to touch anyone rather than aeschylus and they may take warning by the author before us17  footnote 15 letters to rh home i 162  footnote 16 it need hardly be said that the literary resurrectionist has been too much for her and the version of 1833 has recently been reprinted of this reprint the best that can be said is that it provides an occasion for an essay by mrs meynell  footnote 17 athenaeum june 8 1833   to mrs martin sidmouth may 27 1833  my dearest mrs martini am half afraid of your being very angry indeed with me and perhaps it would be quite as well to spare this sheet of paper an angry look of yours by consigning it over to henrietta yet do believe me i have been anxious to write to you a long time and did not know where to direct my letter the history of all my unkindness to you is this i delayed answering your kind welcome letter from rome for three weeks because henrietta was at torquay and i knew that she would like to write in it and because i was unreasonable enough to expect to hear every day of her coming home at the end of the three weeks and on consulting your dates and plans i found out that you would probably have quitted rome before any letter of mine arrived there since then i have been inquiring and all in vain about where i could find you out all i could hear was that you were somewhere between italy and england and all i could do was to wait patiently and throw myself at your feet as soon as you came within sight and hearing and now do be as generous as you can my dear mrs martin and try to forgive one who never could be guilty of the fault of forgetting you notwithstanding appearances we heard only yesterday of your being expected at colwall and although we cannot welcome you there otherwise than in this way at the distance of 140 miles yet we must welcome you in this way and assure both of you how glad we are that the same island holds all of us once more it pleased us very much to hear how you were enjoying yourselves in rome and you must please us now by telling us that you are enjoying yourselves at colwall and that you bear the change with english philosophy the fishing at abbeville was a link between the past and the present and would make the transition between the eternal city and the eternal tithes a little less striking my wonder is how you could have persuaded yourselves to keep your promise and leave italy as soon as you did tell me how you managed it and tell me everything about yourselveshow you are and how you feel and whether you look backwards or forwards with the most pleasure and whether the influenza has been among your welcomers to england henrietta and arabel and daisy18 were confined by it to their beds for several days and the two former are only now recovering their strength three or four of the other boys had symptoms which were not strong enough to put them to bed as for me i have been quite well all the spring and almost all the winter i dont know when i have been so long well as i have been lately without a cough or anything else disagreeable indeed if i may place the influenza in a parenthesis we have all been perfectly well in spite of our fishing and boating and getting wet three times a day there is good troutfishing at the otter and the noble river sid which if i liked to stand in it might cover my ankles and lately daisy and sette and occyta have studied the art of catching shrimps and soak themselves up to their waists like professors my love of water concentrates itself in the boat and this i enjoy very much when the sea is as blue and calm as the sky which it has often been lately of society we have had little indeed but henrietta had more than much of it at torquay during three months and as for me you know i dont want any though i am far from meaning to speak disrespectfully of mr boyds which has been a pleasure and comfort to me his house is not farther than a five minutes walk from ours and i often make it four in my haste to get there ask eliza cliffe to lend you the may number of the wesleyan magazine and if you have an opportunity of procuring last decembers number do procure that there are some translations in each of them which i think you will like the december translation is my favourite though i was amanuensis only in the may one henrietta and arabel have a drawing master and are meditating soon beginning to sketch out of doorsthat is if before the meditation is at an end we do not leave sidmouth our plans are quite uncertain and papa has not i believe made up his mind whether or not to take this house on after the beginning of next month when our engagement with our present landlord closes if we do leave sidmouth you know as well as i do where we shall go perhaps to boulogne perhaps to the swan river the west indians are irreparably ruined if the bill passes papa says that in the case of its passing nobody in his senses would think of even attempting the culture of sugar and that they had better hang weights to the sides of the island of jamaica and sink it at once dont you think certain heads might be found heavy enough for the purpose no insinuation i assure you against the administration in spite of the dagger in their right hands mr atwood seems to me a demigod of ingratitude so much for the fickle reek of popular breath to which men have erected their temple of the windswho would trust a feather to it i am almost more sorry for poor lord grey who is going to ruin us than for our poor selves who are going to be ruined you will hear that my prometheus and other poems came into light a few weeks agoa fortnight ago i think i dare say i shall wish it out of the light before i have done with it and i dare say henrietta is wishing me anywhere rather than where i am certainly i have past all bounds do write soon and tell us everything about mr martin and yourself and ever believe me dearest mrs martin  your affectionate eb barrett  footnote 18 alfred the fifth brother   to mrs martin sidmouth september 7 1833  my dearest mrs martinare you a little angry again i do hope not i should have written long ago if it had not been for henrietta and henrietta would have written very lately if it had not been for me and we must beg of you to forgive us both for the sake of each other thank you for the kind letter which i have been so tardy in thanking you for but which was not on that account the less gladly received do believe how much it pleases me always to see and read dear mrs martins handwriting but i must try to tell you some less ancient truths we are still in the ruinous house without any poetical fiction the walls are too frail for even me who enjoy the situation in a most particularly particular manner to have any desire to pass the winter within them one wind we have had the privilege of hearing already and down came the tiles while we were at dinner and made us all think that down something else was coming we have had one chimney pulled down to prevent it from tumbling down and have received especial injunctions from the bricklayers not to lean too much out of the windows for fear the walls should follow the destiny of the chimney altogether there is every reasonable probability that the whole house will in the course of next winter be as like persepolis as anything so ugly can be if another house which will fit us can be found in sidmouth i am sure papa will take it but as he said the other day if i cant find a house i must go i hope he may find one and as near the sea as this ruin i have enjoyed its moonlight and its calmness all the summer and am prepared to enjoy its tempestuousness of the winter with as true an enjoyment what we shall do ultimately i do not even dream and if i know papa he does not my visions of the future are confined to what shall i write or read next and when shall we next go out in the boat and they you know can do no harm to anybody of one thing i have a comforting certaintythat wherever we may go or stay the decree which moves or fixes us will and must be the wisest virtuousest discreetest best   so i will change the subject to myself you told me that you were going to read my book and i want to know what you think of it if you were given to compliment and insincerity i should be afraid of asking you because among other evident reasons i might then appear to be asking for your praise instead of your opinion as it isi want to know what you think of my book is the translation stiff if you know me at all and i venture to hope that you do you will be certain that i shall like your honesty and love you for being honest even if you put on the very blackest of black caps  of course you know that the late bill has ruined the west indians that is settled the consternation here is very great nevertheless i am glad and always shall be that the negroes arevirtuallyfree  may god bless you dear mrs martin ever believe me your affectionate eb barrett   to hs boyd sidmouth friday 1834  my dear friendi dont know how i shall begin to persuade you not to be angry with me but perhaps the best plan will be to confess as many sins as would cover this sheet of paper and then to go on with my merits certainly i am altogether guiltless of your charge of not noticing your books arrival because no calvinism arrived with it i told you the bare truth when i told you why i did not write immediately the passage relating to calvinism i certainly read and as certainly was sorry for but as certainly as both those certainties such reading and such regret had nothing whatever to do with the silence which made you so angry with me  the other particular thing of which i should have written is mr parker and my letters i am more and more sorry that you should have sent them to him at allnot that their loss is any loss to anybody but that i scarcely like the ideaindeed i dont like it at allof their remaining worthless as they are at mr ps mercy as for my writing about them i should not be able to make up my mind to do that you know i had nothing to do with their being sent to mr parker and was indeed in complete ignorance of it besides i should be half ashamed to write to him now on any subject a very long interregnum took place in our correspondence which was his own work and when he wrote to me the summer before last i delayed from week to week and then from month to month answering it and now i feel ashamed to write at all  perhaps you will wonder why i am not ashamed to write to you indeed i have meant to do it very very often dont be severe upon me i am always afraid of writing to you too often and so the opposite fault is apt to be run intoof writing too seldom if that is a fault you see my scepticism is becoming faster and faster developed  let me hear from you soon if you are not angry i have been reading the bridgewater treatise and am now trying to understand prout upon chemistry i shall be worth something at last shall i not who knows but what i may die a glorious death under the pons asinorum after all prout if i succeed in understanding him does not hold that matter is infinitely divisible and so i suppose the seeds of matterthe ultimate moleculesare a kind of tertium quid between matter and spirit certainly i cant believe that any kind of matter primal or ultimate can be indivisible which it must according to his view  chalmerss treatise is as to eloquence surpassingly beautiful as to matter i could not walk with him all the way although i longed to do it for he walked on flowers and under shadeno tree on which a fine bird did not sit   believe me your affectionate friend ebb   to hs boyd sidmouth september 14 1834  my dear mr boydi wont ask you to forgive me for not writing before because i know very well that you would rather have not heard from me immediately and so you and mrs mathew have been tearing to piecesto the very ragsall my elaborate theology and when mr young is strong enough he is to help you at your cruel work the points upon which you and i differed are so numerous that if i really am wrong upon every one of them mrs mathew has indeed reason to punish me with hard thoughts well she cant help my feeling for her much esteem although i never saw her and if i were to see her i would not argue with her i would only ask her to let me love her i am weary of controversy in religion and should be so were i stronger and more successful in it than i am or care to be the command is not argue with one another but love one another it is better to love than to convince they who lie on the bosom of jesus must lie there together  not a word about your book19 dont you mean to tell me anything of it i saw a review of itrather a satisfactory onei think in an august number of the athenaeum if you will look into frasers magazine for august at an article entitled rogueries of tom moore you will be amused with a notice of the edinburgh reviews criticism in the text and of yourself in a note we have had a crowded bible meeting and a church missionary and london missionary meeting besides and i went last tuesday to the exmouth bible meeting with mrs maling miss taylor and mr hunter we did not return until halfpast one in the morning the bishop of barbadoes and the dean of winchester were walking together on the beach yesterday making sidmouth look quite episcopal you would not have despised it half so much had you been here  do you know any person who would like to send his or her son to sidmouth for the sake of the climate and private instruction and if you do will you mention it to me i am very sorry to hear of mrs boyd being so unwell arabel had a letter two days ago from annie and as it mentions mrs boyds having gone to dover i trust that she is well again should she be returned give my love to her  the blackedged paper may make you wonder at its cause our dear aunt mrs butler died last month at dieppeand died in jesus miss clarke is going if she is not gone to italy for the winter  believe me affectionately yours eb barrett  write to me whenever you dislike it least and tell me what your plans are i hear nothing about our leaving sidmouth  footnote 19 the fathers not papists including a reprint of some translations from the greek fathers which mr boyd had published previously   to miss commeline september 22 1834 sidmouth  i am afraid that there can be no chance of my handwriting at least being unforgotten by you dear miss commeline but in the case of your having a very long memory you may remember the name which shall be written at the end of this note and which belongs to one who does not nor is likely to forget you i was much much obliged to you for the kind few lines you wrote to mehow long ago no do not remember how longdo not remember that for fear you should think me unkind andwhat i am not i have intended again and again to answer your note and i am doing itat last are you all quite well mrs commeline and all of you shall i ever see any of you again perhaps i shall not but even if i do not i shall not cease to wish you to be well and happy in the body or out of the body  we came to sidmouth for two months and you see we are here still and when we are likely to go is as uncertain as ever i like the place and some of its inhabitants i like the greenness and the tranquillity and the sea and the solitude of one dear seat which hangs over it and which is too far or too lonely for many others to like besides myself we are living in a thatched cottage with a green lawn bounded by a devonshire lane do you know what that is milton did when he wrote of hedgerow elms and hillocks green indeed sidmouth is a nest among elms and the lulling of the sea and the shadow of the hills make it a peaceful one but there are no majestic features in the country it is all green and fresh and secluded and the grandeur is concentrated upon the ocean without deigning to have anything to do with the earth i often find my thoughts where my footsteps once used to be but there is no use in speaking of that  pray believe me affectionately yours eb barrett   to mrs martin sidmouth friday december 19 1834 postmark  my dearest mrs martin we have lately had deep anxiety with regard to our dear papa he left us two months ago to do his london business and a few weeks since we were told by a letter from him that he was ill he giving us to understand that his complaint was of a rheumatic character by the next coach we were so daring i can scarcely understand how we managed it as to send henry to him thinking that it would be better to be scolded than to suffer him to be alone and in suffering at a london hotel we were not scolded but my prayer to be permitted to follow henry was condemned to silence and what was said being said emphatically i was obliged to submit and to be  thankful for the unsatisfactory accounts which for many days afterwards we received i cannot help being anxious and fearful you know he is all left to usand that without him we should indeed be orphans and desolate therefore you may well know what feelings those are with which we look back upon his danger and forwards to any threatening of a return of it it may not be so do not when you write allude to my fearing about it our only feeling now should certainly be a deep feeling of thankfulness towards that god of all consolation who has permitted us to know his love in the midst of many griefs and who while he has often cast upon us the sorrow and the shadow has yet enabled us to recognise it as that shadow of the wings of the almighty wherein we may rejoice we shall probably see our dear papa next week at least we know that he is only waiting for strength and that he is already able to go outi fear not to walk out here we are all well belle vue is sold and we shall probably have to leave it in march but i do not think that we shall do so before henrietta is still very anxious to leave sidmouth altogether and i still feel that i shall very much grieve to leave it so that it is happy for us that neither is the decider on this point i have often thought that it is happier not to do what one pleases and perhaps you will agree with meif you dont please at the present moment to do something very particular and do tell me dear mrs martin what you are pleasing to do and what you are doing for it seems to me and indeed is a long time since i heard of you and mr martin in detail miss maria commeline sent a note to henrietta a fortnight ago and in it was honorable mention of youbut i wont interfere with the sublimities of your imagination by telling you what it was i should like to hear something of hope end whether there are many alterations and whether the new lodge of which i heard is built even now the thought stands before me sometimes like an object in a dream that i shall see no more those hills and trees which seemed to me once almost like portions of my existence this is not meant for murmuring i have had much happiness at sidmouth though with a character of its own henrietta and arabel and i are the only guardians just now of the three youngest boys the only ones at home and i assure you we have not too little to do they are no longer little boys there is an anxiety among us just now to have letters from jamaicafrom my dear dear brobut the packet is only expected the last accounts were comforting ones and i am living on the hope of seeing him back again in the spring stormie and georgie are doing well at glasgow so dr wardlaw says henriettas particular love to you and do believe me always  your affectionate eb barrett  you have of course heard of poor mrs boyds death mr boyd and his daughter are both in london and likely i think to remain there   to hs boyd sidmouth tuesday spring 1835  my dear mr boyd now i am going to tell you the only good news i know and you will be glad i know to be told what i am going to tell you dear georgie has taken his degree and very honorably at glasgow and is coming to us in all the dignity of a bachelor of arts he was examined in logic moral philosophy greek and latin of course publicly and we have heard from a fellow student of his that his answers were more pertinent than those of any other of the examined and elicited much applause mr groube is the fellow studentbut he has ceased to be one having found the glasgow studies too heavy for his health stormie shrank from the public examination on account of the hesitation in his speech he would not go up although according to report as well qualified as georgie mr groube says that the ladies of glasgow are preparing to break their hearts for georgies departure and he and stormie leave glasgow on may i now i am sure you will rejoice with me in the result of the examination do you not dear friend i was very anxious about it and almost resigned to hear of a failurefor georgie was in great alarm and prepared us for the very worst therefore the surprise and pleasure were great  i cant tell you of our plans although the glasgow students come to us in a week and this house will be too small to receive them we may leave sidmouth immediately or not at all i shall soon be quite qualified to write a poem on the pleasures of doubtand a very good subject it will be the pleasures of certainty are generally far less enjoyablei mean as pleasures go in this unpleasing world papa is in london and much better when we heard from him lastand we are awaiting his decree  and now what remains for me to tell you i believe i have read more hebrew than greek lately yet the dear greek is not less dear than ever who reads greek to you who holds my office some one i hope with an articulation of more congenial slowness  give annie my kind love may god preserve both of you  believe me your affectionate friend eb barrett     chapter ii  18351841  the residence of the barretts at sidmouth had never been a very settled onenever intended to be permanent and yet never having a fixed term nor any reason for a fixed term hence it spread itself gradually over a space of nearly three years before the long contemplated move to london actually took place during the latter part of that period however extant letters of miss barrett are almost wholly wanting and there is little information from any other source as to the course of her life it was apparently in the summer of 1835 that sidmouth was finally left behind mr barrett having then taken a house at 74 gloucester place near baker street which though never regarded as more than a temporary residence continued to be the home of his family for the next three years  the move to london was followed by two results of great importance for elizabeth barrett in the first place her health which had never been strong broke down altogether in the london atmosphere and it is from some time shortly after the arrival in gloucester place that the beginning of her invalid life must be dated on the other hand residence in london brought her into the neighbourhood of new friends and although the number of those admitted to see her in her sickroom was always small we yet owe to this fact the commencement of some of her closest friendships notably those with her distant cousin john kenyon and with miss mitford the authoress of our village and of a correspondence on a much fuller and more elaborate scale than any of the earlier period to this no doubt the fact of her confinement to her room contributed not a little for being unable to go out and see her friends much of her communication with them was necessarily by letter at the same time her literary activity was increasing she began to contribute poems to various magazines and to be brought thereby into connection with literary men and she was also employed on the longer compositions which went to make up her next volume of published verse  all this was however only of gradual development and for some time her correspondence is limited to mr boyd who was now living in st johns wood and mrs martin the exact date of the first letter is uncertain but it seems to belong to a time soon after the arrival of the barretts in town   to hs boyd 74 gloucester place london autumn 1835  my dear mr boydas georgie is going to do what i am afraid i shall not be able to do todaynamely to visit youhe must take with him a few lines from porsonia greeting to say how glad i am to feel myself again at only a short distance from you and how still gladder i shall be when the same room holds both of us dont be angry because i have not visited you immediately you knowor you will know if you consideri cannot open the window and fly  papa and i were very much obliged to you for the poisonand are ready to smile upon you whenever you give us the opportunity as graciously as socrates did upon his executioner how much you will have to say to me about the greeks unless you begin first to abuse me about the romans and if you begin that the peroration will be a very pathetic one in my being turned out of your doors such is my prophecy  papa has been telling me of your abusing my stanzas on mrs hemanss death i had a presentiment that you would and behold why i said nothing to you of them of course i maintain versus both you and papa that they are very much to be admired as well as everything else proceeding from or belonging to me upon which principle i hope you will admire george particularly  believe me dear mr boyd your affectionate friend eb barrett  arabels and my love to annie wont she come to see us   to mrs martin 74 gloucester place portman square london jan i 1836  my dearest mrs martini am half willing and half unwilling to write to you when among such dearer interests and deep anxieties you may perhaps be scarcely at liberty to attend to what i write and yet i will write if it be only briefly that you may not thinkif you think of us at allthat we have changed our hearts with our residence so much as to forget to sympathise with you dear mrs martin or to neglect to apprise you ourselves of our movements indeed a letter to you should have been written among my first letters on arriving in london only henrietta my scapegoat you will say said i will write to mrs martin and then after i had waited and determined to write without waiting any longer we heard of poor mrs hanfords affliction and your anxiety and i have considered day after day whether or not i should intrude upon you until i find myselfthus  i do hope that you have from the hand of god those consolations which only he in jesus christ can give to the so afflicted for i know well that you are afflicted with the afflicted and that with you sympathy is suffering and that while the tenderest earthly comfort is administered by your presence and kindness to your dear friends you will feel bitterly for them what a little thing earthly comfort is when the earthly beloved perish before them may he who is the beloved in the sight of his father and his church be near to them and you and cause you to feel as well as know the truth that what is sudden sorrow to our judgments is only longprepared mercy in his will whose names are wisdom and love should it not be dear friend that the tears of our human eyes ought to serve the happy and touching purpose of reminding us of those tears of jesus which he shed in assuming our sorrow with our flesh and the memory of those tears involves all comfort a recognition of the oneness of the human nature of that divine saviour who ever liveth with ours which perishes and sorrows so an assurance drawn from thence of his sympathy who sits on the throne of god with us who suffer in the dust of earth and of all those doctrines of redemption and sanctification and happiness which come from him and by him  now you will forgive me for writing all this dearest mrs martin i like to write my thoughts and feelings out of my own head and heart just as they suggest themselves when i write to you and i cannot think of affliction particularly when it comes near to me in the affliction or anxiety of dear friends without looking back and remembering what voice of god used to sound softly to me when none other could speak comfort you will forgive me and not be angry with me for trying or seeming to try to be a sermon writer  perhaps dear mrs martin when you do feel inclined and able to write you would write me a few lines remember i do not ask for them now no do not think of writing now i shall very much like to hear how your dear charge iswhether there should appear any prospect of improvement and how poor mrs hanford bears up against this heavy calamity and whether the anxiety and nursing affect your health but we shall try to hear this from the biddulphs and so do put me out of your head except when its thoughts would dwell on those on earth who sympathise with you and care for you  you see we are in london after all and poor sidmouth left afar i am almost inclined to say poor us instead of poor sidmouth but i dare say i shall soon be able to see in my dungeon and begin to be amused with the spiders half my soul in the meantime seems to have stayed behind on the seashore which i love more than ever now that i cannot walk on it in the body london is wrapped up like a mummy in a yellow mist so closely that i have had scarcely a glimpse of its countenance since we came well i am trying to like it all very much and i dare say that in time i may change my taste and my sensesand succeed we are in a house large enough to hold us for four months at the end of which time if the experiment of our being able to live in london succeed i believe that papas intention is to take an unfurnished house and have his furniture from ledbury you may wonder at me but i wish that were settled so and now i am satisfied with london although i cannot enjoy it we are not likely in the case of leaving it to return to devonshire and i should look with weary eyes to another strangership and pilgrimage even among green fields that know not these fogs papas object in settling here refers to my brothers george will probably enter as a barrister student at the inner temple on the fifth or sixth of this month and he will have the advantage of his home by our remaining where we are another advantage of london is that we shall see here those whom we might see nowhere else this year dear mrs martin may it bring with it the true pleasure of seeing you three have gone and we have not seen you may god bless you and all that you care for being with you always as the god of consolation and peace  your affectionate eb barrett  it is from the middle of this year that miss barretts active appearance as an author may be dated hitherto her publications had been confined to a few small anonymous volumes printed rather to please herself and her friends than with any idea of appealing to a wider public she was now anxious to take this farther step and with that object to obtain admission to some of the literary magazines this was obtained through the instrumentality of mr rh home subsequently best known as the author of orion he was at this time personally unknown to miss barrett but an application through a common friend led both to the opening to the poetess of the pages of the new monthly magazine then edited by bulwer and also to the commencement of a friendship which has left its mark in the two volumes of published letters to mr home the following is mr homes account of the opening of the acquaintance letters i 7 8       my first introduction to miss barrett was by a note from mrs     orme inclosing one from the young lady containing a short     poem with the modest request to be frankly told whether it     might be ranked as poetry or merely verse as there could be     no doubt in the recipients mind on that point the poem was     forwarded to colburns new monthly edited at that time by     mr bulwer afterwards the late first lord lytton where it     duly appeared in the current number the next manuscript sent     to me was the dead pan and the poetess at once started on     her bright and noble career  the poem with which miss barrett thus made her bow to the world of letters was the romaunt of margret20 which appeared in the july number of the magazine mr home must however have been in error in speaking of the dead pan as its successor since that was not written till some years later more probably it was the poets vow21 which was printed in the october number of the new monthly  footnote 20 poetical works ii 3  footnote 21 ib i 277   to hs boyd london october 14 friday 1836  my dear friendbe as little angry with me as you can i have not been very well for a day or two and shall enjoy a visit to you on monday so much more than i shall be able to do today that i will ask you to forgive my not going to you this week and to receive me kindly on that day insteadprovided you know it is not wet  the greek achaiides approach the greek achaioi22 more tremblingly than usual with the new monthly magazine in their hands now pray dont annoy yourself by reading a single word which you would rather not read except for the sake of being kind to me and my prophecy is that even by annoying yourself and making a strenuous effort the whole force of friendship would not carry you down the first page georgie says you want to know the verdict of the athenaeum that paper unfortunately has been lent out of the house but my memory enables me to send you the words very correctly i think after some observations on other periodicals the writer goes on to say the new monthly magazine has not one heavy article it is rich in poetry including some fine sonnets by the corn law rhymer and a fine although too dreamy ballad the poets vow we are almost tempted to pause and criticise the work of a writer of so much inspiration and promise as the author of this poem and exhort him once again to greater clearness of expression and less quaintness in the choice of his phraseology but this is not the time or place for digression  you see my critic has condemned me with a very gracious countenance do put on yours  and believe me affectionately yours eb barrett   i forgot to say that you surprised and pleased me at the same time by your praise of my seamew23 love to annie we were glad to hear that she did not continue unwell and that you are well again too i hope you have had no return of the rheumatic pain  footnote 22 miss barretts greek is habitually written without accents or breathings  footnote 23 poetical works ii 278   to hs boyd 74 gloucester place saturday october 1836  my dear friendi am much disappointed in finding myself at the end of this week without having once seen youparticularly when your two notes are waiting all this time to be answered do believe that they were not either of them addressed to an ungrateful person and that the only reason of their being received silently was my hope of answering them more agreeably to both of usby talking instead of writing  yes you have read my mystery24  you paid a tithe to your human nature in reading only ninetenths of it and the rest was a pure gift to your friendship for me and is taken and will be remembered as such but you have a cruel heart for a parody and this one tried my sensibility so much that i criedwith laughing i confess to you notwithstanding it was very fair and dealt its blow with a shining pointed weapon  but what will you say to me when i confess besides that in the face of all your kind encouragement my drama of the angels25 has never been touched until the last three days it was not out of pure idleness on my part nor of disregard to your admonition but when my thoughts were distracted with other things books just begun inclosing me all around a whole load of books upon my conscience i could not possibly rise up to the gate of heaven and write about my angels you know one cant sometimes sit down to the sublunary occupation of reading greek unless one feels free to it and writing poetry requires a double liberty and an inclination which comes only of itself  but i have begun i tried the blank metre once and it would not do and so i had to begin again in lyrics something above an hundred lines is written and now i am in two panics just as if one were not enough first because it seems to me a very daring subjecta subject almost beyond our sympathies and therefore quite beyond the sphere of human poetry perhaps when all is written courageously i shall have no courage left to publish it secondly because all my tendencies towards mysticism will be called into terrible operation by this dreaming upon angels      yes you will read a mystery  but dont make any rash resolutions about reading anything as i have begun i certainly will go on with the writing  here is a question for you  am i to accept your generous sacrifice of reading ninetenths of my vow as an atonement for your want of confidence in me oh your conscience will understand very well what i mean without a dictionary  arabel and i intend to pay you a visit on monday and if we can and it is convenient to you we are inclined to invite ourselves to your dinner table but this is all dependent on the weather  believe me dear mr boyd your affectionate friend eb barrett

that i have not been able until this morning to take breath or inspiration to answer your lyrics you shall see me soon but i am sorry to say it cant be monday or tuesday  i have had another note from the editor of the new monthly magazinevery flattering and praying for farther supplies the angels were not ready and i was obliged to send something else which i will not ask you to read so dont be very uneasy  arabels and my best love to annie and believe me in a great hurry for i wont miss this post  yours affectionately eb barrett    your lyrics found me dull as prose   among a file of papers   and analysing london fogs   to nothing but the vapours    they knew their part but through the fog   their flaming lightning raising   they missed my fancy and instead   my choler set ablazing

gloucester place december 7 1836  my dearest mrs martinindeed i have long felt the need of writing to you i mean the need to myself and although so many weeks and even months have passed away in silence they have not done so in lack of affection and thought  i had wished very much to have been able to tell you in this letter where we had taken our house or where we were going to take it we remain however in our usual state of conscious ignorance although there is a good deal of talking and walking about a house in wimpole streetwhich between ourselves i am not very anxious to live in on account of the gloominesses of that street and of that part of the street whose walls look so much like newgates turned inside out i would rather go on in my old way inhabiting castles in the air than that particular house nevertheless if it is decided upon i dare say i shall contrive to be satisfied with it and sleep and wake very much as i should in any other it will certainly be a point gained to be settled somewhere and i do so long to sit in my own armchairstrange as it will look out of my own roomand to read from my own books for our own particular parts our healths continue goodnone of us i think the worse for fog or wind as to wind we were almost elevated into the prerogative of pigs in the late storm we could almost see it and the feeling it might have been fatal to us bro and i were moralising about shipwrecks in the diningroom when down came the chimney through the skylight into the entrance passage you may imagine the crashing effect of the bricks bounding from the staircase downwards breaking the stone steps in the process in addition to the falling in of twentyfour large panes of glass frames and all we were terrified out of all propriety and there has been a dreadful calumny about henrietta and methat we had the hall door open for the purpose of going out into the street with our hair on end if bro had not encouraged us by shutting the door and locking it i confess to opening the door but deny the purpose of itat least maintain that i only meant to keep in reserve a way of escape in case as seemed probable the whole house was on its way to the ground indeed we should think much of the mercy of the escape bro had been on the staircase only five minutes before sarah the housemaid was actually there she looked up accidentally and saw the nodding chimneys and ran down into the drawingroom to papa shrieking but escaping with one graze of the hand from one brick how did you fare in the wind i never much imagined before that anything so true to nature as a real live storm could make itself heard in our streets but it has come too surely and carried away with it besides our chimney all that was left to us of the country in the shape of the kensington garden trees now do write to me dearest mrs martin and soon and tell me all you can of your chances and mischances and how mr martin is getting on with the parish and yourself with the parishioners but you have more the name of living at colwall than the thing you seem to me to lead a far more wandering life than we for all our homelessness and pilgrim shoon why you have been in ireland since i last said a word to you even upon paper  i sometimes think that a pilgrims life is the wisestat least the most congenial to the uses of this world we give our sympathies and associations to our hills and fields and then the providence of god gives them to another it is better perhaps to keep a stricter identity by calling only our thoughts our own  was there anybody in the world who ever loved london for itself did dr johnson in his paradise of fleet street love the pavement and the walls i doubt thatwhether i ought to do so or notthough i dont doubt at all that one may be contented and happy here and love much in the place but the place and the privileges of it dont mix together in ones love as is done among the hills and by the seaside  i or henrietta must have told you that one of my privileges has been to see wordsworth twice he was very kind to me and let me hear his conversation i went with him and miss mitford to chiswick and thought all the way that i must certainly be dreaming i saw her almost every day of her weeks visit to london this was all long ago while you were in france and she who overflows with warm affections and generous benevolences showed me every present and absent kindness professing to love me and asking me to write to her her novel is to be published soon after christmas and i believe a new tragedy is to appear about the same time under the protection of mr forrest papa has given me the first two volumes of wordsworths new edition the engraving in the first is his own face you might think me affected if i told you all i felt in seeing the living face his manners are very simple and his conversation not at all prominentif you quite understand what i mean by that i do myself for i saw at the same time landorthe brilliant landorand felt the difference between great genius and eminent talent all these visions have passed now i hear and see nothing except my doves and the fireplace and am doing little else than words torn out write all day long and then people ask me what i mean in words torn out i hope you were among the six who understood or half understood my poets vowthat is if you read it at all uncle hedley made a long pause at the first part but i have been reading too sheridan knowless play of the wreckers it is full of passion and pathos and made me shed a great many tears how do you get on with the reading society do you see much or anything of lady margaret cocks from whom i never hear now i promised to let her have ion if i could before she left brighton but the person to whom it was lent did not return it to me in time will you tell her this if you do see her and give her my kind regards at the same time dear bell was so sorry not to have seen you if she had you would have thought her looking very well notwithstanding the thinnessperhaps in some measure on account of itand in eminent spirits i have not seen her in such spirits for very very long and there she is down at torquay with the hedleys and butlers making quite a colony of it and everybody in each several letter grumbling in an undertone at the dullness of the place what would i give to see the waves once more but perhaps if i were there i should grumble too it is a happiness to them to be together and that i am sure they all feel  believe me dearest mrs martin your affectionate ebb  oh that you would call me ba29   footnote 29 elizabeth barretts pet name see her poem poetical works ii 249 given to her as a child by her brother edward and used by her family and friends and by herself in her letters to them throughout her life   to hs boyd 74 gloucester place thursday december 15 1836 postmark  my dear mr boyd two mornings since i saw in the paper under the head of literary news that a change of editorship was taking place in the new monthly magazine and that theodore hook was to preside in the room of mr hall i am so much too modest and too wise to expect the patronage of two editors in succession that i expect both my poems in a return cover by every twopenny post besides what has theodore hook to do with seraphim so i shall leave that poem of mine to your imagination which wont be half as troublesome to you as if i asked you to read it begging you to be assuredto write it down in your critical rubricthat it is the very finest composition you ever read next of course to the beloved de virginitate of gregory nazianzen30  mr stratten has just been here i admire him more than i ever did for his admiration of my doves by the way i am sure he thought them the most agreeable of the whole party for he said what he never did before that he could sit here for an hour our love to annieand forgive me for baskettiring a letter to you i mean of course as to size not type  yours affectionately eb barrett  is your poem printed yet    footnote 30do you mind that deed of até   which you bound me to so fast   reading de virginitate   from the first line to the last   how i said

christmas 1836  my dear friendi am very much obliged to you for the two copies of your poem so beautifully printed with such majestical types on such magnifical paper as to be almost worthy of baskett himself you are too liberal in sending me more than one copy and pray accept in return a duplicate of gratitude  as to my seraphim they are not returned to me as in the case of their being unaccepted i expressly begged they might be had the old editor been the present one my inference would of course be that their insertion was a determined matter but as it is i dont know what to think31 a long list of great names belonging to intending contributors appeared in the paper a day or two ago and among them was miss mitfords  are you wroth with me for not saying a word about going to see you arabel and i wont affirm it mathematicallybut we are metaphysically talking of paying our visit to you next tuesday dont expect us nevertheless  yours affectionately eb barrett  what are my christmas good wishes to be that you may hold a field in your right hand and a baskerville in your left before the year is out that degree of happiness will satisfy at least the bodily part of you  you may wish in return for me that i may learn to write rather more legibly than at these presents  our love to annie  wont you send your new poem to mr barker to the care of mr valpy with your christmas benedictions  footnote 31 as a matter of fact the seraphim was not printed in the new monthly being probably thought too long   to mrs martin 74 gloucester place january 23 1837 postmark  my dearest mrs martini am standing in henriettas place she saysbut not i say to answer your letter to her yesterday but your letter to me some weeks agowhich i meant to answer much more immediately if the ignis fatuus of a house you see to what a miserable fatuity i am reduced of applying your pure country metaphors to our brick pollutions had not been gliding just before us and i had not much wished to be able to tell you of our settlement as it is however i must write and shall keep a solemn silence on the solemn subject of our shifting plans  no i was not at all disappointed in wordsworth although perhaps i should not have singled him from the multitude as a great man there is a reserve even in his countenance which does not lighten as landors does whom i saw the same evening his eyes have more meekness than brilliancy and in his slow even articulation there is rather the solemnity and calmness of truth itself than the animation and energy of those who seek for it as to my being quite at my ease when i spoke to him why how could you ask such a question i trembled both in my soul and body but he was very kind and sate near me and talked to me as long as he was in the roomand recited a translation by cary of a sonnet of dantesand altogether it was quite a dream landor toowalter savage landor  in whose hands the ashes of antiquity burn againgave me two greek epigrams he had lately written  and talked brilliantly and prominently until bro he and i went together abused him for ambitious singularity and affectation but it was very interesting and dear miss mitford too and mr raymond a great hebraist and the ancient author of a cure for a heartache i never walked in the skies before and perhaps never shall again when so many stars are out i shall at least see dear miss mitford who wrote to me not long ago to say that she would soon be in london with otto her new tragedy which was written at mr forrests own request he in the most flattering manner having applied to her a stranger as the authoress of rienzi for a dramatic work worthy of his actingafter rejecting many plays offered to him and among them mr knowless she says that her play will be quite opposed in its execution to ion as unlike it as a ruined castle overhanging the rhine to a grecian temple and i do not doubt that it will be full of ability although my own opinion is that she stands higher as the authoress of our village than of rienzi and writes prose better than poetry and transcends rather in dutch minuteness and high finishing than in italian ideality and passion i think besides that mr forrests rejection of any play of sheridan knowles must refer rather to its unfitness for the development of his own personal talent than to its abstract demerit whatever transatlantic tastes he may bring with him the published title of the last play is the daughter not the wreckers although i believe it was acted as the last i am very anxious to read otto not to see it i am not going to see it notwithstanding an offered temptation to sit in the authoresss own box with regard to ion i think it is a beautiful work but beautiful rather morally than intellectually is this right or not its moral tone is very noble and sends a grand and touching harmony into the midst of the full discord of this utilitarian age as dramatic poetry it seems to me to want not beauty but power passion and condensation this is my doxy about ion its author32 made me very proud by sending it to me although we do not know him personally i have heard that he is a most amiable man who else could have written ion but that he was a little elevated by his popularity last year  i have read combes phrenology but not the constitution of man the phrenology is very clever and amusing but i do not think it logical or satisfactory i forget whether slowness of the pulse is mentioned in it as a symptom of the poetical aestus i am afraid if it be a symptom i dare not take my place even in the forlorn hope of poets in this age so forlorn as to its poetry for my pulse is in a continual flutter and my feet not half cold enough for a pedestalso i must make my honours over to poor papa straightway he has been shivering and shuddering through the cold weather and partaking our influenza in the warmer i am very sorry that you should have been a sufferer too it seems to have been a universal pestilence even down in devonshire where dear bummy and the whole colony have had their share of groans and one of my doves shook its pretty head and ruffled its feathers and shut its eyes and became subject to pap and nursing and other infirmities for two or three days until i was in great consternation for the result but it is well againcooing as usual and so indeed we all are but indeed i cant write a sentence more without saying some of the evil it deservesof the utilitarianisms of this corrupt ageamong some of the chief of which are steel pens  i am so glad that you liked my romaunt and so resigned that you did not understand some of my poets vow and so obliged that you should care to go on reading what i write they vouchsafed to publish in the first number of the new series of the new monthly a little poem of mine called the island33 but so incorrectly that i was glad at the additional oblivion of my signature if you see it pray alter the last senseless line of the first page into leaf sounds with water in your ear and put amreeta instead of amneta on the second page and strike out of in the line which names aeschylus there are other blunders but these are intolerable and cast me out of my contentment for some time i have begged for proof sheets in future and as none have come for the ensuing month i suppose i shall have nothing in the next number they have a lyrical dramatic poem of mine the two seraphim which whenever it appears i shall like to have your opinion of as to the incomprehensible line in the poets vow of which you asked me the meaning one making one in strong compass i meant to express how that oneness of god in whom are all things produces a oneness or sympathy sympathy being the tendency of many to become one in all things do you understand or is the explanation to be explained the unity of god preserves a unity in menthat is a perpetual sympathy between man and manwhich sympathy we must be subject to if not in our joys yet in our griefs i believe the subject itself involves the necessity of some mysticism but i must make no excuses i am afraid that my very seraphim will not be thought to stand in a very clear light even at heavens gate but this is much asay about nothing   the bishop of exeter is staying and preaching at torquay do you not envy them all for making part of his congregation i am sure i do as much i envy you your beforebreakfast activity i am never a complete man without my breakfastit seems to be some integral part of my soul you read all oconnells speeches i never read any of themunless they take me by surprise i keep my devotion for unpaid patriots but miss mitford is another devotee of mr oconnell   dearest mrs martins affectionate eb barrett  thank you for the ba in henriettas letter if you knew how many people whom i have known only within this year or two whether i like them or not say ba ba quite naturally and pastorally you would not come to me with the detestable miss b  footnote 32 serjeant talfourd  footnote 33 poetical works ii 248   to mrs martin london august 16 1837  my dear mrs martinit seems a long long time since we had any intercourse and the answer to your last pleasant letter to henrietta must go to you from me we have heard of you that you dont mean to return to england before the springwhich news proved me a prophet and disappointed me at the same time for one cant enjoy even a prophecy in this world without something vexing indeed i do long to see you again dearest mrs martin and should always have the same pleasure in it and affection for you if my friends and acquaintances were as much multiplied as you wrongly suppose them to be but the truth is that i have almost none at all in this place and except our relative mr kenyon not one literary in any sense dear miss mitford one of the very kindest of human beings lies buried in geraniums thirty miles away i could not conceive what henrietta had been telling you or what you meant for a long timeuntil we conjectured that it must have been something about lady dacre who kindly sent me her book and intimated that she would be glad to receive me at her conversationsand you know me better than to doubt whether i would go or not there was an equal unworthiness and unwillingness towards the honor of it indeed dearest mrs martin it is almost surprising how we contrive to be as dull in london as in devonshireperhaps more so for the sight of a multitude induces a sense of seclusion which one has not without it and besides there were at sidmouth many more known faces and listenedto voices than we see and hear in this place no house yet and you will scarcely have patience to read that papa has seen and likes another house in devonshire place and that he may take it and we may be settled in it before the year closes i myself think of the whole business indifferently my thoughts have turned so long on the subject of houses that the pivot is brokenand now they wont turn any more all that remains is a sort of consciousness that we should be more comfortable in a house with cleaner carpets and taken for rather longer than a week at a time perhaps after all we are quite as well sur le tapis as it is it is a thousand to one but that the feeling of four red london walls closing around us for seven eleven or twentyfive years would be a harsh and hard one and make us cry wistfully to get out i am sure you will look up to your mountains and down to your lakes and enter into this conjecture  talking of mountains and lakes is itself a trying thing to us poor prisoners papa has talked several times of taking us into the country for two months this summer and we have dreamt of it a hundred times in addition but after all we are not likely to go i dare say it would have been very delightfuland who knows what may take place next summer we may not absolutely die without seeing a tree henrietta has seen a great many you will have heard i dare say of the enjoyment she had in her week at camden house she seems to have walked from seven in the morning to seven at night and was quite delighted with the kindness within doors and the sunshine without i assure you that fresh as she was from the air and dew she saluted us amidst the sentiment of our sisterly meeting just in this wayit was almost her first exclamationwhat a very disagreeable smell there is here and this although she had brought geraniums enough from camden to perfume the haymarket  i am happy to announce to you that a new little dove has appeared from a shellover which nobody had prognosticated goodon august 16 1837 i and the senior doves appear equally delighted and we all three in the capacity of good sitters and indefatigable pullersabout take a good deal of credit upon ourselves  arabel has begun oil painting and without a masterand you cant think how much effect and expression she has given to several of her own sketches notwithstanding all difficulties poor henrietta is without a piano and is not to have one again until we have another house this is something like when homer and virgil are forgotten speaking of homer and virgil i have been writing a romance of the ganges34 in order to illustrate an engraving in the new annual to be edited by miss mitford findens tableaux for 1838 it does not sound a very homeric undertakingi confess i dont hold any kind of annual gild it as you please in too much honour and awebut from my wish to please her and from the necessity of its being done in a certain time i was quite frightful as poor old cooke used to say in order to express his own nervousness but she was quite pleasedshe is very soon pleasedand the ballad gone the way of all writing nowadays to the press i do wish i could send you some kind of news that would interest you but you see scarcely any except all this selfishness is in my beat dearest bro draws and reads german and i fear is dull notwithstanding but we are every one of us more reconciled to london than we were well i must not write any more whenever you think of me dearest mrs martin remember how deeply and unchangeably i must regard youboth with my mind my affections and that part of either called my gratitude ba  henriettas kindest love and thanks for your letter she desires me to say that she and bro are going to dine with mrs robert martin tomorrow i must tell you that georgie and i went to hear dr chalmers preach three sundays ago his sermon was on a text whose extreme beauty would diffuse itself into any sermon preached upon itgod is love his eloquence was very great and his views noble and grasping i expected much from his imagination but not so much from his knowledge it was truer to scripture than i was prepared for although there seemed to me some want on the subject of the work of the holy spirit on the heart which work we cannot dwell upon too emphatically he worketh in us to will and to do and yet we are apt to will and do without a transmission of the praise to him may god bless you  footnote 34 poetical works ii 83   to miss commeline london august 19 1837  my dear miss commelinei could not hear of your being in affliction without very frequent thoughts of you and a desire to express some of them in this way and although so much time has passed i do hope that you will believe in the sympathy with which i or rather we have thought of you and in the regard we shall not cease to feel for you even if we meet no more in this world it is blessed to know both for ourselves and for each other that while there is a darkness that must come to all there is a light which may and may he who is the light in the dark place be with you now and always causing you to feel rather the glory that is in him than the shadow which is in all besidethat so the sweetness of the consolation may pass the bitterness of even grief do give my love to mrs commeline and to your sisters and believe me all of you that the friends who have gone from your neighbourhood have not gone from my old remembrance either of your kindness to them or of their own feelings of interest in you  trusting to such old remembrances i will believe that you care to know what we are doing and how we are settlingthat word which has now been on our lips for years which it is marvellous to think how it got upon human lips at all we came from sidmouth to try london and ourselves and see whether or not we could live together and after more than a year and a half close contact with smoke we find no very good excuse for not remaining in it and papa is going on with his eternal hunt for housesthe wild huntsman in the ballad is nothing to him all except the sublimityintending very seriously to take the first he can he is now about one in particular but i wont tell where it is because we have considered so many houses in particular that our considerations have come to be a jest in general i shall be heartily glad at least i think so for it is possible that the reality of being bricked up for a lease time may not be very agreeable i think i shall be heartily glad when a house is taken and we have made it look like our own with our furniture and pictures and books i am so anxious to see my old books i believe i shall begin at the beginning and read every story book through in the joy of meeting and shall be as sedentary as ever i was in my own armchair i remember when i was a child spreading my vitality not over trees and flowers i do that stilli still believe they have a certain animal susceptibility to pleasure and pain it is my creed and being wordsworths besides i am not ashamed of it but over chairs and tables and books in particular and being used to fancy a kind of love in them to suit my love to them and so if i were a child i should have an intense pity for my poor folios quartos and duodecimos to say nothing of the armchair shut up all these weeks and months in boxes without a rational eye to look upon them pray forgive me if i have written a great deal of nonsenseje men doute  henrietta has spent a fortnight at chislehurst with the martins and was very joyous there and came back to us with that happy triumphant air which i always fancy people just from the country put on towards us hapless londoners  but you must not think i am a discontented person and grumble all day long at being in london there are many advantages here as i say to myself whenever it is particularly disagreeable and if we cant see even a leaf or a sparrow without soot on it there are the parrots at the zoological gardens and the pictures at the royal academy and real live poets above all with their heads full of the trees and birds and sunshine of paradise i have stood face to face with wordsworth and landor and miss mitford who is in herself what she is in her books has become a dear friend of mine but a distant one she visits london at long intervals and lives thirty miles away  bro and i were studying german together all last summer with henry before he left us to become a german and i believe this is the last of my languages for i have begun absolutely to detest the sight of a dictionary or grammar which i never liked except as a means and love poetry with an intenser love if that be possible than i ever did not that greek is not as dear to me as ever but i write more than i read even of greek poetry and am resolute to work whatever little faculty i have clear of imitations and conventionalisms which cloud and weaken more poetry particularly nowadays than would be believed possible without looking into it  as to society in london i assure you that none of us have much and that as for me you would wonder at seeing how possible it is to live as secludedly in the midst of a multitude as in the centre of solitude my doves are my chief acquaintances and i am so very intimate with them that they accept and even demand my assistance in building their innumerable nests do tell me if there is any hope of seeing any of you in london at any time i say do tell me for i will venture to ask you dear miss commeline to write me a few lines in one of the idlest hours of one of your idlest days just to tell me a little about you and whether mrs commeline is tolerably well pray believe me under all circumstances  yours sincerely and affectionately eb barrett  the spring of 1838 was marked by two events of interest to miss barrett and her family in the first place mr barretts apparently interminable search for a house ended in his selection of 50 wimpole street which continued to be his home for the rest of his life and which is consequently more than any other house in london to be associated with his daughters memory the second event was the publication of the seraphim and other poems which was miss barretts first serious appearance before the public and in her own name as a poet the early letters of this year refer to the preparation of this volume as well as to the authoresss health which was at this time in a very serious condition owing to the breaking of a bloodvessel indeed from this time until her marriage in 1846 she held her life on the frailest of tenures and lived in all respects the life of an invalid   to hs boyd monday morning march 27 1838 postmark  my dear friendi do hope that you may not be very angry but papa thinksand indeed i thinkthat as i have already had two proof sheets and fortyeight pages and the printers have gone on to the rest of the poem it would not be very welcome to them if we were to ask them to retrace their steps besides i would ratheri for myself ithat you had the whole poem at once and clearly printed before you to insure as many chances as possible of your liking it i am promised to see the volume completed in three weeks from this time so that the dreadful moment of your reading iti mean the seraphim part of itcannot be far off and perhaps the season being a good deal advanced even now you might not on consideration wish me to retard the appearance of the book except for some very sufficient reason i feel very nervous about itfar more than i did when my prometheus crept out of the greek or i myself out of the shell in the first essay on mind perhaps this is owing to dr chamberss medicines or perhaps to a consciousness that my present attempt is actually and will be considered by others more a trial of strength than either of my preceding ones  thank you for the books and especially for the editio rarissima which i should as soon have thought of your trusting to me as of your admitting me to stand with gloves on within a yard of baxter this extraordinary confidence shall not be abused  i thank you besides for your kind inquiries about my health dr chambers did not think me worse yesterday notwithstanding the last cold days which have occasioned some uncomfortable sensations and he still thinks i shall be better in the summer season in the meantime he has ordered me to take iceout of sympathy with nature i suppose and not to speak a word out of contradiction to my particular human feminine nature  whereupon i revenge myself you see by talking all this nonsense upon paper and making you the victim  to propitiate you let me tell you that your commands have been performed to the letter and that one greek motto from orpheus is given to the first part of the seraphim and another from chrysostom to the second  henrietta desires me to say that she means to go to see you very soon give my very kind remembrance to miss holmes and believe me  your affectionate friend eb barrett  i saw mr kenyon yesterday he has a book just coming out35 i should like you to read it if you would you would thank me for saying so  footnote 35 poems for the most part occasional by john kenyon   to john kenyon36 1838  thank you dearest mr kenyon and i should and shall thank miss thomson too for caring to spend a thought on me after all the parisian glories and rationalities which i sympathise with by many degrees nearer than you seem to do we in this england here are just social barbarians to my mindthat is we know how to read and write and think and even talk on occasion but we carry the old rings in our noses and are proud of the flowers pricked into our cuticles by so much are they better than we on the continent i always think life has a thinner rind and so a livelier sap and that i can see in the books and the traditions and always understand people who like living in france and germany and should like it myself i believe on some accounts  where did you get your bacchanalian song witty certainly but the recollection of the scores a little ghastly for the occasion perhaps you have yourself sung into silence too all possible songs of bacchus as the god and i know  here is a delightful letter from miss martineau i cannot be so selfish as to keep it to myself the sense of natural beauty and the good sense of the remarks on rural manners are both exquisite of their kinds and wordsworth is wordsworth as she knows him have i said that friday will find me expecting the kind visit you promise that at least is what i meant to say with all these words  ever affectionately yours ebb  footnote 36 john kenyon 17841856 was born in jamaica the son of a wealthy west indian landowner but came to england while quite a boy and was a conspicuous figure in literary society during the second quarter of the century he published some volumes of minor verse but is best known for his friendships with many literary men and women and for his boundless generosity and kindliness to all with whom he was brought into contact crabb robinson described him as a man whose life is spent in making people happy he was a distant cousin of miss barrett and a friend of robert browning who dedicated to him his volume of dramatic romances besides writing and sending to him andrea del sarto as a substitute for a print of the painters portrait which he had been unable to find the best account of kenyon is to be found in mrs crosses john kenyon and his friends in redletter days of my life vol i   to john kenyon wimpole street sunday evening 1838  my dear mr kenyoni am so sorry to hear of your going and i not able to say goodbye to you thati am not writing this note on that account  it is a begging note and now i am wondering to myself whether you will think me very childish or womanish or silly enough to be both together i know your thoughts upon certain parallel subjects if i go on to do my begging fully i hear that you are going to mr wordsworthsto rydal mountand i want you to ask for yourself and then to send to me in a letterby the post i mean two cuttings out of the gardenof myrtle or geranium i care very little which or what else only i say myrtle because it is less given to die and i say two to be sure of my chances of saving one will you you would please me very much by doing it and certainly not dis please me by refusing to do it your broadest no would not sound half so strange to me as my little crooked thing does to you but you see everybody in the world is fanciful about something and why not ebb  dear mr kenyon i have a book of yoursm rios if you want it before you go just write in two words send it or i shall infer from your silence that i may keep it until you come back no necessity for answering this otherwise is it as bad as asking for autographs or worse at any rate believe me in earnest this timebesides being with every wish for your enjoyment of mountains and lakes and cherry trees  ever affectionately yours ebb   to hs boyd may 1838  my dear friendi am rather better than otherwise within the last few days but fear that nothing will make me essentially so except the invisible sun i am however a little better and gods will is always done in mercy  as to the poems do forgive me dear mr boyd and refrain from executing your cruel threat of suffering the desire of reading them to pass away  i have not one sheet of them and papaand to say the truth i myselfwould so very much prefer your reading the preface first that you must try to indulge us in our phantasy the book mr bentley half promises to finish the printing of this week at any rate it is likely to be all done in the next and you may depend upon having a copy as soon as i have power over one  with kind regards to miss holmes believe me your affectionate friend ebb   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street wednesday may 1838  thank you for your inquiry my dear friend i had begun to fancy that between saunders and otley and the seraphim i had fallen to the ground of your disfavour but i do trust to be able to send you a copy before next sunday  i am thrown back a little just now by having caught a very bad cold which has of course affected my cough the worst seems however to be past and dr chambers told me yesterday that he expected to see me in two days nearly as well as before this casualty and i have been thank god pretty well lately and although when the stethoscope was applied three weeks ago it did not speak very satisfactorily of the state of the lungs yet dr chambers seems to be hopeful still and to talk of the wonders which the summer sunshine when it does come may be the means of doing for me and people say that i look rather better than worse even now  did you hear of an autograph of shakespeares being sold lately for a very large sum i think it was above a hundred pounds on the credit of its being the only genuine autograph extant is yours quite safe and are you so in your opinion of its veritableness  i have just finished a very long barbarous ballad for miss mitford and the findens tableaux of this year the title is the romaunt of the page37 and the subject not of my own choosing  i believe that you will certainly have the seraphim this week do macadamise the frown from your brow in order to receive them  give my love to miss holmes your affectionate friend eb barrett  footnote 37 poetical works ii 40   to hs boyd june 7 1838 postmark  my dear mr boydpapa is scarcely inclined nor am i for myself to send my book or books to the east indies let them alone poor things until they can walk about a little and then it will be time enough for them to learn to fly  i am so sorry that emily harding saw arabel and went away without this note which i have been meaning to write to you for several days and have been so absorbed and drawn away all except my thoughts by other things necessary to be done that i was forced to defer it my ballad38 containing a ladye dressed up like a page and galloping off to palestine in a manner that would scandalise you went to miss mitford this morning but i augur from its length that she will not be able to receive it into finden  arabel has told me what miss harding told her of your being in the act of going through my seraphim for the second time for the feeling of interest in me which brought this labour upon you i thank you my dear friend what your opinion is and will be i am prepared to hear with a good deal of awe you will certainly not approve of the poem  there now you see i am prepared therefore do not keep back one rough word for friendships sake but be as honest asyou could not help being without this request  if i should live i shall write i believe better poems than the seraphim which belief will help me to survive the condemnation heavy upon your lips  affectionately yours eb barrett  footnote 38 the romaunt of the page   the seraphim and other poems a duodecimo of 360 pages at last made its appearance at the end of may at the time of its publication english poetry was experiencing one of its periods of ebb between two flood tides of great achievement shelley keats byron scott coleridge were dead wordsworth had ceased to produce poetry of the first order no fresh inspiration was to be expected from landor southey rogers campbell and such other writers of the georgian era as still were numbered with the living on the other hand tennyson though already the most remarkable among the younger poets was still but exercising himself in the studies in language and metrical music by which his consummate art was developed browning had published only pauline paracelsus and strafford the other poets who have given distinction to the victorian age had not begun to write and between the veterans of the one generation and the young recruits of the next there was a singular want of writers of distinction there was thus every opportunity for a new poet when miss barrett entered the lists with her first volume of acknowledged verse  its reception on the whole does credit alike to its own merits and to the critics who reviewed it it does not contain any of those poems which have proved the most popular among its authoresss complete works except cowpers grave but the seraphim was a poem which deserved to attract attention and among the minor poems were the poets vow isobels child the romaunt of margret my doves and the seamew the volume did not suffice to win any wide reputation for miss barrett and no second edition was called for on the other hand it was received with more than civility with genuine cordiality by several among the reviewers though they did not fail to note its obvious defects the athenaeum39 began its review with the following declaration      this is an extraordinary volumeespecially welcome as an     evidence of female genius and accomplishmentbut it is hardly     less disappointing than extraordinary miss barretts genius     is of a high order active vigorous and versatile but     unaccompanied by discriminating taste a thousand strange and     beautiful views flit across her mind but she cannot look on     them with steady gaze her descriptions therefore are     often shadowy and indistinct and her language wanting in the     simplicity of unaffected earnestness  footnote 39 july 7 1838  the examiner40 after quoting at length from the preface and the seraphim continued      who will deny to the writer of such verses as these and they     are not sparingly met with in the volume the possession of     many of the highest qualities of the divine art we regret     to have some restriction to add to an admission we make so     gladly miss barrett is indeed a genuine poetess of no common     order yet is she in danger of being spoiled by overambition     and of realising no greater or more final reputation than     a hectical one like crashaws she has fancy feeling     imagination expression but for want of some just equipoise     or other between the material and spiritual she aims     at flights which have done no good to the strongest and     therefore falls infinitely short except in such detached     passages as we have extracted above of what a proper exercise     of her genius would infallibly reach very various and     in the main beautiful and true are the minor poems but the     entire volume deserves more than ordinary attention  footnote 40 june 24 1838  the atlas41 another paper whose literary judgments were highly esteemed at that date was somewhat colder and dwelt more on the faults of the volume but added nevertheless that there are occasional passages of great beauty and full of deep poetical feeling in the romaunt of margret it detected the influence of tennysona suggestion which miss barrett repudiated rather warmly and it concluded with the declaration that the authoress possesses a fine poetical temperament and has given to the public in this volume a work of considerable merit  footnote 41 june 23 1838  such were the principal voices among the critical world when miss barrett first ventured into its midst and she might well be satisfied with them two years later the quarterly review42 included her name in a review of modern english poetesses along with caroline norton v and others whose names are even less remembered today but though the reviewer speaks of her genius and learning in high terms of admiration he cannot be said to treat her sympathetically he objects to the dogmatic positiveness of her prefaces and protests warmly against her reckless repetition of the name of goda charge which in another connection will be found fully and fairly met in one of her later letters on points of technique he criticises her frequent use of the perfect participle with accented final syllablekissed bowed and the likeand her fondness for the adverb very both of which mannerisms he charges to the example of tennyson he condemns the prometheus though recognising it as a remarkable performance for a young lady he criticises the subject of the seraphim from which milton would have shrunk but adds we give miss barrett however the full credit of a lofty purpose and admit moreover that several particular passages in her poem are extremely fine equally profound in thought and striking in expression he sums up as follows  footnote 42 september 1840      in a word we consider miss barrett to be a woman of undoubted     genius and most unusual learning but that she has indulged     her inclination for themes of sublime mystery not certainly     without displaying great power yet at the expense of that     clearness truth and proportion which are essential to     beauty and has most unfortunately fallen into the trammels     of a school or manner of writing which of all that ever     existedlycophron lucan and gongora not forgottenis most     open to the charge of being vitiis imitabile exemplar  so much for the reception of the seraphim volume by the outside world the letters show how it appeared to the authoress herself  the first of them deserves a word of special notice because it is likewise the first in these volumes addressed to miss mary russell mitford whose name holds a high and honourable place in the roll of miss barretts friends her own account of the beginning of the friendship should be quoted in any record of mrs brownings life  my first acquaintance with elizabeth barrett commenced about fifteen years ago43 she was certainly one of the most interesting persons that i had ever seen everybody who then saw her said the same so that it is not merely the impression of my partiality or my enthusiasm of a slight delicate figure with a shower of dark curls falling on either side of a most expressive face large tender eyes richly fringed by dark eyelashes a smile like a sunbeam and such a look of youthfulness that i had some difficulty in persuading a friend in whose carriage we went together to chiswick that the translatress of the prometheus of aeschylus the authoress of the essay on mind was old enough to be introduced into company in technical language was out through the kindness of another invaluable friend44 to whom i owe many obligations but none so great as this i saw much of her during my stay in town we met so constantly and so familiarly that in spite of the difference of age45 intimacy ripened into friendship and after my return into the country we corresponded freely and frequently her letters being just what letters ought to beher own talk put upon paper46  footnote 43 this was written about the end of 1851  footnote 44 probably john kenyon whom miss mitford elsewhere calls the pleasantest man in london he on his side said of miss mitford that she was better and stronger than any of her books  footnote 45 nineteen years miss mitford having been born in 1787  footnote 46 recollections of a literary life by mary russell mitford p 155 1859  miss barretts letters show how warmly she returned this feeling of friendship which lasted until miss mitfords death in 1855 of the earlier letters many must have disappeared for it is evident from miss mitfords just quoted words and also from many references in her published correspondence that they were in constant communication during these years of miss barretts life in london after her marriage however the extant letters are far more frequent and will be found to fill a considerable place in the later pages of this work   to miss mitford 50 wimpole street thursday june 1838  we thank you gratefully dearest miss mitford papa and i and all of us thank you for your more than kindnesses the extracts were both gladdening and surprisingand the one the more for being the other also oh it was so kind of you in the midst of your multitude of occupations to make time out of love to send them to us  as to the ballad dearest miss mitford which you and mr kenyon are indulgent enough to like remember that he passed his criticism over itbefore it went to youand so if you did not find as many obscurities as he did in it the reason ishis merit and not mine but dont believe himnodont believe even mr kenyonwhenever he says that i am perversely obscure unfortunately obscure not perverselythat is quite a wrong word and the last time he used it to me and then i assure you another word still worse was with it i begged him to confine them for the future to his jesting moods because indeed i am not in the very least degree perverse in this fault of mine which is my destiny rather than my choice and comes upon me i think just where i would eschew it most so little has perversity to do with its occurrence that my fear of it makes me sometimes feel quite nervous and thoughttied in composition  i have not seen mr kenyon since i wrote last all last week i was not permitted to get out of bed and was haunted with leeches and blisters and in the course of it lady dacre was so kind as to call here and to leave a note instead of the personal greeting which i was not able to receive the honor she did me a year ago in sending me her book encouraged me to offer her my poems i hesitated about doing so at first lest it should appear as if my vanity were dreaming of a return but mr kenyons opinion turned the balance i was very sorry not to have seen lady dacre and have written a reply to her note expressive of this regret but after all this inaudible voice except in its cough could have scarcely made her understand that i was obliged by her visit had i been able to receive it  dr chambers has freed me again into the drawingroom and i am much better or he would not have done so there is not however much strength or much health nor any near prospect of regaining either it is well that in proportion to our feebleness we may feel our dependence upon god  i feel as if i had not said half and they have come to ask me if i have not said all my beloved friend may you be happy in all ways  do write whenever you wish to talk and have no one to talk to nearer you than i am indeed i did not forget dr mitford when i wrote those words although they look like it  your gratefully affectionate eb barrett   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street wednesday morning june 1838  my dear frienddo not think me depraved in ingratitude for not sooner thanking you for the pleasure made so much greater by the surprise which your note of judgment gave me the truth is that i have been very unwell and delayed answering it immediately until the painful physical feeling went away to make room for the pleasurable moral oneand this i fancied it would do every hour so that i might be able to tell you at ease all that was in my thoughts the fancy was a vain one the pain grew worse and worse and dr chambers has been here for two successive days shaking his head as awfully as if it bore all jupiters ambrosial curls and is to be here again today but with i trust a less grave countenance inasmuch as the leeches last night did their duty and i feel much bettergod be thanked for the relief but i am not yet as well as before this attack and am still confined to my bedand so you must rather imagine than read what i thought and felt in reading your wonderful note of course it pleased me very much very very muchand i dare say would have made me vain by this time if it had not been for the opportune pain and the sight of dr chamberss face  i sent a copy of my book to nelly bordman before i read your suggestion i knew that her kind feeling for me would interest her in the sight of it  thank you once more dear mr boyd may all my critics be gentle after the pattern of your gentleness  believe me affectionately yours eb barrett   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street june 17 1838  my dear friendi send you a number of the atlas which you may keep it is a favorable criticism certainlybut i confess this of my vanity that it has not altogether pleased me you see what it is to be spoilt  as to the athenaeum although i am not conscious of the quaintness and mannerism laid to my charge and am very sure that i have always written too naturally that is too much from the impulse of thought and feeling to have studied attitudes yet the critic was quite right in stating his opinion and so am i in being grateful to him for the liberal praise he has otherwise given me upon the whole i like his review better than even the examiner notwithstanding my being perfectly satisfied with that  thank you for the question about my health i am very tolerably wellfor me and am said to look better at the same time i am aware of being always on the verge of an increase of illnessi mean in a very excitable statewith a pulse that flies off at a word and is only to be caught by digitalis but i am betterfor the presentwhile the sun shines  thank you besides for your criticisms which i shall hold in memory and use whenever i am not particularly obstinate in all my succeeding editions  you will smile at that and so do i  arabel is walking in the zoological gardens with the cliffesbut i think you will see her before long  your affectionate friend eb barrett  dont let me forget to mention the essays47 you shall have yoursand miss bordman hersand the delay has not arisen from either forgetfulness or indifference on my partalthough i never deny that i dont like giving the essay to anybody because i dont like it now that sounds just like a womans reason but it isnt albeit so reasonable i meant to say because i dont like the essay  footnote 47 ie copies of the essay on mind   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street thursday june 21 1838  my dear friendnotwithstanding this silence so ungrateful in appearance i thank you at last and very sincerely for your kind letter it made me laugh and amused meand gratified me besides certainly your quality of mercy is not strained  my reason for not writing more immediately is that arabel has meant day after day to go to you and has had a separate disappointment for every day she says now indeed i hope to see mr boyd tomorrow but i say that i will not keep this answer of mine to run the risk of another days contingencies and that it shall go whether she does or not  i am better a great deal than i was last week and have been allowed by dr chambers to come downstairs again and occupy my old place on the sofa my health remains however in what i cannot help considering myself and in what i believe dr chambers considers a very precarious state and my weakness increases of course under the remedies which successive attacks render necessary dr chambers deserves my confidenceand besides the skill with which he has met the different modifications of the complaint i am grateful to him for a feeling and a sympathy which are certainly rare in such of his profession as have their attention diverted as his must be by an immense practice to fifty objects in a day but notwithstanding all one breath of the east wind undoes whatever he labours to do it is well to look up and remember that in the eternal reality these second causes are no causes at all  dont leave this note about for arabel to see i am anxious not to alarm her or any one of my family and it may please god to make me as well and strong again as ever and indeed i am twice as well this week as i was last  your affectionate friend dear mr boyd eb barrett  i have seen an extract from a private letter of mr chorley editor of the athenaeum48 which speaks huge praises of my poems if he were to say a tithe of them in print it would be nine times above my expectation  footnote 48 this is an error mr chorley was not editor of the athenaeum though he was one of its principal contributors   to hs boyd june 1838  my dear friendi begged your servant to waithow long ago i am afraid to thinkbut certainly i must not make this note very long i did intend to write to you today in any case since saturday i have had my thanks ready at the end of my fingers waiting to slide along to the nib of my pen thank you for all your kindness and criticism which is kindness toothank you at last would that i deserved the praises as well as i do most of the findingsfaultand there is no time now to say more of them yet i believe i have something to say and will find a time to say it in  dr chambers has just been here and does not think me quite as well as usual the truth is that i was rather excited and tired yesterday by rather too much talking and hearing talking and suffer for it today in my pulse but i am better on the whole  mr cross49 the great lion the insectmaking lion came yesterday with mr kenyon and afterwards lady dacre she is kind and gentle in her manner she told me that she had placed my book in the hands of mr bobus smith the brother of sidney smith and the best judge in england and that it was to be returned to her on tuesday if i should hear the judgment i will tell you whether you care to hear it or not there is no other review as far as i am aware  give my love to miss bordman when is she coming to see me  the thunder did not do me any harm  your affectionate friend in great haste although your servant is not likely to think so ebb  footnote 49 andrew crosse the electrician who had recently published his observations of a remarkable development of insect life in connection with certain electrical experimentsa discovery which caused much controversy at the time on account of its supposed bearings on the origin of life and the doctrine of creation   to hs boyd june 1838  my dear friendyou must let me feel my thanks to you even when i do not say them i have put up your various notes together and perhaps they may do me as much good hereafter as they have already for the most part given me pleasure  the burden pure have been certainly was a misprint as certainly nor man nor nature satisfy50 is ungrammatical but i am not so sure about the passage in isobel  i am not used to tears at nights instead of slumbernor to prayer  now i think that the passage may imply a repetition of the words with which it begins after northusnor am i used to prayer c either you or i may be right about it and either or or nor may be grammatical at least so i pray51  you did not answer one question do you consider that apolyptic stands without excuse52  i never read greek to any person except yourself and mr macswiney my brothers tutor to him i read longer than a few weeks but then it was rather guessing and stammering and tottering through parts of homer and extracts from xenophon than reading you would not have called it reading if you had heard it  i studied hard by myself afterwards and the kindness with which afterwards still you assisted me if yourself remembers gladly i remember gratefully and gladly  i have just been told that your servant was desired by you not to wait a minute  the wind is unfavorable for the sea i do not think there is the least probability of my going before the end of next week if then you shall hear  affectionately yours eb barrett  i am tolerably well i have been forced to take digitalis again which makes me feel weak but still i am better i think  footnote 50 altered in later editions to satisfies  footnote 51 in later editions not is repeated instead of nor which looks like a compromise between her own opinion and mr boyds  footnote 52 the poem entitled sounds in the volume of 1838 contained the line as erst in patmos apolyptic john presumably for apocalyptic this being naturally held to be without excuse the line was altered in subsequent editions to as the seersaint of patmos loving john   in the course of this year the failure in miss barretts health had become so great that her doctor advised removal to a warmer climate for the winter torquay was the place selected and thither she went in the autumn accompanied by her brother edward her favourite companion from childhood other members of the family including mr barrett joined them from time to time at torquay she was able to live but no more and it was found necessary for her to stay during the summers as well as the winters of the next three years letters from this period are scarce though it is clear from miss mitfords correspondence that a continuous interchange of letters was kept up between the two friends and her acquaintanceship with horne was now ripening into a close literary intimacy a story relating to bishop phillpotts of exeter the hero of so many racy anecdotes is contained in a letter of miss barretts which must have been written about christmas of either 1838 or 1839  he the bishop was however at church on christmas day and upon mr elliots being mercifully inclined to omit the athanasian creed prompted him most episcopally from the pew with a whereas and further on in the creed when the benign reader substituted the word condemnation for the terrible onedamnation exclaimed the bishop the effect must have been rather startling  a slight acquaintance with the words of the athanasian creed will suggest that the story had suffered in accuracy before it reached miss barrett who of course was unable to attend church and whose own ignorance on the subject may be accounted for by remembering that she had been brought up as a nonconformist with a little correction however the story may be added to the many others on record with respect to henry of exeter  the following letter is shown by the similarity of its contents to the one which succeeds it to belong to november 1839 when miss barrett was entering on her second winter in torquay   to mrs martin beacon terrace torquay november 24 1839  my dearest mrs martinhenrietta shall not write today whatever she may wish to do i felt in reading your unreproaching letter to her as selfreproachful as anybody could with a great deal of innocence in the way of the world to fall back upon i felt sorry very sorry not to have written something to you something sooner which was a possible thingalthough since the day of my receiving your welcome letter i have written scarcely at all nor that little without much exertion had it been with me as usual be sure that you should not have had any silence to complain of henrietta knew i wished to write and felt i suppose unwilling to take my place when my filling it myself before long appeared possible a long storyand not as entertaining as mother hubbard but i would rather tire you than leave you under any wrong impression where my regard and thankfulness to you dearest mrs martin are concerned  to reply to your kind anxiety about me i may call myself decidedly better than i have been since october i i have not been out of bedexcept just for an hour a day when i am lifted to the sofa with the bare permission of my physicianwho tells me that it is so much easier to make me worse than better that he dares not permit anything like exposure or further exertion i like him dr scully very much and although he evidently thinks my case in the highest degree precarious yet knowing how much i bore last winter and understanding from him that the worst tubercular symptoms have not actually appeared i am willing to think it may be gods will to keep me here still longer i would willingly stay if it were only for the sake of that tender affection of my beloved family which it so deeply affects me to consider dearest papa is with us nowto my great comfort and joy and looking very welland astonishing everybody with his eternal youthfulness bro and henrietta and arabel besides i can count as companionsand then there is dear bummy we are fixed at torquay for the winterthat is until the end of may and after that if i have any will or power and am alive to exercise either i do trust and hope to go away the death of my kind friend dr bury was as you suppose a great grief and shock to me how could it be otherwise after his daily kindness to me for a year and then his young wife and childand the rapidity a three weeks illness with which he was hurried away from the energies and toils and honors of professional life to the stillness of that death  gods will is the only answer to the mystery of the worlds afflictions  dont fancy me worse than i amor that this bedkeeping is the result of a gradual sinking it is not so a feverish attack prostrated me on october 2and such will leave their effectsand dr scully is so afraid of leading me into danger by saying you may get up and dress as usual that you should not be surprised if in virtue of being the senior torquay physician and correspondingly prudent he left me in this durance vile for a great part of the winter i am decidedly better than i was a month ago really and truly  may god bless you dearest mrs martin my best and kindest regards to mr martin henrietta desires me to promise for her a letter to colwall soon but i think that one from colwall should come first may god bless you bros fancy just now is painting in water colours and he performs many sketches do you ever in your dreams of universal benevolence dream of travelling into devonshire  love your affectionate ba  found guilty of egotism and stupidity by this sign and at once   to hs boyd 1 beacon terrace torquay wednesday november 27 1839  if you can forgive me my ever dear friend for a silence which has not been intended there will be another reason for being thankful to you in addition to the many to do myself justice one of my earliest impulses on seeing my beloved arabel and recurring to the kindness with which you desired that happiness for me long before i possessed it was to write and tell you how happy i felt but she had promised she said to write herself and moreover she and only she was to send you the balladin expectation of your dread judgment upon which i delayed my own writing it came in the first letter we received in our new house on the first of last october an hour after reading it i was upon my bed was attacked by fever in the night and from that bed have never even been lifted sinceto these last days of novemberexcept for one hour a day to the sofa at two yards distance i am very much better now and have been so for some time but my physician is so persuaded he says that it is easier to do me harm than good that he will neither permit any present attempt at further exertion nor hint at the time when it may be advisable for him to permit it under the circumstances it has of course been more difficult than usual for me to write pray believe my dear and kind friend in the face of all circumstances and appearances that i never forget you nor am reluctant oh how could that be to write to you and that you shall often have to pay a penny for my thoughts under the new postage actif it be in gods wisdom and mercy to spare me through the winter under the new act i shall not mind writing ten words and then stopping as it is they would scarcely be worth eleven pennies  thank you again and again for your praise of the ballad which both delighted and surprised me  as i had scarcely hoped that you might like it at all think of mr tilts never sending me a proof sheet the consequences are rather deplorable and if they had occurred to you might have suggested a deep melancholy for life in my case i who am you know hardened to sins of carelessness simply look aghast at the misprints and mispunctuations coming in as a flood and sweeping away meanings and melodies together the annual itself is more splendid than usual and its vignettes have illustrated my storyangels devils and allmost beautifully miss mitfords tales in prose have suffered besides by reason of mr tiltbut are attractive and graphic notwithstandingand mr horne has supplied a dramatic poem of great power and beauty  how i rejoice with you in the glorious revelation about to be of gregorys second volume the de virginitate poem will in its new purple and fine linen be more dazzling than ever  do you know that george is barristeratlaw of the inner templeis i have seen him gazetted  my dearest papa is with me now making me very happy of course i have much reason to be happymore to be gratefulyet am more obedient to the former than to the latter impulse may the giver of good give gratitude with as full a hand may he bless youand bring us together again if no more in the flesh yet in the spirit  your ever affectionate friend eb barrett  do writewhen you are able and least disinclined do you approve of prince albert or not53  footnote 53 the engagement of prince albert to queen victoria took place in october 1839   to hs boyd torquay may 29 1840  my ever dear friendit was very pleasant to me to see your seal upon a letter once more and although the letter itself left me with a mournful impression of your having passed some time so much less happily than i would wish and pray for you yet there remains the pleasant thought to me still that you have not altogether forgotten me do receive the expression of my most affectionate sympathy under this and every circumstanceand i fear that the shock to your nerves and spirits could not be a light one however impressed you might be and must be with the surety and verity of gods love working in all his will poor poor patience coming to be so happy with you with that joyous smile i thought so pretty do you not remember my telling you so wellit is well and better for her happier for her if god in christ jesus have received her than her hopes were of the holiday time with you the holiday is for ever now  i heard from nelly bordman only a few days before receiving your letter and so far from preparing me for all this sadness and gloom she pleased me with her account of you whom she had lately seendwelling upon your retrograde passage into youth and the delight you were taking in the presence and society of some still more youthful fair and gay monstrum amandum some prodigy of intellectual accomplishment some little circe who never turned anybodies into pigs i learnt too from her for the first time that you were settled at hampstead whereabout at hampstead and for how long she didnt tell me that thinking of course that i knew something more about you than i do yes indeed you do treat me very shabbily i agree with you in thinking so to think that so many hills and woods should interpose between usthat i should be lying here fast bound by a spell a sleeping beauty in a forest and that you who used to be such a doughty knight should not take the trouble of cutting through even a hazel tree with your good sword to find out what had become of me now do tell me the hazel tree being down at last whether you mean to live at hampstead whether you have taken a house there and have carried your books there and wear hampstead grasshoppers in your bonnet as they did at athens to prove yourself of the soil  all this nonsense will make you think i am better and indeed i am pretty well just nowquite however confined to the bedexcept when lifted from it to the sofa babywise while they make it even then apt to faint bad symptoms too do not leave me and i am obliged to be blistered every few daysbut i am free from any attack just now and am a good deal less feverish than i am occasionally there has been a consultation between an exeter physician and my own and they agree exactly both hoping that with care i shall pass the winter and rally in the spring both hoping that i may be able to go about again with some comfort and independence although i never can be fit again for anything like exertion  do you know did you ever hear anything of mr horne who wrote cosmo de medici and the death of marlowe and is now desecrating his powers i beg your pardon by writing the life of napoleon by the way he is the author of a dramatic sketch in the last finden  he is in my mind one of the very first poets of the day and has written to me so kindly offering although i never saw him in my life to cater for me in literature and send me down anything likely to interest me in the periodicals that i cannot but think his amiability and genius do honor to one another   do you remember mr caldicott who used to preach in the infant schoolroom at sidmouth he died here the death of a saint as he had lived a saintly life about three weeks ago it affected me a good deal but he was always so associated in my thoughts more with heaven than earth that scarcely a transition seems to have passed upon his locality present with the lord is true of him now even as having his conversation in heaven was formerly there is little difference  may it be so with us all with you and with me my ever and very dear friend in the meantime do not forget me i never can forget you  your affectionate and grateful elizabeth b barrett  arabel desires her love to be offered to you   to hs boyd 1 beacon terrace torquay july 8 1840  my ever dear friendi must write to you although it is so very long or at least seems so since you wrote to me but you say to arabel in speaking of me that i used to care for what is poetical therefore perhaps you say to yourself sometimes that i used to care for you i am anxious to vindicate my identity to you in that respect above all  it is a long dreary time since i wrote to you i admit the pause on my own part while i charge you with another but your silence has embraced more pleasantness and less suffering to you than mine has to me and i thank god for a prosperity in which my unchangeable regard for you causes me to share directly  i have not rallied this summer as soon and well as i did last i was very ill early in april at the time of our becoming conscious to our great afflictionso ill as to believe it utterly improbable speaking humanly that i ever should be any better i am however a very great deal better and gain strength by sensible degrees however slowly and do hope for the bestthe best meaning one sight more of london in the meantime i have not yet been able to leave my bed  to prove to you that i who used to care for poetry do so still and that i have not been absolutely idle lately an athenaeum shall be sent to you containing a poem on the subject of the removal of napoleons ashes54 it is a fitter subject for you than for me napoleon is no idol of mine i never made a setting sun of him but my physician suggested the subject as a noble one and then there was something suggestive in the consideration that the bellerophon lay on those very baywaters opposite to my bed  another poem which you wont like i dare say is called the lay of the rose55 and appeared lately in a magazine arabel is going to write it out for you she desires me to tell you with her best love indeed i have written lately as far as manuscript goes a good deal only on all sorts of subjects and in as many shapes  lazarus would make a fine poem wouldnt he i lie here weaving a great many schemes i am seldom at a loss for thread  do write sometimes to me and tell me if you do anything besides hearing the clocks strike and bells ring my beloved papa is with me still there are so many mercies close around me and his presence is far from the least that gods being seems proved to me demonstrated to me by his manifested love may his blessing in the full lovingness rest upon you always never fancy i can forget or think of you coldly  your affectionate and grateful elizabeth b barrett  footnote 54 crowned and buried poetical works iii 9  footnote 55 poetical works iii 152   the above letter was written only three days before the tragedy which utterly wrecked elizabeth barretts life for a time and cast a deep shadow over it which never wholly passed awaythe death of her brother edward through drowning on july 11 he and two friends had gone for a sail in a small boat they did not return when they were expected and presently a rumour came that a boat answering in appearance to theirs had been seen to founder in babbicombe bay but it was not until three days later that final confirmation of the disaster was obtained by the discovery of the bodies what this blow meant to the bereaved sister cannot be told the horror with which she refers to it even at a distance of many years shows how deeply it struck it was the loss of the brother whom she loved best of all and she had the misery of thinking that it was to attend on her that he had come to the place where he met his death little wonder if torquay was thenceforward a memory from which she shrank and if even the sound of the sea became a horror to her  one natural consequence of this terrible sorrow is a long break in her correspondence it is not until the beginning of 1841 that she seems to have resumed the thread of her life and to have returned to her literary occupations her health had inevitably suffered under the shock and in the autumn of 1840 miss mitford speaks of not daring to expect more than a few months of lingering life but when things were at the worst she began unexpectedly to take a turn for the better through the winter she slowly gathered strength and with strength the desire to escape from torquay with its dreadful associations and to return to london meanwhile her correspondence with her friends revived and with horne in particular she was engaged during 1841 in an active interchange of views with regard to two literary projects indeed it was only the return to work that enabled her to struggle against the numbing effect of the calamity which had overwhelmed her some time afterwards in october 1843 she wrote to mrs martin for my own part and experiencei do not say it as a phrase or in exaggeration but from very clear and positive convictioni do believe that i should be mad at this moment if i had not forced backdammed outthe current of rushing recollections by work work work one of the projects in which she was concerned was chaucer modernised a scheme for reviving interest in the father of english poetry suggested in the first instance by wordsworth but committed to the care of horne as editor for execution according to the scheme as originally planned all the principal poets of the day were to be invited to share the task of transmuting chaucer into modern language wordsworth leigh hunt horne and others actually executed some portions of the work tennyson and browning it was hoped would lend a hand with some of the later parts horne invited miss barrett to contribute and besides executing modernisations of queen annelida and false arcite and the complaint of annelida56 she also advised generally on the work of the other writers during its progress through the press the other literary project was for a lyrical drama to be written in collaboration with horne it was to be called psyché apocalypté and was to be a drama on the greek model treating of the birth and selfrealisation of the soul of man  footnote 56 these versions are not reprinted in her collected poetical works but are to be found in poems of geoffrey chaucer modernised 1841  the sketch of its contents given in the correspondence with horne will make the modern reader accept with equanimity the fact that it never progressed beyond the initial stage of drafting the plot it is allegorical philosophical fantastic unrealeverything which was calculated to bring out the worst characteristics of miss barretts style and to intensify her faults fortunately her removal from torquay to london interrupted the execution of the scheme it was never seriously taken up again and though never explicitly abandoned died a natural death from inanition somewhat to the relief of miss barrett who had come to recognise its impracticability  apart from the correspondence with horne which has been published elsewhere very few letters are left from this period but those which here follow serve to bridge over the interval until the departure from torquay which closes one wellmarked period in the life of the poetess   to mrs martin december 11 1840  my ever dearest mrs martini should have written to you without this last proof of your remembrancethis cape which warm and pretty as it is i value so much more as the work of your hands and gift of your affection towards me thank you dearest mrs martin and thank you too for all the restfor all your sympathy and love and do believe that although grief had so changed me from myself and warped me from my old instincts as to prevent my looking forwards with pleasure to seeing you again yet that full amends are made in the looking back with a pleasure more true because more tender than any old retrospections do give my love to dear mr martin and say what i could not have said even if i had seen him  shall you really dearest mrs martin come again dont think we do not think of the hope you left us because we do indeed  a note from papa has brought the comforting news that my dear dear stormie is in england again in london and looking perfectly well it is a mercy which makes me very thankful and would make me joyful if anything could but the meanings of some words change as we live on papas note is hurried it was a sixtyday passage and that is all he tells me yesthere is something besides about sette and occy being either unknown or misknown through the fault of their growing papa is not near returning i think he has so much to do and see and so much cause to be enlivened and renewed as to spirits that i begged him not to think about me and stay away as long as he pleased and the accounts of him and of all at home are satisfying i thank god  there is an east wind just now which i feel nevertheless dr scully has said a few minutes since that i am as well as he could hope considering the season  may god bless you ever your gratefully attached ba   to mrs martin march 29 1841  my dearest mrs martinhave you thought the dream has come true i mean the dream of the flowers which you pulled for me and i wouldnt look at even i fear you must have thought that the dream about my ingratitude has come true  and yet it has not dearest mrs martin it has not i have not forgotten you or remembered you less affectionately through all the silence or longed less for the letters i did not ask for but the truth is my faculties seem to hang heavily now like flappers when the spring is broken my spring is broken and a separate exertion is necessary for the lifting up of eachand then it falls down again i never felt so before there is no wonder that i should feel so now nevertheless i dont give up much to the pernicious languorthe tendency to lie down to sleep among the snows of a weary journeyi dont give up much to it only i find it sometimes at the root of certain negligencesfor instance of this toward you  dearest mrs martin receive my sympathy our sympathy in the anxiety you have lately felt so painfully and in the rejoicing for its happy issue do say when you write i take for granted you see that you will write how mrs b is nowbesides the intelligence more nearly touching me of your own and mr martins health and spirits may god bless you both  ah but you did not come i was disappointed  and mrs hanford do you know i tremble in my reveries sometimes lest you should think it guess it to be half unkind in me not to have made an exertion to see mrs hanford it was not from want of interest in herleast of all from want of love to you but i have not stirred from my bed yet but to be honest that was not the reasoni did not feel as if i could without a painful effort which on the other hand could not i was conscious result in the slightest shade of satisfaction to her receive and talk to her perhaps it is hard for you to fancy even how i shrink away from the very thought of seeing a human faceexcept those immediately belonging to me in love or relationshipyours does you knowand a strangers might be easier to look at than one long known  for my own part my dearest mrs martin my heart has been lightened lately by kind honest dr scully who would never give an opinion just to please me saying that i am quite right to mean to go to london and shall probably be fit for the journey early in june he says that i may pass the winter there moreover and with impunitythat wherever i am it will probably be necessary for me to remain shut up during the cold weather and that under such circumstances it is quite possible to warm a london room to as safe a condition as a room here so my heart is lightened of the fear of opposition and the only means of regaining whatever portion of earthly happiness is not irremediably lost to me by the divine decree i am free to use in the meantime it really does seem to me that i make some progress in healthif the word in my lips be not a mockery oh i fancy i shall be strengthened to get home  your remarks on chaucer pleased me very much i am glad you liked what i didor tried to doand as to the criticisms you were rightand they shant be unattended to if the opportunity of correction be given to me  ever your affectionate ba   to hs boyd august 28 1841  my very dear friendi have fluctuated from one shadow of uncertainty and anxiety to another all the summer on the subject to which my last earthly wishes cling and i delayed writing to you to be able to say i am going to london i may say so nowas far as the human may say yes or no of their futurity the carriage a patent carriage with a bed in it and set upon some hundreds of springs is i believe on its road down to me and immediately upon its arrival we begin our journey whether we shall ever complete it remains uncertainmore so than other uncertainties my physician appears a good deal alarmed calls it an undertaking full of hazard and myself the empress catherine for insisting upon attempting it but i must i go as the doves to their windows to the only earthly daylight i see here i go to rescue myself from the associations of this dreadful place i go to restore to my poor papa the companionships family enough has been done and suffered for me i thank god i am going home at last  how kind it was in you my very kind and ever very dear friend to ask me to visit you at hampstead i felt myself smiling while i read that part of your letter and laid it down and suffered the vision to arise of your little room and your great gregory and your dear self scolding me softly as in the happy olden times for not reading slow enough wellwe do not know what may happen i may even that is probable read to you again but nowah my dear friendif you could imagine me such as i amyou would not think i could visit you yet i am wonderfully better this summer and if i can but reach home and bear the first painful excitement it will do me more good than anythingi know it will and if it does not it will be well even so  i shall tell them to send you the athenaeum of last week where i have a house of clouds57 which papa likes so much that he would wish to live in it if it were not for the damp there is not a clock in one roomthats another objection how are your clocks do they go and do you like their voices as well as you used to do  i think annie is not with you but in case of her still being so do give her and yourself too arabels love and mine i wish i heard of you oftener is there nobody to write may god bless you  your ever affectionate friend ebb   to hs boyd august 31 1831 sic  thank you my ever dear friend with almost my last breath at torquay for your kindness about the gregory besides the kind note itself it is however too late we go or mean at present to go tomorrow and the carriage which is to waft us through the air upon a thousand springs has actually arrived you are not to think severely upon dr scullys candour with me as to the danger of the journey he does think it likely to do me harm therefore you know he was justified by his medical responsibility in laying before me all possible consequences i have considered them all and dare them gladly and gratefully papas domestic comfort is broken up by the separation in his family and the associations of this place lie upon me struggle as i may like the oppression of a perpetual nightmare it is an instinct of selfpreservation which impels me to escapeor to try to escape and in gods mercythough god forbid that i should deny either his mercy or his justice if he should deny mewe may be together in wimpole street in a few days nelly bordman has kindly written to me mr jagos favourable opinion of the patent carriages and his conviction of my accomplishing the journey without inconvenience  may god bless you my dear dear friend give my love to dearest annie perhaps if i am ever really in wimpole street safe enough for greek you will trust the poems to me which you mention i care as much for poetry as ever and could not more  your affectionate and grateful elizabeth b barrett  footnote 57 poetical works iii 186     chapter iii  18411843   in september 1841 the journey from torquay was actually achieved and miss barrett returned to her fathers house in london from which she was never to be absent for more than a few hours at a time until the day five years later when she finally left it to join her husband robert browning her life was that of an invalid confined to her room for the greater part of each year and unable to see any but a few intimate friends still she regained some sort of strength especially during the warmth of the summer months and was able to throw herself with real interest into literary work in a life such as this there are few outward events to record and its story is best told in miss barretts own letters which for the most part need little comment the letters of the end of 1841 and beginning of 1842 are almost entirely written to mr boyd and the main subject of them is the series of papers on the greek christian poets and the english poets which at the suggestion of mr dilke then editor of the athenaeum she contributed to that periodical of the composition of original poetry we hear less at this time   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street october 2 1841  my very dear friendi thank you for the letter and books which crossed the threshold of this house before me and looked like your welcome to me home i have read the passages you wished me to readi have read them again for i remember reading them under your star or the greater part of them a long while ago you on the other hand may remember of me that i never could concede to you much admiration for your gregory as a poetnot even to his grand work de virginitate he is one of those writers of whom there are instances in our own times who are only poetical in prose  the passage imitative of chryses i cannot think much of try to be forgiving it is toasted dry between the two fires of the scriptures and homer and is as stiff as any dry toast out of the simile to be sincere i like dry toast better  the hymns and prayers i very much prefer and although i remembered a good deal about them it has given me a pleasure you will approve of to go through them in this edition the one which i like best which i like far best which i think worth all the rest de virginitate and all put together is the second upon page 292 beginning soi charis it is very fine i think written out of the heart and for the heart warm with a natural heat and not toasted dry and brown and stiff at a fire by any means  dear mr boyd i coveted arabels walk to you the other day i shall often covet my neighbours walks i believe although and may god be praised for it i am more happythat is nearing to the feeling of happiness nowthan a month since i could believe possible to a heart so bruised and crushed as mine has been be at home is a blessing and a relief beyond what these words can say  but dear mr boyd you said something in a note to arabel some little time ago which i will ask of your kindness to avoid saying again i have been through the whole summer very much better and even if it were not so i should dread being annoyed by more medical speculations pray do not suggest any i am not in a state to admit of experiments and my case is a very clear and simple one i have not one symptom like those of my old illness and after more than fifteen years absolute suspension of them their recurrence is scarcely probable my case is very clear not tubercular consumption not what is called a decline but an affection of the lungs which leans towards it you know a bloodvessel broke three years ago and i never quite got over it mr jago not having seen me could scarcely be justified in a conjecture of the sort when the opinions of four able physicians two of them particularly experienced in diseases of the chest and the other two the most eminent of the faculty in the east and west of england were decided and contrary while coincident with each other besides you see i am becoming betterand i could not desire more than that dear mr boyd do not write a word about it any more either to me or others i am sure you would not willingly disturb me nelly bordman is good and dear but i cant let her prescribe for me anything except her own affection  i hope arabel expressed for me my thankful sense of mrs smiths kind intention but indeed although i would see you dear mr boyd gladly or an angel or a fairy or any very particular friend i am not fit either in body or spirit for general society i cant see people and if i could it would be very bad for me is mrs smith writing are you writing part of me is worn out but the poetical partthat is the love of poetryis growing in me as freshly and strongly as if it were watered every day did anybody ever love it and stop in the middle i wonder if anybody ever did believe me your affectionateebb   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street december 29 1841  my dear friendi should not have been half as idle about transcribing these translations58 if i had fancied you could care so much to have them as arabel tells me you do they are recommended to your mercy o greek daniel the last sounds in my ears most like english poetry but i assure you i took the least pains with it the second is obscure as its original if it do not as it does not equal it otherwise the first is yet more unequal to the greek i praised that greek poem above all of gregorys for the reason that it has unity and completeness for which to speak generally you may search the streets and squares and alleys of nazianzum in vain tell me what you think of my part  ever affectionately yours elizabeth b barrett  have you a plotinus and would you trust him to me in that case oh no you do not tempt me with your musical clocks my time goes to the best music when i read or write and whatever money i can spend upon my own pleasures flows away in books  footnote 58 translations of three poems of gregory nazianzen printed in the athenaeum of january 8 1842   to mr westwood59 50 wimpole street january 2 1842  miss barrett inferring mr westwood from the handwriting begs his acceptance of the unworthy little book60 he does her the honour of desiring to see  it is more unworthy than he could have expected when he expressed that desire having been written in very early youth when the mind was scarcely free in any measure from trammels and popes and what is worse when flippancy of language was too apt to accompany immaturity of opinion the miscellaneous verses are still more than the chief poem childish things in a strict literal sense and the whole volume is of little interest even to its writer except for personal reasonsexcept for the traces of dear affections since rudely wounded and of that love of poetry which began with her sooner than so soon and must last as long as life does without being subject to the changes of life little more therefore can remain for such a volume than to be humble and shrink from circulation yet mr westwoods kind words win it to his hands will he receive at the same moment the expression of touched and gratified feelings with which miss barrett read what he wrote on the subject of her later volumes still very imperfect although more mature and true to the truth within indeed she is thankful for what he said so kindly in his note to her  footnote 59 mr thomas westwood was the author of a volume of poems published in 1840 beads from a rosary 1843 the burden of the bell 1850 and other volumes of verse several of his compositions were appearing occasionally in the athenaeum at the time when this correspondence with miss barrett commenced  footnote 60 the essay on mind   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street january 6 1842  my dear friendi have done your bidding and sent the translations to the athenaeum attaching to them an infamous prefatory note which says all sorts of harm of gregorys poetry you will be very angry with it and me  and you may be angry for another reasonthat in the midst of my true thankfulness for the emendations you sent me i ventured to reject one or two of them you are right probably and i wrong but still i thought within myself with a womanly obstinacy not altogether peculiar to meif he and i were to talk together about them he would kindly give up the point to meso that now we cannot talk together i might as well take it well you will see what i have done try not to be angry with me you shall have the athenaeum as soon as possible  my dear mr boyd you know how i disbelieved the probability of these papers being accepted you will comprehend my surprise on receiving last night a very courteous note from the editor which i would send to you if it were legible to anybody except people used to learn reading from the pyramids he wishes me to contribute to the athenaeum some prose papers in the form of reviewsthe review being a mere form and the book a mere text he is not very clearbut i fancy that a few translations of excerpta with a prose analysis and synthesis of the original authors genius might suit his purpose now suppose i took up some of the early christian greek poets and wrote a few continuous papers so61 give me your advice my dear friend i think of synesius for one suppose you send me a list of the names which occur to you will you advise me will you write directly will you make allowance for my teazing you will you lend me your little synesius and clarkes book i mean the one commenced by dr clarke and continued by his son above all things however i want the advice  ever affectionately yours ebb   to hs boyd wednesday january 13 1842 postmark  my dear friendthank you thank you for your kind suggestion and advice altogether i had just when your note arrived finished two hymns of synesius one being the seventh and the other the ninth oh i do remember that you performed upon the latter and my modesty should have certainly bid me avaunt from it nevertheless it is so fine so prominent in the first class of synesiuss beauties that i took courage and dismissed my scruples and have produced a version which i have not compared to yours at all hitherto but which probably is much rougher and rather closer winning in faith what it loses in elegance elegance isnt a word for me you know generally speaking the barbarians herd with me by two and three  i had a letter today from mr dilke who agrees to everything closes with the idea about christian greek poets only begging me to keep away from theology and suggesting a subsequent reviewal of english poetical literature from chaucer down to our times62 well but the greek poets with all your kindness i have scarcely sufficient materials for a full and minute survey of them i have won a sight of the poetae christiani but the price is ruinousfourteen guineas and then the work consists almost entirely of latin poets deducting gregory and nonnus and john damascenus and a cento from homer by somebody or other turning the leaves rapidly i do not see much else and you know i may get a separate copy of john dam and have access to the rest try to turn in your head what i should do greg nyssen did not write poems did he have i a chance of seeing your copy of mr clarkes book it would be useful in the matters of chronology  i humbly beg your pardon and gregorys for the insolence of my note it was as brief as it could be and did not admit of any extended reference and admiration to his qualities as an orator but whoever read it to you should have explained that when i wrote he was an orator the word orator was marked emphatically so as to appear printed in capital letters of emphasis do not say you chose you chose i didnt and dont choose to be obstinate indeed but i cant see the sense of that heavenly soul  ever your grateful and affectionate ebb  i shall have room for praising gregory in these papers  footnote 61 the series of papers on the greek christian poets appeared in the athenaeum for february and march 1842 they are reprinted in the poetical works v 109200  footnote 62 this scheme took shape in the series of papers on the english poets which appeared in the athenaeum in the course of june and august 1842 reprinted in poetical works v 201290   to hs boyd february 4 1842  my dear friendyou must be thinking if you are not a st boyd for good temper that among the gregorys and synesiuses i have forgotten everything about you no indeed it has not been so i have never stopped being grateful to you for your kind notes and the two last pieces of gregory although i did not say an overt thank you but i have been very very busy besides and thus i answered to myself for your being kind enough to pardon a silence which was compelled rather than voluntary  do you ever observe that as vexations dont come alone occupations dont and that if you happen to be engaged upon one particular thing it is the signal for your being waylaid by bundles of letters desiring immediate answers and proof sheets or manuscript works whose writers request your opinion while their printer waits the old saints are not responsible for all the filling up of my time i have been busy upon busy  the first part of my story about the greek poets went to the athenaeum some days ago but although graciously received by the editor it wont appear this week or i should have had a proof sheet which was promised to me before now i must contrive to include all i have to say on the subject in three parts they will admit they tell me a fourth if i please but evidently they would prefer as much brevity as i could vouchsafe only two poets are in the first notice and twenty remainand neither of the two is gregory  will you let me see that volume of gregory which contains the christus patiens send it by any boy on the heath and i will remunerate him for the walk and the burden and thank you besides oh dont be afraid i am not going to charge it upon gregory but on the younger apollinaris whose claim is stronger and i rather wish to refresh my recollection of the height and breadth of that tragic misdemeanour  it is quite true that i never have suffered much pain and equally so that i continue most decidedly better notwithstanding the winter i feel tooi do hope not ungratefullythe blessing granted to me in the possibility of literary occupationwhich is at once occupation and distraction carlyle not the infidel but the philosopher calls literature a fireproof pleasure how truly how deeply i have felt that truth  may god bless you dear mr boyd i dont despair of looking in your face one day yet before my last  ever your affectionate and obliged ebb  arabels love   to hs boyd march 2 1842  my ever very dear frienddo receive the assurance that whether i leave out the right word or put in the wrong one you never can be other to me than just that while i live and why not after i have ceased to live and nowwhat have i done in the meantime to be called miss barrett i pause for a reply  of course it gives me very great pleasure to hear you speak so kindly of my first paper some bona avis as good as a nightingale must have shaken its wings over me as i began it and if it will but sit on the same spray while i go on towards the end i shall rejoice exactly fourfold the third paper went to mr dilke today and i was so fidgety about getting it away and it seemed to cling to my writing case with both its hands that i would not do any writing even as little as this note until it was quite gone out of sight you know it is possible that he the editor may not please to have the fourth paper but even in that case it is better for the remarks to remain fragmentary than be compressed till they are as dry as a hortus siccus of poets  certainly you do and must praise my number one too much number one thats myself thinks so i do really and the supererogatory virtue of kindness may be acknowledged out of the pale of the romish church  in regard to gregory and synesius you will see presently that i have not wronged them altogether  as you have ordered the athenaeums i will not send one tomorrow so as to repeat my ill fortune of being too late but tell me if you would like to have any from me and how many  it was very kind in you to pat flushs63 head in defiance of danger and from pure regard for me i kissed his head where you had patted it which association of approximations i consider as an imitation of shaking hands with you and as the next best thing to it you understanddont youthat flush is my constant companion my friend my amusement lying with his head on one page of my folios while i read the other not your foliosi respect your books be sure oh i dare say if the truth were known flush understands greek excellently well  i hope you are right in thinking that we shall meet again once i wished not to live but the faculty of life seems to have sprung up in me again from under the crushing foot of heavy grief  be it all as god wills  believe me your ever affectionate  ebb  footnote 63 miss barretts dog the gift of miss mitford his praise is sung in her poem to flush my dog poetical works iii 19 and in many of the following letters he accompanied his mistress to italy lived to a good old age and now lies buried in the vaults of casa guidi    to hs boyd saturday night march 5 1842  my very dear friendi am quite angry with myself for forgetting your questions when i answered your letter  could you really imagine that i have not looked into the greek tragedians for years with my true love for greek poetry that is asking a question you will say and not answering it well then i answer by a yes the one you put to me i had two volumes of euripides with me in devonshire and have read him as well as aeschylus and sophoclesthat is from themboth before and since i went there you know i have gone through every line of the three tragedians long ago in the way of regular consecutive reading  you know also that i had at different times read different dialogues of plato but when three years ago and a few months previous to my leaving home i became possessed of a complete edition of his works edited by bekker why then i began with the first volume and went through the whole of his writings both those i knew and those i did not know one after another and have at this time read not only all that is properly attributed to plato but even those dialogues and epistles which pass falsely under his nameeverything except two books i think or three of the treatise de legibus which i shall finish in a week or two as soon as i can take breath from mr dilke  now the questions are answered  ever your affectionate and grateful friend ebb   to hs boyd thursday march 10 1842 postmark  my very dear friendi did not know until today whether the paper would appear on saturday or not but as i have now received the proof sheets there can be no doubt of it i have been and am hurried and hunted almost into a corner through the pressing for the fourth paper and the difficulty about books you will forgive a very short note to night  i have read of aristotle only his poetics his ethics and his work upon rhetoric but i mean to take him regularly into both hands when i finish platos last page aristophanes i took with me into devonshire and after all i do not know much more of him than three or four of his plays may stand for next week my very dear friend i shall be at your commands and sit in spirit at your footstool to hear and answer anything you may care to ask mebut oh what have i done that you should talk to me about venturing or liberty or anything of that kind  from your affectionate and grateful catechumen ebb   to hs boyd march 29 1842  my very dear friendi received your long letter and receive your short one and thank you for the pleasure of both of course i am very very glad of your approval in the matter of the papers and your kindness could not have wished to give me more satisfaction than it gave actually mr kenyon tells me that mr burgess64 has been reading and commending the papers and has brought me from him a newly discovered scene of the bacchae of euripides edited by mr burgess himself for the gentlemens magazine and of which he considers that the planctus mariae at least the passage i extracted from it is an imitation should you care to see it say yesand i will send it to you  do you think it was wrong to make eternity feminine i knew that the greek word was not feminine but imagined that the english personification should be so am i wrong in this will you consider the subject again  ah yes that was a mistake of mine about putting constantine for constantius i wrote from memory and the memory betrayed me but say nothing about it nobody will find it out i send you silentiarius and some poems of pisida in the same volume even if you had not asked for them i should have asked you to look at some passages which are fine in both it appears to me that silentiarius writes difficult greek overlaying his description with a multitude of architectural and other far fetched words pisida is hard too occasionally from other causes particularly in the hexaëmeron which is not in the book i send you but in another very gigantic one as tall as the irish giants which you may see if you please i will send a coach and six with it if you please  john mauropus of the three towns i owe the knowledge of to you you lent me the book with his poems you know he is a great favorite of mine in all ways i very much admire his poetry  believe me ever your affectionate and grateful  elizabeth b barrett  pray tell me what you think i am sorry to observe that the book i send you is marked very irregularly that is marked in some places unmarked in others just as i happened to be near or far from my pencil and inkstand otherwise i should have liked to compare judgments with you  keep the book as long as you please it is my own  footnote 64 george burges the classical scholar he had in 1832 contributed to the gentlemans magazine under a pseudonym some lines purporting to be a newly discovered portion of the bacchae but really composed by himself on the basis of a parallel passage in the christus patiens it is apparently to these lines that miss barrett alludes though the discovery was then nearly ten years old   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street april 2 1842  my very dear friend as to your kind desire to hear whatever in the way of favorable remark i have gathered together for fruit of my papers i put on a veil and tell you that mr kenyon thought it well done although labour thrown away from the unpopularity of the subject that miss mitford was very much pleased with the warmheartedness common to her that mrs jamieson sic read them with great pleasure unconsciously of the author and that mr home the poet and mr browning the poet were not behind in approbation mr browning is said to be learned in greek especially in the dramatists and of mr home i should suspect something similar miss mitford and mrs jamieson although very gifted and highly cultivated women are not grecians and therefore judge the papers simply as english compositions  the single unfavorable opinion is mr hunters who thinks that the criticisms are not given with either sufficient seriousness or diffidence and that there is a painful sense of effort through the whole many more persons may say so whose voices i do not hear i am glad that yours my dear indulgent friend is not one of them  believe me your ever affectionate  elizabeth b barrett   to hs boyd may 17 1842  my very dear friendhave you thought all unkindness out of my silence yet the inference is not a true one however it may look in logic  you do not like silentiarius very much that is my inference since you have kept him so short a time and i quite agree with you that he is not a poet of the same interest as gregory nazianzen however he may appear to me of more lofty cadence in his versification my own impression is that john of euchaita is worth two of each of them as a poet his poems strike me as standing in the very first class of the productions of the christian centuries synesius and john of euchaita i shall always think of those two togethernot by their similarity but their dignity  i return you the books you lent me with true thanks and also those which mrs smith i believe left in your hands for me i thank you for them and you must be good enough to thank her they were of use although of a rather sublime indifference for poets generally  i shall send you soon the series of the greek papers you asked for and also perhaps the first paper of a survey of the english poets under the pretence of a review of the book of the poets a booksellers selection published lately i begin from langland of piers plowman and the malvern hills the first paper went to the editor last week and i have heard nothing as to whether it will appear on saturday or not and perhaps if it does you wont care to have it sent to you tell me if you do or dont i have suffered unpleasantly in the heart lately from this tyrannous dynasty of east winds but have been well otherwise and am better in that flushie means to bark the next time he sees you in revenge for what you say of him  good bye dear mr boyd think of me as  your ever affectionate ebb   to hs boyd june 3 1842  my very dear friendi disobeyed you in not simply letting you know of the publication of my english poets because i did not know myself when the publication was to take place and i hope you will forgive the innocent crime and accept the first number going to you with this note i warn you that there will be two numbers more at least therefore do not prepare yourself for perhaps the impossible magnanimity of reading them through  and now i am fit for rivalship with your clocks papa having given me an aeolian harp for the purpose do you know the music of an aeolian harp and that nothing below the spherical harmonies is so sweet and soft and mournfully wild the amusing part of it is after the poetical that flushie is jealous and thinks it is alive and takes it as very hard that i should say beautiful to anything except his ears  arabel talks of going to see you but if you are sensible to this intense and most overcoming heat you will pardon her staying away for the present  we have heard today that annie proposes to publish her miscellany by subscription and although i know it to be the only way compatible with publication at all to avoid a pecuniary loss yet the custom is so entirely abandoned except in the case of persons of a lower condition of life than your daughter that i am sorry to think of the observations it may excite the whole scheme has appeared to me from the beginning most foolish and if you knew what i know of the state and fortune of our ephemeral literature you would use what influence you have with her to induce her to condemn her contributions to the adorning of a private annual rather than the purpose in unhappy question i wish i dared to appeal through my true love for her to her own good sense once more  my very dear friends affectionate and grateful ebb  if you do read any of the papers let me know i beseech you your full and free opinion of them   to hs boyd june 22 1842  my very dear friendi thank you gratefully for your two notes with their united kindness and candourthe latter still rarer than the former if less sweet upon the tongue sir william alexanders tragedy that is the right name i think sir william alexander earl of stirling you will not find mentioned among my dramatic notices because i was much pressed for room and had to treat the whole subject as briefly as possible striking off like the roman only the heads of the flowers and i did not besides receive your injunction until my third paper on the dramatists was finished and in the press when you read it you will find some notice of that tragedy by marlowe the first knowledge of which i owe to you my dear mr boyd as how much besides and then comes the fourth paper and i tremble to anticipate the possiblenay the very probablescolding i may have from you upon my various heresies as to dryden and pope and queen annes versificators in the meantime you have breathing time for mr dilke although very gracious and courteous to my offence of extending the two papers he asked for into four65 yet could find no room in the athenaeum last week for me and only hopes for it this week and after this week comes the british association business which always fills every column for a month so that a further delay is possible enough it will increase says mr dilke the zest of the reader whereas i say at least think that it will help him quite to forget me i explain all this lest you should blame me for neglect to yourself in not sending the papers i am so pleased that you like at least the second article that is encouragement to me  flushie did not seem to think the harp alive when it was taken out of the window and laid close to him he examined it particularly and is a philosophical dog but i am sure that at first and while it was playing he thought so  in the same way he cant bear me to look into a glass because he thinks there is a little brown dog inside every looking glass and he is jealous of its being so close to me he used to tremble and bark at it but now he is silently jealous and contents himself with squeezing close close to me and kissing me expressively  my very dear friends ever gratefully affectionate ebb  footnote 65 ultimately five   to john kenyon 50 wimpole street sunday night september 1842  my dear mr kenyonhaving missed my pleasure today by a coincidence worse for me than for you i must tired as i am tonight tell youready for tomorrows return of the bookswhat i have waited three whole days hoping to tell you by word of mouth but mind before i begin i dont do so out of despair ever to see you again because i trust steadfastly to your kindness to come again when you are not languid and i am alone as usual only that i dare not keep back from you any longer the following message of miss mitford she says wont he take us in his way to torquay or from torquay beg him to do soand of all love to tell us when afterwards again i think my father is better tell mr kenyon what i say and stand my friend with him and beg him to come  which i do in the most effectual wayin her own words  she is much pleased by means of your introduction tell dear mr kenyon how very very much i like mrs leslie she seems all that is good and kind and to add great intelligence and agreeableness to these prime qualities  now i have done with being a messenger of the gods and verily my caduceus is trembling in my hand  o mr kenyon what have you done you will know the interpretation of the reproach your conscience holding the key of the cypher  in the meantime i ought to be thanking you for your great kindness about this divine tennyson66 beautiful beautiful after all it is a noble thing to be a poet but notwithstanding the poetry of the noveltiesand you will observe that his two preceding volumes only one of which i had seen before having inquired for the other vainly are included in these twonothing appears to me quite equal to oenone and perhaps a few besides of my ancient favorites that is not said in disparagement of the last but in admiration of the first there is in fact more thoughtmore bare brave working of the intellectin the latter poems even if we miss something of the high ideality and the music that goes with it of the older ones only i am always inclined to believe that philosophic thinking like music is involved however occultly in high ideality of any kind  you have not a key to the cypher of this at least and i am so tired that one word seems tumbling over another all the way  ever affectionately yours elizabeth b barrett  you will let me keep your beautiful ballad and the gods67 a little longer  footnote 66 this refers to the recent publication of tennysons poems in two volumes the first containing a reissue of poems previously published while the second was wholly new and included such poems as the morte darthur ulysses and locksley hall  footnote 67 no doubt mr kenyons translation of schillers gods of greece which was the occasion of miss barretts poem the dead pan   to hs boyd september 14 1842  my very dear friendi have made you wait a long time for the north american review because when your request came it was no longer within my reach and because since then i have not been so well as usual from a sweep of the wing of the prevailing epidemic now however i am better than i was even before the attack only wishing that it were possible to hookandeye on another summer to the hem of the garment of this last sunny one at the end of such a double summer to measure things humanly i might be able to go to see you at hampstead nevertheless winters and adversities are more fit for us than a constant sun  i suppose dear mr boyd you want only to have this review read to you and not written because it isnt out of laziness that i send the book to you and arabel would copy whatever you please willingly provided you wished it keep the book as long as you please i have put a paper mark and a pencil mark at the page and paragraph where i am taken up it seems to me that the condemnation of the seraphim is not too hard the poem wants unity  as to your words of fire about wordsworth if i had but a cataract at command i would try to quench them his powers should not be judged of by my extracts or by anybodys extracts from his lastpublished volume68 do you remember his grand ode upon childhoodworth to my apprehension just twenty of drydens st cecilias dayhis sonnet upon westminster bridge his lyric on a lark in which the larks music swells and exults and the many noble and glorious passages of his excursion you must not indeed blame me for estimating wordsworth at his height and on the other side i readily confess to you that he is occasionally and not unfrequently heavy and dull and that coleridge had an intenser genius tell me if you know anything of tennyson he has just published two volumes of poetry one of which is a republication but both full of inspiration  ever my very dear friends affectionate and grateful ebb   footnote 68 poems chiefly of early and late years including the borderers a tragedy 1842   to mrs martin 50 wimpole street october 22 1842  my dearest mrs martinwaiting first for you to write to me and then waiting that i might write to you cheerfully has ended by making so long a silence that i am almost ashamed to break it and perhaps even if i were not ashamed you would be angryperhaps you are angry and dont much care now whether or not you ever hear from me again still i must write and i must moreover ask you to write to me again and i must in particular assure you that i have continued to love you sincerely notwithstanding all the silence which might seem to say the contrary what i should like best just now is to have a letter speaking comfortable details of your being comparatively well again yet i hope on without it that you really are so much better as to be next to quite well it was with great concern that i heard of the indisposition which hung about you dearest mrs martin so longi who had congratulated myself when i saw you last on the promise of good health in your countenance may god bless you and keep you better and may you take care of yourself and remember how many love you in the world from dear mr martin down toebb  well now i must look around me and consider what there is to tell you but i have been uneasy in various ways sometimes by reason and sometimes by fantasy and even now although my dear old friend dr scully is something better he lies i fear in a very precarious state while dearest miss mitfords letters from the deathbed of her father make my heart ache as surely almost as the post comes there is nothing more various in character nothing which distinguishes one human being from another more strikingly than the expression of feeling the manner in which it influences the outward man if i were in her circumstances i should sit paralysedit would be impossible to me to write or to cry and she who loves and feels with the intensity of a nature warm in everything seems to turn to sympathy by the very instinct of grief and sits at the deathbed of her last relative writing there in letter after letter every symptom physical or moraleven to the very words of the raving of a delirium and those heartbreaking words i could not write such letters but i know she feels as deeply as any mourner in the world can and all this reminds me of what you once asked me about the inscriptions in lord broughams villa at nice there are probably as many different dialects for the heart as for the tongue are there not  and now you will kindly like to have a word said about myself and it need not be otherwise than a word to give your kindness pleasure the long splendid summer exhausting as the heat was to me sometimes did me essential good and left me walking about the room and equal to going downstairs which i achieved four or five times and even to going out in the chair without suffering afterwards and best of all the spitting of blood i must tell you which more or less kept by me continually stopped quite some six weeks ago and i have thus more reasonable hopes of being really and essentially better than i could have with such a symptom loitering behind accidental improvements weak enough and with a sort of pulse which is not excellent i certainly remain but still if i escape any decided attack this winterand i am in garrison nowthere are expectations of further good for next summer and i may recover some moderate degree of health and strength again and be able to do good instead of receiving it only  i write under the eyes of wordsworth not wordsworths living eyes although the actual living poet had the infinite kindness to ask mr kenyon twice last summer when he was in london if he might not come to see me mr kenyon said noi couldnt have said no to wordsworth though i had never gone to sleep again afterwards but this wordsworth who looks on me now is wordsworth in a picture mr haydon the artist with the utmost kindness has sent me the portrait he was painting of the great poetan unfinished portraitand i am to keep it until he wants to finish it such a head such majesty and the poet stands musing upon helvellyn and all thatpoet helvellyn and allis in my room69  give my kind love to mr martinour kind love indeed to both of youand believe me my dearest mrs martin  your ever affectionate ba  is there any hope for us of you before the winter ends do consider  to hs boyd monday october 31 1842  my very dear friendi have put off from day to day sending you these volumes and in the meantime i have had a letter from the great poet did arabel tell you that my sonnet on the picture was sent to mr haydon and that mr haydon sent it to mr wordsworth the result was that mr wordsworth wrote to me king johns barons were never better pleased with their charta than i am with this letter70  but i wont tell you any more about it until you have read the poems which i send you read first to put you into good humour the sonnet written on westminster bridge vol iii page 78 then take from the sixth volume page 152 the passage beginning within the soul down to page 153 at despair and again at page 155 beginning with    i have seen   a curious child c  down to page 157 to the end of the paragraph if you admit these passages to be fine poetry i wish much that you would justify me further by reading out of the second volume the two poems called laodamia and tintern abbey at page 172 and page 161 i will not ask you to read any more but i dare say you will rush on of your own account in which case there is a fine ode upon the power of sound in the same volume wordsworth is a philosophical and christian poet with depths in his soul to which poor byron could never reach do be candid nay i need not say so because you always are as i am  your ever affectionate elizabeth b barrett  footnote 69 it was this picture that called forth the sonnet on a portrait of wordsworth by br haydon poetical works iii 62 alluded to in the next letter  footnote 70 the following is the letter from wordsworth which gave such pleasure to miss barrett and which she treasured among her papers for the rest of her life two slips of the pen have been corrected between brackets  rydal mount oct 26 42  dear miss barrettthrough our common friend mr haydon i have received a sonnet which his portrait of me suggested i should have thanked you sooner for that effusion of a feeling towards myself with which i am much gratified but i have been absent from home and much occupied  the conception of your sonnet is in full accordance with the painters intended work and the expression vigorous yet the word ebb though i do not myself object to it nor wish to have it altered will i fear prove obscure to nine readers out of ten    a vision free   and noble haydon hath thine art released  owing to the want of inflections in our language the construction here is obscure would it not be a little better thus i was going to write a small change in the order of the words but i find it would not remove the objection the verse as i take it would be somewhat clearer thus if you would tolerate the redundant syllable    by a vision free   and noble haydon is thine art released  i had the gratification of receiving a good while ago two copies of a volume of your writing which i have read with much pleasure and beg that the thanks which i charged a friend to offer may be repeated to you  it grieved me much to hear from mr kenyon that your health is so much deranged but for that cause i should have presumed to call upon you when i was in london last spring  with every good wish i remain dear miss barrett your much obliged  wm wordsworth  postmark ambleside oct 28 1842  it may be added that although miss barrett altered the passage criticised by the great poet she did not accept his amendment it now runs    a noble vision free   our haydons hand has flung out from the mist    to hs boyd december 4 1842  my very dear friendyou will think me in a discontented state of mind when i knit my brows like a sleeve of care over your kind praises but the truth is i wont be praised for being liberal in calvinism and love of byron i liberal in commending byron take out my heart and try it look at it and compare it with yours and answer and tell me if i do not love and admire byron more warmly than you yourself do i suspect it indeed why i am always reproached for my love to byron why people say to me you who overpraise byron why when i was a little girl and whatever you may think my tendency is not to cast off my old loves i used to think seriously of dressing up like a boy and running away to be lord byrons page and i to be praised now for being liberal in admitting the merit of his poetry i  as for the calvinism i dont choose to be liberal there either i dont call myself a calvinist i hang suspended between the two doctrines and hide my eyes in gods love from the sights which other people say they see i believe simply that the saved are saved by grace and that they shall hereafter know it fully and that the lost are lost by their choice and free willby choosing to sin and die and i believe absolutely that the deepest damned of all the lost will not dare to whisper to the nearest devil that reproach of martha if the lord had been near me i had not died but of the means of the working of gods grace and of the time of the formation of the divine counsels i know nothing guess nothing and struggle to guess nothing and my persuasion is that when people talk of what was ordained or approved by god before the foundations of the world their tendency is almost always towards a confusion of his eternal nature with the human conditions of ours and to an oblivion of the fact that with him there can be no after nor before  at any rate i do not find it good for myself to examine any more the brickbats of controversythere is more than enough to think of in truths clearly revealed more than enough for the exercise of the intellect and affections and adorations i would rather not suffer myself to be disturbed and perhaps irritated where it is not likely that i should ever be informed and although you tell me that your system of investigation is different from some others answer me with your accustomed candour and admit my very dear friend that this argument does not depend upon the construction of a greek sentence or the meaning of a greek word let a certain word71 be foreknow or publicly favor room for a stormy controversy yet remains i went through the romans with you partially and wholly by myself by your desire and in reference to the controversy long ago and i could not then and cannot now enter into that view of taylor and adam clarke and yourself i believe as to the jews and gentiles neither could i conceive that a particular part of the epistle represents an actual dialogue between a jew and gentile since the form of question and answer appears to me there simply rhetorical the apostle paul was learned in rhetoric and i think he described so by a rhetorical and vivacious form that struggle between the flesh and the spirit common to all christians the spirit being triumphant through god in christ jesus these are my impressions yours are different and since we should not probably persuade each other and since we are both of us fond of and earnest in what we fancy to be the truth why should we cast away the thousand sympathies we rejoice in religious and otherwise for the sake of a fruitless contention what you would say by the time we had quarrelled half an hour cant you talk without being excited half an hour afterwards pray do lower your voiceit goes through my head in another ten minutes i could scarcely have believed you to be so obstinate in another your prejudices are insurmountable and your reason most womanlyyou are degenerated to the last degree in anotherwhy then you would turn me and flush out of the room and so finish the controversy victoriously  was i wrong too dearest mr boyd in sending the poems to the athenaeum well i meant to be right i fancied that you would rather they were sent and as your name was not attached there could be no harm in leaving them to the editors disposal they are not inserted as i anticipated the religious character was a sufficient objectiontheir character of prayer mr dilke begged me once while i was writing for him to write the name of god and jesus christ as little as i could because those names did not accord with the secular character of the journal  ever your affectionate and grateful elizabeth b barrett  tell me how you like the sonnet but you wont i prophesy like it keep the athenaeum  footnote 71 the greek greek progignôskein used in romans viii 29   to hs boyd december 24 1842  my very dear friendi am afraid that you will infer from my silence that you have affronted me into ill temper by your parody upon my sonnet yet lucus a non lucendo were a truer derivation i laughed and thanked you over the parody and put off writing to you until i had the headache which forced me to put it off again  may god bless you my dear mr boyd mr savage landor once said that anybody who could write a parody deserved to be shot but as he has written one himself since saying so he has probably changed his mind arabel sends her love  ever your affectionate and grateful elizabeth b barrett   to hs boyd january 5 1842 1843  my very dear friendmy surprise was inexpressible at your utterance of the name what ossian superior as a poet to homer mr boyd saying so mr boyd treading down the neck of aeschylus while he praises ossian the fact appears to me that anomalous thing among believersa miracle without an occasion  i confess i never never should have guessed the name not though i had guessed to doomsday in the first place i do not believe in ossian and having partially examined the testimony for i dont pretend to any exact learning about it i consider him as the poetical lay figure upon which mr macpherson dared to cast his personality there is a sort of phraseology nay an identity of occasional phrases from the antiquebut that these socalled ossianic poems were ever discovered and translated as they stand in their present form i believe in no wise as dr johnson wrote to macpherson so i would say mr macpherson i thought you an impostor and think so still  it is many years ago since i looked at ossian and i never did much delight in him as that fact proves since your letter came i have taken him up again and have just finished carthon there are beautiful passages in it the most beautiful beginning i think desolate is the dwelling of moina and the next place being filled by that address to the sun you magnify so with praise but the charm of these things is the only charm of all the poems there is a sound of wild vague music in a monotonenothing is articulate nothing individual nothing various take away a few poetical phrases from these poems and they are colourless and bare compare them with the old burning ballads with a wild heart beating in each how cold they grow in the comparison compare them with homers grand breathing personalities with aeschylussnay but i cannot bear upon my lips or finger the charge of the blasphemy of such comparing even for religions sake  i had another letter from america a few days since from an american poet of boston who is establishing a magazine and asked for contributions from my pen the americans are as goodnatured to me as if they took me for the high radical i am you know  you wont be angry with me for my obliquity as you will consider it about ossian you know i always talk sincerely to you and you have not made me afraid of telling you the truththat is my truth the truth of my belief and opinions  i do not defend much in the idiot boy wordsworth is a great poet but he does not always write equally  and that reminds me of a distinction you suggest between ossian and homer i fashion it in this way homer sometimes nods but ossian makes his readers nod  ever your affectionate elizabeth b barrett  did i tell you that i had been reading through a manuscript translation of the gorgias of plato by mr hyman of oxford who is a stepson of mr haydons the artist it is an excellent translation with learned notes but it is not elegant he means to try the public upon it but as i have intimated to him the christians of the present day are not civilised enough for plato  arabels love   to hs boyd about the end of january 1843  my very dear friendthe image you particularly admire in ossian i admire with you although i am not sure that i have not seen it or its like somewhere in a classical poet greek or latin perhaps lord byron remembered it when in the siege of corinth he said of his francescas uplifted arm you might have seen the moon shine through it reminds me also that maclise the artist a man of poetical imagination gives such a transparency to the ghost of banquo in his picture of macbeths banquet that we can discern through it the lights of the festival that is good poetry for a painter is it not  i send you the magazines which i have just received from america and which contain one of them the cry of the human and the other four of my sonnets my correspondent tells me that the cry is considered there one of the most successful of my poems but you probably will not think so tell me exactly what you do think at page 343 of grahams magazine editors table is a review of me which however extravagant in its appreciation will give your kindness pleasure i confess to a good deal of pleasure myself from these american courtesies expressed not merely in the magazines but in the newspapers a heap of which has been sent to me by my correspondentthe new york tribune the union the union flag call scattered over with extracts from my books and benignant words about their writer among the extracts is the whole of the review of wordsworth from the london athenaeum an unconscious compliment as they do not guess at the authorship and one which you wont thank them for keep the magazines as i have duplicates  dearest mr boyd since you admit that i am not prejudiced about ossian i take courage to tell you what i am thinking of  i am thinking this is said in a whisper and in confidenceof two kinds i am thinking that you dont admire him quite as much as you did three weeks ago  ever most affectionately yours elizabeth b barrett  arabel not being here i send her love without asking for it   to mrs martin january 30 1843  my dearest mrs martinthank you for your letter and for dear mr martins thought of writing one ah i thought he would not write but not for the reason you say it was something more palpable and less romantic well i will not grumble any more about not having my letter since you are coming and since you seem my dear mrs martin something in better spirits than your note from southampton bore token of madeira is the promised land you know and you should hope hopefully for your invalid from his pilgrimage there you should hope with those who hope my dearest mrs martin  our event just now is a new purchase of a holy family supposed to be by andrea del sarto it has displaced the glover over the chimneypiece in the drawingroom and dear stormie and alfred nearly broke their backs in carrying it upstairs for me to see before the placing it is probably a fine picture and i seem to see my way through the dark of my ignorance to admire the grouping and colouring whatever doubt as to the expression and divinity may occur otherwise well you will judge i wont tell you how i think of it and you wont care if i do there is also a new very pretty landscape piece and you may imagine the local politics of the arrangement and hanging with their talk and consultation while i on the storey higher have my arranging to manage of my pretty new books and my three hyacinths and a pot of primroses which dear mr kenyon had the good nature to carry himself through the streets to our door but all the flowers forswear me and die either suddenly or gradually as soon as they become aware of the want of fresh air and light in my room talking of air and light what exquisite weather this is what a summer in winter it is the fourth day since i have had the fire wrung from me by the heat of temperature and i sit here very warm indeed notwithstanding that bare grate nay yesterday i had the door thrown open for above an hour and was warm still you need not ask you see how i am  tell me have you read mr dickenss america and what is your thought of it like if i were an american it would make me rabid and certain of the free citizens are furious i understand while others speak peace and ensue it admire as much of the book as deserves any sort of admiration and attribute the blameable parts to the prejudices of the party with whom the writer fell in and not to a want of honesty or brotherhood in his own intentions i admire mr dickens as an imaginative writer and i love the americansi cannot possibly admire or love this book does mr martin do you  henrietta would send her love to you if i could hear her voice nearer than i do actually as she sings to the guitar downstairs and her love is not the only one to be sent give mine to dear mr martin though he cant make up his mind to the bore of writing to me and remember us all both of you as we do you  dearest mrs martin your affectionate ba   to james martin february 6 1843  you make us out my dear mr martin to be such perfect parallel lines that i should be half afraid of completing the definition by our never meeting if it were not for what you say afterwards of the coming to london and of promising to come and see flush if you should be travelling while i am writing it was only what happened to me when i wrote not long ago to dearest mrs martin and everybody in this house cried out against the fatuity of the coincidence as if i could know that she was travelling when nobody told me and i wasnt a witch if the same thing happens today believe in the innocence of my ignorance i shall be consoled if it doesfor certain reasons but for none in the world can i help thanking you for your letter which gave me so much pleasure from the first sight of the handwriting to the thought of the kindness spent upon me in it that after all i cannot thank you as i would  yet i wont let you fancy me of such an irrational state of simplicity as not to be fully aware that you with your nature of the fields and forests look down disdainfully and with an inward heat of glorying upon me who have all my pastime in booksdead and seethed perhaps if it were a little warmer i might even grant that you are right in your pride as it is i grumble feebly to myself something about the definition of nature and how we in the town which god made just as he made your hedges have our share of nature too and then i have secret thoughts of the state of the thermometer and wonder how people can breathe out of doors in the meantime flush who is a better philosopher pushes deep into my furs and goes to sleep perhaps i should fear the omen for my correspondent  oh yes that picture in boz is beautiful for my own part and by a natural womanly contradiction i have never cared so much in my life for flowers as since being shut out from gardensunless indeed in the happy days of old when i had a garden of my own and cut it out into a great hector of troy in relievo with a high heroic box nose and shoeties of columbine72 but that was long ago now i count the buds of my primrose with a new kind of interest and you never saw such a primrose i begin to believe in ovid and look for a metamorphosis the leaves are turning white and springing up as high as corn want of air and of sun i suppose i should be loth to think itwant of friendship to me  do you know that the royal boz lives close to us three doors from mr kenyon in harley place the new numbers appear to me admirable and full of life and bloodwhatever we may say to the thick rouging and extravagance of gesture there is a beauty a tenderness too in the organ scene which is worthy of the gilliflowers but my admiration for boz fell from its sticking place i confess a good furlong when i read victor hugo and my creed is that not in his tenderness which is as much his own as his humour but in his serious powerful jewtrial scenes he has followed hugo closely and never scarcely looked away from les trois jours dun condamné  if you should not be on the road i hope you wont be very long before you are and that dearest mrs martin will put off building her greenhouseyou see i believe she will build ituntil she gets home again  how kind of you and of her to have poor old mrs barker at colwall  do believe me both of you with love from all of us  very affectionately yours ba  footnote 72 see hector in the garden poetical works iii 37   to hs boyd february 21 1843  thank you my very dear friend i am as well as the east wind will suffer me to be and that indeed is not very well my heart being fuller of all manner of evil than is necessary to its humanity but the wind is changed and the frost is gone and it is not quite out of my fancy yet that i may see you next summer you and summer are not out of the question yet therefore you see i cannot be very deep in tribulation but you may consider it a bad symptom that i have just finished a poem of some five hundred lines in stanzas called the lost bower73 and about nothing at all in particular  as to arabel she is not an icicle there are flowers which blow in the frostwhen we brambles are brown with their inward deathand she is of them dear thing you are not a bramble though and i hope that when you talk of feeling the cold you mean simply to refer to your sensation and not to your health remember also dearest mr boyd what a glorious winter we have had take away the last ten days and a few besides and call the whole summer rather than winter ought we to complain really really no  i venture another prophecy upon the shoulders of the ast though my hand shakes so that nobody will read it  you cant abide my cry of the human and four sonnets they have none of them found favor in your eyes  in or out of favor  ever your affectionate ebb  do you think that next summer you might could or would walk across the park to see mesupposing always that i fail in my aspiration to go and see you i only ask by way of hypothesis consider and revolve it so we live on the verge of the town rather than in it and our noises are cousins to silence and you should pass into a room where the silence is most absolute flushs breathing is my loudest sound and then the watchs tickings and then my own heart when it beats too turbulently judge of the quiet and the solitude  footnote 73 poetical works iii 105   to hs boyd april 19 1843  my very dear friendthe earth turns round to be sure and we turn with it but i never anticipated the day and the hour for you to turn round and be guilty of high treason to our greeks i cry ai ai as if i were a chorus and all vainly for you see arguing about it will only convince you of my obstinacy and not a bit of homers supremacy ossian has wrapt you in a cloud a fog a true scotch mist you have caught cold in the critical faculty perhaps at any rate i cant see a bit more of your reasonableness than i can see of fingal sic transit homer like the darkened half of the moon in eclipse you have spoilt for me now the finest image in your ossianmacpherson  my dearest mr boyd you will find as few believers in the genuineness of these volumes among the most accomplished antiquarians in poetry as in the genuineness of chattertons rowley and of irelands shakespeare the latter impostures boasted of disciples in the first instance but the discipleship perished by degrees and the place thereof during this present 1843 knows it no more so has it been with the belief in macphersons ossian of those who believed in the poems at the first sight of them who kept his creed to the end and speaking so i speak of macphersons contemporaries whom you respect  i do not consider walter scott a great poet but he was highly accomplished in matters of poetical antiquarianism and is certainly citable as an authority on this question  try not to be displeased with me i cannot conceal from you that my astonishment is profound and unutterable at your new religionyour new faith in this pseudossianand your desecration in his service of the old hellenic altars and by the way my own figure reminds me to inquire of you whether you are not sometimes struck with a want in hima want very grave in poetry and very strange in antique poetrythe want of devotional feeling and conscience of god observe that all antique poets rejoice greatly and abundantly in their divine mythology and that if this ossian be both antique and godless he is an exception a discrepancy a monster in the history of letters and experience of humanity as such i leave him  oh how angry you will be with me but you seemed tolerably prepared in your last letter for my being in a passion ever affectionately yours  elizabeth b barrett  why should i be angry with flush he does not believe in ossian oh i assure you he doesnt   the following letter was called forth by a criticism of mr kenyons on miss barretts poem the dead pan which he had seen in manuscript but it also meets some criticisms which others had made upon her last volume see above p 65   to john kenyan wimpole street march 25 1843  my very dear cousinyour kindness having touched me much and your good opinion whether literary or otherwise being of great price to me it is even with tears in my eyes that i begin to write to you upon a difference between us and what am i to say to admit of course in the first place the injuriousness to the popularity of the scriptural tone but am i to sacrifice a principle to popularity would you advise me to do so should i be more worthy of your kindness by doing so and could you apart from the kindness call my refusal to do so either perverseness or obstinacy even if you could i hope you will try a little to be patient with me and to forgive at least what you find it impossible to approve  my dear cousin if you had not reminded me of wordsworths exclamation    i would rather be   a pagan suckled in a creed outworn  and if he had never made it i do think that its significance would have occurred to me by a sort of instinct in connection with this discussion certainly i would rather be a pagan whose religion was actual earnest continualfor week days work days and song daysthan i would be a christian who from whatever motive shrank from hearing or uttering the name of christ out of a church i am no fanatic but i like truth and earnestness in all things and i cannot choose but believe that such a christian shows but ill beside such a pagan what pagan poet ever thought of casting his gods out of his poetry in what pagan poem do they not shine and thunder and if ito approach the point in questionif i writing a poem the end of which is the extolment of what i consider to be christian truth over the pagan myths shrank even there from naming the name of my god lest it should not meet the sympathies of some readers or lest it should offend the delicacies of other readers or lest generally it should be unfit for the purposes of poetry in what more forcible manner than by that act i appeal to philip against philip can i controvert my own poem or secure to myself and my argument a logical and unanswerable shame if christs name is improperly spoken in that poem then indeed is schiller right and the true gods of poetry are to be sighed for mournfully for be sure that burns was right and that a poet without devotion is below his own order and that poetry without religion will gradually lose its elevation and then my dear friend we do not live among dreams the christian religion is true or it is not and if it is true it offers the highest and purest objects of contemplation and the poetical faculty which expresses the highest moods of the mind passes naturally to the highest objects who can separate these things did dante did tasso did petrarch did calderon did chaucer did the poets of our best british days did any one of these shrink from speaking out divine names when the occasion came chaucer with all his jubilee of spirit and resounding laughter had the name of jesus christ and god as frequently to familiarity on his lips as a child has its fathers name you say our religion is not vitalnot weekdayenough forgive me but that is a confession of a wrong not an argument and if a poet be a poet it is his business to work for the elevation and purification of the public mind rather than for his own popularity while if he be not a poet no sacrifice of selfrespect will make amends for a defective faculty nor ought to make amends  my conviction is that the poetry of christianity will one day be developed greatly and nobly and that in the meantime we are wrong poetically as morally in desiring to restrain it no i never felt repelled by any christian phraseology in cowperalthough he is not a favorite poet of mine from other causesnor in southey nor even in james montgomery nor in wordsworth where he writes ecclesiastically nor in christopher north nor in chateaubriand nor in lamartine  it is but two days ago since i had a letterand not from a fanaticto reproach my poetry for not being christian enough and this is not the first instance nor the second of my receiving such a reproach i tell you this to open to you the possibility of another side to the question which makes you see a triangle of it  can you bear with such a long answer to your letter and forbear calling it a preachment there may be such a thing as an awkward and untimely introduction of religion i know and i have possibly been occasionally guilty in this way but for my principle i must contend for it is a poetical principle and more and an entire sincerity in respect to it is what i owe to you and to myself try to forgive me dear mr kenyon i would propitiate your indulgence for me by a libation of your own eau de cologne poured out at your feet it is excellent eau de cologne and you are very kind to me but notwithstanding all there is a foreboding within me that my conventicleisms will be inodorous in your nostrils  incomplete   to john kenyon tuesday about march 1843  my very dear cousini have read your letter again and again and feel your kindness fully and earnestly you have advised me about the poem74 entering into the questions referring to it with the warmth rather of the author of it than the critic of it and this i am sensible of as absolutely as anyone can be at the same time i have a strong perception rather than opinion about the poem and also if you would not think it too serious a word to use in such a place i have a conscience about it it was not written in a desultory fragmentary way the last stanzas thrown in as they might be thrown out but with a design which leans its whole burden on the last stanzas in fact the last stanzas were in my mind to say and all the others presented the mere avenue to the end of saying them therefore i cannot throw them outi cannot yield to the temptation even of pleasing you by doing so i make a compromise with myself and do not throw them out and do not print the poem now say nothing against this my dear cousin because i am obstinate as you know as you have good evidence for knowing i will not either alter or print it then you have your manuscript copy which you can cut into any shape you please as long as you keep it out of print and seeing that the poem really does belong to you having had its origin in your paraphrase of schillers stanzas i see a great deal of poetical justice in the manuscript copyright remaining in your hands for the rest i shall have quite enough to print and to be responsible for without it and i am quite satisfied to let it be silent for a few years until either i or you as may be the case even with me shall have revised our judgments in relation to it  this being settled you must suffer me to explain for mere personal reasons and not for the good of the poem that no mortal priest of st peters or otherwise is referred to in a particular stanza but the saviour himself who is the high priest of our profession and the only priest recognised in the new testament in the same way the altar candles are altogether spiritual or they could not be supposed even by the most amazing poetical exaggeration to light the earth and skies i explain this only that i may not appear to you to have compromised the principle of the poem by compromising any truth such in my eyes for the sake of a poetical effect  and now i will not say any more i know that you will be inclined to cry print it in any case but i will entreat of your kindness which i have so much right to trust in while entreating not to say one such word be kind and let me follow my own way silently i have not indeed like a spoilt child in a fret thrown the poem up because i would not alter it though you have done much to spoil me i act advisedly and have made up my mind as to what is the wisest and best thing to do and personally the pleasantest to myself after a good deal of serious reflection pan is dead and so best for the present at least  i shall take your advice about the preface in every respect and thanks for the letter and taylors memoirs  miss mitford talks of coming to town for a day and of bringing flush with her as soon as the weather settles and today looks so like it that i have mused this morning on the possibility of breaking my prison doors and getting into the next room only there is a forbidding north wind they say  dont be vexed with me dear mr kenyon you know there are obstinacies in the world as well as mortalities and thereto appertaining and then you will perceive through all mine that it is difficult for me to act against your judgment so far as to put my own tenacity into print  ever gratefully and affectionately yours ebb  footnote 74 the dead pan poetical works iii 280   it is to the honour of america that it recognised from the first the genius of miss barrett and for a large part of her life some of the closest of her personal and literary connections were with americans the same is true in both respects of robert browning as appears from some letters printed farther on in these volumes at a time when the sale of his poems in england was almost infinitesimal they were known and highly prized in the united states expressions of mrs brownings sympathy with america and of gratitude for the kindly feelings of americans recur frequently in the letters and it is probable that there are still extant in the states many letters written to friends and correspondents there only three or four such have been made available for the present collection and of these the first follows here in its place in the chronological sequence it was written to mr cornelius mathews then editor of grahams magazine who had invited miss barrett to send contributions to his periodical the warm expression in it of sympathy with the poetry of robert browning whom she did not yet know personally is especially interesting to readers of this later day who like the spectators at a greek tragedy watch the development of a drama of which the dénouement is already known to them   to cornelius mathews 50 wimpole street april 28 1843  my dear mr mathewsin replying to your kind letter i send some more verse for grahams praying such demisemigods as preside over contributors to magazines that i may not appear overloquacious to my editor of course it is not intended to thrust three or four poems into one number my pluralities go to you simply to bide your time and be used one by one as the opportunity is presented in the meanwhile you have received i hope a short letter written to explain my unwillingness to apply as you desired me at first to wiley and putnaman unwillingness justified by what you told me afterwards i did not apply nor have i applied and i would rather not apply at all perhaps i shall hear from them presently the pamphlet on international copyright is welcome at a distance but it has not come near me yet and for all your kindness in relation to the prospective gift of your works i thank you again and earnestly you are kind to me in many ways and i would willingly know as much of your intellectual habits as you teach me of your genial feelings this pathfinder what an excellent name for an american journal i also owe to you with the summing up of your performances in it and with a notice of mr brownings blot on the scutcheon which would make one poet furious the infelix talfourd and another a little melancholynamely mr browning himself there is truth on both sides but it seems to me hard truth on browning i do assure you i never saw him in my lifedo not know him even by correspondenceand yet whether through fellowfeeling for eleusinian mysteries or whether through the more generous motive of appreciation of his powers i am very sensitive to the thousand and one stripes with which the assembly of critics doth expound its vocation over him and the athenaeum for instance made me quite cross and misanthropical last week75 the truth isand the world should know the truthit is easier to find a more faultless writer than a poet of equal genius dont let us fall into the category of the sons of noah noah was once drunk indeed but once he built the ark talking of poets would your grahams miscellany care at all to have occasional poetical contributions from mr horne i am in correspondence with him and i think i could manage an arrangement upon the same terms as my engagement rests on if you please and your friends please that is and without formality if it should give you any pleasure he is a writer of great power i think and this reminds me that you may be looking all the while for the athenaeums reply to your friends propositionof which i lost no time in apprising the editor mr dilke and here are some of his words an american friend who had been long in england and often conversed with me on the subject resolved on his return to establish such a correspondence in all things worth knowingall reviews of good books which are published first or simultaneously says mr dilke in london he was anticipated and after some months he was driven of necessity to geological surveys centenary celebrations progress of railroads manufactures c and thus the prospect was abandoned altogether having made this experiment mr dilke is unwilling to risk another neither must we blame him for the reserve when the international copyright shall at once protect the national meum and tuum in literature and give it additional fullness and value we shall cease to say insolently to you that what we want of your books we will get without your help but as it is the mr dilkes of us have nothing much more courteous to do i wish i could have been of any use to your friendi have done what i could in regard to critical papers of mine i would willingly give myself up to you seeing your good nature but it is the truth that i never published any prose papers at all except the series on the greek christian poets and the other series on the english poets in the athenaeum of last year and both of which you have probably seen afterwards i threw up my brief and went back to my poetry in which i feel that i must do whatever i am equal to doing at all that life is short and art long appears to us more true than usual when we lie all day long on a sofa and are as frightened of the east wind as if it were a tiger life is not only short but uncertain and art is not only long but absorbing what have i to do with writing scandal as mr jones would say upon my neighbours work when i have not finished my own so i threw up my brief into mr dilkes hands and went back to my verses whenever i print another volume you shall have it if messrs wiley and putnam will convey it to you how can i send you by the way anything i may have to send you why will you not as a nation embrace our great penny post scheme and hold our envelopes in all acceptation you do not knowcannot guesswhat a wonderful liberty our rowland hill has given to british spirits and how we flash a thought instead of wafting it from our extreme south to our extreme north paying a penny for our thought and for the electricity included i recommend you our penny postage as the most successful revolution since the glorious three days of paris  and so you made merry with my scorn of my prometheus believe mebelieve me absolutelyi did not strike that others might spare but from an earnest remorse when you know me better you will know i hope that i am true whether right or wrong and you know already that i am right in this thing the only merit of the translation being its closeness can i be of any use to you dear mr mathews when i can make use of me you surprise and disappoint me in your sketch of the boston poet for the letter he wrote to me struck me as frank and honest i wonder if he made any use of the verses i sent him and i wonder what i sent himfor i never made a note of it through negligence and have quite forgotten are you acquainted with mrs sigourney she has offended us much by her exposition of mrs southeys letter and i must say not without cause i rejoice in the progress of wakondah wishing the influences of mountain and river to be great over him and in him and so i will say the god bless you your kindness cares to hear and remain  sincerely and thankfully yours elizabeth b barrett  endorsed in another hand eb barrett london received may 12 1843 4 poems previously furnished to grahams magazine 50  footnote 75 the athenaeum of april 22 contained a review of brownings dramatic lyrics charging him with taking pleasure in being enigmatical and declaring this to be a sign of weakness not strength it spoke of many of the pieces composing the volume as being rather fragments and sketches than having any right to independent existence   to john kenyan may 1 1843  my dear cousinhere is my copyright for you and you will see that i have put word instead of sound as certainly the proper word do let me thank you once more for all the trouble and interest you have taken with me and in me observe besides that i have altered the title according to your unconscious suggestion and made it the dead pan which is a far better name i think than the repetition of the refrain  but i spoil my exemplary docility so far by confessing that i dont like scornful children halfno not half so well as my railing children although to be sure you proved to me that the last was nigh upon nonsense you proved itthat is you almost proved it for dont we sayat least mightnt we saythe thunder was silent thunder involving the idea of noise as much as railing children do consider thisi give it up to you76  i am ashamed to have kept carlyle so long but i quite failed in trying to read him at my usual pacehe wont be read quick after all and full of beauty and truth as that book is and strongly as it takes hold of my sympathies there is nothing new in itnot even a new carlyleism which i do not say by way of blaming the book because the author of it might use words like the apostles to write the same things unto you to me indeed is not grievous and to you it is safe the world being blind and deaf and rather stupid requires a reiteration of certain uncongenial truths  thank you for the address ever affectionately yours ebb  i observe that the most questionable rhymes are not objected to by mr merivale alsobut this letter is too long already  footnote 76 mr kenyons view evidently prevailed for stanza 19 now has scornful children   to mrs martin may 3 1843  my dearest mrs martinif you promised which you did i ought to have promisedand therefore we may ask each others pardon  how is the dog and how does dear mr martin find himself in arcadia do we all stand in his recollection like a species of fog or a concentrated essence of brick wall how i wishand since i said it aloud to you i have often wished it over in a whisperthat you would put away your romance or cut it in two and spend six months of the year in london with us miss mitford believes that wishes if wished hard enough realise themselves but my experience has taught me a less cheerful creed only if wishes do realise themselves  miss mitford is at bath where she has spent one week and is about to spend two and then goes on her way into devonshire she amused me so the other day by desiring me to look at the date of mr landors poems in their first edition because she was sure that it must be fifty years since and she finds him at this 1843 the very lothario of bath enchanting the wives making jealous the husbands and enjoying altogether the worst of reputations i suggested that if she proved him to be seventyfive as long as he proved himself enchanting it would do no manner of good in the way of practical ethics and that besides for her to travel round the world to investigate gentlemens ages was invidious and might be alarming as to the safe inscrutability of ladies ages she is delighted with the scenery of bath which certainly take it altogether marble and mountains is the most beautiful town i ever looked upon cheltenham i think is a mere commonplace to it although the avenues are beautiful to be sure  mrs southey complains that she has lost half her income by her marriage and her friend mr landor is anxious to persuade by the means of intermediate friends sir robert peel to grant her a pension she is said to be in london now and has at least left keswick for ever it is not likely that wordsworth should come here this year which i am sorry for now although i should certainly be sorry if he did come a happy state of contradiction not confined either to that particular movement or nomovement inasmuch as i was gratified by his sending me the poem you saw and yet read it with such extreme pain as to incapacitate me from judging of it such stuff we are made of  this is a long letterand you are tired i feel by instinct  may god bless you my dearest mrs martin give my love to mr martin and think of me as  your very affectionate  ba  henry and daisy have been to see the lying in state as lying stark and dead is called whimsically of the duke of sussex it was a fine sight they say   to hs boyd may

wary of them evermore be sure as if they were gunpowder pray send them to mary hunter why not why should you think that i was likely to object to your doing so she will laugh i laughed albeit in no smiling mood for i have been transmigrating from one room to another and your packet found me half tired and half excited and whole grave but i could not choose but laugh at your oxford charge and when i had counted your great guns and javelin points and other military appurtenances of the punic war i said to myselfor to flush well mr boyd will soon be back again with the dissenters upon which i think flush said thats a comfort  marys direction is 111 london road brighton you ought to send the verses to her yourself if you mean to please her entirely and i cannot agree with you that there is the slightest danger in sending them by the post letters are never opened unless you tempt the flesh by putting sovereigns or shillings or other metallic substances inside the envelope and if the devil entered into me causing me to write a libel against the queen i would send it by the post fearlessly from john o groats to lands end inclusive  one of your best puns if not the best    hatching

octosyllabic do you not observe my dearest mr boyd that the final accent and rhyme fall on the eighth syllable instead of the tenth and that that single circumstance determines the class of versethat they are in fact octosyllabic verses with triple rhymes    hatching succession apostolical   with other falsehoods diabolical  pope has double rhymes in his heroic verses but how does he manage them why he admits eleven syllables throwing the final accent and rhyme on the tenth thus    worth makes the man and want of it the fellow   the rest is nought but leather and prunella  again if there is a double rhyme to an octosyllabic verse there are always nine syllables in that verse the final accent and rhyme falling on the eighth syllable thus    compound for sins that were inclined to   by damning those we have no mind to  hudibras  again if there is a triple rhyme to an octosyllabic verse precisely the present case there must always be ten syllables in that verse the final accent and rhyme falling on the eighth syllable thus from hudibras again    then in their robes the penitentials   are straight presented with credentials   remember how in arms and politics   we still have worsted all your holy tricks  you will admit that these last couplets are precisely of the same structure as yours and certainly they are octosyllabics and made use of by butler in an octosyllabic poem whereas yours to be rendered of the heroic structure should run thus    hatching at ease succession apostolical   with many other falsehoods diabolical  i have written a good deal about an oversight on your part of little consequence but as you charged me with a mistake made in cold blood and under corrupt influences from lakemists why i was determined to make the matter clear to you and as to the influences if i were guilty of this mistake or of a thousand mistakes wordsworth would not be guilty in me i think of him now exactly as i thought of him during the first years of my friendship for you only with an equal admiration he was a great poet to me always and always while i have a soul for poetry will be so yet i said and say in an undervoice but steadfastly that coleridge was the grander genius there is scarcely anything newer in my estimation of wordsworth than in the colour of my eyes  perhaps i was wrong in saying a pun but i thought i apprehended a double sense in your application of the term apostolical succession to oxfords breeding and hatching words which imply succession in a way unecclesiastical  after all which quarrelling i am delighted to have to talk of your coming nearer to mewithin reachalmost within my reach now if i am able to go in a carriage at all this summer it will be hard but that i manage to get across the park and serenade you in greek under your window  your ever affectionate elizabeth b barrett   to hs boyd may 18 1843  my very dear friendyes you have surprised me  i always have thought of you and i always think and say that you are truthful and candid in a supreme degree and therefore it is not your candour about wordsworth which surprises me  he had the kindness to send me the poem upon grace darling when it first appeared and with a curious mixture of feelings for i was much gratified by his attention in sending it i yet read it with so much pain from the nature of the subject that my judgment was scarcely free to consider the poetryi could scarcely determine to myself what i thought of it from feeling too much  but i do confess to you my dear friend that i suspectthrough the mist of my sensationsthe poem in question to be very inferior to his former poems i confess that the impression left on my mind is of its decided inferiority and i have heard that the poets friends and critics all except one are mourning over its appearance sighing inwardly wordsworth is old  one thing is clear to me however and over that i rejoice and triumph greatly if you can esteem this poem of grace darling you must be susceptible to the grandeur and beauty of the poems which preceded it and the cause of your past reluctance to recognise the poets power must be as i have always suspected from your having given a very partial attention and consideration to his poetry you were partial in your attention i perhaps was injudicious in my extracts but with your truth and his genius i cannot doubt but that the time will come for your mutual amity oh that i could stand as a herald of peace with my wooltwisted fillet i do not understand the greek metres as well as you do but i understand wordsworths genius better and do you forgive that it should console me  i will ask about his collegian extraction such a question never occurred to me apollo taught him under the laurels while all the muses looked through the boughs  your ever affectionate elizabeth b barrett  oh yes it delights me that you should be nearer of course you know that wordsworth is laureate77  footnote 77 wordsworth was nominated poet laureate after the death of southey in march 1843   to john kenyan may 19 1843  thank you my dear cousin for all your kindness to me there is ivy enough for a thyrsus and i almost feel ready to enact a sort of bacchus triumphalis for jollitie as i see it already planted and looking in at me through the window i never thought to see such a sight as that in my london room and am overwhelmed with my own glory  and then mr brownings note unless you say nay to me i shall keep this note which has pleased me so much yet not more than it ought now i forgive mr merivale for his hard thoughts of my easy rhymes but all this pleasure my dear mr kenyon i owe to you and shall remember that i do  ever affectionately yours ebb   to mrs martin may 26 1843   i thank you for your part in the gaining of my bed dearest mrs martin most earnestly and am quite ready to believe that it was gained by wishdom which believing is wisdom no you would certainly never recognise my prison if you were to see it the bed like a sofa and no bed the large table placed out in the room towards the wardrobe end of it the sofa rolled where a sofa should be rolledopposite the armchair the drawers crowned with a coronal of shelves fashioned by sette and co of papered deal and crimson merino to carry my books the washing table opposite turned into a cabinet with another coronal of shelves and chaucers and homers busts in guard over these two departments of english and greek poetry three more busts consecrating the wardrobe which there was no annihilating and the windowoh i must take a new paragraph for the window i am out of breath  in the window is fixed a deep box full of soil where are springing up my scarlet runners nasturtiums and convolvuluses although they were disturbed a few days ago by the revolutionary insertion among them of a great ivy root with trailing branches so long and wide that the top tendrils are fastened to henriettas window of the higher storey while the lower ones cover all my panes it is mr kenyons gift he makes the like to flourish out of mere flowerpots and embower his balconies and windows and why shouldnt this flourish with me but certainlythere is no shutting my eyes to the fact that it does droop a little papa prophesies hard things against it every morning why ba it looks worse and worse and everybody preaches despondency i however persist in being sanguine looking out for new shoots and making a sure pleasure in the meanwhile by listening to the sound of the leaves against the pane as the wind lifts them and lets them fall well what do you think of my ivy ask mr martin if he isnt jealous already  have you read the neighbours mary howitts translation of frederica bremers swedish yes perhaps have you read the home1 fresh from the same springs do if you have not it has not only charmed me but made me happier and better it is fuller of christianity than the most orthodox controversy in christendom and represents to my perception or imagination a perfect and beautiful embodiment of christian outward life from the inward purely and tenderly at the same time i should tell you that sette says i might have liked it ten years ago but it is too young and silly to give me any pleasure now for me however it is not too young and perhaps it wont be for you and mr martin as to sette he is among the patriarchs to say nothing of the lawyersand there we leave him  ever your affectionate ba  to john kenyan 50 wimpole street wednesday or is it thursday summer 1843  my dear cousin i send you my friend mr hornes new epic78 and beg you if you have an opportunity to drop it at mr eagles feet so that he may pick it up and look at it i have not gone through it i have another copy but it appears to me to be full of fine things as to the authors fantasy of selling it for a farthing i do not enter into the secret of itunless indeed he should intend a sarcasm on the ages generous patronage of poetry which is possible  footnote 78 orion the early editions of which were sold at a farthing in accordance with a fancy of the author miss barrett reviewed it in the athenaum july 1843   to john kenyan june 30 1843  thank you my dear mr kenyon for the camden society books and also for these which i return and also for the hope of seeing you which i kept through yesterday i honor mrs coleridge for the readiness of reasoning and integrity in reasoning for the learning energy and impartiality which she has brought to her purpose and i agree with her in many of her objects and disagree by opposing her opponents with a fuller front than she is always inclined to do in truth i can never see anything in these sacramental ordinances except a prospective sign in one baptism and a memorial sign in the other the lords supper and could not recognise either under any modification as a peculiar instrument of grace mystery or the like the tendencies we have towards making mysteries of gods simplicities are as marked and sure as our missing the actual mystery upon occasion gods love is the true mystery and the sacraments are only too simple for us to understand so you see i have read the book in spite of prophecies after all i should like to cut it in twoit would be better for being shorterand it might be clearer also there is in fact some dullness and perplexitya few passages which are to my impression contradictory of the general purposesomething which is not generous about nonconformityand what i cannot help considering a superfluous tenderness for puseyism moreover she is certainly wrong in imagining that the antenicene fathers did not as a body teach regeneration by baptismeven gregory nazianzen the most spiritual of many did and in the fourth century but after all as a work of theological controversy it is very unbitter and wellpoised gentle and modest and as the work of a woman you must admire it and we be proud of itthat remains certain at last  poor mr haydon i am so sorry for his reverse in the cartoons79 it is a thunderbolt to him i wonder in the pauses of my regret whether mr selous is your friendwhether boadicea visiting the druids suggested by you i think as a subject is this victorious boadicea down for a hundred pound prize you will tell me when you come  i have just heard an uncertain rumour of the arrival of your brother if it is not all air i congratulate you heartily upon a happiness only not past my appreciation  ever affectionately yours ebb  i send the copy of orion for yourself which you asked for it is in the fourth edition  footnote 79 this refers to the competition for the cartoons to be painted in the houses of parliament in which haydon was unsuccessful the disappointment was the greater inasmuch as the scheme for decorating the building with historical pictures was mainly due to his initiative    to mrs martin july 8 1843  thank you my dearest mrs martin for your kind sign of interest in the questioning note although i will not praise the stenography of it i shall be as brief today as you not quite out of revenge but because i have been writing to george and am the less prone to activities from having caught cold in an inscrutable manner and being stiff and sore from head to foot and inclined to be a little feverish and irritable of nerves no it is not of the slightest consequence i tell you the truth but i would have written to you the day before yesterday if it had not been for this something between cramp and rheumatism which was rather unbearable at first but yesterday was better and is today better than better and tomorrow will leave me quite well if i may prophesy i only mention it lest you should have upbraided me for not answering your note in a moment as it deserved to be answered so dont put any nonsense into georgies headforgive me for beseeching you i have been very welldownstairs seven or eight times lying on the floor in papas room meditating the chair which would have amounted to more than a meditation except for this little contrariety in a day or two more if this cool warmth perseveres in serving me and no ariel refills me with aches i shall fulfil your kind wishes perhaps and be outand so no more about me  oh i do believe you think me a cockneya metropolitan barbarian but i persist in seeing no merit and no superior innocence in being shut up even in precincts of rosetrees away from those great sources of human sympathy and occasions of mental elevation and instruction without which many natures grow narrow many others gloomy and perhaps if the truth were known very few prosper entirely lit is not that i who have always lived a good deal in solitude and live in it still more now and love the country even painfully in my recollections of it would decry either one or the othersolitude is most effective in a contrast and if you do not break the bark you cannot bud the tree and in short not to be in long i could write a dissertation which i will spare you about it and about it   tell george to lend younay i think i will be generous and let him give you although the author gave me the bookthe copy of the new epic orion which he has with him you have probably observed the advertisement and are properly instructed that mr horne the poet who has sold three editions already at a farthing a copy and is selling a fourth at a shilling and is about to sell a fifth at half a crown on the precise principle of the aërial machinelaunching himself into popularity by a first impulse on the people is my unknown friend with whom i have corresponded these four years without having seen his face do you remember the beech leaves sent to me from epping forest yes you must well the sender is the poet and the poem i think a very noble one and i want you to think so too so hereby i empower you to take it away from george and keep it for my sakeif you will  dear mr martin was so kind as to come and see me as you commanded and i must tell you that i thought him looking so better than well that i was more than commonly glad to see him give my love to him and join me in as much metropolitan missionary zeal as will bring you both to london for six months of the year oh i wish you would come not that it is necessary for you but that it will be so good for us  my ivy is growing and i have green blinds against which there is an outcry they say that i do it out of envy and for the equalisation of complexions  ever your affectionate ba   to mr westwood 50 wimpole street august 1843  dear mr westwoodi thank you very much for the kindness of your questioning and am able to answer that notwithstanding the as it seems to you fatal significance of a womans silence i am alive enough to be sincerely grateful for any degree of interest spent upon me as to flush he should thank you too but at the present moment he is quite absorbed in finding a cool place in this room to lie down in having sacrificed his usual favorite place at my feet his head upon them oppressed by the torrid necessity of a thermometer above 70 to flopsys acquaintance he would aspire gladly only hoping that flopsy does not delight to bark and bite like dogs in general because if he does flush would as soon be acquainted with a cat he says for he does not pretend to be a hero poor flush the bright summer days on which i am ever likely to take him out for a ramble over hill and meadow are never likely to shine but he follows or rather leaps into my wheeled chair and forswears merrier company even now to be near me i am a good deal better it is right to say and look forward to a possible prospect of being better still though i may be shut out from climbing the brocken otherwise than in a vision  you will see by the length of the legend80 which i send to you in its only printed form why i do not send it to you in manuscript keep the book as long as you please my new volume is not yet in the press but i am writing more and more in a view to it pleased with the thought that some kind hands are already stretched out in welcome and acceptance of what it may become not as idle as i appear i have also been writing some fugitive verses for american magazines this is my confession forgive its tediousness and believe me thankfully and very sincerely yours  elizabeth b barrett  footnote 80 the lay of the brown rosary   to mr westwood 50 wimpole street september 2 1843  dear mr westwoodyour letter comes to remind me how much i ought to be ashamed of myself i received the book in all safety and read your kind words about my rosary with more grateful satisfaction than appears from the evidence it is great pleasure to me to have written for such readers and it is great hope to me to be able to write for them the transcription of the rosary is a compliment which i never anticipated or you should have had the manuscript copy you asked for although i have not a perfect one in my hands the poem is full of faults as indeed all my poems appear to myself to be when i look back upon them instead of looking down i hope to be worthier in poetry some day of the generous appreciation which you and your friends have paid me in advance  tennyson is a great poet i think and browning the author of paracelsus has to my mind very noble capabilities do you know mr hornes orion the poem published for a farthing to the wonder of booksellers and bookbuyers who could not understand the speculation in its eyes there are very fine things in this poem and altogether i recommend it to your attention but what is wanting in tennyson he can think he can feel and his language is highly expressive characteristic and harmonious i am very fond of tennyson he makes me thrill sometimes to the end of my fingers as only a true great poet can  you praise me kindly and if indeed the considerations you speak of could be true of me i am not one who could lament having learnt in suffering what i taught in song in any case working for the future and counting gladly on those who are likely to consider any work of mine acceptable to themselves i shall be very sure not to forget my friends at enfield  dear mr westwood i remain sincerely yours elizabeth b barrett   to mrs martin september 4 1843 finished september 5  my dearest mrs martin  i have had a great gratification within this week or two in receiving a letternay two lettersfrom miss martineau one of the last strangers in the world from whom i had any right to expect a kindness yet most kind most touching in kindness were both of these letters so much so that i was not far from crying for pleasure as i read them she is very hopelessly ill you are probably aware at tynemouth in northumberland suffering agonies from internal cancer and conquering occasional repose by the strength of opium but almost forgetting to use her own words to wish for health in the intense enjoyment of pleasures independent of the body she sent me a little work of hers called traditions of palestine her friends had hoped by the stationary character of some symptoms that the disease was suspended but lately it is said to be gaining ground and the serenity and elevation of her mind are more and more triumphantly evident as the bodily pangs thicken  and now i am going to tell you what will surprise you if you do not know it already stormie and georgie are passing georges vacation on the rhine you are certainly surprised if you did not know it papa signed and sealed them away on the ground of its being good and refreshing for both of them and i was even mixed up a little with the diplomacy of it until i found they were going and then it was a hard terrible struggle with me to be calm and see them go but that was childish and when i had heard from them at ostend i grew more satisfied again and attained to think less of the fatal influences of my star they went away in great spirits stormie quite elated to use his own words and then at the end of the six weeks they must be at home at sessions and no possible way of passing the interim could be pleasanter and better and more exhilarating for themselves the plan was to go from ostend by railroad to brussels and cologne then to pass down the rhine to switzerland spend a few days at geneva and a week in paris as they return the only fear is that stormie wont go to paris we have too many friends therea strange obstacle  dearest mrs martin i am doing something more than writing you a letter i think  may god bless you all with the most enduring consolations give my love to mr martin and believe also both of you in my sympathy i am glad that your poor fanny should be so supported may god bless her and all of you  dearest mrs martins affectionate ba  i am very well for me and was out in the chair yesterday   to hs boyd september 8 1843  my very dear friendi ask you humbly not to fancy me in a passion whenever i happen to be silent for a woman to be silent is ominous i know but it need not be significant of anything quite so terrible as illhumour and yet it always happens so if i do not write i am sure to be cross in your opinion you set me down directly as hurt which means irritable or offended which means sulky your ideal of me having in fact its finger in its eye all day long  i on the contrary humbled as i was by your hard criticism of my soft rhymes about flush81 waited for arabel to carry a message for me begging to know whether you would care at all to see my cry of the children82 before i sent it to you but arabel went without telling me that she was going twice she went to st johns wood and made no sign and now i find myself thrown on my own resources will you see the cry of the human83 or not it will not please you probably it wants melody the versification is eccentric to the ear and the subject the factory miseries is scarcely an agreeable one to the fancy perhaps altogether you had better not see it because i know you think me to be deteriorating and i dont want you to have further hypothetical evidence of so false an opinion humbled as i am i say so false an opinion frankly if not humbly i believe myself to have gained power since the time of the publication of the seraphim and lost nothing except happiness frankly if not humbly  with regard to the house of clouds84 i disagree both with you and miss mitford thinking it comparatively with my other poems neither so bad nor so good as you two account it it has certainly been singled out for great praise both at home and abroad and only the other day mr horne wrote to me to reproach me for not having mentioned it to him because he came upon it accidentally and considered it one of my best productions mr kenyon holds the same opinion as for flushs verses they are what i call cobweb verses thin and light enough and arabel was mistaken in telling you that miss mitford gave the prize to them her words were they are as tender and true as anything you ever wrote but nothing is equal to the house of clouds those were her words or to that effect and i refer to them to you not for the sake of flushs verses which really do not appear even to myself their writer worth a defence but for the sake of your judgment of her accuracy in judging  lately i have received two letters from the profoundest woman thinker in england miss martineauletters which touched me deeply while they gave me pleasure i did not expect  my poor flush has fallen into tribulation think of catiline the great savage cuba bloodhound belonging to this house attempting last night to worry him just as the first catiline did cicero flush was rescued but not before he had been wounded severely and this morning he is on three legs and in great depression of spirits my poor poor flushie he lies on my sofa and looks up to me with most pathetic eyes  where is annie if i send my love to her will it ever be found again  may god bless you both dearest mr boyds affectionate and grateful ebb  footnote 81 to flush my dog poetical works iii 19  footnote 82 published in blackwoods magazine for august 1843 and called forth by mr hornes report as assistant commissioner on the employment of children in mines and manufactories  footnote 83 evidently a slip of the pen for children  footnote 84 poetical works iii 186 mr boyds opinion of it may be learnt from miss barretts letter to horne dated august 31 1843 letters to rh horne i 84 mr boyd told me that he had read my papers on the greek fathers with the more satisfaction because he had inferred from my house of clouds that illness had impaired my faculties   to hs boyd monday september 19 1843  my own dear friendi should have written instantly to explain myself out of appearances which did me injustice only i have been in such distress as to have no courage for writing flush was stolen away and for three days i could neither sleep nor eat nor do anything much more rational than cry confiteor tibi oh reverend father and if you call me very silly i am so used to the reproach throughout the week as to be hardened to the point of vanity the worst of it is now that there will be no need of more houses of clouds to prove to you the deterioration of my faculties qed  in my own defence i really believe that my distress arose somewhat less from the mere separation from dear little flushie than from the consideration of how he was breaking his heart cast upon the cruel world formerly when he has been prevented from sleeping on my bed he has passed the night in moaning piteously and often he has refused to eat from a strange hand and then he loves me heart to heart there was no exaggeration in my verses about him if there was no poetry and when i heard that he cried in the street and then vanished there was little wonder that i on my part should cry in the house  with great difficulty we hunted the dogbanditti into their caves of the city and bribed them into giving back their victim money was the least thing to think of in such case i would have given a thousand pounds if i had had them in my hand the audacity of the wretched men was marvellous they said that they had been about stealing flush these two years and warned us plainly to take care of him for the future  the joy of the meeting between flush and me would be a good subject for a greek odei recommend it to you it might take rank next to the epical parting of hector and andromache he dashed up the stairs into my room and into my arms where i hugged him and kissed him black as he wasblack as if imbued in a distillation of st giless ah i can break jests about it now you see well to go back to the explanations i promised to give you i must tell you that arabel perfectly forgot to say a word to me about blackwood and your wish that i should send the magazine it was only after i heard that you had procured it yourself and after i mentioned this to her that she remembered her omission all at once therefore i am quite vexed and disappointed i beg you to believei who have pleasure in giving you any printed verses of mine that you care to have never mind i may print another volume before long and lay it at your feet in the meantime you endure my cry of the children better than i had anticipatedjust because i never anticipated your being able to read it to the end and was overdelicate of placing it in your hands on that very account my dearest mr boyd you are right in your complaint against the rhythm the first stanza came into my head in a hurricane and i was obliged to make the other stanzas like itthat is the whole mystery of the iniquity if you look mr lucas from head to foot you will never find such a rhythm on his person the whole crime of the versification belongs to me so blame me and by no means another poet and i will humbly confess that i deserve to be blamed in some measure there is a roughness my own ear being witness and i give up the body of my criminal to the rod of your castigation kissing the last as if it were flush  a report runs in london that mr boyd says of elizabeth barrett she is a person of the most perverted judgment in england now if this be true i shall not mend my evil position in your opinion my very dear friend by confessing that i differ with you the more the longer i live on the ground of what you call jumping lines i am speaking not of particular cases but of the principle the general principle of these cases and the tenacity of my judgment does not arise from the teaching of mr lucas but from the deeper study of the old masterpoetsenglish poetsthose of the elizabeth and james ages before the corruption of french rhythms stole in with waller and denham and was acclimated into a national inodorousness by dryden and pope we differ so much upon this subject that we must proceed by agreeing to differ and end perhaps by finding it agreeable to differ there can be no possible use in an argument only you must be upright in justice and find wordsworth innocent of misleading me so far from having read him more within these three years i have read him less and have taken no new review i do assure you of his position and character as a poet and these facts are testified unto by the other fact that my poetry neither in its best features nor its worst is adjusted after the fashion of his school  but i am writing too much you will have no patience with me the excursion is accused of being lengthy and so you will tell me that i convict myself of plagiarism currente calamo  i have just finished a poem of some eight hundred lines called the vision of poets85 philosophical allegoricalanything but popular it is in stanzas every one an octosyllabic triplet which you will think odd and i have not sanguinity enough to defend  may god bless you my dearest mr boyd yes i heardi was glad to hearof your having resumed that which used to be so great a pleasure to youmiss marcuss society i remain  affectionately and gratefully yours elizabeth b barrett  my love to dear annie  footnote 85 poetical works i 223   to mr westwood october 1843  you are probably right in respect to tennyson for whom with all my admiration of him i would willingly secure more exaltation and a broader clasping of truth still it is not possible to have so much beauty without a certain portion of truth the position of the utilitarians being true in the inverse but i think as i did of uses and responsibilities and do hold that the poet is a preacher and must look to his doctrine  perhaps mr tennyson will grow more solemn like the sun as his day goes on in the meantime we have the noble two voices and among other grand intimations of a teaching power certain stanzas to jk i think the initials are on the death of his brother86 which very deeply affected me  take away the last stanzas which should be applied more definitely to the body or cut away altogether as a lie against eternal verity and the poem stands as one of the finest of monodies the nature of human grief never surely was more tenderly intimated or touchedit brought tears to my eyes do read it he is not a christian poet up to this time but let us listen and hear his next songs he is one of gods singers whether he knows it or does not know it  i am thinking lifting up my pen what i can write to you which is likely to be interesting to you after all i come to chaos and silence and even old nightit is growing so dark i live in london to be sure and except for the glory of it i might live in a desert so profound is my solitude and so complete my isolation from things and persons without i lie all day and day after day on the sofa and my windows do not even look into the street to abuse myself with a vain deceit of rural life i have had ivy planted in a box and it has flourished and spread over one window and strikes against the glass with a little stroke from the thicker leaves when the wind blows at all briskly then i think of forests and groves it is my triumph when the leaves strike the window pane and this is not a sound like a lament books and thoughts and dreams almost too consciously dreamed however for methe illusion of them has almost passed and domestic tenderness can and ought to leave nobody lamenting also gods wisdom deeply steeped in his love is as far as we can stretch out our hands  footnote 86 the lines to js which begin    the wind that beats the mountain blows   more softly round the open wold    to mr westwood 50 wimpole street december 26 1843  dear mr westwoodyou think me perhaps and not without apparent reason ungrateful and insensible to your letter but indeed i am neither one nor the other and i am writing now to try and prove it to you i was much touched by some tones of kindness in the letter and it was welcome altogether and i did not need the owl which came after to waken me because i was wide awake enough from the first moment and now i see that you have been telling your beads while i seemed to be telling nothing in that dread silence of mine may all true saints of poetry be propitious to the wearer of the rosary  in answer to a question which you put to me long ago on the subject of books of theology i will confess to you that although i have read rather widely the divinity of the greek fathers gregory chrysostom and so forth and have of course informed myself in the works generally of our old english divines hooker jeremy taylor and so forth i am not by any means a frequent reader of books of theology as such and as the men of our times have made them i have looked into the tracts from curiosity and to hear what the world was talking of and i was disappointed even in the degree of intellectual power displayed in them from motives of a desire of theological instruction i very seldom read any book except gods own the minds of persons are differently constituted and it is no praise to mine to admit that i am apt to receive less of what is called edification from human discourses on divine subjects than disturbance and hindrance i read the scriptures every day and in as simple a spirit as i can thinking as little as possible of the controversies engendered in that great sunshine and as much as possible of the heat and glory belonging to it it is a sure fact in my eyes that we do not require so much more knowledge as a stronger apprehension by the faith and affections of what we already know  you will be sorry to hear that mr tennyson is not well although his friends talk of nervousness and do not fear much ultimate mischief87  it is such a lovely may day that i am afraid of breaking the spell by writing down christmas wishes  very faithfully yours elizabeth barrett  footnote 87 about the same date she writes to home letters to rh horne i 86 i am very glad to hear that nothing really very bad is the matter with tennyson if anything were to happen to tennyson the world should go into mourning   to mr westwood 50 wimpole street december 31 1843  if you do find the paper i was invited to write upon wordsworth88 you will see to which class of your admiring or abhorring friends i belong perhaps you will cry out quickly to the blind admirers certes and i have a high admiration of wordsworth his spirit has worked a good work and has freed into the capacity of work other noble spirits he took the initiative in a great poetic movement and is not only to be praised for what he has done but for what he has helped his age to do for the rest byron has more passion and intensity shelley more fancy and music coleridge could see further into the unseen and not one of those poets has insulted his own genius by the production of whole poems such as i could name of wordsworths the vulgarity of which is childish and the childishness vulgar still the wings of his genius are wide enough to cast a shadow over its feet and our gratitude should be stronger than our critical acumen yes i will be a blind admirer of wordsworths i will shut my eyes and be blind better so than see too well for the thankfulness which is his due from me  yes i mean to print as much as i can find and make room for brown rosary and all i am glad you liked napoleon89 but i shall be more glad if you decide when you see this new book that i have made some general progress in strength and expression sometimes i rise into hoping that i may have done so or may do so still more  the poets work is no light work his wheat will not grow without labour any more than other kinds of wheat and the sweat of the spirits brow is wrung by a yet harder necessity and thinking so i am inclined to a little regret that you should have hastened your book even for the sake of a sentiment now you will be angry with me  there are certain difficulties in the way of the critic unprofessional as i know by experience our most sweet voices are scarcely admissible among the most sour ones of the regular brotherhood  harriet martineau is quite welltrudging miles together in the snow when the snow was and in great spirits wordsworth is to be in london in the spring tennyson is dancing the polka and smoking cloud upon cloud at cheltenham robert browning is meditating a new poem and an excursion on the continent miss mitford came to spend a day with me some ten days ago sprinkled as to the soul with meadow dews am i at the end of my account i think so  did you read blackwood and in that case have you had deep delight in an exquisite paper by the opiumeater which my heart trembled through from end to end what a poet that man is how he vivifies words or deepens them and gives them profound significance  i understand that poor hood is supposed to be dying really dying at last sydney smiths last laugh mixes with his or nearly so but hood had a deeper heart in one sense than sydney smith and is the material of a greater man  and what are you doing writingreadingor musing of either are you a reviewermanin opposition to the writer once reviewing was my besetting sin but now it is only my frailty now that i lie here at the mercy of every reviewer i save myself by an instinct of selfpreservation from that gnawing tooth as homer and aeschylus did rightly call it and spring forward into definite work and thought else i should perish do you understand that if you are a reviewerman you will and if not you must set it down among those mysteries of mine which people talk of as profane  may god bless you c c elizabeth barrett  footnote 88 in the athenaeum  footnote 89 crowned and buried poetical works iii 9   to mr westwood undated  you know as well as i do how the plague of rhymers and of bad rhymes is upon the land and it was only three weeks ago that at a literary institute at brighton i heard of the reverend somebody stoddart gravely proposing poetry for the million to his audience he assuring them that poets made a mystery of their art but that in fact nothing except an english grammar and a rhyming dictionary and some instruction about counting on the fingers was necessary in order to make a poet of any man  this is a fact and to this extent has the art once called divine been desecrated among the educated classes of our country  very sincerely yours elizabeth barrett  besides the poems to which reference has been made in the above letters miss barrett was engaged during the year 1843 in cooperating with her friend mr home in the production of his great critical enterprise the new spirit of the age in this the much daring author undertook no less a task than that of passing a sober and serious judgment on his principal living comrades in the world of letters not unnaturally he ended by bringing a hornets nest about his earsalike of those who thought they should have been mentioned and were not and of those who were mentioned but in terms which did not satisfy the good opinion of themselves with which providence had been pleased to gift them the volumes appeared under homes name alone and he took the whole responsibility but he invited assistance from others and in particular used the collaboration of miss barrett to no small extent she did not indeed contribute any complete essay to his work but she expressed her opinion when invited on several writers in a series of elaborate letters which were subsequently worked up by home into his own criticisms90 the secret of her cooperation was carefully kept and she does not appear to have suffered any of the evil consequences of his indiscretions real or imagined another contribution from her consisted of the suggestion of mottoes appropriate to each writer noticed at length and in this work she had an unknown collaborator in the person of robert browning so ends the somewhat uneventful year of 1843  footnote 90 her contributions to the essays on tennyson and carlyle have recently been printed in messrs nichols and wises literary anecdotes of the nineteenth century i 33 ii 105     chapter iv  184446   the year 1844 marks an important epoch in the life of mrs browning it was in this year that as a result of the publication of her two volumes of poems she won her general and popular recognition as a poetess whose rank was with the foremost of living writers it was six years since she had published a volume of verse and in the meanwhile she had been gaining strength and literary experience she had tried her wings in the pages of popular periodicals she had profited by the criticisms on her earlier work and by intercourse with men of letters and though her defects in literary art were by no means purged away yet the flights of her inspiration were stronger and more assured the result is that although the volumes of 1844 do not contain absolutely her best workno one with the sonnets from the portuguese in his mind can affirm so much as thatthey contain that which has been most generally popular and which won her the position which for the rest of her life she held in popular estimation among the leaders of english poetry  the principal poem in these two volumes is the drama of exile of the genesis of this work miss barrett gives the following account in a letter to home dated december 28 1843  a volume full of manuscripts had been ready for more than a year when suddenly a short time ago when i fancied i had no heavier work than to make copy and corrections i fell upon a fragment of a sort of masque on the first days exile from edenor rather it fell upon me and beset me till i would finish it91  footnote 91 letters to rh home ii 146  at one time it was intended to use its name as the title to the two volumes but this design was abandoned and they appeared under the simple description of poems by elizabeth barrett barrett the vision of poets comes next in length to the drama and among the shorter pieces were several which rank among her best work the cry of the children wine of cyprus the dead pan bertha in the lane crowned and buried the mourning mother and the sleep together with such popular favourites as lady geraldines courtship the romaunt of the page and the rhyme of the duchess may since the publication of the seraphim volume the new era of poetry had developed itself to a notable extent tennyson had published the best of his earlier verse locksley hall ulysses the morte darthur the lotus eaters a dream of fair women and many more browning had issued his wonderful series of bells and pomegranates including pippa passes king victor and king charles dramatic lyrics the return of the druses and the blot on the scutcheon and it was among company such as this that miss barrett by general consent now took her place   to mrs martin january 8 1844  thank you again and again my dearest mrs martin for your flowers and the verses which gave them another perfume the incense of the heart lost not a grain of its perfume in coming so far and not a leaf of the flowers was ruffled and to see such gorgeous colours all on a sudden at christmas time was like seeing a vision and almost made flush and me rub our eyes thank you dearest mrs martin how kind of you the grace of the verses and the brightness of the flowers were too much for me altogether and when george exclaimed why she has certainly laid bare her greenhouse i had not a word to say in justification of myself for being the cause of it  papa admired the branch of australian origin so much that he walked all over the house with it beautiful it is indeed but my eyes turn back to the camellias i do believe that i like to look at a camellia better than at a rose and then these have a double association  i meant to write a long letter to you today but mr kenyon has been to see me and cut my time short before post time you remember perhaps how his brother married a german and after an exile of many years in germany returned last summer to england to settle well he cant bear us any longer his wife is growing paler and paler with the pressure of english social habits or rather unsocial habits and he himself is a german at heart and besides being a man of a singularly generous nature and accustomed to give away in handfuls of silver and gold onethird of every years income he dislikes the social obligation of spending it here so they are going back poor mr kenyon i am full of sympathy with him this returning to england was a dream of all last year to him he gave up his house to the new comers and bought a new one and talked of the brightness secured to his latter years by the presence of his only remaining near relative and i see that for all his effort towards a bright view of the matter he is disappointedvery should you suppose that four hundred pounds in vienna go as far as a thousand in england i should never have fancied it  you shall hear from me my dearest mrs martin in another few days and i send this as it is just because i am benighted by the post hour and do not like to pass your kindness with even one days apparent neglect  may god bless you and dear mr martin the kindest wishes for the long slope of coming year and for the many i trust beyond it belong to you from the deepest of our hearts  but shall you not be comingsetting outvery soon before i can write again  your affectionate ba   to john kenyan january 1844  i am so sorry dear mr kenyon to hearwhich i did last night for the first timeof your being unwell i had hoped that today would bring a better account but your note with its next week prospect is disappointing the ignominy would have been very preferableto us at least particularly as it need not have lasted beyond today dear georgie being quite recovered and at his law again and no more symptoms of smallpox in anybody we should all be well if it were not for me and my cough which is better but i am not quite well nor have yet been out  a letter came to me from dear miss mitford a few days since which i had hoped to talk to you about some of the subject of it is mr kenyons only fault which ought of course to be a large one to weigh against the multitudinous ones of other people but which seems to be he has the habit of walking in without giving notice he thinks it saves trouble whereas in a small family and at a distance from a town the effect is that one takes care to be provided for the whole time that one expects him and then by some exquisite ill luck on the only day when ones larder is empty in he comes and so if you have not written to interrupt her in this process of indefinite expectation the only fault will in her eyes grow as it ought as large as fifty others  i do hope dear mr kenyon soon to hear that you are betterand welland that your course of prophecy may not run smooth all through next week  very truly yours e barrett   saturday to john kenyon saturday night about march 1844  i return mr burgess criticism which i omitted to talk to you of this morning but which interested me much in the reading do let him understand how obliged to him i am for permitting me to look for a moment according to his view of the question perhaps my poetical sense is not convinced all through and certainly my critical sense is not worth convincing but i am delighted to be able to call by the name of aeschylus under the authority of mr burges those noble electrical lines electrical for double reasons which had struck me twenty times as aeschylean when i read them among the recognised fragments of sophocles you hear aeschyluss footsteps and voice in the lines no other of the gods could tread so heavily or speak so like thundering  i wrote all this to begin with hesitating how else to begin my very dear and kind friend you understanddo you notthrough an expression which whether written or spoken must remain imperfect to what deep full feeling of gratitude your kindness has moved me92 the good you have done me and just at the moment when i should have failed altogether without it and in more than one way and in a deeper than the obvious degreeall this i know better than you do and i thank you for it from the bottom of my heart i shall never forget it as long as i live to remember anything the book may fail signally after allthat is another question but i shall not fail to begin with and that i owe to you for i was falling to pieces in nerves and spirits when you came to help me i had only enough instinct left to be ashamed a little afterwards of having sent you in company too with miss martineaus heroic cheerfulness that note of weak because unavailing complaint it was a long compressed feeling breaking suddenly into words forgive and forget that i ever so troubled youno troubled is not the word for your kindnessand remember as i shall do the great good you have done me  may god bless you my dear cousin  affectionately yours always ebb  footnote 92 referring to mr kenyons encouraging comments on the drama of exile which he had seen in manuscript at a time when miss barrett was very despondent about it   this note is not to be answered  i am thinking of writing to moxon as there does not seem much to arrange the type and size of tennysons books seem upon examination to suit my purpose excellently   to john kenyan march 21 1844  no you never sent me back miss martineaus letter my dear cousin but you will be sure or rather mr crabb robinson will to find it in some too safe a place and then i shall have it in the meantime here are the other letters back again you will think that i was keeping them for a deposit a security till i had my ain again but i have only been idle and busy together they are the most interesting that can be and have quite delighted me by the way i who saw nothing to object to in the life in the sick room object very much to her argument in behalf of itan argument certainly founded on a miserable misapprehension of the special doctrine referred to in her letter there is nothing so elevating and ennobling to the nature and mind of man as the view which represents it raised into communion with god himself by the justification and purification of god himself platos dream brushed by the gate of this doctrine when it walked highest and won for him the title of divine that it is vulgarised sometimes by narrowminded teachers in theory and by hypocrites in action might be an argument if admitted at all against all truth poetry and music  on the other hand i was glad to see the leaning on the education question in which all my friends the dissenters did appear to me so painfully wrong and so unworthily wrong at once  and southeys letters i did quite delight in them they are more personal than any i ever saw of his and have more warm everyday life in them  the particular paul pry in question to come down to my life never intrudes it is his peculiarity and i put the stop exactly where i was bid and was going to put gabriels speech93 onlywith the pen in my hand to do iti found that the angel was a little too exclamatory altogether and that he had cried out o ruined earth and o miserable angel just before approaching to the habit of a mere caller of names so i altered the passage otherwise taking care of your full stop after despair thank you my dear mr kenyon  also i sent enough manuscript for the first sheet and a note to moxon yesterday last night thanking him for his courtesy about leigh hunts poems and following your counsel in every point only last night you will say but i have had such a headacheand some very painful vexation in the prospect of my maids leaving me who has been with me throughout my illness so that i am much attached to her with the best reasons for being so while the idea of a stranger is scarcely tolerable to me under my actual circumstances  the palm leaves94 are full of strong thought and good thoughtthought expressed excellently well but of poetry in the true sense and of imagination in any i think them bare and coldsomewhat wintry leaves to come from the east surely surely  may the change of air be rapid in doing you goodthe weather seems to be softening on purpose for you may god bless you dear mr kenyon i never can thank you enough when you return i shall be rustling my proofs about you to prove my faith in your kindness  ever affectionately yours ebb  footnote 93 in the drama of exile near the beginning poetical works i 7  footnote 94 by monckton milnes afterwards lord houghton   to hs boyd march 22 1844  my dearest mr boydi heard that once i wrote three times too long a letter to you i am aware that nine times too long a silence is scarcely the way to make up for it forgive me however as far as you can for every sort of fault when i once begin to write to you i do not know how to stop and i have had so much to do lately as scarcely to know how to begin to write to you hence these faultsnot quite tearsin spite of my penitence and the quotation  at last my book is in the press my great poem in the modest comparative sense my masque of exile as i call it at last95 consists of some nineteen hundred or two thousand lines and i call it masque of exile because it refers to lucifers exile and to that other mystical exile of the divine being which was the means of the return homewards of my adam and eve after the exultation of boldness of composition i fell into one of my deepest fits of despondency and at last at the end of most painful vacillations determined not to print it never was a manuscript so near the fire as my masque was i had not even the instinct of applying for help to anybody in the midst of this mr kenyon came in by accident and asked about my poem i told him that i had given it up despairing of my republic in the kindest way he took it into his hands and proposed to carry it home and read it and tell me his impression you know he said i have a prejudice against these sacred subjects for poetry but then i have another prejudice for you and one may neutralise the other the next day i had a letter from him with the returned manuscripta letter which i was absolutely certain before i opened it would counsel against the publication on the contrary his impression is clearly in favour of the poem and while he makes sundry criticisms on minor points he considers it very superior as a whole to anything i ever did beforemore sustained and fuller in power so my nerves are braced and i grow a man again and the manuscript as i told you is in the press moreover you will be surprised to hear that i think of bringing out two volumes of poems instead of one by advice of mr moxon the publisher also the americans have commanded an american edition to come out in numbers either a little before or simultaneously with the english one and provided with a separate preface for themselves  there now i have told you all this knowing your kindness and that you will care to hear of it  it has given me the greatest concern to hear of dear annies illness and i do hope both for your sake and for all our sakes that we may have better news of her before long  but i dont mean to fall into another scrape today by writing too much may god bless you my very dear friend  i am ever your affectionate ebb   footnote 95 there was however a still later last when it became the drama of exile   to hs boyd april i 1844  my very dear friendyour kind letter i was delighted to receive you mistake a good deal the capacities in judgment of the man96 the man is highly refined in his tastes and leaning to the classical i was going to say to your classical only suddenly i thought of ossian a good deal more than i do he has written satires in the manner of pope which admirers of pope have praised warmly and deservedly if i had hesitated about the conclusiveness of his judgments it would have been because of his confessed indisposition towards subjects religious and ways mystical and his occasional insufficient indulgence for rhymes and rhythms which he calls barrettian but these things render his favourable inclination towards my drama of exile still more encouraging as you will see to my hopes for it  still i do tremble a good deal inwardly when i come to think of what your own thoughts of my poem and poems in their twovolume development may finally be i am afraid of you you will tell me the truth as it appears to youupon that i may rely and i should not wish you to suppress a single disastrous thought for the sake of the unpleasantness it may occasion to me my own faith is that i have made progress since the seraphim only it is too possible as i confess to myself and you that your opinion may be exactly contrary to it  you are very kind in what you say about wishing to have some conversation as the medium of your information upon architecture with octaviusoccy as we call him he is very much obliged to you and proposes if it should not be inconvenient to you to call upon you on friday with arabel at about one oclock friday is mentioned because it is a holiday no work being done at mr barrys otherwise he is engaged every day except indeed sunday from nine in the morning to five in the afternoon may god bless you dearest mr boyd i am ever  your affectionate elizabeth b barrett  footnote 96 john kenyon see the last letter   to mr westwood april 16 1844   surely surely it was not likely i should lean to utilitarianism in the notice on carlyle as i remember the writer of that article leans somewherei who am reproached with transtranstranscendentalisms and not without reason or with insufficient reason  oh and i should say also that mr home in his kindness has enlarged considerably in his annotations and reflections on me personally97 my being in correspondence with all the kings of the east for instance is an exaggeration although literary work in one way will bring with it happily literary association in others still i am not a great letter writer and i dont write elegant latin verses as all the gods of rome know and i have not been shut up in the dark for seven years by any manner of means by the way a barrister said to my barrister brother the other day i suppose your sister is dead dead said he a little struck dead why yes after mr homes account of her being sealed up hermetically in the dark for so many years one can only calculate upon her being dead by this time  elizabeth barrett  several of the letters to mr boyd which follow refer to that celebrated gift of cyprus wine which led to the composition of one of miss barretts best known and most quoted poems  footnote 97 in the new spirit of the age    to hs boyd june 18 1844  thank you my very dear friend i write to you drunk with cyprus nothing can be worthier of either gods or demigods and if as you say achilles did not drink of it i am sorry for him i suppose jupiter had it instead just thenhebe pouring it and junos oxeyes bellowing their splendour at it if you will forgive me that broken metaphor for the sake of aeschyluss genius and my own particular intoxication  indeed there never was in modern days such wine flush to whom i offered the last drop in my glass felt it was supernatural and ran away i have an idea that if he had drunk that drop he would have talked afterwardseither greek or english  never was such wine the very taste of ideal nectar only stiller from keeping if the bubbles of eternity were on it we should run away perhaps like flush  still the thought comes to me ought i to take it from you is it right of me are you not too kind in sending it and should you be allowed to be too kind in any case you must not think of sending me more than you have already sent it is more than enough and i am not less than very much obliged to you  i have passed the middle of my second volume and i only hope that critics may say of the rest that it smells of greek wine dearest mr boyds  ever affectionate eb barrett   to mr westwood june 28 1844  my dear mr westwoodi have certainly and considerably increased the evidence of my own death by the sepulchral silence of the last few days but after all i am not dead not even at heart so as to be insensible to your kind anxiety and i can assure you of this upon very fair authority neither is the book dead yet it has turned the corner of the felo de se and if it is to die it will be by the critics the mystery of the long delay it would not be very easy for me to explain notwithstanding i hear mr moxon says i suppose miss barrett is not in a hurry about her publication and i say i suppose moxon is not in a hurry about the publication there may be a little fault on my side when i have kept a proof a day beyond the hour or when copy has put out new buds in my hands as i passed it to the printers still in my opinion it is a good deal more the fault of mr moxons not being in a hurry than in the excessive virtue of my patience or vice of my indolence miss mitford says as you do that she never heard of so slowfooted a book   to hs boyd 50 wimpole street wednesday august i 1844 postmark  my very dear friendhave you expected to hear from me and are you vexed with me i am a little ambitious of the first itemyet hopeful of an escape from the last if you did but know how i am pressed for time and how i have too much to do every day you would forgive me for my negligence even if you had sent me nectar instead of mountain98 and i had neglected laying my gratitude at your feet last saturday upon its being discovered that my first volume consisted of only 208 pages and my second of 280 pages mr moxon uttered a cry of reprehension and wished to tear me to pieces by his printers as the bacchantes did orpheus perhaps you might have heard my head moaning all the way to st johns wood he wanted to tear away several poems from the end of the second volume and tie them on to the end of the first i could not and would not hear of this because i had set my mind on having dead pan to conclude with so there was nothing for it but to finish a ballad poem called lady geraldines courtship which was lying by me and i did so by writing ie composing one hundred and forty lines last saturday99 i seemed to be in a dream all day long lines toowith fifteen syllables in each i see you shake your head all this way off moreover it is a romance of the age treating of railroads routes and all manner of temporalities and in so radical a temper that i expect to be reproved for it by the conservative reviews round by the way did i tell you of the good news i had from america the third of this month the drama of exile is in the hands of a new york publisher and having been submitted to various chief critics of the country on its way was praised loudly and extravagantly this was however by a private reading only a bookseller at philadelphia had announced it for publicationhe intended to take it up when the english edition reached america but upon its being represented to him that the new york publisher had proof sheets direct from the author and would give copy money he abandoned his intention to the other i confess i feel very much pleased at the kind spiritthe spirit of eager kindness indeedwith which the americans receive my poetry it is not wrong to be pleased i hope in this country there may be mortifications waiting for me quite enough to keep my modesty in a state of cultivation i do not know i hope the work will be out this week and then did i explain to you that what lady geraldines courtship was wanted for was to increase the size of the first volume so as to restore the equilibrium of volumes without dislocating pan oh how anxious i shall be to hear your opinion if you tell me that i have lost my intellects what in the world shall i do thenwhat shall i do my americansthat is my americans who were in at the private reading and perhaps i myselfare of opinion that i have made great progress since the seraphim it seems to me that i have more reach whether in thought or language but then to you it may appear quite otherwise and i shall be very melancholy if it does only you must tell me the precise truth and i trust to you that you will let me have it in its integrity  all the life and strength which are in me seem to have passed into my poetry it is my pou stonot to move the world but to live on in  i must not forget to tell you that there is a poem towards the end of the second volume called cyprus wine which i have done myself the honor and pleasure of associating with your name i thought that you would not be displeased by it as a proof of grateful regard from me  talking of wines the mountain has its attraction but certainly is not to be compared to the cyprus you will see how i have praised the latter well now i must say goodbye which you will praise me for  dearest mr boyds affectionate ebb  psnota benei wish to forewarn you that i have cut away in the text none of my vowels by apostrophes when i say to efface wanting twosyllable measure i do not write t efface as in the old fashion but to efface full length this is the style of the day also you will find me a little lax perhaps in metrea freedom which is the result not of carelessness but of conviction and indeed of much patient study of the great fathers of english poetrynot meaning mr pope be as patient with me as you can you shall have the volumes as soon as they are ready   footnote 98 evidently a reference to the name of some wine perhaps montepulciano sent her by mr boyd see the end of the letter  footnote 99 it will be observed that this is not quite the same as the current legend which asserts that the whole poem of 412 lines was composed in twelve hours   to hs boyd august 6 1844  my very dear friendi cannot be certain from my recollections whether i did or did not write to you before as you suggest but as you never received the letter and i was in a continual press of different thoughts the probability is that i did not write the cyprus wine in the second vial i certainly did receive and was grateful to you with the whole force of the aroma of it and now i will tell you an anecdote  in the excess of my filial tenderness i poured out a glass for papa and offered it to him with my right hand  what is this said he  taste it said i as laconically but with more emphasis  he raised it to his lips and after a moment recoiled with such a face as sinned against adams image and with a shudder of deep disgust  why he said what most beastly and nauseous thing is this oh he said what detestable drug is this oh oh he said i shall never never get this horrible taste out of my mouth  i explained with the proper degree of dignity that it was greek wine cyprus wine and of very great value  he retorted with acrimony that it might be greek twice over but that it was exceedingly beastly  i resumed with persuasive argument that it could scarcely be beastly inasmuch as the taste reminded one of oranges and orange flower together to say nothing of the honey of mount hymettus  he took me up with stringent logic that any wine must positively be beastly which pretending to be wine tasted sweet as honey and that it was beastly on my own showing i send you this report as an evidence of a curious opinion but drinkers of port wine cannot be expected to judge of nectarand i hold your cyprus to be pure nectar  i shall have pleasure in doing what you ask me to dothat is i willif you promise never to call me miss barrett again you have often quite vexed me by it there is baelizabethelzbethellieany modification of my name you may call me bybut i wont be called miss barrett by you do you understand arabel means to carry your copy of my book to you and i beg you not to fancy that i shall be impatient for you to read the two volumes through if you ever read them through it will be a sufficient compliment and indeed i do not expect that you ever will  may god bless you dearest mr boyd  i remain  your affectionate and grateful elizabeth b barrett  the date of this last letter marks as nearly as need be the date of publication of miss barretts volumes the letters which follow deal mainly with their reception first at the hand of friends and then by the regular critics the general verdict of the latter was extremely complimentary mr chorley in the athenaeum100 described the volumes as extraordinary adding that between her miss barretts poems and the slighter lyrics of most of the sisterhood there is all the difference which exists between the puttingon of singing robes for altar service and the taking up lute or harp to enchant an indulgent circle of friends and kindred in the examiner101 john forster declared that miss barrett is an undoubted poetess of a high and fine order as regards the first requisites of her artimagination and expression she is a most remarkable writer and her volumes contain not a little which the lovers of poetry will never willingly let die a phrase then not quite so hackneyed as it has since become the atlas102 asserted that the present volumes show extraordinary powers and abating the failings of which all the followers of tennyson are guilty extraordinary genius more influential even than these blackwood103 paid her the compliment of a whole article criticising her faults frankly but declaring that her poetical merits infinitively outweigh her defects her genius is profound unsullied and without a flaw all agreed in assigning her a high or the highest place among the poetesses of england but as miss barrett herself pointed out this in itself was no great praise104  footnote 100 august 24 1844  footnote 101 october 5 1844  footnote 102 september 31 1844  footnote 103 november 1844  footnote 104 see letter of january 3 1845  with regard to individual poems the critics did not take kindly to the drama of exile and blackwood in particular criticised it at considerable length calling it the least successful of her works the subject while half challenging comparison with milton lends itself only too readily to fancifulness and unreality which were among the most besetting sins of miss barretts genius the minor poems were incomparably more popular and the favourite of all was that masterpiece of rhetorical sentimentality lady geraldines courtship it must have been a little mortifying to the authoress to find this piece a large part of which had been dashed off at a single heat in order to supply the printers needs preferred to others on which she had employed all the labour of her deliberate art but with the general tone of all the critics she had every reason to be as content as her letters show her to have been only two criticisms rankled the one that she was a follower of tennyson the other that her rhymes were slovenly and careless and these appeared in varying shapes in nearly all the reviews  the former of these allegations is of little weight whatever qualities miss barrett may have shared with tennyson her substantial independence is unquestionable it is a case rather of coincidence than imitation or if imitation it is of a slight and unconscious kind the second criticism deserves fuller notice because it is constantly repeated to this day the following letters show how strongly miss barrett protested against it as she told horne105 with reference to this very subject if i fail ultimately before the publicthat is before the peoplefor an ephemeral popularity does not appear to me to be worth trying forit will not be because i have shrunk from the amount of labour where labour could do anything i have worked at poetry it has not been with me reverie but art that her rhymes were inexact especially in such poems as the dead pan she did not deny but her defence was that the inexactness was due to a deliberate attempt to widen the artistic capabilities of the english language partly perhaps as a result of her acquaintance with italian literature she had a marked fondness for disyllabic rhymes and since pure rhymes of this kind are not plentiful in english she tried the experiment of using assonances instead hence such rhymes as silence and islands vision and procession panther and saunter examples which could be indefinitely multiplied if need were now it may be that a writer with a very sensitive ear would not have attempted such an experiment and it is a fact that public taste has not approved it but the experiment itself is as legitimate as say the metrical experiments in hexameters and hendecasyllabics of longfellow or tennyson and whether approved or not it should be criticised as an experiment not as mere carelessness that mrs brownings ear was quitecapable of discerning true rhymes is shown by the fact that she tacitly abandoned her experiment in assonances not only in the pure and high art of the sonnets from the portuguese but even in casa guidi windows the rhetorical and sometimes colloquial tone of which might have been thought to lend itself to such devices imperfect rhymes occur but rarely not exceeding the limits allowed to himself by every poet who has rhymed given and heaven and the roll of those who have not done so must be small indeed  footnote 105 letters to rh horne ii 119  the point has seemed worth dwelling on because it touches a commonplace of criticism as regards mrs browning but we may now make way for her own comments on her critics and friends   to hs boyd tuesday august 13 1844 postmark  my very dear friendi must thank you for the great kindness with which you have responded to a natural expression of feeling on my part and for all the pleasure of finding you pleased with the inscription of cyprus wine your note has given me much true pleasure yes if my verses survive me i should wish them to relate the fact of my being your debtor for many happy hours  and now i must explain to you that most of the incorrectnesses you speak of may be incorrectnesses but are not negligences i have a theory about double rhymes for whichi shall be attacked by the critics but which i could justify perhaps on high authority or at least analogy in fact these volumes of mine have more double rhymes than any two books of english poems that ever to my knowledge were printed i mean of english poems not comic now of double rhymes in use which are perfect rhymes you are aware how few there are and yet you are also aware of what an admirable effect in making a rhythm various and vigorous double rhyming is in english poetry therefore i have used a certain licence and after much thoughtful study of the elizabethan writers have ventured it with the public and do you tell me you who object to the use of a different vowel in a double rhyme why you rhyme as everybody does without blame from anybody given to heaven when you object to my rhyming remember and chamber the analogy surely is all on my side and i believe that the spirit of the english language is also  i write all this because you will find many other sins of the sort besides those in the cyprus wine and because i wish you to consider the subject as a point for consideration seriously and not to blame me as a writer of careless verses if i deal too much in licences it is not because i am idle but because i am speculative for freedoms sake it is possible you know to be wrong conscientiously and i stand up for my conscience only  i thank you earnestly for your candour hitherto and i beseech you to be candid to the end    it is tawny as rheas lion  i know although you dont say so you object to that line yet consider its structure does not the final y of tawny suppose an apostrophe and apocope do you not run tawny as into two syllables naturally i want you to see my principle  with regard to blank verse the great fletcher admits sometimes seventeen syllables into his lines  i hope miss heard received her copy and that you will not think me arrogant in writing freely to you  believe me i write only freely and not arrogantly and i am impressed with the conviction that my work abounds with far more faults than you in your kindness will discover notwithstanding your acumen  always your affectionate and grateful elibet   to hs boyd wednesday august 14 1844 postmark  my dearest mr boydi must thank you for the great great pleasure with which i have this moment read your note the more welcome as without hypocrisy i had worked myself up into a nervous apprehension from your former one that i should seem so rudis atque incomposita to you in consequence of certain licences as to end by being intolerable i know what an ear you have and how you can hear the dust on the wheel as it goes on well i wrote to you yesterday to beg you to be patient and considerate  but you are always given to surprise me with abundant kindnesswith supererogatory kindness i believe in that certainly  i am very very glad that you think me stronger and more perspicuous for the perspicuity i have struggled hard  your affectionate and grateful elzbeth   to mr westwood 50 wimpole street august 22 1844   thank you for your welcome letter so kind in its candour i angry that you should prefer the seraphim angry no indeed indeed i am grateful for the seraphim and not exacting for the drama and all the more because of a secret obstinate persuasion that the drama will have a majority of friends in the end and perhaps deserve to have them nay why should i throw perhapses over my own impressions and be insincere to you who have honoured me by being sincere why should i dissemble my own belief that the drama is worth two or three seraphimsmy own belief you know which is worth nothing writers knowing themselves so superficially and having such a natural leaning to their last work still i may say honestly to you that i have a far more modest value for the seraphim than your kindness suggests and that i have seemed to myself to have a clear insight into the fact that that poem was only borne up by the minor poems published with it from immediate destruction there is a want of unity in it which vexes me to think of and the other faults magnify themselves day by day more and more in my eyes therefore it is not that i care more for the drama but i care less for the seraphim both poems fall short of my aspiration and desire but the drama seems to me fuller freer and stronger and worth the other three times over if it has anything new i think it must be something new into which i have lived for certainly i wrote it sincerely and from an inner impulse in fact i never wrote any poem with so much sense of pleasure in the composition and so rapidly with continuous flowfrom fifty to a hundred lines a day and quite in a glow of pleasure and impulse all through still you have not been used to see me in blank verse and there may be something in that that the poem is full of faults and imperfections i do not in the least doubt i have vibrated between exultations and despondencies in the correcting and printing of it though the composition went smoothly to an end and i am prepared to receive the bastinado to the critical degree i do assure you the few opinions i have yet had are all to the effect that my advance on the former publication is very great and obvious but then i am aware that people who thought exactly the contrary would be naturally backward in giving me their opinion indeed i thank you most earnestly truth and kindness how rarely do they come together i am very grateful to you it is curious that duchess may is not a favorite of mine and that i have sighed one or two secret wishes towards its extirpation but other writers besides yourself have singled it out for praise in private letters to me there has been no printed review yet i believe and when i think of them i try to think of something else for with no private friends among the critical body not that i should desire to owe security in such a matter to private friendship it is awful enough this looking forward to be reviewed never mind the ultimate prosperity of the book lies far above the critics and can neither be mended nor made nor unmade by them   to john kenyan wednesday morning august 1844  i return mr chorleys106 note my dear cousin with thankful thoughts of himas of you i wish i could persuade you of the rightness of my view about essays on mind and such things and how the difference between them and my present poems is not merely the difference between two schools as you seemed to intimate yesterday nor even the difference between immaturity and maturity but that it is the difference between the dead and the living between a copy and an individuality between what is myself and what is not myself to you who have a personal interest andmay i say affection for me the girls exercise assumes a factitious value but to the public the matter is otherwise and ought to be otherwise and for the psychological side of the question do observe that i have not reputation enough to suggest a curiosity about my legends instead of your legendary lore it would be just a legendary bore now you understand what i mean i do not underrate pope nor his school but i do disesteem everything which bearing the shape of a book is not the true expression of a mind and i know and feel and so do you that a girls exercise written when all the experience lay in books and the mind was suited rather for intelligence than production lying like an infants face with an undeveloped expression must be valueless in itself and if offered to the public directly or indirectly as a work of mine highly injurious to me why of the prometheus volume even you know what i think and desire the seraphim with all its feebleness and shortcomings and obscurities yet is the first utterance of my own individuality and therefore the only volume except the last which is not a disadvantage to me to have thought of and happily for me the early books never having been advertised nor reviewed except by accident once or twice are as safe from the public as manuscript  oh i shudder to think of the lines which might have been nicked in and all through mr chorleys good nature as if i had not sins enough to ruin me in the new poems without reviving juvenile ones sinned when i knew no better perhaps you would like to have the series of epic poems which i wrote from nine years old to eleven they might illustrate some doctrine of innate ideas and enrich to that end the myths of metaphysicians  and also agree with me in reverencing that wonderful genius keats who rising as a grand exception from among the vulgar herd of juvenile versifiers was an individual man from the beginning and spoke with his own voice though surrounded by the yet unfamiliar murmur of antique echoes107 leigh hunt calls him the young poet very rightly most affectionately and gratefully yours  ebb  do thank mr chorley for me will you  footnote 106 henry fothergill chorley 18081872 was one of the principal members of the staff of the athenaeum especially in literary and musical matters dr garnett in the dictionary of national biography says of him shortly after his first joining the staff in 1833 that his articles largely contributed to maintain the reputation the athenaeum had already acquired for impartiality at a time when puffery was more rampant than ever before or since and when the only other london literary journal of any pretension was notoriously venal he also wrote several novels and dramas which met with but little popular success  footnote 107 compare aurora leighs asseveration    by keats soul the man who never stepped   in gradual progress like another man   but turning grandly on his central

kind letter a reply to which should certainly as you desired have met you at colwall only right or wrong i have been flurried agitated put out of the way altogether by stormies and henrys plan of going to egypt ah now you are surprised now you think me excusable for being silent two days beyond my timeyes and they have gone it is no vague speculation you know or perhaps you dont know that a little time back papa bought a ship put a captain and crew of his own in it and began to employ it in his favourite via lactea of speculations it has been once to odessa with wool i think and now it has gone to alexandria with coals stormie was wild to go to both places and with regard to the last papa has yielded and henry goes too this was all arranged weeks ago but nothing was said of it until last monday to me and when i heard it i was a good deal moved of course and although resigned now to their having their way in it and their pleasure which is better than their way still i feel i have entered a new anxiety and shall not be quite at ease again till they return  and now to thank you my everdearest mrs martin for your kind and welcome letter from the lakes i knew quite at the first page and long before you said a word specifically that dear mr martin was better and think that such a scene even from under an umbrella must have done good to the soul and body of both of you i wish i could have looked through your eyes for once but i suppose that neither through yours nor through my own am i ever likely to behold that sight in the meantime it is with considerable satisfaction that i hear of your failure of wordsworth which was my salvation in a very awful sense why if you had done such a thing you would have put me to the shame of too much honor the speculation consoles me entirely for your loss in respect to rydal hall and its poet by the way i heard the other day that rogers who was intending to visit him said it is a bad time of year for it the god is on his pedestal and can only give gestures to his worshippers and no conversation to his friends   although you did not find a letter from me on your return to colwall i do hope that you found meviz my book which mr burden took charge of and promised to deliver or see delivered when you have read it do let me hear your own and mr martins true impression and whether you think it worse or better than the seraphim the only review which has yet appeared or had time to appear has been a very kind and cordial one in the athenaeum   your ever affectionate ba   to mr westwood august 31 1844  my dear mr westwoodi send you the manuscript you ask for and also my certificate that although i certainly was once a little girl yet i never in my life had fair hair or received lessons when you mention i think a cousin of mine now dead may have done it the barrett barrett seems to specify my family i have a little cousin with bright fair hair at this moment who is an elizabeth barrett the subject of my portrait108 but then she is a georgiana besides and your friend must refer to times past my hair is very dark indeed and always was as long as i remember and also i have a friend who makes serious affidavit that i have never changed except by being rather taller since i was a year old altogether you cannot make a case of identity out and i am forced to give up the glory of being so long remembered for my cleverness  you do wrong in supposing me inclined to underrate mr melvilles power he is inclined to highchurchism and to such doctrines as apostolical succession and i who am a dissenter and a believer in a universal christianity recoil from the exclusive doctrine  but then that is not depreciatory of his power and eloquencesurely not  eb  footnote 108 poetical works iii 172   to mr chorley 50 wimpole street monday about the end of august 1844  dear mr chorleykindnesses are more frequent things with me than gladnesses but i thank you earnestly for both in the letter i have this moment received109 you have given me a quick sudden pleasure which goes deeper i am very sure than selflove for it must be something better than vanity that brings the tears so near the eyes i thank you dear mr chorley  after all we are not quite strangers i have had some early encouragement and direction from you and much earlier and later literary pleasures from such of your writings as did not refer to me i have studied music and manners110 under you and found an excuse for my love of romancereading from your grateful fancy then as dear miss mitfords friend you could not help being however against your will a little my acquaintance and this she daringly promised to make you in reality some day till i took the fervour for prophecy  altogether i am justified while i thank you as a stranger to say one more word as a friend and that shall be the best wordmay god bless you the trials with which he tries us all are different but our faces may be turned towards the end in cheerfulness for to the end he has loved us i remain  very faithfully your obliged elizabeth b barrett  you may trust me with the secret of your kindness to me it shall not go farther  footnote 109 a summary of its contents is given in the next letter but one  footnote 110 music and manners in france and germany a series of travelling sketches of art and society published by mr chorley in 1841   to hs boyd monday september 1 1844  my dearest mr boydi thank you for the cyprus and also for a still sweeter amreetayour praise certainly to be praised as you praise me might well be supposed likely to turn a sager head than mine but i feel that with all my sensitive and grateful appreciation of such words i am removed rather below than above the ordinary temptations of vanity poetry is to me rather a passion than an ambition and the gadfly which drives me along that road pricks deeper than an expectation of fame could do  moreover there will be plenty of counterirritation to prevent me from growing feverish under your praises and as a beginning i hear that the john bull newspaper has cut me up with sanguinary gashes for the edification of its sabbath readers i have not seen it yet but i hear so the drama is the particular victim do not send for the paper i will let you have it if you should wish for it  one thing is left to me to say arabel told you of a letter i had received from a professional critic and i am sorry that she should have told you so without binding you to secrecy on the point at the same time in fact the writer of the letter begged me not to speak of it and i took an engagement to him not to speak of it now it would be very unpleasant to me and dishonorable to me if after entering into this engagement the circumstance of the letter should come to be talked about of course you will understand that i do not object to your having been informed of the thing only arabel should have remembered to ask you not to mention again the name of the critic who wrote to me  may god bless you my very dear friend i drink thoughts of you in cyprus every day  your ever affectionate elibet  there is no review in the examiner yet nor any continuation in the athenaeum111  footnote 111 the athenaeum had reserved the two longer poems the drama of exile and the vision of poets for possible notice in a second article which however never appeared   to mrs martin september 10 1844  my dearest mrs martini will not lose a post in assuring you that i was not silent because of any disappointment from your previous letter i could only feel the kindness of that letter and this was certainly the chief and uppermost feeling at the time of reading it and since your preference of the seraphim one other person besides yourself has acknowledged to me in the same manner and although i myselfperhaps from the natural leaning to last works and perhaps from a wise recognition of the complete failure of the poem called the seraphim do disagree with you yet i can easily forgive you for such a thought and believe that you see sufficient grounds for entertaining it more and more i congratulate myself at any rate for the decision i came to at the last moment and in the face of some persuasions to call the book poems instead of trusting its responsibility to the drama by such a title as a drama of exile and poems it is plain as i anticipated that for one person who is ever so little pleased with the drama fifty at least will like the smaller poems and perhaps they are right the longer sustaining of a subject requires of course more power and i may have failed in it altogether  yes i think i may say that i am satisfied so far with the aspect of things in relation to the book you see there has scarcely been time yet to give any except a sanguine or despondent judgmenti mean there is scarcely room yet for forming a very rational inference of what will ultimately be without the presentiments of hope or fear the book came out too late in august for any chance of a mention in the september magazines and at the dead time of year when the very critics were thinking more of holiday innocence than of their carnivorous instincts this will not hurt it ultimately although it might have hurt a novel the regular critics will come back to it and in the meantime the newspaper critics are noticing it all round with more or less admissions to its advantage the atlas is the best of the newspapers for literary notices and it spoke graciously on the whole though i do protest against being violently attached to a school i have faults enough i know but it is just to say that they are at least my own well then it is true that the westminster review says briefly what is great praise and promises to take the earliest opportunity of reviewing me at large so that with regard to the critics there seems to be a good prospect then i have had some very pleasant private lettersone from carlyle an oath from miss martineau to give her whole mind to the work and tell me her free and full opinion which i have not received yet an assurance from an acquaintance of mrs jameson that she was much pleased but the letter which pleased me most was addressed to me by a professional critic personally unknown to me who wrote to say that he had traced me up step by step ever since i began to print and that my last volumes were so much better than any preceding them and were such living books that they restored to him the impulses of his youth and constrained him to thank me for the pleasant emotions they had excited i cannot say the name of the writer of this letter because he asked me not to do so but of course it was very pleasant to read now you will not call me vain for speaking of this i would not speak of it only i want you see to prove to you how faithfully and gratefully i have a trust in your kindness and sympathy it is certainly the best kindness to speak the truth to me i have written those poems as well as i could and i hope to write others better i have not reached my own ideal and i cannot expect to have satisfied other peoples expectation but it is as i sometimes say the least ignoble part of me that i love poetry better than i love my own successes in it  i am glad that you like the lost bower the scene of that poem is the wood above the garden at hope end  it is very true my dearest mrs martin all that you say about the voyage to alexandria and i do not feel the anxiety i thought i should in fact i am surprised to feel so little anxiety still when they are at home again i shall be happier than i am now that i feel strongly besides  what i missed most in your first letter was what i do not miss in the second the good news of dear mr martin both he and you are very vainglorious i suppose about oconnell but although i was delighted on every account at his late victory112 or rather at the late victory of justice and constitutional law he never was a hero of mine and is not likely to become one if he had been by the way a hero of mine i should have been quite ashamed of him for being so unequal to his grand position as was demonstrated by the speech from the balcony such poetry in the position and such prose in the speech he has not the stuff in him of which heroes are made there is a thread of cotton everywhere crossing the silk  with our united love to both of you ever dearest mrs martin most affectionately yours ba    footnote 112 the reversal by the house of lords of his conviction in ireland for conspiracy which the english court of queens bench had confirmed  to mrs martin wednesday about september 1844  my dearest mrs martin  did i tell you that miss martineau had promised and vowed to me to tell me the whole truth with respect to the poems her letter did not come until a few days ago and for a full month after the publication and i was so fearful of the probable sentence that my hands shook as they broke the seal but such a pleasant letter i have been overjoyed with it she says that her predominant impression is of the originalityvery pleasant to hear i must not forget however to say that she complains of want of variety in the general effect of the drama and that she likes lucifer less than anything in the two volumes you see how you have high backers still she talks of immense advances which consoles me again in fact there is scarcely a word to require consolation in her letter and what did not please me leastnay to do myself justice what put all the rest out of my head for some minutes with joyis the account she gives of herself for she is better and likely still to be better she has recovered appetite and sleep and lost the most threatening symptoms of disease she has been out for the first time for four years and a half lying on the grass flat she says with my books open beside her day after day that does sound vain of me but i cannot resist the temptation of writing it and the meansthe means such means you would never divine it is mesmerism she is thrown into the magnetic trance twice a day and the progress is manifest and the hope for the future clear now what do you both think consider what a case it is no case of a weakminded woman and a nervous affection but of the most manlike woman in the three kingdomsin the best sense of mana woman gifted with admirable fortitude as well as exercised in high logic a woman of sensibility and of imagination certainly but apt to carry her reason unbent wherever she sets her foot given to utilitarian philosophy and the habit of logical analysis and suffering under a disease which has induced change of structure and yielded to no tried remedy is it not wonderful and past expectation she suggests that i should try the meansbut i understand that in cases like mine the remedy has done harm instead of good by overexciting the system but her experience will settle the question of the reality of magnetism with a whole generation of infidels for my own part i have long been a believer in spite of papa then i have had very kind letters from mrs jameson the ennuyée113 and from mr serjeant talfourd and some less famous persons and a poet with a welsh name wrote to me yesterday to say that he was writing a poem similar to my drama of exile and begged me to subscribe to it now i tell you all this to make you smile and because some of it will interest you more gravely it will prove to dear unjust mr martin that i do not distrust your sympathy how could he think so of me i am half vexed that he should think so indeedindeed i am not so morbidly vain why if you had told me that the books were without any sort of value in your eyes do you imagine that i should not have valued you reverenced you ever after for your truth so sacred a thing in friendship i really believe it would have been my predominant feeling but you proved your truth without trying me so hardly i had both truth and praise from you and surely quite enough and more than enough as many would think of the latter  my dearest papa left us this morning to go for a few days into cornwall for the purpose of examining a quarry in which he has bought or is about to buy shares and he means to strike on for the lands end and to see falmouth before he returns it depresses me to think of his being away his presence or the sense of his nearness having so much cheering and soothing influence with me but it will be an excellent change for him even if he does not as he expects dig an immense fortune out of the quarries  your affectionate and ever obliged ba  footnote 113 mrs jamesons earliest book and one which achieved considerable popularity was her diary of an ennuyée   to cornelius mathews london 50 wimpole street october 1 1844  my dear mr mathewsi have just received your note which on the principle of single sighs or breaths being wafted from indies to the poles arrived quite safely and i was very glad to have it i shall fall into monotony if i go on to talk of my continued warm sense of your wonderful kindness to me a stranger according to the manner of men and indeed i have just this moment been writing a note to a friend two streets away and calling it wonderful kindness i cannot however of course allow you to run the tether of your impulse and furnish me with the reviews of my books and other things you speak of at your own expense and i should prefer if you would have the goodness to give the necessary direction to messrs putnam  co that they should send what would interest me to see together with a note of the pecuniary debt to themselves i shall like to see the reviews of course and that you should have taken the first word of american judgment into your own mouth is a pleasant thought to me and leaves me grateful in england i have no reason so far to be otherwise than well pleased there has not indeed been much yet besides newspaper criticismsexcept ainsworths magazine which is benignantthere has not been time the monthly reviews give themselves pause in such matters to set the plumes of their dignity and i am rather glad than otherwise not to have the first fruits of their haste the atlas the best newspaper for literary reviews excepting always the examiner who does not speak yet is generous to me and i have reason to be satisfied with others and our most influential quarterly after the edinburgh and right quarterly the westminster review promises an early paper with passing words of high praise what vexed me a little in one or two of the journals was an attempt made to fix me in a school and the calling me a follower of tennyson for my habit of using compound words nounsubstantives which i used to do before i knew a page of tennyson and adopted from a study of our old english writers and greeks and even germans the custom is so far from being peculiar to tennyson that shelley and keats and leigh hunt are all redolent of it and no one can read our old poets without perceiving the leaning of our saxon to that species of coalition then i have had letters of great kindness from spirits of the age whose praises are so many crowns and altogether am far from being out of spirits about the prospect of my work i am glad however that i gave the name of poems to the work instead of admitting the drama of exile into the titlepage and increasing its responsibility for one person who likes the drama ten like the other poems both carlyle and miss martineau select as favorite lady geraldines courtship which amuses and surprises me somewhat in that poem i had endeavoured to throw conventionalities turned asbestos for the nonce into the fire of poetry to make them glow and glitter as if they were not dull things well i shall soon hear what you like bestand worst i wonder if you have been very carnivorous with me i tremble a little to think of your hereditary claim to an instrument called the tomahawk still i am sure i shall have to think most ever as now of your kindness and truth must be sacred to all of us whether we have to suffer or be glad by it as for mr horne i cannot answer for what he has received or not received i had one note from him on silver paper fear of postage having reduced him to a transparency from germany and that is all and i did not think him in good spirits in what he said of himself i will tell him what you have the goodness to say and something too on my own part he has had a hard time of it with his spirit of the age the attacks on the book here being bitter in the extreme your democratic does not comfort him for the rest by the way and indeed he is almost past comfort on the subject i had a letter the other day from dr shelton mackenzie whom i do not know personally but who is about to publish a living author dictionary and who by some association talked of the effeminacy of the american poets so i begged him to read your poems on man and prepare an exception to his position i wish to write more and must not  most faithfully yours ebb  am i the first with the great and good news for america and england that harriet martineau is better and likely to be better she told me so herself and attributes the change to the agency of mesmerism   to hs boyd october 4 1844  my dearest mr boyd as to the lost bower i am penitent about having caused you so much disturbance i sometimes fancy that a little varying of the accents though at the obvious expense of injuring the smoothness of every line considered separately gives variety of cadence and fuller harmony to the general effect but i do not question that i deserve a great deal of blame on this point as on others many lines in isobels child are very slovenly and weak from a multitude of causes i hope you will like the lost bower better when you try it again than you did at first though i do not of course expect that you will not see much to cry out against the subject of the poem was an actual fact of my childhood  oh and i think i told you when giving you the history of lady geraldines courtship that i wrote the thirteen last pages of it in one day i ought to have said nineteen pages instead but dont tell anybody only keep the circumstance in your mind when you need it and see the faults nobody knows of it except you and mr kenyon and my own family for the reason i told you i sent off that poem to the press piecemeal as i never in my life did before with any poem and since i wrote to you i have heard of mr eagles one of the first writers in blackwood and a man of very refined taste adding another name to the many of those who have preferred it to anything in the two volumes he says that he has read it at least six times aloud to various persons and calls it a beautiful sui generis drama on which mr kenyon observes that i am ruined for life and shall be sure never to take pains with any poem again  the american edition did arabel tell you was to be out in new york a week ago and was to consist of fifteen hundred copies in two volumes as in england  she sends you the verses and asks you to make allowances for the delay in doing so i cannot help believing that if you were better read in wordsworth you would appreciate him better ever since i knew what poetry is i have believed in him as a great poet and i do not understand how reasonably there can be a doubt of it will you remember that nearly all the first minds of the age have admitted his power without going to intrinsic evidence and then say that he can be a mere grub street writer it is not that he is only or chiefly admired by the profanum vulgus that he is a mere popular and fashionable poet but that men of genius in this and other countries unite in confessing his genius and is not this a significant circumstancesignificant at least  believe me yourself your affectionate and grateful elibet bb  how kind you are far too kind about the cyprus wine i thank you very much   to mrs martin october 5 1844  my dearest mrs martin well papa came back from cornwall just as i came back to my own room and he was as pleased with his quarry as i was to have the sight again of his face during his absence henrietta had a little polka which did not bring the house down on its knees and i had a transparent blind put up in my open window there is a castle in the blind and a castle gateway and two walks and several peasants and groves of trees which rise in excellent harmony with the fall of my green damask curtainsnew since you saw me last papa insults me with the analogy of a back window in a confectioners shop but is obviously moved when the sunshine lights up the castle notwithstanding and mr kenyon and everybody in the house grow ecstatic rather than otherwise as they stand in contemplation before it and tell me what is obvious without their evidence that the effect is beautiful and that the whole room catches a light from it well and then mr kenyon has given me a new table with a rail round it to consecrate it from flushs paws and large enough to hold all my varieties of vanities  i had another letter from miss martineau the other day and she says she has a hat of her own a parasol of her own and that she can walk a mile with ease what do miracles mean miracle or not however one thing is certainit is very joyful and her own sensations on being removed suddenly from the verge of the prospect of a most painful deatha most painful and lingering deathmust be strange and overwhelming  i hope i may hear soon from you that you had much pleasure at clifton and some benefit in the air and change and that dear mr martin and yourself are both as well as possible do you take in punch if not you ought mr kenyon and i agreed the other day that we should be more willing to take our politics from punch than from any other of the newspaper oracles punch is very generous and i like him for everything except for his rough treatment of louis philippe whom i believe to be a great manfor a king and then it is well worth fourpence to laugh once a week i do recommend punch to you114 douglas jerrold is the editor i fancy and he has a troop of wits such as planché titmarsh and the author of little peddlington to support him  now i have written enough to tire you i am sure may god bless you both did you read coningsby that very able book without character story or specific teaching it is well worth reading and worth wondering over disraeli who is a man of genius has written nevertheless books which will live longer and move deeper but everybody should read coningsby it is a sign of the times believe me my dearest mrs martin  your very affectionate ba   to john kenyon tuesday october 8 1844  thank you my dearest cousin for your kind little note which i run the chance of answering by that wednesdays post you think you may wait for so via your table i set about writing to you and the first word of course must be an expression of my contentment with the examiner review indeed i am more than contenteddelighted with it i had some dread vaguely fashioned about the examiner the very delay looked ominous and then i thought to myself though i did not say that if mr forster praised the verses on flush to you it was just because he had no sympathy for anything else but it is all the contrary you see and i am the more pleased for the want of previous expectation and i must add that if you were so kind as to be glad of being associated with me by mr forsters reference i was so human as to be very very glad of being associated with you by the same also you shall criticise geraldine exactly as you likemind i dont think it all so rough as the extracts appear to be and some variety is attained by that playing at ball with the pause which causes the apparent roughnessstill you shall criticise geraldine exactly as you like i have a great fancy for writing some day a longer poem of a like classa poem comprehending the aspect and manners of modern life and flinching at nothing of the conventional i think it might be done with good effect you said once that tennyson had done it in locksley hall and i half agreed with you but looking at locksley hall again i find that not much has been done in that way noble and passionate and full as the poem is in other ways but there is no story no manners no modern allusion except in the grand general adjuration to the motherage and no approach to the treatment of a conventionality but crabbe as you say has done it and campbell in his theodore in a few touches was near to do it but hayley clearly apprehends the species of poem in his triumphs of temper and triumphs of music and so did miss seward who called it the poetical novel now i do think that a true poetical novelmodern and on the level of the manners of the daymight be as good a poem as any other and much more popular besides do you not think so  i had a letter from dear miss mitford this morning with yours but i can find nothing in it that you will care to hear again she complains of the vagueness of coningsby and praises the french writersa sympathy between us that last which we wear hidden in our sleeves for the sake of propriety not a word of coming to london though i asked neither have i heard again from miss martineau  ever most affectionately and gratefully yours ebb  footnote 114 it will be remembered that punch had only been in existence for three years at this time which will account for this apparently superfluous advice   to mrs martin october 15 1844   not a word more have i heard from miss martineau and shall not soon perhaps as she is commanded not to write not to readto do nothing in fact except the getting better i am not i confess quite satisfied myself but she herself appears to be so altogether and she speaks of symptoms having given way implying a structural change yes i use the common phrase in respect to mesmerism and think there is something in it only i think besides that if something there must be a great deal in it clairvoyance has precisely the same evidence as the phenomenon of the trance has and scientific and philosophical minds are recognising all the phenomena as facts on all sides of us mr kenyons is the best distinction and the immense quantity of humbug which embroiders the truth over and over and round and round makes it needful i believe in mesmerism but not in mesmerists  we have had no other letter from our egyptians but can wait a little longer without losing our patience  the blind rises in favour and the ivy would not fall if it would but live alas i am going to try guano as a last resource you see in painting the windows papa was forced to have it taken down and the ivy that grows on ruins and oaks is not usually taken down for the nonce i think i shall have a myrtle grove in two or three large pots inside the window i have a mind to try it  i heard twice from dear mr kenyon at dover where he was detained by the weather but not since his entrance into france which is grand enough word for the french majesty itselfentrance into france by the way i do hope you have some sympathy with me in my respect for the king of the frenchthat right kingly king louis philippe if france had borne more liberty he would not have withheld it and for the rest and in all truly royal qualities he is the noblest king according to my idea in europethe most royal king in the encouragement of art and literature and in the honoring of artists and men of letters let a young unknown writer accomplish a successful tragedy and the next day he sits at the kings tablenot in a metaphor but face to face see how different the matter is in our court where the artists are shown up the back stairs and where no poet even by the back stairs can penetrate unless so fortunate as to be a banker also what is the use of kings and queens in these days except to encourage arts and letters really i cannot see anybody can hunt an otter out of a boxwho has nerve enough  i had a letter from america today and heard that my book was not published there until the fifth of this october still a few copies had preceded the publication and made way among the critics and several reviews were in the course of germinating very greenly yes i was delighted with the examiner and all the more so from having interpreted the long delay of the notice the gloomiest manner possible my friends try to persuade me that the book is making some impression and i am willing enough to be convinced thank you for all your kind sympathy my dear friend  now do write to me soon again have you read dr arnolds life i have not but am very anxious to do so from the admirable extracts in the examiner of last saturday and also from what i hear of it in other quarters that dr arnold must have been a man in the largest and noblest sense may god bless you both of you i think of you dearest mrs martin much and remain  your very affectionate ba   to john kenyon saturday october 29 1844  the moral of your letter my dearest cousin certainly is that no green herb of a secret will spring up and flourish between you and me  the loss of flush was a secret my aunts intention of coming to england for i know not how to explain what she said to you but by the supposition of an unfulfilled intention was a secret and mr chorleys letter to me was a third secret all turned into light  for the last you may well praise me for discretion the letter he wrote was pleasanter to me than many of the kindnesses apart from your own occasioned by my bookand when you asked me once what letters i had received if ever a woman deserved to be canonised for her silence i did but the effort was necessaryfor he particularly desired that i would not mention to our common friends the circumstance of his having written to me and common friends could only stand for mr kenyon and miss mitford of course what you tell me of his liking the poems better still is delightful to hear but he reviewed them in the athenaeum surely the review we read in the athenaeum was by his handcould not be mistaken   well but flushie it is too true that he has been lostlost and won and true besides that i was a good deal upset by it meo more and that i found it hard to eat and sleep as usual while he was in the hands of his enemies it is a secret too we would not tell papa of it papa would have been angry with the unfortunate person who took flush out without a chain and would have kicked against the pricks of the necessary bribing of the thief in order to the getting him back therefore we didnt tell papa and as i had a very bad convenient headache the day my eyes were reddest i did not see him except once till flush was on the sofa again as to the thieves you are very kind to talk daggers at them and i feel no inclination to say dont it is quite too bad and cruel and think of their exceeding insolence in taking flush away from this very door while arabel was waiting to have the door opened on her return from her walk and in observing as they gave him back for six guineas and a half that they intended to have him again at the earliest opportunity and that then they must have ten guineas i tell poor flushie while he looks very earnestly in my face that he and i shall be ruined at last and that i shall have no money to buy him cakes but the worst is the anxiety whether i am particularly silly or not i dont know they say here that i am but it seems to me impossible for anybody who really cares for a dog to think quietly of his being in the hands of those infamous men and then i know how poor flushie must feel it when he was brought home he began to cry in his manner whine as if his heart was full it was just what i was inclined to do myself and thus was flushie lost and won  but we are both recovered now thank you and intend to be very prudent for the future i am delighted to think of your being in england it is the next best thing to your being in london in regard to miss martineau i agree with you word for word but i cannot overcome an additional horror which you do not express or feel probably  there is an excellent refutation of puseyism in the edinburgh reviewby whom and i have been reading besides the admirable paper by macaulay in the same number and now i must be done having resolved to let you hear without a posts delay otherwise i might have american news for you as i hear that a packet has come in  my brothers arrived in great spirits at malta after a three weeks voyage from gibraltar and must now be in egypt i think and trust  may god bless you my dear cousin  most affectionately yours ebb   to john kenyan 50 wimpole street november 5 1844  well but am i really so bad  et tu can you call me careless remember all the altering of manuscript and proofand remember how the obscurities used to fly away before your cloudcompelling when you were the jove of the criticisms that the books i wont call them our books when i am speaking of the faults are remarkable for defects and superfluities of evil i can see quite as well as another but then i wont admit that  it comes of my carelessness and refusing to take pains on the contrary my belief is that very few writers called  correct  who have selected classical models to work from pay more laborious attention than i do habitually to the forms of thought and expression  lady geraldine  was an exception in her whole history if i write fast sometimes and the historical fact is that what has been written fastest has pleased most l am not apt to print without consideration i appeal to philip sober if i am my dearest cousin do remember as to the faults i do not think of defending them be very sure my consolation is that i may try to do better in time if i may talk of time the worst fault of all as far as expression goes the adjectivesubstantives whether in prose or verse i cannot make up my mind to consider faulty is that kind of obscurity which is the same thing with inadequate expression be very suretry to be very surethat i am not obstinate and selfopiniated beyond measure to you in case who have done so much for me and who think of me so more than kindly i feel it to be both duty and pleasure to defer and yield still you know we could not if we were ten years about it alter down the poems to the terms of all these reviewers you would not desire it if it were possible i do not remember that you suggested any change in the verse on aeschylus the critic115 mistakes my allusion which was to the fact that in the acting of the eumenides when the great tragic poet did actually frown as the gods did women fell down fainting from the benches i did not refer to the effect of his human countenance during composition but i am very grateful to the reviewer whoever he may beveryand with need see how the sun shines in response to blackwood thank you for sending me that notice when previously we had had but a wintry rag from the same quarter no if i am not spoilt by your kindness i am not likely to be so by any of these exoteric praises however beyond what i expected or deserved and then i am like a bird with one wing broken throw it out of the window and after the first feeling of pleasure in liberty it falls heavily i have had moments of great pleasure in hearing whatever good has been thought of the poems but the feeling of elation is too strong or rather too long for me  can it be true that mr newman has at last joined the church of rome116 if it is true it will do much to prove to the most illogical minds the real character of the late movement it will prove what the point of sight is as by the drawing of a straight line miss mitford told me that he had lately sent a message to a r catholic convert from the english church to the effectyou have done a good deed but not at a right time it can but be a question of time indeed to the whole party at least to such as are logicaland honest unsigned  footnote 115 in blackwood  footnote 116 newman did not actually enter the church of rome until nearly a year later in october 1845   to john kenyan 50 wimpole street november 8 1844  thank you my dear dear cousin for the kind thought of sending me mr eagless letter and most for your own note you know we both saw that he couldnt have written the paper in question we both were poets and prophets by that sign but i hope he understands that i shall gratefully remember what his intention was as to his friend who told him that i had imitated tennyson why i can only say and feel that it is very particularly provoking to hear such things said and that i wish people would find fault with my metre in the place of them in the matter of geraldine i shall not be puffed up i shall take to mind what you suggest of course if you find it hard to read it must be my fault and then the fact of there being a story to a poem will give a factitious merit in the eyes of many critics which could not be an occasion of vainglory to the consciousness of the most vainglorious of writers you made me smile by your suggestion about the aptitude of critics aforesaid for courting lady geraldines certeshowever it may bethe poem has had more attention than its due oh and i must tell you that i had a letter the other day from mr westwood one of my correspondents unknown referring to blackwood and observing on the mistake about goethe did you not mean fell the verb he said or do i mistake so you see some people in the world did actually understand what i meant i am eager to prove that possibility sometimes  how full of life of mind mr eagless letter is such letters always bring me to think of harriet martineaus pestilent plan of doing to destruction half of the intellectual life of the world by suppressing every mental breath breathed through the post office she was not in a state of clairvoyance when she said such a thing i have not heard from her but you observed what the critic said of william howitts being empowered by her to declare the circumstances of her recovery  again and again have i sent for dr arnolds life and i do hope to have it today i am certain by the extracts besides your opinion that i shall be delighted with it  why shouldnt miss martineaus apocalyptic housemaid117 tell us whether flush has a soul and what is its future destination as to the fact of his soul i have long had a strong opinion on it the grand peutêtre to which without revelation the human argument is reduced covers dognature with the sweep of its fringes  did you ever read bulwers eva or the unhappy marriage that is a sort of poetical novel with modern manners inclusive but bulwer although a poet in prose writes all his rhythmetical compositions somewhat prosaically providing an instance of that curious difference which exists between the poetical writer and the poet it is easier to give the instance than the reason but i suppose the cause of the rhythmetical impotence must lie somewhere in the want of the power of concentration for is it not true that the most prolix poet is capable of briefer expression than the least prolix prose writer or am i wrong  your ever affectionate ebb  footnote 117 miss martineau besides having been cured by mesmerism herself was blest with a housemaid who had visions under the same influence concerning which miss martineau subsequently wrote at great length in the athenaeum   to cornelius mathews 50 wimpole street november 14 1844  my dear mr mathewsi write to tell youonly that there is nothing to tellonly in guard of my gratitude lest you should come to think all manner of evil of me and of my supposed propensity to let everything pass like mr hornes copies of the american edition of his work sub silentio therefore i must write and you are to please to understand that i have not up to this moment received either letter or book by the packet of october 10 which was charged according to your intimation with so much i being quite out of patience and out of breath with expectation have repeatedly sent to mr putnam and he replies with undisturbed politeness that the ship has come in and that his part and lot in her together with mine remain at the disposal of the customhouse officers and may remain some time longer so you see how it is i am waitingsimply waiting and it is better to let you know that i am not forgetting instead  in the meantime your kindness will be glad to learn of the prosperity of my poems in my own country i am more than satisfied in my most sanguine hope for them and a little surprised besides the critics have been good to me blackwood and tait have this month both been generous and the new monthly and ainsworths magazine did what they could then i have the examiner in my favor and such heads and hearts as are better and purer than the purely critical and i am very glad altogether and very grateful and hope to live long enough to acknowledge if not to justify much unexpected kindness of course some hard criticism is mixed with the liberal sympathy as you will see in blackwood but some of it i deserve even in my own eyes and all of it i am willing to be patient under the strange thing is that without a single personal friend among these critics they should have expended on me so much gentillesse and this strangeness i feel very sensitively mr horne has not returned to england yet and in a letter which i received from him some fortnight ago he desired to have my book sent to him to germany just as if he never meant to return to england again i answered his sayings and reiterated in a way that would make you smile my information about your having sent the american copies to him i made my oyez very plain and articulate he wont say again that he never heard of itbe sure of that well and then mr browning is not in england either so that whatever you send for him must await his return from the east or the west or the south wherever he is the new spirit of the age is a wandering spirit mr dickens is in italy even miss mitford talks of going to france which is an extreme case for her do you never feel inclined to flash across the atlantic to us or can you really remain still in one place  i must not forget to assure you dear mr mathews as i may conscientiously do even before i have looked into or received the democratic review that whatever fault you may find with me my strongest feeling on reading your article will or must be the sense of your kindness of course i do not expect nor should i wish that your personal interest in me proved in so many ways would destroy your critical faculty in regard to me such an expectation if i had entertained it would have been scarcely honorable to either of us and i may assure you that i never did entertain it no be at rest about the article it is not likely that i shall think it inadequate and i may as well mention in connection with it that before you spoke of reviewing me i in my despair of mr hornes absence and my impotency to assist your book had thrown into my desk to watch for some opportunity of publication a review of your poems on man from my own hand and that i am still waiting and considering and taking courage before i send it to some current periodical there is a difficultythere is a feeling of shyness on my part because as i told you i have no personal friend or introduction among the pressmen or the critics and because the athenaeum which i should otherwise turn to first has already treated of your work and would not of course consent to reconsider an expressed opinion well i shall do it somewhere forgive me the appearance of my impotency under a general aspect  ah you cannot guess at the estate of poetry in the eyes of even such poetical english publishers as mr moxon who can write sonnets himself poetry is in their eyes just a desperate speculation a poet must have tried his public before he tries the publisherthat is before he expects the publisher to run a risk for him but i will make any effort you like to suggest for any work of yours i only tell you how things are by the way if i ever told you that tennyson was ill i may as rightly tell you now that he is well again or was when i last heard of him i do not know him personally also harriet martineau can walk five miles a day with ease and believes in mesmerism with all her strength mr putnam had the goodness to write and open his reading room to me who am in prison instead in mine  may god bless you do let me hear from you soon and believe me ever your friend  eb barrett   to mrs martin november 16 1844  my dearest mrs martin  today i perceive in the contents of the new westminster review that my poems are reviewed in it and i hope that you will both be interested enough in my fortunes to read at the library what may be said of them did george tell you that he imagined as i also did the blackwood paper to be by mr phillimore the barrister well mr phillimore denies it altogether has in fact quarrelled with christopher north and writes no more for him so that i am quite at a loss now where to carry my gratitude  do write to me soon i hear that everybody should read dr arnolds life do you know also eothen a work of genius you have read perhaps hewitts visits to remarkable places in the first series and second and mrs jamesons visits and sketches and life in mexico do you know the santa fé expedition and custines russia and forest life by mrs clavers you will think that my associative process is in a most disorderly state by all this running up and down the stairs of all sorts of subjects in the naming of books i would write a list more as a list should be written if i could see my way better and this will do for a beginning in any case you do not like romances i believe as i do and then nearly every romance nowadays sets about pulling the joints of ones heart and soul out as a process of course ellen middleton which i have not read yet is said to be very painful do you know leigh hunts exquisite essays called the indicator and companion c published by moxon i hold them at once in delight and reverence may god bless you both  i am ever your affectionate ba    to mrs martin 50 wimpole street tuesday november 26 1844 postmark  my dearest mrs martini thank you much for your little notes and you know too well how my sympathy answers you as face to face in a glass for me to assure you of it here your account of yourselves altogether i take to be satisfactory because i never expected anybody to gain strength very rapidly while in the actual endurance of hard medical discipline i am glad you have found out a trustworthy adviser at dover but i feel nevertheless that you may both trust and hope in dr bright of whom i heard the very highest praises the other day  now really i dont know why i should fancy you to be so deeply interested in dr bright that all this detail should be necessary what i do want you to be interested in is in miss martineaus mesmeric experience118 for a copy of which in the last athenaeum i have sent ever since yesterday in the intention of sending it to you you will admit it to be curious as philosophy and beautiful as composition for the rest i will not answer believing in mesmerism as an agency i hesitate to assent to the necessary connection between miss martineaus cure and the power and also i am of opinion that unbelievers will not very generally become converts through her representations there is a tone of exaltation which will be observed upon and one or two sentences are suggestive to scepticism i will send it to you when i get the number i understand that an intimate friend of hers a lady travelled down from the south of england to tynemouth simply to try to prevent the public exposition but could not prevail mr milnes has besides been her visitor he is fully a believer she says and affirms to having seen the same phenomena in the east but regards the whole subject with horror this still appears to be mrs jamesons feeling as you know it is mine mrs jameson came again to this door with a note and overcoming by kindness was let in on saturday last and sate with me for nearly an hour and so ran into what my sisters call one of my sudden intimacies that there was an embrace for a farewell of course she won my affections through my vanity mr martin will be sure to say so i hasten to anticipate him and by exaggerations about my poetry but really and although my heart beat itself almost to pieces for fear of seeing her as she walked upstairs i do think i should have liked her without the flattery she is very lighthas the lightest of eyes the lightest of complexions no eyebrows and what looked to me like very pale red hair and thin lips of no colour at all but with all this indecision of exterior the expression is rather acute than soft and the conversation in its principal characteristics analytical and examinative throwing out no thought which is not as clear as glasscritical in fact in somewhat of an austere sense i use austere of course in its intellectual relation for nothing in the world could be kinder or more graciously kind than her whole manner and words were to me she is coming again in two or three days she says yes and she said of miss martineaus paper in the athenaeum that she very much doubted the wisdom of publishing it now and that for the publics sake if not for her own miss m should have waited till the excitement of recovered health had a little subsided she said of mesmerism altogether that she was inclined to believe it but had not finally made up her convictions she used words so exactly like some i have used myself that i must repeat them that if there was anything in it there was so much it became scarcely possible to limit consequences and the subject grew awful to contemplate   on saturday i had some copies of my american edition which dazzle the english one and one or two reviews transatlantically transcendental in oilie flatterie and i heard yesterday from the english publisher moxon and he was happy to tell me that the work was selling very well and this without an inquiry on my part to say the truth i was afraid to inquire it is good news altogether the westminster review wont be out till next month  wordsworth is so excited about the railroad that his wife persuaded him to go away to recover his serenity but he has returned raging worse than ever he says that fifty members of parliament have promised him their opposition he is wrong i think but i also consider that if the people remembered his genius and his age and suspended the obnoxious act for a few years they would be right  may god bless you both  most affectionately yours ba  footnote 118 the athenaum of november 23 contained the first of a series of articles by miss martineau giving her experiences of mesmerism   to james martin december 10 1844  i have been thinking of you my dear mr martin more and more the colder it has been and had made up my mind to write today let me feel as dull as i might so the vane only turns to you instead of to dearest mrs martin in consequence of your letteryour letter makes that difference i should have written to dover in any case  you are to know that miss martineaus mesmeric experience is only peculiar as being harriet martineaus otherwise it exhibits the mere commonplaces of the agency you laugh i see i wish i could laugh too i mean i seriously wish that i could disbelieve in the reality of the power which is in every way most repulsive to me  mrs martin is surprised at me and others on account of our horror surely it is a natural feeling and she would herself be liable to it if she were more credulous the agency seems to me like the shaking of the floodgates placed by the divine creator between the unprepared soul and the unseen world thenthe subjection of the will and vital powers of one individual to those of another to the extent of the apparent solution of the very identity is abhorrent from me and then as to the expediency of the matter and to prove how far believers may be carried there is even now a religious sect at cheltenham of persons who call themselves advocates of the third revelation and profess to receive their system of theology entirely from patients in the sleep  in the meantime poor miss martineau as the consequence of her desire to speak the truth as she apprehends it is overwhelmed with atrocious insults from all quarters for my own part i would rather fall into the hands of god than of man and suffer as she did in the body instead of being the mark of these cruel observations but she has singular strength of mind and calmly continues her testimony  miss mitford writes to me be sure it is all true i see it every day in my janeher maid who is mesmerised for deafness but not i believe with much success curatively as a remedy the success has been far greater in the martineau case than in others with miss mitfords maid the sleep is however produced and the girl professed at the third séance to be able to see behind her  i am glad i have so much interesting matter to look forward to in the eldon memoirs as pinchers biography i am only in the first volume are english chancellors really made of such stuff i couldnt have thought it pincher will help to reconcile me to the law lords perhaps  and to turn from tory legislators i am vainglorious in announcing to you that the anticornlaw league has taken up my poems on the top of its pikes as antithetic to war and monopoly have i not had a sonnet from gutter lane and has not the journal called the league reviewed me into the third heaven high upabove the pure ether of the five points yes indeed of course i should be a magna chartist for evermore even without the previous predilection  and what do you and mrs martin say about oconnell did you read last saturdays examiner tell her that i welcomed her kind letter heartily and that this is an answer to both of you my best love to her always may god bless you dear mr martin probably i have written your patience to an end if papa or anybody were in the room i should have a remembrance for you  i remain myself  affectionately yours ba   to mrs martin wednesday december 1844  my dearest mrs martinhardly had my letter gone to you yesterday when your kind present and not et arrived i thank you for my boots with more than the warmth of the worsted and feel all their merits to my soul each sole while i thank you a pair of boots or shoes which cant be kicked off is something highly desirable for me in wilsons opinion and this is the first thing which struck her but the great idea à propos des bottes which occurred to myself ought to be unspeakable like miss martineaus great ideasfor i do believe it wasthat i neednt have the trouble every morning now of putting on my stockings  my voice is thawing too with all the rest if the cold had lasted i should have been dumb in a day or two more and as it was i was forced to refuse to see mrs jameson who had the goodness to come again because i couldnt speak much above my breath but i was tolerably well and brave upon the whole oh these murderous english winters the wonder is how anybody can live through them  did i tell you or mr martin that rogers the poet at eightythree or four years of age bore the bank robbery119 with the lighthearted bearing of a man young and bold went out to dinner two or three times the same week and said witty things on his own griefs one of the other partners went to bed instead and was not likely i heard to get over it i felt quite glad and proud for rogers he was in germany last year and this summer in paris but he first went to see wordsworth at the lakes  it is a fine thing when a light burns so clear down into the socket isnt it i who am not a devout admirer of the pleasures of memory do admire this perpetual youth and untired energy it is a fine thing to my mind then there are other noble characteristics about this rogers a common friend said the other day to mr kenyon rogers hates me i know he is always saying bitter speeches in relation to me and yesterday he said so and so but he continued if i were in distress there is one man in the world to whom i would go without doubt and without hesitation at once and as to a brother and that man is rogers not that i would choose to be obliged to a man who hated me but it is an illustration of the fact that if rogers is bitter in his words which we all know he is he is always benevolent and generous in his deeds he makes an epigram on a man and gives him a thousand pounds and the deed is the truer expression of his own nature an uncommon development of character in any case  may god bless you both  your most affectionate ba  i am going to tell you in an antithesis of the popularising of my poems i had a sonnet the other day from gutter lane cheapside and i heard that count dorsay had written one of the stanzas of crowned and buried at the bottom of an engraving of napoleon which hangs in his room now i allow you to laugh at my vaingloriousness and then you may pin it to mrs bests satisfaction in the dedication to dowager majesty by the wayno out of the wayit is whispered that when queen victoria goes to strathfieldsea120 how do you spell it she means to visit miss mitford to which rumour miss mitford being that rare creature a sensible woman says may god forbid  footnote 119 a great robbery from rogers bank on november 23 1844 in which the thieves carried off 40000£ worth of notes besides specie and securities  footnote 120 strathfieldsaye the duke of wellingtons house   to john kenyan wednesday morning about december 1844  i thank you my dear cousin and did so silently the day before yesterday when you were kind enough to bring me the review and write the good news in pencil i should be delighted to see you this is to certify notwithstanding the frost only my voice having suffered and being the ghost of itself you might find it difficult to hear me without inconvenience which is for you to consider and not for me and indeed the fog in addition to the cold makes it inexpedient for anyone to leave the house except upon business and compulsion  oh nowe need not mind any scorn which assails tennyson and us together there is a dishonor that does honorand this is of it i never heard of barnes121  were you aware that the review you brought was in a newspaper called the league and laudatory to the utmost extravagancepraising us too for courage in opposing war and monopolythe corn ships in the offing being duly named i have heard that it is probably written by mr cobden himself who writes for the journal in question and is an enthusiast in poetry if i thought so to the point of conviction do you know i should be very much pleased you remember that i am a sort of magna chartistonly going a little farther  flush was properly ashamed of himself when he came upstairs again for his most ungrateful inexplicable conduct towards you and i lectured him well and upon asking him to promise never to behave ill to you again he kissed my hands and wagged his tail most emphatically it altogether amounted to an oath i think the truth is that flushs nervous system rather than his temper was in fault and that in that great cloak he saw you as in a cloudy mystery and then when you stumbled over the bell rope he thought the world was come to an end he is not accustomed you see to the vicissitudes of life try to forgive him and mefor his ingratitude seems to strike through to me and i am not without remorse  ever most affectionately yours ebb  i inclose mr chorleys note which you left behind you but which i did not see until just now you know that i am not ashamed of progress on the contrary my only hope is in it but the question is not there nor i think for the public except in cases of ripe established reputations as i said before  footnote 121 william barnes the dorsetshire poet the first part of whose poems of rural life in the dorset dialect appeared in 1844   to mr westwood on returning some illustrations of spenser by mr woods december 11 1844   with many thanks cordial and true i thank you for the pleasure i have enjoyed in connection with these proofs of genius to be honest it is my own personal opinion i give it to you for as much as it is worthnot much that many of the subjects of these drawings are unfit for graphic representation what we can bear to see in the poets vision and sustained on the wings of his divine music we shrink from a little when brought face to face with as drawn out in black and white you will understand what i mean the horror and terror preponderate in the drawings and what is sublime in the poet is apt to be extravagant in the artistand this not from a deficiency of power in the latter but from a treading on ground forbidden except to the poets foot i may be wrong perhapsi do not pretend to be right i only tell you as you ask for them what my impressions are  i need not say that i wish all manner of success to your friend the artist and laurels of the weight of gold while of the freshness of grassalas an impossible vegetablefabulous as the halcyon    to hs boyd monday december 24 1844 postmark  my dearest mr boydi wish i had a note from you todaywhich optative aorist i am not sure of being either grammatical or reasonable perhaps you have expected to hear from me with more reason  i fancied that you would be struck by miss martineaus lucid and able style she is a very admirable womanand the most logical intellect of the age for a woman on this account it is that the men throw stones at her and that many of her own sex throw dirt but if i begin on this subject i shall end by gnashing my teeth a righteous indignation fastens on me i had a note from her the other day written in a noble spirit and saying in reference to the insults lavished on her that she was prepared from the first for publicity and ventured it all for the sake of what she considered the truthshe was sustained she said by the recollection of godiva  do you remember who godiva wasor shall i tell you think of itgodiva of coventry and peeping tom the worst and basest is that in this nineteenth century there are thousands of toms to one  i think however myself and with all my admiration for miss martineau that her statement and her reasonings on it are not free from vagueness and apparent contradictions she writes in a state of enthusiasm and some of her expressions are naturally coloured by her mood of mind and nerve  may this christmas give you ease and pleasantness in various ways my dearest friend my christmas wish for myself is to hear that you are well i cannot bear to think of you suffering are the nights better may god bless you shall you not think it a great thing if the poems go into a second edition within the twelvemonth i am surprised at your not being satisfied consider what poetry is and that four months have not passed since the publication of mine and that where poems have to make their way by force of themselves and not of name nor of fashion the first three months cannot present the period of the quickest sale that must be for afterwards think of me on christmas day as of one who gratefully loves you  elibet   a passing reference in a previous letter above p 217 has told of the beginning of another friendship which was to hold a large place in miss barretts later life and the next letter is the first now extant which was written to this new friend anna jameson mrs jameson had not at this time written the works on sacred art with which her name is now chiefly associated but she was already engaged in her long struggle to earn her livelihood by her pen her first work the diary of an ennuyée 1826 written before her marriage had attracted considerable attention since then she had written her characteristics of women essays on shakespeares female characters visits and sketches and a number of compilations of less importance quite recently she had been engaged to write handbooks to the public and private art galleries of london and had so embarked on the career of art authorship in which her best work was done  the beginning and end of the following letter are lost the subject of it is the long and hostile comment which appeared in the athenaeum for december 28 on miss martineaus letters on mesmerism   to mrs jameson end of december 1844   for the athenaeum i have always held it as a journal firstin the very first rankboth in ability and integrity and knowing mr dilke is the athenaeum i could make no mistake in my estimation of himself i have personal reasons for gratitude to both him and his journal and i have always felt that it was honorable to me to have them also i do not at all think that because a woman is a woman she is on that account to be spared the ordinary risks of the arena in literature and philosophy i think no such thing logical chivalry would be still more radically debasing to us than any other it is not therefore at all as a harriet martineau but as a thinking and feeling martineau now dont laugh that i hold her to have been hardly used in the late controversy and if you dont laugh at that dont be too grave either with the thought of your own share and position in the matter because as must be obvious to everyone yourself included you did everything possible to you to prevent the catastrophe and no man and no friend could have done better my brother george told me of his conversation with you at mr loughs but are you not mistaken in fancying that she blames you that she is cold with you i really think you must be why if she is displeased with you she must be unjust and is she ever unjust i ask you i should imagine not but then with all my insolence of talking of her as my friend i only admire and love her at a distance in her books and in her letters and do not know her face to face and in living womanhood at all she wrote to me once and since we have corresponded and as in her kindness she has called me her friend i leap hastily at an unripe fruit perhaps and echo back the word she is your friend in a completer or at least a more ordinary sense and indeed it is impossible for me to believe without strong evidence that she could cease to be your friend on such grounds as are apparent perhaps she does not write because she cannot contain her wrath against mr dilke which between ourselves she cannot very well and respects your connection and regard for him is not that a peradventure worth considering i am sure that you have no right to be uneasy in any case  and now i do not like to send you this letter without telling you my impression about mesmerism lest i seem reserved and afraid of committing myself as prudent people are i will confess then that my impression is in favour of the reality of mesmerism to some unknown extent i particularly dislike believing it i would rather believe most other things in the world but the evidence of the cloud of witnesses does thunder and lightning so in my ears and eyes that i believe while my blood runs cold i would not be practised uponno not for one of flushies ears and i hate the whole theory it is hideous to my imagination especially what is called phrenological mesmerism after all however truth is to be accepted and testimony when so various and decisive is an ascertainer of truth now do not tell mr dilke lest he excommunicate me  but i will not pity you for the increase of occupation produced by an increase of such comfort as your mothers and sisters presence must give what it will be for you to have a branch to sun yourself on after a long flight against the wind   to mr chorley 50 wimpole street january 3 1845  dear mr chorleyi hope it will not be transgressing very much against the etiquette of journalism or against the individual delicacy which is of more consequence to both of us if i venture to thank you by one word for the pages which relate to me in your excellent article in the new quarterly it is not my habit to thank or to remonstrate with my reviewers and indeed i believe i may tell you that i never wrote to thank anyone before on these grounds i could not thank anyone for praising mei would not thank him for praising me against his conscience and if he praised me to the measure of his conscience only i should have little as far as the praise went to thank him for therefore i do not thank you for the praise in your article but for the kind cordial spirit which pervades both praise and blame for the willingness in praising and for the gentleness in finding fault for the encouragement without unseemly exaggeration and for the criticisms without critical scorn allow me to thank you for these things and for the pleasure i have received by their means i am bold to do it because i hear that you confess the reviewership and am the bolder because i recognised your hand in an act of somewhat similar kindness in the athenaeum at the first appearance of the poems  while i am writing of the new quarterly i take the liberty of making a remark not of course in relation to myselfi know too well my duty to my judgesbut to your view of the vantage ground of the poetesses of england it is a strong impression with me that previous to joanna baillie there was no such thing in england as a poetess and that so far from triumphing over the rest of the world in that particular product we lay until then under the feet of the world we hear of a marie in brittany who sang songs worthy to be mixed with chaucers for true poetic sweetness and in italy a vittoria colonna sang her noble sonnets but in england where is our poetess before joanna bailliepoetess in the true sense lady winchilsea had an eye as wordsworth found out but the duchess of newcastle had more poetry in herthe comparative praise proving the negative positionthan lady winchilsea and when you say of the french that they have only epistolary women and wits while we have our lady mary why what would lady mary be to us but for her letters and her wit not a poetess surely unless we accept for poetry her graceful vers de société  do forgive me if an impulse has carried me too far it has been long a fact to my view of the matter that joanna baillie is the first female poet in all senses in england and i fell with the whole weight of fact and theory against the edge of your article  i recall myself now to my first intention of being simply but not silently grateful to you and entreating you to pardon this letter too quickly to think it necessaryto answer it  i remain very truly yours elizabeth b barrett   to mr chorley 50 wimpole street january 7 1845  dear mr chorleyyou are very good to deign to answer my impertinences and not to be disgusted by my defamations of the grandmothers and to diminish my perversity in your eyes i am ready to admit at once that we are generally too apt to run into premature classificationthe error of all imperfect knowledge and into unreasonable exclusivenessthe vice of it we spoil the shining surface of life by our black lines drawn through and through as if ominously for a game of the fox and goose for my part however imperfect my practice may be i am intimately convincedand more and more since my long seclusionthat to live in a house with windows on every side so as to catch both the morning and evening sunshine is the best and brightest thing we have to doto say nothing about the justest and wisest sympathies are our opportunities of good  moreover i know nothing of your sweet mistress anne122 i never read a verse of hers ignorance goes for much you see in all our malcriticisms and my ignorance goes to this extent i cannot write to you of your angloamerican poetess  also in my sweeping speech about the grandmothers i should have stopped before such instances as the exquisite ballad of auld robin gray which is attributed to a woman and the pathetic ballow my babe which tradition calls lady anne bothwells lament i have certain doubts of my own indeed in relation to both origins and with regard to robin gray in particular but doubts are not worthy stuff enough to be taken into an argument and certainly therefore i should have admitted those two ballads as worthy poems before the joannan aera  for what i ventured to say otherwise would you not consent to join our sympathies and receive the choir ah but you are very cunningly subtle in your distinctions i am afraid i was too simple for you as agreeable writers of verses sometimes leaving the word poet alone because you see what you call the bad dispensation by no means accounts for the want of the faculty of poetry strictly so called england has had many learned women not merely readers but writers of the learned languages in elizabeths time and afterwardswomen of deeper acquirements than are common now in the greater diffusion of letters and yet where were the poetesses the divine breath which seemed to come and go and ere it went filled the land with that crowd of true poets whom we call the old dramatistswhy did it never pass even in the lyrical form over the lips of a woman how strange and can we deny that it was so i look everywhere for grandmothers and see none it is not in the filial spirit i am deficient i do assure youwitness my reverent love of the grandfathers  seriously i do not presume to enter into argument with you and this in relation to a critical paper which i admire in so many ways and am grateful for in some but is not the poet a different man from the cleverest versifier and is it not well for the world to be taught the difference the divineness of poetry is far more to me than either pride of sex or personal pride and though willing to acknowledge the lowest breath of the inspiration i cannot the powder and patch as powder and patch i may but not as poetry and though i in turn may suffer for this myselfthough i too anch io may be turned out of arcadia and told that i am not a poet still i should be content i hope that the divineness of poetry be proved in my humanness rather than lowered to my uses  but you shall not think me exclusive of poor lel for instance i could write with more praiseful appreciation than you can it appears to me that she had the giftthough in certain respects she dishonored the artand her latter lyrics are many of them of great beauty and melody such as having once touched the ear of a reader live on in it i observe in your life of mrs hemans shall i tell you how often i have read those volumes she mrs h never appears in any given letter or recorded opinion to esteem her contemporary the antagonism lay probably in the higher parts of mrs hemanss character and mind and we are not to wonder at it  it is very pleasant to me to have your approbation of the sonnets on george sand on the points of feeling and lightness on which all my readers have not absolved me equally i have reason to know i am more a latitudinarian in literature than it is generally thought expedient for women to be and i have that admiration for genius which dear mr kenyon calls my immoral sympathy with power and if madame dudevant123 is not the first female genius of any country or age i really do not know who is and then she has certain noblenessesgranting all the evil and perilous stuffnoblenesses and royalnesses which make me loyal do pardon me for intruding all this on you though you cannot justify meyou who are occupied beyond measure and i who know it i have been under the delusion too during this writing of having something like a friends claim to write and be troublesome i have lived so near your friends that i keep the odour of them a mere delusion alas my only personal right in respect to you being one that i am not likely to forget or waivethe right of being grateful to you  but so and looking again at the last words of your letter i see that you wish in the kindest of words to do something more for me i hope some day to take this something more of your kindness out in the pleasure of personal intercourse and if in the meantime you should consent to flatter my delusion by letting me hear from you now and then if ever you have a moment to waste and inclination to waste it why i on my side shall always be ready to thank you for the something more of kindness as bound in the duty of gratitude in any case i remain  truly and faithfully yours elizabeth b barrett  footnote 122 probably miss anne seward a minor poetess who enjoyed considerable popularity at the end of the eighteenth century her elegies on captain cook and major andré went through several editions as did her louisa a poetical novel a class of composition in which she was the predecessor of mrs browning herself her collected poetical works were edited after her death by sir walter scott 1810  footnote 123 the real name of george sand   to mr chorley the beginning of this letter is lost 1845   to the awful consideration of the possibility of my reading a novel or caring for the story of it proh pudor that i am probably not to say certainly the most complete and unscrupulous romance reader within your knowledge never was a child who cared more for a story than i do never even did i myself as a child care more for it than i do my love of fiction began with my breath and will end with it and goes on increasing and the heights and depths of the consumption which it has induced you may guess at perhaps but it is a sublime idea from its vastness and will gain on you but slowly on my tombstone may be written cigît the greatest novel reader in the world and nobody will forbid the inscription and i approve of grays notion of paradise more than of his lyrics when he suggests the reading of romances ever new greek eis tous aiônas are you shocked at me perhaps so and you see i make no excuses as an invalid might invalid or not i should have a romance in a drawer if not behind a pillow and i might as well be true and say so there is the love of literature which is one thing and the love of fiction which is another and then i am not fastidious as mrs hemans was in her high purity and therefore the two loves have a racecourse clear  this is a long preface to coming to speak of the improvisatore124 i had sent for it already to the library and shall dun them for it twice as much for the sake of what you say only i hope i may care for the story i shall try  and for the rococo i have more feeling for it in a sense than i once had for some two years ago i passed through a long dynasty of french memoirs which made me feel quite differently about the littlenesses of greatnesses i measured them all from the heights of the tabouret125 and was a good duchess in the nonnatural meaning for the moment those memoirs are charming of their kind and if life were cut in filagree paper would be profitable reading to the soul do you not think so and you mean besides probably that you care for beauty in detail which we all should do if our senses were better educated  so the confession is not a dreadful one after all and mine may involve more evil and would to ninetynine out of a hundred sensible and cultivated people think what mrs ellis would say to the women of england about me in her fifteenth edition if she knew  and do you know that dear miss mitford spent this day week with me notwithstanding the rain  very truly yours elizabeth b barrett  i have forgotten what i particularly wished to sayviz that i never thought of expecting to hear from you i understand that when you write it is pure grace and never to be expected you have too much to do i understand perfectly  the east wind seems to be blowing all my letters about today the ts and es wave like willows now if crooked es mean a greenshade not taken rurally what awful significance can have the whole crooked alphabet  footnote 124 by hans andersen an english translation by mary

to mean the rank of a duchess    to mrs martin saturday january 1844 should be 1845126  i must tell you my dearest mrs martin mr kenyon has read to me an extract from a private letter addressed by h martineau to moxon the publisher to the effect that lord morpeth was down on his knees in the middle of the room a few nights ago in the presence of the somnambule j and conversing with her in greek and latin that the four miss liddels were also present and that they five talked to her during one séance in five foreign languages viz latin greek french italian and german when the mesmeriser touches the organ of imitation on js head while the strange tongue is in the course of being addressed to her she translates into english word for word what is said but when the organ of language is touched she simply answers in english what is said  my few words of comment upon this are that i feel to be more and more standing on my headwhich does not mean you will be pleased to observe that i understand  well and how are you both going on my voice is quite returned and papa continues i am sorry to say to have a bad cold and cough he means to stay in the house today and try what prudence will do  we have heard from henry at alexandria still but a few days before sailing and he and stormie are bringing home as a companion to flushie a beautiful little gazelle what do you think of it i would rather have it than the babby though the flourish of trumpets on the part of the possessors seems quite in favor of the latter  and i had a letter from browning the poet last night which threw me into ecstasiesbrowning the author of paracelsus and king of the mystics  the rest of this letter is missing  footnote 126 the mention of her brothers being at alexandria is sufficient to show that 1845 must be the true date    to mrs martin saturday january 1845  my dearest mrs martini believe our last letters crossed and we might draw lots for the turn of receiving one so that you are to take it for supererogatory virtue in me altogether if i begin to write to you as at these presents but i want to know how you both are and if your last account may continue to be considered the true one you have been poising yourself on the equal balance of letters as weak consciences are apt to do but i write that you may write and also a little that i may thank you for the kindness of your last letter which was so very kind  no indeed dearest mrs martin if i do not say oftener that i have a strong and grateful trust in your affection for me and therefore in your interest in all that concerns me it is not that it is less strong and grateful what i said or sang of miss martineaus letter was no consequence of a distrust of you but of a feeling within myself that for me to show about such a letter was scarcely becoming and in the matter of modesty nowise discreet i suppose i was writing excuses to myself for showing it to you i cannot otherwise account for the saying and singing and for the rest nobody can say or sing that i am not frank enough to youto the extent of telling all manner of nonsense about myself which can only be supposed to be interesting on the ground of your being presupposed to care a little for the person concerned now am i not frank enough and by the way i send you the seraphim127 at last by this days railroad  thursday  to prove to you that i had not forgotten you before your letter came here is the fragment of an unfinished one which i send you to begin withan imperfect fossil letter which no comparative anatomy will bring much sense out ofexcept the plain fact that you were not forgotten  from alexandria we heard yesterday that they sailed from thence on the first of january and the home passage may be long  the changes in mary minto on account of mesmerism were merely imaginary as far as i can understand nobody here observed any change in her oh no these things will be fancied sometimes that she is an enthusiastic girl and that the subject took strong hold upon her is true enough and not the least in the worldaccording to my mindto be wondered at by the way i had a letter and the present of a work on mesmerismmr newnhamsfrom his daughter who sent it to me the other day in the kindest way out of gratitude for my poetry as she says and from a desire that it might do me physical good in the matter of health i do not at all know her i wrote to thank her of course for the kindness and sympathy which as she expressed them quite touched me and to explain how i did not stand in reach just now of the temptations of mesmerism i might have said that i shrank nearly as much from these temptations as from lord bacons stew of infant children for the purposes of witchcraft  well then i am getting deeper and deeper into correspondence with robert browning poet and mystic and we are growing to be the truest of friends if i live a little longer shut up in this room i shall certainly know everybody in the world mrs jameson came again yesterday and was very agreeable but tried vainly to convince me that the vestiges of creation which i take to be one of the most melancholy books in the world is the most comforting and that lady byron was an angel of a wife i persisted in relation to the former clause in a determinate counsel not to be a fully developed monkey if i could help it but when mrs j assured me that she knew all the circumstances of the separation though she could not betray a confidence and entreated me to keep my mind open on a subject which would one day be set in the light i stroked down my feathers as well as i could and listened to reason you knowor perhaps you do not knowthat there are two women whom i have hated all my life longlady byron and marie louise to prove how false the public effigy of the former is however mrs jameson told me that she knew nothing of mathematics nothing of science and that the element preponderating in her mind is the poetical elementthat she cares much for my poetry how deep in the knowledge of the depths of vanity must mrs j be to tell me thatnow mustnt she but there wasyes and isa strong adverse feeling to work upon and it is not worked away  then i have seen a copy of a note of lord morpeth to h martineau to the effect that he considered the mesmeric phenomena witnessed by him inclusive remember of the languages to be equally beautiful wonderful and undeniable but he is prudent enough to desire that no use should be made of this letter  and now no more for today  with love to mr martin ever believe me your affectionate ba  footnote 127 a copy of the 1838 volume for which mrs martin had asked   to john kenyan saturday february 8 1845  i return to you dearest mr kenyon the two numbers of jerold douglass128 magazine and i wish by that same sign i could invoke your presence and advice on a letter i received this morning you never would guess what it is and you will wonder when i tell you that it offers a request from the leeds ladies committee authorised and backed by the london general council of the league to your cousin ba that she would write them a poem for the corn law bazaar to be holden at covent garden next may now my heart is with the cause and my vanity besides perhaps for i do not deny that i am pleased with the request so made and if left to myself i should be likely at once to say yes and write an agriculturalevil poem to complete the factoryevil poem into a nationalevil circle and i do not myself see how it would be implicating my name with a political party to the extent of wearing a badge the league is not a party but the meeting of the waters of several parties and i am trying to persuade papas whiggery that i may make a poem which will be a fair exponent of the actual grievance leaving the remedy free for the hands of fixedduty men like him or freetrade women like myself as to wearing the badge of a party either in politics or religion i may say that never in my life was i so far from coveting such a thing and then poetry breathes in another outer air and then there is not an existent set of anykindofpolitics i could agree with if i triedi who am a sort of fossil republican you shall see the letters when you come remember what the league newspaper said of the cry of the children  ever affectionately yours ebb  footnote 128 evidently a slip of the pen for douglas jerrold whose shilling magazine began to come out in 1845   to miss commeline 50 wimpole street februarymarch 1845  my dear miss commelinei do hope that you will allow me to appear to remember you as i never have ceased to do in reality and at a time when sympathy of friends is generally acceptable to offer you mine as if i had some right of friendship to do so and i am encouraged the more to attempt this because i never shall forget that in the hour of the bitterest agony of my life your brother wrote me a letter which although i did not read it i was too ill and distracted i was yet shown the outside of some months afterwards and enabled to appreciate the sympathy fully such a kindness could not fail to keep alive in me if the need of keeping alive were the memory of the various kindnesses received by me and mine from all your family nor fail to excite me to desire to impress upon you my remembrance of you and my regard and the interest with which i hear of your joys and sorrows whenever they are large enough to be seen from such a distance try to believe this of me dear miss commeline yourself and let your sisters and your brother believe it also if sorrow in its reaction makes us think of our friends let my name come among the list of yours to you and with it let the thought come that i am not the coldest and least sincere may god bless and comfort you i say with a full heart knowing what afflictions like yours are and must be but confident besides that we know not what we do in weeping for the dearest in our sorrow we see the rough side of the stuff in our joys the smooth and who shall say that when the taffeta is turned the most silk may not be in the sorrows it is true however that sorrows are heavy and that sometimes the conditions of life which sorrows are seem hard to us and overcoming and i believe that much suffering is necessary before we come to learn that the world is a good place to live in and a good place to die in for even the most affectionate and sensitive  how glad i should be to hear from you some day when it is not burdensome for you to write at length and fully concerning all of youof your sister maria and of laura and of your brother and of all your occupations and plans and whether it enters into your dreams not to say plans ever to come to london or to follow the track of your many neighbours across the seas perhaps  for ourselves we have the happiness of seeing our dear papa so well that i am almost justified in fancying happily that you would not think him altered he has perpetual youth like the gods and i may make affidavit to your brother nevertheless that we never boiled him up to it also his spirits are good and his step on the stair so light as to comfort me for not being able to run up and down them myself i am essentially better in health but remain weak and shattered and at the mercy of a breath of air through a crevice and thus the unusually severe winter has left me somewhat lower than usual without surprising anybody henrietta and arabel are quite well and at home george on circuit always obliged by your proffered hospitality and charles john and henry returning from a voyage to alexandria in papas own vessel the statira i set you an imperfect example of egotism and hope that you will double my is and wes and kindly trust to me for being interested in yours  yours affectionately eb barrett   to hs boyd saturday march 3 1845  my dearest friendi am aware that i should have written to you before but the cold weather is apt to disable me and to make me feel idle when it does not do so quite now i am going to write about your remarks on the dublin review  certainly i agree with you that there can be no necessity for explaining anything about the tutorship if you do not kick against the pricks of the insinuation yourself and especially as i consider that you were in a sense my tutor inasmuch as i may say both that nobody ever taught me so much greek as you and also that without you i should have probably lived and died without any knowledge of the greek fathers the greek classics i should have studied by love and instinct but the fathers would probably have remained in their sepulchres as far as my reading them was concerned therefore very gratefully do i turn to you as my tutor in the best sense and the more persons call you so the better it is for the pleasures of my gratitude the review amused me by hitting on the right meaning there and besides by its percipiency about your remembering me during your travels in the east and sending me home the cyprus wine some of these reviewers have a wonderful gift at inferences the metropolitan magazine for march which is to be sent to you when papa has read it contains a flaming article in my favour calling me the friend of wordsworth and moreover a very little lower than the angels you shall see it soon and it is only just out of course being the march number the praise is beyond thanking for and then i do not know whom to thanki cannot at all guess at the writer  i have had a kind note from lord teynham whose oblivion i had ceased to doubt it seemed so proved to me that he had forgotten me but he writes kindly and it gave me pleasure to have some sign of recollection if not of regard from one whom i consider with unalterable and grateful respect and shall always although i am aware that he denies all sympathy to my works and ways in literature and the world in fact and to set my poetry aside he has joined that strait sect of the plymouth brethren and of course has straitened his views since we met and i by the reaction of solitude and suffering have broken many bands which held me at that time he was always straiter than i and now the difference is immense for i think the world wider than i once thought it and i see gods love broader than i once saw it to the touch not taste not handle not of the strict religionists i feel inclined to cry touch taste handle all things are pure but i am writing this for you and not for him and you probably will agree with me if you think as you used to think at least  but i do not agree with you on the league question nor on the woman question connected with it only we will not quarrel today and i have written enough already without an argument at the end  can you guess what i have been doing lately washing out my conscience effacing the blot on my escutcheon performing an expiation translating over again from the greek the prometheus of aeschylus  yes my very dear friend i could not bear to let that frigid rigid exercise called a version and called mine cold as caucasus and flat as the neighbouring plain stand as my work a palinodia a recantation was necessary to me and i have achieved it do you blame me or not perhaps i may print it in a magazine but this is not decided how delighted i am to think of your being well it makes me very happy  your ever affectionate and grateful elibet   to mr westwood march 4 1845  i reproach myself dear mr w for my silence and began to do so before your kind note reminded me of its unkindness i had indeed my pen in my hand three days ago to write to you but a cross fate plucked at my sleeve for the ninetyninth time and left me guilty and you do not write to reproach me you only avenge yourself softly by keeping back all news of your health and by not saying a word of the effect on you of the winter which has done its spiriting so ungently which brings me down to myself for somebody has been dreaming of me and dreams you know must go by contraries and how could it be otherwise although i am on the whole essentially betteron the wholeyet the peculiar severity of the winter has acted on me and the truth is that for the last month precisely the last month i have been feeling off and on as people say very uncomfortable not that i am essentially worse but essentially better on the contrary only that the feeling of discomfort and trouble at the heart physically will come with the fall of the thermometer and the voice will go  and then i have another question to enunciatewill the oracle answer  do you know who wrote the article in the metropolitan beseech you answer me i have a suspicion true that the critics have been supernaturally kind to me but the kindness of this metropolitan critic so passes the ordinary limit of kindness metropolitan or critical that i cannot but look among my personal friends for the writer of the article coming to personal friends i reject one on one ground and one on anotherfor one the graciousness is too graceful and for another the grace almost too gracious i am puzzled and dizzy with doubt andis it you answer me will you if so i should owe so much gratitude to you suffer me to pay itpermit the pleasure to me of paying itfor i know too much of the pleasures of gratitude to be willing to lose one of them   to john kenyan march 6 1845  thank you dearest mr kenyonthey are very fine the poetry is in them rather than in blair and now i send them back and cunningham and jerrold with thanks on thanks and if you will be kind enough not to insist on my reading the letters to travis129 within the hour they shall wait for the responsibility and the two go to you together  and as to the tiring it has not been much and the happy day was well worth being tired for it is better to be tired with pleasure than with frost and if i have the last fatigue too why it is march and it is the hour of my martyrdom always but i am not illonly uncomfortable  ah the relenting it is rather a bad sign i am afraid notwithstanding the subtilty of your consolations but i stroke down my philosophy to make it shine like a cats back in the dark the argument from more deserving poets who prosper less is not very comforting is it i trow not  but as to the review be surebe very sure that it is not mr brownings how you could think even of mr browning surprises me now as for me i know as well as he does himself that he has had nothing to do with it  i should rather suspect mr westwood the author of some fugitive poems who writes to me sometimes and the suspicion having occurred to me i have written to put the question directly you shall hear if i hear in reply  may god bless you always i have heard from dear miss mitford  ever affectionately yours ebb  footnote 129 by porson on the authenticity of i john v 7   to hs boyd march 29 1845 postmark  my dearest mr boydas arabel has written out for you the glorification of peter of york130 i shall use an edge of the same paper to fall on your sense with my gratitude about the cyprus wine indeed i could almost upbraid you for sending me another bottle it is most supererogatory kindness in you to think of such a thing and i accept it nevertheless with thanks instead of remonstrances and promise you to drink your health in and the spring in together and the east wind out if you do not object to it i have been better for several days but my heart is not yet very orderlynot being able to recover the veins i suppose all in a moment  for the rest you always mean what is right and affectionate and i am not apt to mistake your meanings in this respect be indulgent to me as far as you can when it appears to you that i sink far below your religious standard as i am sure i must do oftener than you remind me also it certainly does appear to my mind that we are not as christians called to the exclusive expression of christian doctrine either in poetry or prose all truth and all beauty and all music belong to godhe is in all things and in speaking of all we speak of him in poetry which includes all things the diapason closeth full in god i would not lose a note of the lyre and whatever he has included in his creation i take to be holy subject enough for me that i am blamed for this view by many i know but i cannot see it otherwise and when you pay your visit to peter of york and me and are able to talk everything over we shall agree tolerably well i do not doubt  ah what a dream what a thought too good even to come true  i did not think that you would much like the duchess may but among the profanum vulgus you cannot think how successful it has been there was an account in one of the fugitive reviews of a lady falling into hysterics on the perusal of it although that was nothing to the gush of tears of which there is a tradition down the plutonian cheeks of a lawyer unknown over bertha in the lane but these things should not make anybody vain it is the story that has power with people just what you do not care for  about the reviews you ask a difficult question but i suppose the best as reviews are the dublin review blackwood the new quarterly and the last american i forget the title at this moment the whig american not the democratic the most favorable to me are certainly the american unremembered and the late metropolitan which last was written i hear by mr charles grant a voluminous writer but no poet i consider myself singularly happy in my reviews and to have full reason for gratitude to the profession  i forgot to say that what the dublin reviewer did me the honor of considering an irishism was the expression do you mind in cyprus wine but he was wrong because it occurs frequently among our elder english writers and is as british as london porter  now see how you throw me into figurative liquids by your last cyprus it is the true celestial this last but arabel pleased me most by bringing back so good an account of you  your ever affectionate and grateful elibet  footnote 130 a monster bell for york minster then being exhibited at the baker street bazaar mr boyd was an enthusiast on bells and bell ringing   to john kenyan friday about januarymarch 1845  dearest mr kenyonif your good nature is still not at ease through doubting about how to make lizzy happy in a book you will like to hear perhaps that i have thought of a certain family robinson crusoe translated from the german i think not a robinson purified mind but a robinson multiplied and compounded131 children like reading it i believe and then there is a masterman ready or some name like it by captain marryat also popular with young readers or seawards narrative by miss porter would delight her as it did me not so many years ago  i mention these books but know nothing of their price and only because you asked me i do mention them the fact is that she is not hard to please as to literature and will be delighted with anything  today mr poe sent me a volume containing his poems and tales collected so now i must write and thank him for his dedication what is to be said i wonder when a man calls you the noblest of your sex sir you are the most discerning of yours were you thanked for the garden ticket yesterday no everybody was ungrateful down to flush who drinks day by day out of his new purple cup and had it properly explained how you gave it to him i explained that and yet never came upstairs to express to you his sense of obligation  affectionately yours always ebb  footnote 131 no doubt the swiss family robinson   to john kenyan saturday beginning of april 1845  my dearest cousinafter all i said to you said the other day about apuleius and about what couldnt shouldnt and mustnt be done in the matter i ended by trying the unlawful art of translating this prose into verse and one after another have done all the subjects of the poniatowsky gems miss thompson sent the list of except two which i am doing and shall finish anon132 in the meantime it comes into my head that it is just as well for you to look over my doings and judge whether anything in them is to the purpose or at all likely to be acceptable especially i am anxious to impress on you that if i could think for a moment you would hesitate about rejecting the whole in a body from any consideration for me i should not merely be vexed but pained am i not your own cousin to be ordered about as you please and so take notice that i will not bear the remotest approach to ceremony in the matter what is wrong what is right what is too much those are the only considerations  apuleius is florid which favored the poetical design on his sentences indeed he is more florid than i have always liked to make my verses it is not of course an absolute translation but as a running commentary on the text it is sufficiently faithful  but probably i say to myself you do not want so many illustrations and all too from one hand  the two i do not send are psyche contemplating cupid asleep and psyche and the eagle  and i wait to hear how polyphemus is to lookand also adonis  the magazine goes to you with many thanks the sonnet is full of force and expression and i like it as well as ever i didbetter even  ohsuch happy news today the statira is at plymouth and my brothers quite well notwithstanding their hundred days on the sea it makes me happy  yours most affectionately ba  you shall have your radical almost immediately i am ashamed in such haste  footnote 132 these versions were not published in mrs brownings lifetime but were included in the posthumous last poems 1862 they now appear in the poetical works v 7283   to hs boyd april 3 1845  my very dear friendi have been intending every day to write to tell you that the cyprus wine is as nectareous as possible so fit for the gods in fact that i have been forced to leave it off as unfit for me it made me so feverish but i keep it until the sun shall have made me a little less mortal and in the meantime recognise thankfully both its high qualities and your kind ones how delightful it is to have this sense of a summer at hand shall i see you this summer i wonder that is a question among my dreams  by the last american packet i had two letters one from a poet of massachusetts and another from a poetess the he mr lowell and the she mrs sigourney she says that the sound of my poetry is stirring the deep green forests of the new world which sounds pleasantly does it not and i understand from mr moxon that a new edition will be called for before very long only not immediately  your affectionate and grateful friend elibet  arabel and mr hunter talk of paying you a visit some day   to mrs martin april 3 1845  my dearest mrs martini wrote to you not many days ago but i must tell you that our voyagers are safe in sandgate break in an ugly hulk as poor stormie says despondingly suffering three or four days of quarantine agony and that we expect to see them on monday or tuesday in the full bloom of their ill humour i am happy to think according to the present symptoms that the mania for sea voyages is considerably abated nothing could be more miserable exclaims storm the only comfort of the whole four months is the safety of the beans tell papaand the safety of the beans is rather a pythagoraean133 equivalent for four months vexation though not a bean of them all should have lost in freshness and value he could scarcely write he said for the chilblains on his hands and was in utter destitution of shirts and sheets oh i have very good hopes that for the future wimpole street may be found endurable  well and you are at once angry and satisfied i suppose about maynooth just as i am satisfied with the justice as far as it goes and angry and disgusted at the hideous shrieks of intolerance and bigotry which run through the country the dissenters have very nearly disgusted me what with the education clamour and the presbyterian chapel cry and now this maynooth cry and certainly it is wonderful how people can see rights as rights in their own hands and as wrongs in the hands of their opposite neighbours moreover it seems to me atrocious that we who insist on seven millions of catholics supporting a church they call heretical should dare to talk of our scruples conscientious scruples forsooth about assisting with a poor pittance of very insufficient charity their damnable idolatry why every cry of complaint we utter is an argument against the wrong we have been committing for years and years and must be so interpreted by every honest and disinterested thinker in the world of course i should prefer the irish establishment coming down to any endowment at all i should prefer a trial of the voluntary system throughout ireland but as it is adjudged on all hands impossible to attempt this in the actual state of parties and countries why this maynooth grant and subsequent endowment of the catholic church in ireland seem the simple alternative obviously and on the first principles of justice macaulay was very great was he not he appeared to me conclusive in logic and sentiment the sensation everywhere is extraordinary i am sorry really to say  wordsworth is in london having been commanded up to the queens ball he went in rogerss court dress or did i tell you so the other day and i hear that the fair majesty of england was quite fluttered at seeing him she had not a word to say said mrs jameson who came to see me the other day and complained of the omission as unqueenly but i disagreed with her and thought the being fluttered far the highest compliment but she told me that a short time ago the queen confessed she never had read wordsworth on which a maid of honour observed that is a pity he would do your majesty a great deal of good mrs jameson declared that miss murray a maid of honour very deeply attached to the queen assured her mrs j of the answer being quite as abrupt as that as direct and to the purpose and no offence intended or received i like mrs jameson better the more i see her and with grateful reason she is so kind now do write directly and let me hear of you in detail and tell mr martin to make a point of coming home to us with no grievances but political ones the bazaar is to be something sublime in its degree and i shall have a sackcloth feeling all next week all the rail carriages will be wound up to radiate into it i hear and the whole country is to be shot into the heart of london  may god bless you  your ever affectionate ba  i hear that guizot suffers intensely and that there are fears lest he may sink not that the complaint is mortal  footnote 133 referring to the pythagorean doctrine of the sanctity of beans   to mr westwood wimpole street april 9 1845  poor hood ah i had feared that the scene was closing on him and i am glad that a little of the poor gratitude of the world is laid down at his door just now to muffle to his dying ear the harsher sounds of life i forgive much to sir robert for the sake of that letterthough after all the minister is not highhearted or made of heroic stuff134  i am delighted that you should appreciate mr brownings high powervery high according to my viewvery high and various yes paracelsus you should have sordello has many fine things in it but having been thrown down by many hands as unintelligible and retained in mine as certainly of the sphinxine literature with all its power i hesitate to be imperious to you in my recommendations of it still the book is worth being studiedstudy is necessary to it as indeed though in a less degree to all the works of this poet study is peculiarly necessary to it he is a true poet and a poet i believe of a large future inrus about to be he is only growing to the height he will attain   to mr westwood april 1845  the sin of sphinxine literature i admit have i not struggled hard to renounce it do i not day by day do you know that i have been told that i have written things harder to interpret than browning himselfonly i cannot cannot believe ithe is so very hard tell me honestly and although i attributed the excessive good nature of the metropolitan criticism to you i know that you can speak the truth truly if anything like the sphinxineness of browning you discover in me take me as far back as the seraphim volume and answer as for browning the fault is certainly great and the disadvantage scarcely calculable it is so great he cuts his language into bits and one has to join them together as young children do their dissected maps in order to make any meaning at all and to study hard before one can do it not that i grudge the study or the time the depth and power of the significance when it is apprehended glorifies the puzzle with you and me it is so but with the majority of readers even of readers of poetry it is not and cannot be so  the consequence is that he is not read except in a peculiar circle very strait and narrow he will not die because the principle of life is in him but he will not live the warm summer life which is permitted to many of very inferior faculty because he does not come out into the sun  faithfully your friend eb barrett  footnote 134 hood died on may 3 1845 while on his deathbed he received from sir robert peel the notification that he had conferred on him a pension of 100£ a year with remainder to his wife   the following letter relates to the controversy raging round miss martineau and her mesmerism miss barrett had evidently referred to it in a letter to mr chorley which has not been preserved   to mr chorley 50 wimpole street april 28 1845  dear mr chorleyi felt quite sure that you would take my postscript for a womanish thing and a little doubtful whether you would not take the whole allusion in or out of a postscript for an impertinent thing but the impulse to speak was stronger than the fear of speaking and from the peculiarities of my position i have come to write by impulses just as other people talk by them still if i had known that the subject was so painful to you i certainly would not have touched on it strong as my feeling has been about it and full and undeniable as is my sympathy with our nobleminded friend both as a woman and a thinker not that i consider of course i cannot that she has made out anything like a fact in the tynemouth storynot that i think the evidence offered in any sort sufficient take it as it was in the beginning and unimpugnednot that i have been otherwise than of opinion throughout that she was precipitate and indiscreet however generously so in her mode and time of advocating the mesmeric question but that she is at liberty as a thinking being in my mind to hold an opinion the grounds of which she cannot yet justify to the world do you not think she may be have you not opinions yourself beyond what you can prove to others have we not all and because some of the links of the outer chain of a logical argument fail or seem to fail are we therefore to have our honours questioned because we do not yield what is suspended to an inner uninjured chain of at once subtler and stronger formation for what i venture to object to in the argument of the athenaeum is the making a moral obligation of an intellectual act which is the first step and gesture is it not in all persecution for opinion and the involving of the honour of an opponent in the motion of recantation she is invited to this i do venture to exclaim against i do cry aloud against this and i do say this that when we call it hard we are speaking of it softly why consider how it is the athenaeum has done quite enough to disprove the proving of the wreck story135 and no more at all the disproving of the proof of the wreck story is indeed enough to disprove the wreck story and to disprove mesmerism itself as far as the proof of mesmerism depends on the proof of the wreck story and no farther with all doubters and undetermined inquirers but with the very large class of previous believers this disproof of a proof is a mere accident and cannot be expected to have much logical consequence believing that such things may be as this revelation of a wreck they naturally are less exacting of the stabilities of the proving process what we think probable we do not call severely for the proof of moreover miss martineau is not only a believer in the mysteries of mesmerism and she wrote to me the other day that in birmingham where she is she has present cognisance of three cases of clairvoyance but she is a believer in the personal integrity of her witnesses she has what she has well called an incommunicable confidence and this however incommunicable is sufficiently comprehensible to all persons who know what personal faith is to place her honour i do maintain high above any suspicion any charge with the breath of mans lips i am sure you agree with me dear mr chorleyah it will be a comfort and joy together dear miss mitford and i often quarrel softly about literary life and its toils and sorrows she against and i in favour of but we never could differ about the worth and comfort of domestic affection  ever sincerely yours elizabeth b barrett  i am delighted to hear of the novel and the comedy  footnote 135 one of the visions of miss martineaus apocalyptic housemaid related to the wreck of a vessel in which the tynemouth people were much interested unfortunately it appeared that news of the wreck had reached the town shortly before her vision and that she had been out of doors immediately before submitting to the mesmeric trance   to mr chorley 50 wimpole street april 28 1845  dear mr chorley for miss martineau is it not true that she has admitted her wreck story to have no proof surely she has surely she said that the evidence was incapable at this point of time of justification to the exoteric and that the question had sunk now to one of character to which her opponent answered that it had always been one of character and you must admit that the direct and unmitigated manner of depreciating the reputation not merely of jane arrowsmith but of mrs wynyard a personal friend of miss martineaus to whom she professes great obligations could not be otherwise than exasperating to a woman of her generous temper and this just in the crisis of her gratitude for her restoration to life and enjoyment by the means as she considers it of this friend not that i feel at all convinced of her having been cured by mesmerism i have told her openly that i doubt it a little and she is not angry with me for saying so also the wreck story and as you suggest the three new cases of clairvoyance why one cannot you know give ones specific convictions to general sweeping testimonies with a mist all round them still i do lean to believing this class of mysteries and i see nothing more incredible in the apocalypse of the wreck and other marvels of clairvoyance than in that singular adaptation of another persons senses which is a common phenomenon of the simple forms of mesmerism if it is credible that a person in a mesmeric sleep can taste the sourness of the vinegar on another persons palate i am ready to go the whole length of the transmigration of senses but after all except from hearing so much i am as ignorant as you are in my own experience one of my sisters was thrown into a sort of swoon and could not open her eyelids though she heard what passed once or twice or thrice and she might have been a prophetess by this time perhaps if partly from her own feeling on the subject and partly from mine she had not determined never to try the experiment again it is hideous and detestable to my imagination as i confessed to you it makes my blood run backwards and if i were you i would not with the nervous weakness you speak of throw myself into the way of it i really would not think of a female friend of mine begging me to give her a lock of my hair or rather begging my sister to get it for her that she might send it to a celebrated prophet of mesmerism in paris to have an oracle concerning me did you ever since the days of the witches hear a more ghastly proposition it shook me so with horror i had scarcely voice to say no hough i did say it very emphatically at last i assure you a lock of my hair for a parisian prophet why if i had yielded i should have felt the steps of pale spirits treading as thick as snow all over my sofa and bed by day and night and pulling a corresponding lock of hair on my head at awful intervals i who was born with a double set of nerves which are always out of order the most excitable person in the world and nearly the most superstitious i should have been scarcely sane at the end of a fortnight i believe of myself do you remember the little spirit in gold shoebuckles who was a familiar of heinrich stillings well i should have had a french one to match the german with balzacs superfine bootpolish in place of the buckles as surely as i lie here a mortal woman  i congratulate you amid all cares and anxieties upon the view of naples in the distance but chiefly on your own happy and just estimate of your selected position in life it does appear to me wonderfully and mournfully wrong when men of letters as it is too much the fashion for them to do take to dishonoring their profession by fruitless bewailings and gnashings of teeth when all the time it must be their own fault if it is not the noblest in the world miss mitford treats me as a blind witness in this case because i have seen nothing of the literary world or any other sort of world and yet cry against her pen and ink cry it is the cry i least like to hear from her lips of all others and it is unworthy of them altogether on the lips of a woman of letters it sounds like jealousy which it cannot be with her as on the lips of a woman of the world like ingratitude madame girardins ecole des journalistes deserved jules janins reproof of it and there is something noble and touching in that feeling of brotherhood among men of letters which he invokes i am so glad to hear you say that i am right glad for your sake and glad for mine in fact there is something which is attractive to me and which has been attractive ever since i was as high as this table even in the old worn type of grub street authors and garret poets men and women of letters are the first in the whole world to me and i would rather be the least among them than dwell in the courts of princes  forgive me for writing so fast and far just as if you had nothing to do but to read me oh for patience for the novel  i am faithfully yours elizabeth b barrett   to miss thomson136 50 wimpole street friday may 16 1845 postmark  i write one line to thank you dear miss thomson for your translation so far too liberal though true to the spirit of my intention of my work for your album how could it not be a pleasure to me to work for you  as to my using those manuscripts otherwise than in your service i do not at all think of it and i wish to say this perhaps i do not also partake quite your divine fury for converting our sex into greek scholarship and i do not i confess think it as desirable as you do where there is a love for poetry and thirst for beauty strong enough to justify labour let these impulses which are noble be obeyed but in the case of the multitude it is different and the mere fashion of scholarship among women would be a disagreeable vain thing and worse than vain you who are a greek yourself know that the greek language is not to be learnt in a flash of lightning and by hamiltonian systems but that it swallows up year after year of studious life now i have a doxy as warburton called it that there is no exercise of the mind so little profitable to the mind as the study of languages it is the nearest thing to a passive recipiencyis it notas a mental action though it leaves one as weary as ennui itself women want to be made to think actively their apprehension is quicker than that of men but their defect lies for the most part in the logical faculty and in the higher mental activities well and then to remember how our own english poets are neglected and scorned our poets of the elizabethan age i would rather that my countrywomen began by loving these  not that i would blaspheme against greek poetry or depreciate the knowledge of the language as an attainment i congratulate you on it though i never should think of trying to convert other women into a desire for it forgive me  to think of mr burgess comparing my nonnus to the right nonnus makes my hair stand on end and the truth is i had flattered myself that nobody would take such trouble i have not much reverence for nonnus and have pulled him and pushed him and made him stand as i chose never fearing that my naughty impertinences would be brought to light for the rest i thank you gratefully and may i respectfully and gratefully thank miss bayley for the kind words of both of you both in this letter and as my sister heard them it is delightful to me to find such grace in the eyes of dearest mr kenyons friends and i remain dear miss thomson   truly yours and gladly ebb  if there should be anything more at any time for me to do i trust to your trustfulness  footnote 136 afterwards mdme emil braun see the letter of january 9 1850 at this time she was engaged in editing an album or anthology to which she had asked miss barrett to contribute some classical translations   to miss thomson 50 wimpole street monday 1845  my dear miss thomsonbelieve of me that it can only give me pleasure when you are affectionate enough to treat me as a friend and for the rest nobody need apologise for taking another into the vineyardsleast miss bayley and yourself to me at the first thought i felt sure that there must be a great deal about vines in these greeks of ours and am surprised i confess in turning from one to another to find how few passages of length are quotable and how the images drop down into a line or two do you know the passage in the seventh odyssey where there is a vineyard in different stages of ripenessof which pope has made the most so i tore up what i began to write and leave you to him it is in alcinous gardens and between the first and second hundred lines of the book the one from the iliad open to miss bayleys objection is yet too beautiful and appropriate i fancy for you to throw over curious it is that my first recollection went from that shield of achilles to hesiods shield of hercules from which i send you a versionleaving out of it what dear miss bayley would object to on a like ground with the other    some gathered grapes with reaphooks in their hands   while others bore off from the gathering hands   whole basketsfull of bunches black and white   from those great ridges heaped up into fight   with vineleaves and their curling tendrils so   they bore the baskets      yes and all were saying   their jests while each went staggering in a row   beneath his grapeload to the pipers playing   the grapes were purpleripe and here in fine   men trod them out and there they drained the wine  in the works and days hesiod says again what is not worth your listening to perhaps    and when that sinus and orion come   to middle heaven and when aurorashe   o the rosy fingerslooks inquiringly   full on arcturus straightway gather home   the general vintage and i charge you see   all in the sun and open air outlaid   ten days and nights and five days in the shade   the sixth day pour in vases the fine juice   the gift of bacchus who gives joys for use  anacreon talks to the point so well that you must forgive him i think for being anacreontic and take from his hands what is not defiled the translation you send me does not smell of anacreon nor please me where did you get it would this be at all fresher    grapes that wear a purple skin   men and maidens carry in   brimming baskets on their shoulders   which they topple one by one   down the winepress men are holders   of the place there and alone   tread the grapes out crush them down   letting loose the soul of wine   praising bacchus as divine   with the loud songs called his own  you are aware of the dresser of the vine in homers hymn to mercury translated so exquisitely by shelley and of a very beautiful single figure in theocritus besides neither probably would suit your purpose in the pax of aristophanes there is an idle chorus who talks of looking at the vines and watching the grapes ripen and eating them at last but there is nothing of vineyard work in it so i dismiss the whole  for hector and andromache would you like me to try to do it for you it would amuse me and you should not be bound to do more with what i send you than to throw it into the fire if it did not meet your wishes precisely the same observation applies remember to this little sheet which i have keptdelayed sendingjust because i wanted to let you have a trial of my strength on andromache in the same envelope but the truth is that it is not begun yet partly through other occupation and partly through the lassitude which the cold wind of the last few days always brings down on me yesterday i made an effort and felt like a broken sticknot even a bent one so wait for a warm day and what a season we have had i have been walking up and down stairs and pretending to be quite well and i will promise to do my best and certainly an inferior hand may get nearer to touch the great greek lions mane than popes did  will you give my love to dear miss bayley she shall hear from meand you shall in a day or two and do not mind mr kenyon he roars as softly as a sucking dove nevertheless he is an intolerant monster as i half told him the other day  believe me dear miss thomson affectionately yours ebb   to mr westwood 50 wimpole street may 22 1845  did you persevere with sordello i hope so be sure that we may all learn as poets much and deeply from it for the writer speaks true oracles when you have read it through then read for relaxation and recompense the last bell and pomegranate by the same poet his colombos birthday which is exquisite only pippa passes i lean to or kneel to with the deepest reverence wordsworth has been in town and is gone tennyson is still here he likes london i hear and hates cheltenham where he resides with his family and he smokes pipe after pipe and does not mean to write any more poems are we to sing a requiem  believe me faithfully yours elizabeth barrett barrett   to hs boyd saturday july 21 1845 postmark  my very dear friendyou are kind to exceeding kindness and i am as grateful as any of your longago kind invitations ever found me it is something pleasant indeed and like a return to life to be asked by you to spend two or three days in your house and i thank you for this pleasantness and for the goodness on your own part which induced it you may be perfectly sure that no claypon though he should live in arcadia would be preferred by me to you as a host and i wonder how you could entertain the imagination of such a thing mr kenyon indeed has asked me repeatedly to spend a few hours on a sofa in his house and the regents park being so much nearer than you are i had promised to think of it but i have not yet found it possible to accomplish even that quarter of a miles preferment and my ambition is forced to be patient when i begin to think of st johns wood i am considerably stronger and increasing in strength and in time with a further advance of the summer i may do such thingswhat they are yet i know not yes i know that they relate to you and that i have a hope as well as an earnest affectionate desire to sit face to face with you once more before this summer closes do in the meantime believe that i am very grateful to you for your kind considerate proposal and that it is not made in vain for my wishes and that i am not likely willingly to spend two or three days with anybody in the world before i do so with yourself  mr hunter has not paid us his usual saturdays visit and therefore i have no means of answering the questions you put in relation to him we will ask him about times and seasons when next we see him and you shall hear  did you ever hear much of robert montgomery commonly called satan montgomery because the author of satan of the omnipresence of the deity and of various poems which pass through edition after edition nobody knows how or why i understand that his pew he is a clergyman is sown over with red rosebuds from ladies of the congregation and that the same fair hands have made and presented to him in the course of a single season one hundred pairs of slippers whereupon somebody said to this reverend satan i never knew before mr montgomery that you were a centipede  dearest mr boyds affectionate and grateful elibet   through the summer of 1845 miss barrett as usual recovered strength but so slightly that her doctor urged that she should not face the winter in england plans were accordingly made for her going abroad to which the following letters refer but the scheme ultimately broke down before the prohibition of mr barretta prohibition for which no valid reason was put forward and which to say the least bore the colour of unaccountable indifference to his daughters health and wishes the matter is of some importance on account of its bearing on the action taken by miss barrett in the autumn of the following year   to mrs martin monday july 29 1845 postmark  my dearest mrs martini am ashamed not to have written before and yet have courage enough to ask you to write to me as soon as you can day by day i have had good intentions enough the fact is about writing to seem to deserve some good deeds from you which is contrary to all wisdom and reason i know but is rather natural after all what my deeds have been you will be apt to ask why all manner of idleness which is the most interrupting you know of all things the hedleys have been flitting backwards and forwards staying some of them for a month at a time in london and then going and then coming again and i have had other visitors few but engrossing after their kind and i have been getting wellwhich is a processgoing out into the carriage two or three times a week abdicating my sofa for my armchair moving from one room to another now and then and walking about mine quite as well as and with considerably more complacency than a child of two years old altogether i do think that if you were kind enough to be glad to see me looking better when you were in london you would be kind enough to be still gladder if you saw me now everybody praises me and i look in the lookingglass with a better conscience also it is an improving improvement and will be until you know the last hem of the garment of summer is lost sight of and thenand theni must either follow to another climate or be ill againthat i know and am prepared for it is but dreary work this undoing of my penelope web in the winter after the doing of it through the summer and the more progress one makes in ones web the more dreary the prospect of the undoing of all these fine silken stitches but we shall see  ever your affectionate ba   to mrs martin tuesday october 1845  my dearest mrs martindo believe that i have not been as i have seemed perhaps forgetful of you through this silence this last proof of your interest and affection for mein your letter to henriettaquite rouses me to speak out my remembrance of you and i have been remembering you all the time that i did not speak only i was so perplexed and tossed up and down by doubts and sadnesses as to require some shock from without to force the speech from me your verses in their grace of kindness and the ivy from wordsworths cottage just made me think to myself that i would write to you before i left england but when you talk really of coming to see me why i must speak you overcome me with the sense of your goodness to me  yet after all i will not have you come the farewells are bad enough which come to us without our going to seek them and i would rather wait and meet you on the continent or in england again than see you now just to part from you and you cannot guess how shaken i am and how i cling to every plank of a little calm perhaps i am going on the 17th or 20th certainly i have made up my mind to do it and shall do it as a bare matter of duty and it is one of the most painful acts of duty which my whole life has set before me the road is as rough as possible as far as i can see it at the same time being absolutely convinced from my own experience and perceptions and the unhesitating advice of two able medical men dr chambers one of them that to escape the english winter will be everything for me and that it involves the comfort and usefulness of the rest of my life i have resolved to do it let the circumstances of the doing be as painful as they may if you were to see me you would be astonished to see the work of the past summer but all these improvements will ebb away with the sunwhile i am assured of permanent good if i leave england the struggle with me has been a very painful one i cannot enter on the how and wherefore at this moment i had expected more help than i have found and am left to myself and thrown so on my own sense of duty as to feel it right for the sake of future years to make an effort to stand by myself as i best can at the same time i will not tell you that at the last hour something may not happen to keep me at home that is neither impossible nor improbable if for instance i find that i cannot have one of my brothers with me why the going in that case would be out of the question under ordinary circumstances i shall go and if the experiment of going fails why then i shall have had the satisfaction of having tried it and of knowing that it is gods will which keeps me a prisoner and makes me a burden as it is i have been told that if i had gone years ago i should be well now that one lung is very slightly affected but the nervous system absolutely shattered as the state of the pulse proves i am in the habit of taking forty drops of laudanum a day and cannot do with less that is the medical man told me that i could not do with less saying so with his hand on the pulse the cold weather they say acts on the lungs and produces the weakness indirectly whereas the necessary shutting up acts on the nerves and prevents them from having a chance of recovering their tone and thus without any mortal disease or any disease of equivalent seriousness i am thrown out of life out of the ordinary sphere of its enjoyment and activity and made a burden to myself and to others whereas there is a means of escape from these evils and god has opened the door of escape as wide as i see it  in all ways for my own happinesss sake i do need a proof that the evil is irremediable and this proof or the counterproof i am about to seek in italy  dr chambers has advised pisa and i go in the direct steamer from the thames to leghorn i have good courage and as far as my own strength goes sufficient means  dearest mrs martin more than i thought at first of telling you i have told you much beside there is painful to talk of but i hope i have determined to do what is right and that the determination has not been formed ungently unscrupulously nor unaffectionately in respect to the feelings of others i would die for some of those but there has been affection opposed to affection  this in confidence of course may god bless both of you pray for me dearest mrs martin make up your mind to go somewhere soonshall you notbefore the winter shuts the last window from which you see the sun  dr chambers said that he would answer for it that the voyage would rather do me good than harm let me suffer sea sickness or not he said he would answer for its doing me no harm  i hope to take arabel with me and either storm or henry this is my hope  gratefully and affectionately i think of all your kindness and interest may dear mr martin lose nothing in this coming winter i shall think of you and not cease to love you moreover you shall hear again from  your ever affectionate ba   to hs boyd october 27 1845 postmark  my very dear friendit is so long since i wrote that i must write i must ruffle your thoughts with a little breath from my side listen to me my dear friend that i have not written has scarcely been my fault but my misfortune rather for i have been quite unstrung and overcome by agitation and anxiety and thought that i should be able to tell you at last of being calmer and happier but it was all in vain i do not leave england my dear friend it is decided that i remain on in my prison it was my full intention to go i considered it to be a clear duty and i made up my mind to perform it let the circumstances be ever so painfully like obstacles but when the moment came it appeared impossible for me to set out alone and also impossible to take my brother and sister with me without involving them in difficulties and displeasure now what i could risk for myself i could not risk for others and the very kindness with which they desired me not to think of them only made me think of them more as was natural and just so italy is given up and i fall back into the hands of god who is merciful trusting him with the time that shall be  arabel would have gone to tell you all this a fortnight since but one of my brothers has been ill with fever which was not exactly typhus but of the typhoid character and we knew that you would rather not see her under the circumstances he is very much better it is octavius and has been out of bed today and yesterday  do not reproach me either for not writing or for not going my very dear friend i have been too heavyhearted for words and as to the deeds you would not have wished me to lead others into difficulties the extent and result of which no one could calculate it would not have been just of me  and you how are you and what are you doing  may god bless you my dear dear friend  ever yours i am affectionately and gratefully ebb   to mr chorley 50 wimpole street november 1845  i must trouble you with another letter of thanks dear mr chorley now that i have to thank you for the value of the work as well as the kindness of the gift for i have read your three volumes of pomfret137 with interest and moral assent and with great pleasure in various ways it is a pure true book without effort which in these days of gesture and rolling of the eyes is an uncommon thing also you make your private judgment work itself out quietly as a simple part of the love of truth instead of being the loud heroic virtue it is so apt in real life to profess itself seldom moving without drums and trumpets and the flying of party colours all these you have put down rightly wisely and boldly and it was in my mind no less wise than bold of you to let in that odour of tyrrwhitism into the folds of the purple and so prevent the very possibility of any prestige if i complained it might be that your private judgment confines its reference to public opinion and shuns too proudly perhaps the higher and deeper relations of human responsibility but there are difficulties i see and you choose your path advisedly of course the best character in the book i take to be rose i cannot hesitate in selecting him he is so lifelike with the worlds conventional life that you hear his footsteps when he walks and indeed i think his boots were apt to creak just the soupçon of a creak just as a gentlemans boots might and he is excellently consistent even down to the choice of a wife whom he could patronise i hope you like your own mr rose and that you will forgive me for jilting grace for helena which i could not help any more than walter could but now may i venture to ask a question would it not have been wise of you if on the point of reserve you had thrown a deeper shade of opposition into the characters or rather manners of these women helena sits like a statue and could grace have done more when she wins walters heart in italy afterwards and by fits at the time indeed the artist fire bursts from her but there was a great deal of smouldering when there should have been a clear heat to justify walters change of feeling and then in respect to that do you really think that your grace was generous heroic with the evidence she had of the change in giving up her engagement for her own sake could she have done otherwise i fancy not the position seems surrounded by its own necessities and no room for a doubt i write on my own doubts you see and you will smile at them or understand all through them that if the book had not interested me like a piece of real life i should not find myself backbiting as if all these were my neighbours the pure tender feeling of the closing scenes touched me to better purpose believe me and i applaud from my heart and conscience your rejection of that low creed of poetical justice which is neither justice nor poetry which is as degrading to virtue as false to experience and which thrown from your book raises it into a pure atmosphere at once   i could go on talking but remind myself i do hope in time that i might show my gratitude better with sincere wishes for the success of the work for just see how practically we come to trust to poetical justices after all our theoriesi i mean and mine and with respect and esteem for the writer  i remain very truly yours elizabeth barrett barrett  footnote 137 a novel by mr chorley a copy of which he had presented to miss barrett   to mrs jameson 50 wimpole street december 1 1845  my dear mrs jamesoni receive your letter as i must do every sign of your being near and inclined to think of me in kindness gladly and assure you at once that whenever you can spend a halfhour on me you will find me enough myself to have a true pleasure in welcoming you say any day except next saturday or the monday immediately following  as soon as i heard of your return to england i ventured to hope that some good might come of it to me in my room here besides the general good which i look for with the rest of the public when the censer swings back into the midst of us again and how good of you dear mrs jameson to think of me there where the perfumes were set burning it makes me glad and grand that you should have been able to do so also the kind wishes which came with the thoughts you say were not in vain for i have been very idle and very well the angel of the summer has done more for me even than usual and till the last wave of his wing i took myself to be quite well and at liberty and even now i am as well as anyone can be who has heard the prison door shut for a whole winter at least and knows it to be the only english alternative of a grave which is a gloomy way of saying that i am well but forced to shut myself up with disagreeable precautions all round and i ought to be gratified instead of gloomy believe me that i shall be so when you come to see me remaining in the meanwhile  most truly yours elizabeth barrett   to mrs martin friday about december 1845  i am the guilty person dearest mrs martin you would have heard from henrietta at least yesterday only i persisted in promising to write instead of her and so if there are reproaches let them fall not that i am audacious and without shame but i have grown familiar with an evil conscience as to these matters of not writing when i ought and long ago i grew familiar with your mercy and power of pardoning and thenand thenif silence and sulkiness are proved crimes of mine to ever such an extreme why it would not be unnatural do you think i was born to live the life of an oyster such as i do live here and so the moaning and gnashing of teeth are best done alone and without taking anyone into confidence and so this is all i have to say for myself which perhaps you will be glad of for you will be ready to agree with me that next to such faults of idleness negligence silence call them by what names you please as i have been guilty of is the repentance of them if indeed the latter be not the most unpardonable of the two  and what are you doing so late in herefordshire is dear mr martin too well and tempting the demons i do hope that the next news of you will be of your being about to approach the sun and visit us on the road you do not give your wisdom away to your friends all of it i hope and trustnot even to reynolds  tell mr martin that a new great daily newspaper professing ultraism at the right end meaning his and mine is making mighty preparation to be called the daily news138 to be edited by dickens and to combine with the most liberal politics such literature as gives character to the french journalsthe objects being both to help the people and to give a status to men of letters socially and politicallygreat objects which will not be attained i fear by any such means in the first place i have misgivings as to dickens he has not i think breadth of mind enough for such work with all his gifts but we shall see an immense capital has been offered and actually advanced be good patriots and order the paper and talking of papers i hope you read in the morning chronicle landors verses to my friend and englands poet mr browning139 they have much beauty  you know that occy has been ill and that he is well i hope you are not so behindhand in our news as not to know for me i am not yet undone by the winter i still sit in my chair and walk about the room but the prison doors are shut close and i could dash myself against them sometimes with a passionate impatience of the needless captivity i feel so intimately and from evidence how with air and warmth together in any fair proportion i should be as well and happy as the rest of the world that it is intolerablewell it is better to sympathise quietly with ladyand other energetic runaways than amuse you with being riotous to no end and it is best to write ones own epitaph still more quietly is it not  and oh how lightly i write and then sigh to think of what different colours my spirits and my paper are do you know what it is to laugh that you may not cry yet i hold a comfort fast your very affectionate  ba  footnote 138 the first number of the daily news appeared on january 2l 1846 under the editorship of charles dickens  footnote 139 the wellknown lines beginning there is delight in singing they appeared in the morning chronicle for november 22 1845     to mrs martin saturday februarymarch 1846  my dearest mrs martinindeed it has been tantalising and provoking to have you close by without being able to gather a better advantage from it than the knowledge that you were suffering so passes the world and the glory of it i have been vexed into a high state of morality i assure you now that you are gone away i hear from you again and it does seem to me that almost always it happens so and that you come to london to be ill and leave it before you can be well again it is a comfort in every case to know of your being better and hastings is warm and quiet and the pretty country all round mind you go and see the rocks par excellence will entice you into very gentle exercise at the same time dont wish me into the house you speak of i can lose nothing here shut up in my prison and the nightingales come to my windows and sing through the sooty panes if i were at hastings i should risk the chance of recovering liberty and the consolations of slavery would not reach me as they do here also if i were to set my heart upon hastings i might break it at leisure there would be exactly as much difficulty in turning my face that way as towards italyah you do not understand and i do at last i am sorry to say and it has been very long tedious and reluctant work the learning of the lesson  did henrietta tell you that i heard at last from miss martineau who thought me in italy she said and therefore was silent she has sent me her new work have you read it and speaks of her strength and of being able to walk fifteen miles a day which seems to me like a fairy tale or the threeleagued boots at least  what am i doing to tell you of nothing the winter is kind and this divine muggy weather is that the technical word and spelling thereof which gives all reasonable people colds in their heads leaves me the hope of getting back to the summer without much injury a friend of mineone of the greatest poets in england toobrought me primroses and polyanthuses the other day as they are grown in surrey140 surely it must be nearer spring than we think  dearest mrs martin write and say how you are and say god bless you both the yous and mention mr martin particularly and what your plans are  ever your affectionate ba  footnote 140    beloved them hast brought me many flowers   plucked in the garden all the summer through   and winter and it seemed as if they grew   in this close room nor missed the sun and showers  sonnets from the portuguese xliv   to mrs martin tuesday end of june 1846  so my dearest mrs martin you are quite angry with all of us and with me chiefly oh you need not say no i see it i understand it and shall therefore take up my own cause precisely as if i were an injured person in the first place dearest mrs martin when you wrote to me at last to say that we were both guilty correspondents you should have spoken in the singular number for i was not guilty at all i beg to say while you were on the continent you were uncertain you said on going where you should go and how long you should stay and you promised to write and give me some sort of addressa promise never keptand where was i to write to you i heard for the first time from the peytons of your being at pau and then you were expected at home so innocent i am and because it is a pleasure rather rare to make a sincere profession of innocence i meant to write to you at least ten days ago and then believe me you will without difficulty the dreadful death of poor mr haydon141 the artist quite upset me and made me disinclined to write a word beyond necessary ones i thank god that i never saw himpoor gifted haydonbut a year and a half ago we had a correspondence which lasted through several months and was very pleasant while it lasted then it was dropped and only a few days before the event he wrote three or four notes to me to ask me to take charge of some papers and pictures which i acceded to as once i had done before he was constantly in pecuniary difficulty and in apprehension of the seizure of goods and nothing of fear suggested itself to my mindnothing the shock was very great oh i do not write to you to write of this only i would have you understand the real case and that it is not an excuse and that it was natural for me to be shaken a good deal no artist is left behind with equal largeness of poetical conception if the hand had always obeyed the soul he would have been a genius of the first order as it is he lived on the slope of greatness and could not be steadfast and calm his life was one long agony of selfassertion poor poor haydon see how the world treats those who try too openly for its gratitude tom thumb for ever over the heads of the giants  so you heard that i was quite well dont believe everything you hear but i am really in a way to be well if i could have such sunshine as we have been burning in lately and a fair field of peace besides generally i am able to go out every day either walking or in the carriagewalking means as far as queen annes street the wonderful winter did not cast me down and the hot summer helps me up higher now to keep in the sun is the problem to solve and if i can do it i shall be as well as anybody if i cant as ill as ever which is the résumé of me without a word more  your ever affectionate ba  footnote 141 he committed suicide on june 22 under the influence of the disappointment caused by the indifference of the public to his pictures the final instance of which was its flocking to see general tom thumb and neglecting haydons large pictures of aristides and nero which were being exhibited in an adjoining room of the egyptian hall   to hs boyd june 27 1846 postmark  dearest mr boydlet me be clear of your reproaches for not going to you this week the truth is that i have been so much shocked and shaken by the dreadful suicide of poor mr haydon the artist i had not spirits for it he was not personally my friend i never saw him face to face but we had corresponded and one of his last acts was an act of trust towards me also i admired his genius and all to end so it has naturally affected me much  so i could not come but in a few days i will come and in the meantime i have had the sound of your voice to think of more than i could think of the deep melodious bells though they made the right and solemn impression how i felt to be under your roof again    may god bless you my very dear friend   these words in the greatest haste  from your ever affectionate elibet     chapter v  18461849   it is now time to tell the story of the romance which during the last eighteen months had entered into elizabeth barretts life and was destined to divert its course into new and happier channels it is a story which fills one of the brightest pages in english literary history  the foregoing letters have shown something of miss barretts admiration for the poetry of robert browning and contain allusions to the beginning of their personal acquaintance her knowledge of his poetry dates back to the appearance of paracelsus not to pauline of which there is no mention in her letters and which had been practically withdrawn from circulation by the author her personal acquaintance with him was of much later date and was directly due to the publication of the poems in 1844 chancing to express his admiration of them to mr kenyon who had been his friend since 1839 and his fathers schoolfellow in years long distant mr browning was urged by him to write to miss barrett himself and tell her of his pleasure in her work possibly the allusion to him in lady geraldines courtship may have been felt as furnishing an excuse for addressing her however that may be he took mr kenyons advice and in january 1845 we find miss barrett in ecstasies over a letter evidently the first from browning the poet browning the author of paracelsus and king of the mystics see p 236 above  the correspondence once begun continued to flourish and in the course of the same month miss barrett tells mrs martin that she is getting deeper and deeper into correspondence with robert browning poet and mystic and we are growing to be the truest of friends at the end of may when the return of summer brought her a renewal of strength they met face to face for the first time and from that time robert browning was included in the small list of privileged friends who were admitted to visit her in person  how this friendship ripened into love and love into courtship it is not for us to inquire too closely something has been told already in mrs orrs life of robert browning something more is told in the long and most interesting letter which stands first in the present chapter more precious than either is the record of her fluctuating feelings which mrs browning has enshrined for ever in her sonnets from the portuguese and in the handful of other poemslife and love a denial proof and disproof inclusions insufficiency142 which likewise belong to this period and describe its hesitations its sorrows and its overwhelming joys in the difficult circumstances under which they were placed the conduct of both was without reproach mr browning knew that he was asking to be allowed to take charge of an invalids lifebelieved indeed that she was even worse than was really the case and that she was hopelessly incapacitated from ever standing on her feetbut was sure enough of his love to regard that as no obstacle miss barrett for her part shrank from burdening the life of the man she loved with a responsibility so trying and perhaps so painful and refused his unchanging devotion for his sake not for her own  footnote 142 poetical works iv 2032  the situation was complicated by the character of mr barrett and by the certaintyfor such it was to his daughterthat he would refuse to entertain the idea of her marriage or indeed that of any of his children the truth of this view was absolutely vindicated not only in the case of elizabeth but also in those of two others of the family in later years the reasons for his feeling it is probable he could not have explained to himself he was fond of his family after his own fashionproud too of his daughters genius but he could not it would seem regard them in any other light than as belonging to himself the wish to leave his roof and to enter into new relations was looked upon as unfilial treachery and no argument or persuasion could shake him from his fixed idea so long as this disposition could be regarded as the result of a devoted love of his children it could be accepted with respect if not with full acquiescence but circumstances brought the proof that this was not the case and thereby ultimately paved the way to elizabeths marriage  these circumstances are stated in several of her letters and alluded to in several others but it may help to the understanding of them if a brief summary be given here in the autumn of 1845 as described above miss barretts doctors advised her to winter abroad the advice was strongly pressed as offering a good prospect of a real improvement of health and as the only way of avoiding the annual relapse brought on by the english winter one or more of her brothers could have gone with her and she was willing and able to try the experiment but in face of this express medical testimony mr barrett interposed a refusal this indifference to her health naturally wounded miss barrett very deeply but it also gave her the right of taking her fate into her own hands convinced at last that no refusal on her part could alter mr brownings devotion to her and that marriage with him so far from being an increase of risk to her health offered the only means by which she might hope for an improvement in it she gave him the conditional promise that if she came safely through the then impending winter she would consent to a definite engagement  the winter of 18456 was an exceptionally mild one and she suffered less than usual and in the spring of 1846 her lover claimed her promise throughout the summer she continued to gain strength being able not only to drive out but even to walk short distances and to visit a few of her special friends such as mr kenyon and mr boyd accordingly it was agreed that at the end of the summer they should be married and leave england for italy before the cold weather should return the uselessness of asking her fathers consent was so evident and the certainty that it would only result in the exclusion of mr browning from the house so clear that no attempt was made to obtain it only her two sisters were aware of what was going on but even they were not informed of the final arrangements for the marriage in order that they might not be involved in their fathers anger when it should become known for the same reason the secret was kept from so close a friend of both parties as mr kenyon though both he and mr boyd and possibly also mrs jameson had suspicions amounting to different degrees of certainty as to the real state of affairs it had been intended that they should wait until the end of september but a project for a temporary removal of the family into the country precipitated matters and on september 12 accompanied only by her maid wilson miss barrett slipped from the house and was married to robert browning in marylebone church143 the associations which that ponderous edifice has gained from this act for all lovers of english poetry tempt one to forgive its unromantic appearance and to remember rather the pilgrimages which robert browning on his subsequent visits to england never failed to pay to its threshold  footnote 143 mrs sutherland orr says that the marriage took place in st pancras church but this is a mistake as the parish register of st marylebone proves  for a week after the marriage mrs browningby which more familiar name we now have the right to call herremained in her fathers house her husband refraining from seeing her since he could not now ask for her by her proper name without betraying their secret then on september 19 accompanied once more by her maid and the everbeloved flushie she left her home to which she was never to return crossed the channel with her husband to havre and so travelled on to paris her fathers anger if not loud was deep and unforgiving from that moment he cast her off and disowned her he would not read or open her letters he would not see her when she returned to england even the birth of her child brought no relenting he expressed no sympathy or anxiety he would not look upon its face he died as he lived unrelenting cut off by his own unbending anger from a daughter who could with difficulty bring herself to speak a harsh word of him even to her most intimate friends  it was a more unexpected and consequently an even more bitter blow to find that her brothers at first disapproved of her action the more so since they had sympathised with her in the struggle of the previous autumn this disapprobation was however less deepseated resting partly upon doubts as to the practical prudence of the match partly no doubt upon a natural annoyance at having been kept in the dark such an estrangement could only be temporary and as time went on was replaced by a full renewal of the old affection towards herself and a friendly acceptance of her husband with her sisters on the other hand there was never a shadow of difference or estrangement that love remained unaffected and almost the only circumstance that caused mrs browning to regret her enforced absence from england was the separation which it entailed from her two sisters  in paris the fugitives found a friend who proved a friend indeed a few weeks earlier mrs jameson knowing of the needs of miss barretts health had offered to take her to italy but her offer had been refused her astonishment may be imagined when after this short interval of time she found her invalid friend in paris as the wife of robert browning the prospect filled her with almost as much dismay as pleasure i have here she wrote to a friend from paris a poet and a poetesstwo celebrities who have run away and married under circumstances peculiarly interesting and such as to render imprudence the height of prudence both excellent but god help them for i know not how the two poet heads and poet hearts will get on through this prosaic world144 mrs jameson who was travelling with her young niece miss geraldine bate145 lent her aid to smooth the path of her poet friends and it was in her company that after a weeks rest in paris the brownings proceeded on their journey to italy it is easy to imagine what a comfort her presence must have been to the invalid wife and her naturally anxious husband and this journey sealed a friendship of no ordinary depth and warmth mrs browning bore the journey wonderfully though suffering much from fatigue during a rest of two days at avignon a pilgrimage was made to vaucluse in honour of petrarch and his laura and there as mrs macpherson has recorded in an often quoted passage of her biography of her aunt there at the very source of the chiare fresche e dolci acque mr browning took his wife up in his arms and carrying her across the shallow curling water seated her on a rock that rose thronelike in the middle of the stream thus love and poetry took a new possession of the spot immortalised by petrarchs loving fancy146  footnote 144 memoirs of anna jameson by g macpherson p 218  footnote 145 afterwards mrs macpherson and mrs jamesons biographer  footnote 146 memoirs p 231  so at the beginning of october the party reached pisa and there the newly wedded pair settled for the winter here first since the departure from london was there leisure to renew the intercourse with friends at home to answer congratulations and good wishes to explain what might seem strange and unaccountable from this point mrs brownings correspondence contains nearly a full record of her life and can be left to tell its own story in better language than the biographers the first letter to mrs martin is an apologia pro connubio suo in fullest detail the others carry on the story from the point at which that leaves it  with regard to this first letter full as it is of the most intimate personal and family revelations it has seemed right to give it entire the marriage of robert and elizabeth browning has passed into literary history and it is only fair that it should be set once for all in its true light those who might be pained by any expressions in it have passed away and those in whose character and reputation the lovers of english literature are interested have nothing to fear from the fullest revelation if anything were kept back false and injurious surmises might be formed the truth leaves little room for controversy and none for slander   to mrs martin collegio ferdinando pisa october 20 1846147  my dearest mrs martinwill you believe that i began a letter to you before i took this step to give you the whole story of the impulses towards it feeling strongly that i owed what i considered my justification to such dear friends as yourself and mr martin that you might not hastily conclude that you had thrown away upon one who was quite unworthy the regard of years i had begun such a letterwhen by the plan of going to little bookham my plans were all hurried forwardchangeddriven prematurely into action and the last hours of agitation and deep anguishfor it was the deepest of its kind to leave wimpole street and those whom i tenderly lovedso would not admit of my writing or thinking only i was able to think that my beloved sisters would send you some account of me when i was gone and now i hear from them that your generosity has not waited for a letter from me to do its best for me and that instead of being vexed as you might well be at my leaving england without a word sent to you you have used kind offices in my behalf you have been more than the generous and affectionate friend i always considered you so my first words must be that i am deeply grateful to you my very dear friend and that to the last moment of my life i shall remember the claim you have on my gratitude generous people are inclined to acquit generously but it has been very painful to me to observe that with all my mere friends i have found more sympathy and trust than in those who are of my own household and who have been daily witnesses of my life i do not say this for papa who is peculiar and in a peculiar position but it pained me that who knew all that passed last yearfor instance about pisawho knew that the alternative of making a single effort to secure my health during the winter was the severe displeasure i have incurred now and that the fruit of yielding myself a prisoner was the sense of being of no use nor comfort to any soul papa having given up coming to see me except for five minutes a day  who said to me with his own lips he does not love youdo not think it said and repeated it two months agothat  should now turn round and reproach me for want of affection towards my family for not letting myself drop like a dead weight into the abyss a sacrifice without an object and expiationthis did surprise me and pain mepained me more than all papas dreadful words but the personal feeling is nearer with most of us than the tenderest feeling for another and my family had been so accustomed to the idea of my living on and on in that room that while my heart was eating itself their love for me was consoled and at last the evil grew scarcely perceptible it was no want of love in them and quite natural in itself we all get used to the thought of a tomb and i was buried that was the whole it was a little thing even for myself a short time ago and really it would be a pneumatological curiosity if i could describe and let you see how perfectly for years together after what broke my heart at torquay i lived on the outside of my own life blindly and darkly from day to day as completely dead to hope of any kind as if i had my face against a grave never feeling a personal instinct taking trains of thought to carry out as an occupation absolutely indifferent to the me which is in every human being nobody quite understood this of me because i am not morally a coward and have a hatred of all the forms of audible groaning but god knows what is within and how utterly i had abdicated myself and thought it not worth while to put out my finger to touch my share of life even my poetry which suddenly grew an interest was a thing on the outside of me a thing to be done and then done what people said of it did not touch me a thoroughly morbid and desolate state it was which i look back now to with the sort of horror with which one would look to ones graveclothes if one had been clothed in them by mistake during a trance  footnote 147 the date at the head of the letter is october 2 but that is certainly a slip of the pen since at that date as the following letter to miss mitford shows they had not reached pisa see also the reference to six weeks of marriage on p 295 the pisa postmark appears to be october 20 or later and the english postmark is november 5  and now i will tell you it is nearly two years ago since i have known mr browning mr kenyon wished to bring him to see me five years ago as one of the lions of london who roared the gentlest and was best worth my knowing but i refused then in my blind dislike to seeing strangers immediately however after the publication of my last volumes he wrote to me and we had a correspondence which ended in my agreeing to receive him as i never had received any other man i did not know why but it was utterly impossible for me to refuse to receive him though i consented against my will he writes the most exquisite letters possible and has a way of putting things which i have not a way of putting asideso he came he came and with our personal acquaintance began his attachment for me a sort of infatuation call it which resisted the various denials which were my plain duty at the beginning and has persisted past them all i began witha grave assurance that i was in an exceptional position and saw him just in consequence of it and that if ever he recurred to that subject again i never could see him again while i lived and he believed me and was silent to my mind indeed it was a bare impulsea generous man of quick sympathies taking up a sudden interest with both hands so i thought but in the meantime the letters and the visits rained down more and more and in every one there was something which was too slight to analyse and notice but too decided not to be understood so that at last when the proposed respect of the silence gave way it was rather less dangerous so then i showed him how he was throwing into the ashes his best affectionshow the common gifts of youth and cheerfulness were behind mehow i had not strength even of heart for the ordinary duties of lifeeverything i told him and showed him look at thisand this throwing down all my disadvantages to which he did not answer by a single compliment but simply that he had not then to choose and that i might be right or he might be right he was not there to decide but that he loved me and should to his last hour he said that the freshness of youth had passed with him also and that he had studied the world out of books and seen many women yet had never loved one until he had seen me that he knew himself and knew that if ever so repulsed he should love me to his last hourit should be first and last at the same time he would not tease me he would wait twenty years if i pleased and then if life lasted so long for both of us then when it was ending perhaps i might understand him and feel that i might have trusted him for my health he had believed when he first spoke that i was suffering from an incurable injury of the spine and that he never could hope to see me stand up before his face and he appealed to my womanly sense of what a pure attachment should bewhether such a circumstance if it had been true was inconsistent with it he preferred he said of free and deliberate choice to be allowed to sit only an hour a day by my side to the fulfilment of the brightest dream which should exclude me in any possible world  i tell you so much my ever dear friend that you may see the manner of man i have had to do with and the sort of attachment which for nearly two years has been drawing and winning me i know better than any in the world indeed what mr kenyon once unconsciously said before methat robert browning is great in everything then when you think how this element of an affection so pure and persistent cast into my dreary life must have acted on ithow little by little i was drawn into the persuasion that something was left and that still i could do something to the happiness of anotherand he what he was for i have deprived myself of the privilege of praising himthen it seemed worth while to take up with that unusual energy for me expended in vain last year the advice of the physicians that i should go to a warm climate for the winter then came the pisa conflict of last year for years i had looked with a sort of indifferent expectation towards italy knowing and feeling that i should escape there the annual relapse yet with that laisser aller manner which had become a habit to me unable to form a definite wish about it but last year when all this happened to me and i was better than usual in the summer i wished to make the experimentto live the experiment out and see whether there was hope for me or not hope then came dr chambers with his encouraging opinion i wanted simply a warm climate and air he said i might be well if i pleased followed what you knowor do not precisely knowthe pain of it was acutely felt by me for i never had doubted but that papa would catch at any human chance of restoring my health i was under the delusion always that the difficulty of making such trials lay in me and not in him his manner of acting towards me last summer was one of the most painful griefs of my life because it involved a disappointment in the affections my dear father is a very peculiar person he is naturally stern and has exaggerated notions of authority but these things go with high and noble qualities and as for feeling the water is under the rock and i had faith yes and have it i admire such qualities as he hasfortitude integrity i loved him for his courage in adverse circumstances which were yet felt by him more literally than i could feel them always he has had the greatest power over my heart because i am of those weak women who reverence strong men by a word he might have bound me to him hand and foot never has he spoken a gentle word to me or looked a kind look which has not made in me large results of gratitude and throughout my illness the sound of his step on the stairs has had the power of quickening my pulsei have loved him so and love him now if he had said last summer that he was reluctant for me to leave himif he had even allowed me to think by mistake that his affection for me was the motive of such reluctancei was ready to give up pisa in a moment and i told him as much whatever my new impulses towards life were my love for him taken so would have resisted alli loved him so dearly but his course was otherwise quite otherwise and i was wounded to the bottom of my heartcast off when i was ready to cling to him in the meanwhile at my side was another i was driven and i was drawn then at last i said if you like to let this winter decide it you may i will allow of no promises nor engagement i cannot go to italy and i know as nearly as a human creature can know any fact that i shall be ill again through the influence of this english winter if i am you will see plainer the foolishness of this persistence if i am not i will do what you please and his answer was if you are ill and keep your resolution of not marrying me under those circumstances i will keep mine and love you till god shall take us both this was in last autumn and the winter came with its miraculous mildness as you know and i was saved as i dared not hope my word therefore was claimed in the spring now do you understand and will you feel for me an application to my father was certainly the obvious course if it had not been for his peculiar nature and my peculiar position but there is no speculation in the case it is a matter of knowledge that if robert had applied to him in the first instance he would have been forbidden the house without a moments scruple and if in the last as my sisters thought best as a respectable form i should have been incapacitated from any afterexertion by the horrible scenes to which as a thing of course i should have been exposed papa will not bear some subjects it is a thing known his peculiarity takes that ground to the largest not one of his children will ever marry without a breach which we all know though he probably does notdeceiving himself in a setting up of obstacles whereas the real obstacle is in his own mind in my case there was or would have been a great deal of apparent reason to hold by my health would have been motive enoughostensible motive i see that precisely as others may see it indeed if i were charged now with want of generosity for casting myself so a dead burden on the man i love nothing of the sort could surprise me it was what occurred to myself that thought was and what occasioned a long struggle and months of agitation and which nothing could have overcome but the very uncommon affection of a very uncommon person reasoning out to me the great fact of love making its own level as to vanity and selfishness blinding me certainly i may have made a mistake and the future may prove it but still more certainly i was not blinded so on the contrary never have i been more humbled and never less in danger of considering any personal pitiful advantage than throughout this affair you who are generous and a woman will believe this of me even if you do not comprehend the habit i had fallen into of casting aside the consideration of possible happiness of my own but i was speaking of papa obvious it was that the application to him was a mere form i knew the result of it i had made up my mind to act upon my full right of taking my own way i had long believed such an act the most strictly personal act of ones life to be within the rights of every person of mature age man or woman and i had resolved to exercise that right in my own case by a resolution which had slowly ripened all the other doors of life were shut to me and shut me in as in a prison and only before this door stood one whom i loved best and who loved me best and who invited me out through it for the goods sake which he thought i could do him now if for the sake of the mere form i had applied to my father and if as he would have done directly he had set up his curse against the step i proposed to take would it have been doing otherwise than placing a knife in his hand a few years ago merely through the reverberation of what he said to another on a subject like this i fell on the floor in a fainting fit and was almost delirious afterwards i cannot bear some words i would much rather have blows without them in my actual state of nerves and physical weakness it would have been the sacrifice of my whole lifeof my convictions of my affections and above all of what the person dearest to me persisted in calling his life and the good of itif i had observed that form therefore wrong or right i determined not to observe it and wrong or right i did and do consider that in not doing so i sinned against no duty that i was constrained to act clandestinely and did not choose to do so god is witness and will set it down as my heavy misfortune and not my fault also up to the very last act we stood in the light of day for the whole world if it pleased to judge us i never saw him out of the wimpole street house he came twice a week to see meor rather three times in the fortnight openly in the sight of all and this for nearly two years and neither more nor less some jests used to be passed upon us by my brothers and i allowed them without a word but it would have been infamous in me to have taken any into my confidence who would have suffered as a direct consequence a blighting of his own prospects my secrecy towards them all was my simple duty towards them all and what they call want of affection was an affectionate consideration for them my sisters did indeed know the truth to a certain point they knew of the attachment and engagementi could not help thatbut the whole of the event i kept from them with a strength and resolution which really i did not know to be in me and of which nothing but a sense of the injury to be done to them by a fuller confidence and my tender gratitude and attachment to them for all their love and goodness could have rendered me capable their faith in me and undeviating affection for me i shall be grateful for to the end of my existence and to the extent of my power of feeling gratitude my dearest sistersespecially let me say my own beloved arabel who with no consolation except the exercise of a most generous tenderness has looked only to what she considered my goodnever doubting me never swerving for one instant in her love for me may god reward her as i cannot dearest henrietta loves me too but loses less in me and has reasons for not misjudging me but both my sisters have been faultless in their bearing towards me and never did i love them so tenderly as i love them now  the only time i met rb clandestinely was in the parish church where we were married before two witnessesit was the first and only time i looked he says more dead than alive and can well believe it for i all but fainted on the way and had to stop for sal volatile at a chemists shop the support through it all was my trust in him for no woman who ever committed a like act of trust has had stronger motives to hold by now may i not tell you that his genius and all but miraculous attainments are the least things in him the moral nature being of the very noblest as all who ever knew him admit then he has had that wide experience of men which ends by throwing the mind back on itself and god there is nothing incomplete in him except as all humanity is incompleteness the only wonder is how such a man whom any woman could have loved should have loved me but men of genius you know are apt to love with their imagination then there is something in the sympathy the strange straight sympathy which unites us on all subjects if it were not that i look up to him we should be too alike to be together perhaps but i know my place better than he does who is too humble oh you cannot think how well we get on after six weeks of marriage if i suffer again it will not be through him some day dearest mrs martin i will show you and dear mr martin how his prophecy was fulfilled saving some picturesque particulars i did not know before that saul was among the prophets  my poor husband suffered very much from the constraint imposed on him by my position and did for the first time in his life for my sake do that in secret which he could not speak upon the housetops mea culpa all of it if one of us two is to be blamed it is i at whose representation of circumstances he submitted to do violence to his own selfrespect i would not suffer him to tell even our dear common friend mr kenyon i felt that it would be throwing on dear mr kenyon a painful responsibility and involve him in the blame ready to fall and dear dear mr kenyon like the noble generous friend i love so deservedly comprehends all at a word sends us not his forgiveness but his sympathy his affection the kindest words which can be written i cannot tell you all his inexpressible kindness to us both he justifies us to the uttermost and in that all the grateful attachment we had each on our side so long professed towards him indeed in a note i had from him yesterday he uses this strong expression after gladly speaking of our successful journey i considered that you had perilled your life upon this undertaking and reflecting upon your last position i thought that you had done well but my life was not perilled in the journey the agitation and fatigue were evils to be sure and mrs jameson who met us in paris by a happy accident thought me looking horribly ill at first and persuaded us to rest there for a week on the promise of accompanying us herself to pisa to help robert to take care of me he who was in a fit of terror about me agreed at once and so she came with us she and her young niece and her kindness leaves us both very grateful so kind she was and isfor still she is in pisaopening her arms to us and calling us children of light instead of ugly names and declaring that she should have been proud to have had anything to do with our marriage indeed we hear every day kind speeches and messages from people such as mr chorley of the athenaeum who has tears in his eyes monckton milnes barry cornwall and other friends of my husbands but who only know me by my books and i want the love and sympathy of those who love me and whom i love i was talking of the influence of the journey the change of air has done me wonderful good notwithstanding the fatigue and i am renewed to the point of being able to throw off most of my invalid habits and of walking quite like a woman mrs jameson said the other day you are not improved you are transformed we have most comfortable rooms here at pisa and have taken them for six months in the best situation for health and close to the duomo and leaning tower it is a beautiful solemn city and we have made acquaintance with professor ferucci who is about to admit us to a sight148 of the university library we shall certainly spend next summer in italy somewhere and talk of rome for the next winter but of course this is all in air let me hear  from you dearest mrs martin and direct m browning poste restante pisait is best just before we left paris i wrote to my aunt jane and from marseilles to bummy but from neither have i heard yet  with best love to dearest mr martin ever both my dear kind friends  your affectionate and grateful ba  footnote 148 the original is torn here   to miss mitford149 moulins october 2 1846  i began to write to you my beloved friend earlier that i might follow your kindest wishes literally and also to thank you at once for your goodness to me for which may god bless you but the fatigue and agitation have been very great and i was forced to break offas now i dare not revert to what is behind i will tell you more another day at orleans with your kindest letter i had one from my dearest gracious friend mr kenyon who in his goodness does more than exculpateeven approveshe wrote a joint letter to both of us but oh the anguish i have gone through you are good you are kind i thank you from the bottom of my heart for saying to me that you would have gone to the church with me yes i know you would and for that very reason i forbore involving you in such a responsibility and drawing you into such a net i took wilson with me i had courage to keep the secret to my sisters for their sakes though i will tell you in strict confidence that it was known to them potentially that is the attachment and engagement were known the necessity remaining that for stringent reasons affecting their own tranquillity they should be able to say at last we were not instructed in this and this the dearest fondest most affectionate of sisters they are to me and if the sacrifice of a life or of all prospect of happiness would have worked any lasting good to them it should have been made even in the hour i left them i knew that by the anguish i suffered in it but a sacrifice without good to anyonei shrank from it and also it was the sacrifice of two and he as you say had done everything for me had loved me for reasons which had helped to weary me of myself loved me heart to heart persistentlyin spite of my own willdrawn me back to life and hope again when i had done with both my life seemed to belong to him and to none other at last and i had no power to speak a word have faith in me my dearest friend till you can know him the intellect is so little in comparison to all the rest to the womanly tenderness the inexhaustible goodness the high and noble aspiration of every hour temper spirits manners there is not a flaw anywhere i shut my eyes sometimes and fancy it all a dream of my guardian angel only if it had been a dream the pain of some parts of it would have awakened me before now it is not a dream i have borne all the emotion of fatigue miraculously well though of course a good deal exhausted at times we had intended to hurry on to the south at once but at paris we met mrs jameson who opened her arms to us with the most literal affectionateness kissed us both and took us by surprise by calling us wise people wild poets or not moreover she fixed us in an apartment above her own in the hôtel de la ville de paris that i might rest for a week and crowned the rest of her goodnesses by agreeing to accompany us to pisa where she was about to travel with her young niece therefore we are five travelling wilson being with me oh yes wilson came her attachment to me never shrank for a moment and flush came and i assure you that nearly as much attention has been paid to flush as to me from the beginning so that he is perfectly reconciled and would be happy if the people at the railroads were not barbarians and immovable in their evil designs of shutting him up in a box when we travel that way  you understand now ever dearest miss mitford how the pause has come about writing the week at paris such a strange week it was altogether like a vision whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell scarcely our balzac should be flattered beyond measure by my thinking of him at all which i did but of you more i will write and tell you more about paris you should go there indeed and to our hotel if at all once we were at the louvre but we kept very still of course and were satisfied with the idea of paris i could have borne to live on there it was all so strange and full of contrast  now you will writei feel my way on the paper to write this nothing is changed between us nothing can ever interfere with sacred confidences remember i do not show letters you need not fear my turning traitress pray for me dearest friend that the bitterness of old affections may not be too bitter with me and that god may turn those salt waters sweet again  pray for your grateful and loving ebb  footnote 149 this letter is of earlier date than the last having been written en route between orleans and lyons but it has seemed better to place the more detailed narrative first   to mrs martin pisa november 5 1846  it was pleasant to me my dearest friend to think while i was reading your letter yesterday that almost by that time you had received mine and could not even seem to doubt a moment longer whether i admitted your claim of hearing and of speaking to the uttermost i recognised you too entirely as my friend because you had put faith in me so much the more reason there was that i should justify it as far as i could and with as much frankness which was a part of my gratitude to you as was possible from a woman to a woman always i have felt that you have believed in me and loved me and for the sake of the past and of the present your affection and your esteem are more to me than i could afford to lose even in these changed and happy circumstances so i thank you once more my dear kind friends i thank you bothi never shall forget your goodness i feel it of course the more deeply in proportion to the painful disappointment in other quarters am i bitter the feeling however passes while i write it out and my own affection for everybody will wait patiently to be forgiven in the proper form when everybody shall be at leisure properly assuredly in the meanwhile however my case is not to be classed with other caseswhat happened to me could not have happened perhaps with any other family in england i hate and loathe everything too which is clandestinewe both do robert and i and the manner the whole business was carried on in might have instructed the least acute of the bystanders the flowers standing perpetually on my table for the last two years were brought there by one hand as everybody knew and really it would have argued an excess of benevolence in an unmarried man with quite enough resources in london to pay the continued visits he paid to me without some strong motive indeed was it his fault that he did not associate with everybody in the house as well as with me he desired it but nothat was not to be the endurance of the pain of the position was not the least proof of his attachment to me how i thank you for believing in himhow grateful it makes me he will justify to the uttermost that faith we have been married two months and every hour has bound me to him more and more if the beginning was well still better it is nowthat is what he says to me and i say back again day by day then it is an advantage to have an inexhaustible companion who talks wisdom of all things in heaven and earth and shows besides as perpetual a good humour and gaiety as if he werea fool shall i say or a considerable quantity more perhaps as to our domestic affairs it is not to my honour and glory that the bills are made up every week and paid more regularly than hard beseems while dear mrs jameson laughs outright at our miraculous prudence and economy and declares that it is past belief and precedent that we should not burn the candles at both ends and the next moment will have it that we remind her of the children in a poem of heines who set up housekeeping in a tub and inquired gravely the price of coffee ah but she has left pisa at lastleft it yesterday it was a painful parting to everybody seven weeks spent in such close neighbourhooda month of it under the same roof and in the same carriageswill fasten people together and then travelling shakes them together a more affectionate generous woman never lived than mrs jameson and it is pleasant to be sure that she loves us both from her heart and not only du bout des lèvres think of her making robert promise as he has told me since that in the case of my being unwell he would write to her instantly and she would come at once if anywhere in italy so kind so like her she spends the winter in rome but an intermediate month at florence and we are to keep tryst with her somewhere in the spring perhaps at venice if not she says that she will come back here for that certainly she will see us she would have stayed altogether perhaps if it had not been for her book upon art which she is engaged to bring out next year and the materials for which are to be sought as to pisa she liked it just as we like it oh it is so beautiful and so full of repose yet not desolate it is rather the repose of sleep than of death then after the first ten days of rain which seemed to refer us fatally to alfieris piove e ripiove came as perpetual a divine sunshine such cloudless exquisite weather that we ask whether it may not be june instead of november every day i am out walking while the golden oranges look at me over the walls and when i am tired robert and i sit down on a stone to watch the lizards we have been to your seashore too and seen your island only he insists on it robert does that it is not corsica but gorgona and that corsica is not in sight beautiful and blue the island was however in any case it might have been romeros instead of either also we have driven up to the foot of mountains and seen them reflected down in the little pure lake of ascuno and we have seen the pine woods and met the camels laden with faggots all in a line so now ask me again if i enjoy my liberty as you expect my head goes round sometimes that is all i never was happy before in my life ah but of course the painful thoughts recur  there are some whom i love too tenderly to be easy under their displeasure or even under their injustice only it seems to me that with time and patience my poor dearest papa will be melted into opening his arms to uswill be melted into a clearer understanding of motives and intentions i cannot believe that he will forget me as he says he will and go on thinking me to be dead rather than alive and happy so i manage to hope for the best and all that remains all my life here is best already could not be better or happier and willingly tell dear mr martin i would take him and you for witnesses of it and in the meanwhile he is not to send me tantalising messages no indeed unless you really really should let yourselves be wafted our way and could you do so much better at pau particularly if fanny hanford should come here will she really the climate is described by the inhabitants as a pleasant spring throughout the winter and if you were to see robert and me threading our path along the shady side everywhere to avoid the excessive heat of the sun in this november  it would appear a good beginning we are not in the warm orthodox position by the arno because we heard with our ears one of the best physicians of the place advise against it better he said to have cool rooms to live in and warm walks to go out along the rooms we have are rather overcool perhaps we are obliged to have a little fire in the sittingroom in the mornings and evenings that is but i do not fear for the winter there is too much difference to my feelings between this november and any english november i ever knew we have our dinner from the trattoria at two oclock and can dine our favorite way on thrushes and chianti with a miraculous cheapness and no trouble no cook no kitchen the prophet elijah or the lilies of the field took as little thought for their dining which exactly suits us it is a continental fashion which we never cease commending then at six we have coffee and rolls of milk made of milk i mean and at nine our supper call it supper if you please of roast chestnuts and grapes so you see how primitive we are and how i forget to praise the eggs at breakfast the worst of pisa is or would be to some persons that socially speaking it has its dullnesses it is not lively like florence not in that way but we do not want society we shun it rather we like the duomo and the campo santo instead then we know a little of professor ferucci who gives us access to the university library and we subscribe to a modern one and we have plenty of writing to do of our own if we can do anything for fanny hanford let us know it would be too happy i suppose to have to do it for yourselves think however i am quite well quite well i can thank god too for being alive and well make dear mr martin keep well and not forget himself in the herefordshire colddraw him into the sun somewhere now write and tell me everything of your plans and of you both dearest friends my husband bids me say that he desires to have my friends for his own friends and that he is grateful to you for not crossing that feeling let him send his regards to you and let me be throughout all changes  your ever faithful and most affectionate ba  i am expecting every day to hear from my dearest sisters write to them and love them for me  this letter has been kept for several days from different causes will you inclose the little note to miss mitford i do not hear from home and am uneasy  may god bless you   november 9  i am so vexed about those poems appearing just now in blackwood150 papa must think it impudent of me it is unfortunate  footnote 150 blackwoods magazine for october 1846 contained the following poems by mrs browning some phrases in which might certainly be open to comment if they were supposed to have been deliberately chosen for publication at this particular time a womans shortcomings a mans requirements maudes spinning a dead rose change on change a reed and hector in the garden   to miss mitford pisa november 5 1846  i have your letter ever dearest miss mitford and it is welcome even more than your letters have been used to be to methe last charm was to come you see by this distance for all your affection and solicitude may you trust my gratitude and if you love me a little i love you indeed and never shall cease the only difference shall be that two may love you where one did and for my part i will answer for it that if you could love the poor one you will not refuse any love to the other when you come to know him i never could bear to speak to you of him since quite the beginning or rather i never could dare but when you know him and understand how the mental gifts are scarcely half of him you will not wonder at your friend and indeed two years of steadfast affection from such a man would have overcome any womans heart i have been neither much wiser nor much foolisher than all the shes in the world only much happierthe difference is in the happiness certainly i am not likely to repent of having given myself to him i cannot for all the pain received from another quarter the comfort for which is that my conscience is pure of the sense of having broken the least known duty and that the same consequence would follow any marriage of any member of my family with any possible man or woman i look to time and reason and natural love and pity and to the justification of the events acting through all i look on so and hope and in the meanwhile it has been a great comfort to have had not merely the indulgence but the approbation and sympathy of most of my old personal friendsoh such kind letters for instance yesterday one came from dear mrs martin who has known me she and her husband since the very beginning of my womanhood and both of them are acute thinking people with heads as strong as their hearts i in my haste left england without a word to them for which they might naturally have reproached me instead of which they write to say that never for a moment have they doubted my having acted for the best and happiest and to assure me that having sympathised with me in every sorrow and trial they delightedly feel with me in the new joy nothing could be more cordially kind see how i write to you as if i could speakall these little things which are great things when seen in the light also r and i are not in the least tired of one another notwithstanding the very perpetual têteàtête into which we have fallen and which past the first fortnight would be rather a trial in many cases then our housekeeping may end perhaps in being a proverb among the nations for at the beginning it makes mrs jameson laugh heartily it disappoints her theories she admitsfinding that albeit poets we abstain from burning candles at both ends at once just as if we did statistics and historical abstracts by nature instead and do not think that the trouble falls on me even the pouring out of the coffee is a divided labour and the ordering of the dinner is quite out of my hands as for me when i am so good as to let myself be carried upstairs and so angelical as to sit still on the sofa and so considerate moreover as not to put my foot into a puddle why my duty is considered done to a perfection which is worthy of all adoration it really is not very hard work to please this taskmaster for pisa we both like it extremely the city is full of beauty and repose and the purple mountains gloriously seem to beckon us on deeper into the vineland we have rooms close to the duomo and leaning tower in the great collegio built by vasari three excellent bedrooms and a sittingroom matted and carpeted looking comfortable even for england for the last fortnight except the very last few sunny days we have had rain but the climate is as mild as possible no cold with all the damp delightful weather we had for the travelling ah you with your terrors of travelling how you amuse me why the constant change of air in the continued fine weather made me better and better instead of worse it did me infinite good mrs jameson says she wont call me improved but transformed rather i like the new sights and the movement my spirits rise i livei can adapt myself if you really tried it and got as far as paris you would be drawn on i fancy and onon to the east perhaps with h martineau or at least as near it as we are here by the way or out of the way it struck me as unfortunate that my poems should have been printed just now in blackwood i wish it had been otherwise then i had a letter from one of my leeds readers the other day to expostulate about the inappropriateness of certain of them the fact is that i sent a heap of verses swept from my desk and belonging to old feelings and impressions and not imagining that they were to be used in that quick way there cant be very much to like i fear apart from your goodness for what calls itself mine love me dearest dear miss mitford my dear kind friendlove me i beg of you still and ever only ceasing when i cease to think of you i will allow of that clause mrs jameson and gerardine are staying at the hotel here in pisa still and we manage to see them every day so good and true and affectionate she is and so much we shall miss her when she goes which will be in a day or two now she goes to florence to siena to rome to complete her work upon art which is the object of her italian journey i read your vivid and glowing description of the picture to her or rather i showed your picture to her and she quite believes with you that it is most probably a velasquez much to be congratulated the owner must be i mean to know something about pictures some day robert does and i shall get him to open my eyes for me with a little instruction you know that in this place are to be seen the first steps of art and it will be interesting to trace them from it as we go farther ourselves our present residence we have taken for six months but we have dreams dreams and we discuss them like soothsayers over the evenings roasted chestnuts and grapes flush highly approves of pisa and the roasted chestnuts because here he goes out every day and speaks italian to the little dogs oh mr chorley such a kind feeling note he wrote to robert from germany when he read of our marriage in galignani we were both touched by it and monckton milnes and othersvery kind all but in a particular manner i remember the kindness of my valued friend mr horne who never failed me nor could fail will you explain to him or rather ask him to understand why i did not answer his last note i forget even balzac here tell me what he writes and help me to love that dear generous mr kenyon whom i can love without help and let me love you and you love me  your ever affectionate and grateful ebb   to mrs jameson collegio ferdinando pisa saturday november 23 1846 postmark  we were delighted to have your note dearest aunt nina and i answer it with my feet on your stool so that my feet are full of you even if my head is not always now i shall not go a sentence farther without thanking you for that comfort you scarcely guessed perhaps what a comfort it would be that stool of yours i am even apt to sit on it for hours together leaning against the sofa till i get to be scolded for putting myself so into the fire and prophesied of in respect to the probability of a general conflagration of stools and bas on which the prophet is to leap from the leaning tower and flush to be left to make the funeral oration of the establishment in the meantime it really is quite a comfort that our housekeeping should be your example at florence we have edifying countenances whenever we think of it and robert will not by any means believe that you passed us on our own ground though the eleven pauls a week for breakfast and my humility seemed to suggest something of the sort i am so glad we are both so glad that you are enjoying yourself at the fullest and highest among the wonders of art and cannot be chilled in the soul by any of those fatal winds you speak of for me i am certainly better here at pisa though the penalty is to see frate angelicos picture with the remembrance of you rather than the presence here indeed we have had a little too much cold for two days there was a feeling of frost in the air and a most undeniable east wind which prevented my going out and made me feel less comfortable than usual at home but after all one felt ashamed to call it cold and robert found the heat on the arno insupportable which set us both mourning over our situation at the collegio where one of us could not get out on such days without a blow on the chest from the wind at the corner well experience teaches and we shall be taught and the cost of it is not so very much after all we have seen your professor once since you left us oh the leaving or spoken to him once i should say when he came in one evening and caught us reading sighing yawning over nicolò de lapi a romance by the sonin law of manzoni before we could speak he called it excellent très beau one of their very best romances upon which of course dear robert could not bear to offend his literary and national susceptibilities by a doubt even i not being so humane thought that any suffering reader would be justified under the rackwheel in crying out against such a book as the dullest heaviest stupidest lengthiest did you ever read it if not dont when a fatherinlaw imitates scott and a soninlaw imitates his fatherinlaw think of the consequences robert in his zeal for italy and against eugène sue tried to persuade me at first this was before the scene with your professor that really ba it wasnt so bad really you are too hard to be pleased and so on but after two or three chapters the dullness grew too strong for even his benevolence and the yawning catastrophe supposed to be peculiar to the guida overthrew him as completely as it ever did me though we both resolved to hold on by the stirrup to the end of the two volumes the catalogue of the library for observe that we subscribe nowthe object is attained offers a most melancholy insight into the actual literature of italy translations translations translations from third and fourth and fifth rate french and english writers chiefly french the roots of thought here in italy seem dead in the ground it is well that they have great memoriesnothing else lives  we have had the kindest of letters from dear noble mr kenyon who by the way speaks of you as we like to hear him dickens is going to paris for the winter and mrs butler151 he adds is expected in london dear mr kenyon calls me crotchety but robert an incarnation of the good and the true so that i have everything to thank him for there are noble people who take the worlds side and make it seem for the nonce almost respectable but he gives up all the talk and fine schemes about moneymaking and allows us to wait to see whether we want it or notthe money i mean  it is monday and i am only finishing this note in the midst came letters from my sisters making me feel so glad that i could not write everybody is well and happy and dear papa in high spirits and having people to dine with him every day so that i have not really done anyone harm in doing myself all this good it does not indeed bring us a step nearer to the forgiveness but to hear of his being in good spirits makes me inclined to jump with gerardine152 dear geddie how pleased i am to hear of her being happy particularly perhaps as she is not too happy to forget me is all that glory of art making her very ambitious to work and enter into the court of the temple  roberts love to you both we often talk of our prospect of meeting you again and for the past dearest aunt nina believe of me that i feel to you more gratefully than ever i can say and remain while i live  your faithful and affectionate ba  footnote 151 better known as fanny kemble  footnote 152 miss gerardine bate mrs jamesons niece   to miss mitford pisa december 19 1846  ever dearest miss mitford your kindest letter is three times welcome as usual on the day you wrote it in the frost i was sitting out of doors just in my summer mantilla and complaining of the heat this december but woe comes to the discontented within these three or four days we too have had frostyes and a little snow for the first time say the pisans during five years robert says that the mountains are powdered toward lucca and i who cannot see the mountains can see the cathedralthe duomohow it glitters whitely at the summit between the blue sky and its own walls of yellow marble of course i do not stir an inch from the fire yet have to struggle a little against my old languor only you see this cant last it is exceptional weather and up to the last few days has been divine and then after all we talk of frost my bedroom which has no fireplace shows not an english sign on the window and the air is not metallic as in england the sun too is so hot that the women are seen walking with fur capes and parasols a curious combination  i hope you had your visit from mr chorley and that you both had the usual pleasure from it indeed i am touched by what you tell me and was touched by his note to my husband written in the first surprise and because robert has the greatest regard for him besides my own personal reasons i do count him in the forward rank of our friends you will hear that he has obliged us by accepting a trusteeship to a settlement forced upon me in spite of certain professions or indispositions of mine but as my husbands gifts i had no right it appeared by refusing it to place him in a false position for the sake of what dear mr kenyon calls my crotchets oh dear mr kenyon his kindness and goodness to us have been past thinking of past thanking for we can only fall into silence he has thrust his hand into the fire for us by writing to papa himself by taking up the management of my small moneymatters when nearer hands let them drop by justifying us with the whole weight of his personal influence all this in the very face of his own habits and susceptibilities he has resolved that i shall not miss the offices of father brother friend nor the tenderness and sympathy of them all and this man is called a mere man of the world and would be called so rightly if the world were a place for angels i shall love him dearly and gratefully to my last breath we both shall  robert and i are deep in the fourth month of wedlock there has not been a shadow between us nor a word and i have observed that all married people confess to words and that the only change i can lay my finger on in him is simply and clearly an increase of affection now i need not say it if i did not please and i should not please you know to tell a story the truth is that i who always did certainly believe in love yet was as great a sceptic as you about the evidences thereof and having held twenty times that jacobs serving fourteen years for rachel was not too long by fourteen days i was not a likely person with my loathing dread of marriage as a loveless state and absolute contentment with single life as the alternative to the great majorities of marriages i was not likely to accept a feeling not genuine though from the hand of apollo himself crowned with his various godships especially too in my position i could not would not should not have done it then genuine feelings are genuine feelings and do not pass like a cloud we are as happy as people can be i do believe yet are living in a way to try this new relationship of oursin the utmost seclusion and perpetual téteàtéteno amusement nor distraction from without except some of the very dullest italian romances which throw us back on the memory of balzac with reiterated groans the italians seem to hang on translations from the frenchas we find from the librarynot merely of balzac but dumas your dumas and reaching lowerlong past de kockto the third and fourth rate novelists what is purely italian is as far as we have read purely dull and conventional there is no breath nor pulse in the italian genius mrs jameson writes to us from florence that in politics and philosophy the people are getting alivewhich may be for aught we know to the contrary the poetry and imagination leave them room enough by immense vacancies  yet we delight in italy and dream of pleasures new for the summerpastures new i should have saidbut it comes to the same thing the padrone in this house sent us in as a gift in gracious recognition perhaps of our lawful paying of bills an immense dish of orangestwo hanging on a stalk with the green leaves still moist with the mornings dewevery great orange of twelve or thirteen with its own stalk and leaves such a pretty sight and better oranges i beg to say never were eaten when we are barbarous enough to eat them day by day after our two oclock dinner softening with the vision of them the winter which has just shown itself almost i have been as pleased with the oranges as i was at avignon by the pomegranate given to me much in the same way think of my being singled out of all our caravan of travellersmrs jameson and gerardine jameson153 both therefor that significant gift of the pomegranates i had never seen one before and of course proceeded instantly to cut one deep down the middle154accepting the omen yet in shame and confusion of face i confess to not being able to appreciate it properly olives and pomegranates i set on the same shelf to be just looked at and called by their names but by no means eaten bodily  but you mistake me dearest friend about the blackwood verses i never thought of writing applicative poemsthe heavens forfend only that just then in the midst of all the talk any verses of mine should come into printand some of them to that particular effectlooked unlucky i dare say poor papa for instance thought me turned suddenly to brass itself well it is perhaps more my fancy than anything else and was only an impression even there mr chorley will tell you of a play of his which i hope will make its way though i do wonder how people can bear to write for the theatres in the present state of things robert is busy preparing a new edition of his collected poems which are to be so clear that everyone who has understood them hitherto will lose all distinction we both mean to be as little idle as possible we shall meet one day in joy i do hope and then you will love my husband for his own sake as for mine you do not hate him now  your ever affectionate ebb  footnote 153 this surname is a mistake on mrs brownings part see her letter of october 1 1849  footnote 154 see lady geraldines courtship stanza xli   to hs boyd pisa december 21 1846  you must let me tell you my dearest mr boyd that i dreamed of you last night and that you were looking very well in my dream and that you told me to break a crust from a loaf of bread which lay by you on the table which i accept on recollection as a sacramental sign between us of peace and affection wasnt it strange that i should dream so of you yet no thinking awake of you the sleeping thoughts come naturally believe of me this christmas time as indeed at every time that i do not forget you and that all the distance and change of country can make no difference understand too for that will give pleasure to your goodness that i am very happy and not unwell though it is almost christmas  dearest friend are you well and in good spirits think of me over the cyprus between the cup and the lip though bad things are said to fall out so we have instead of cyprus montepulciano the famous king of wine crowned king you remember by the grace of a poet your cyprus however keeps supremacy over me and will not abdicate the divine right of being associated with you i speak of wine but we live here the most secluded quiet life possiblereading and writing and talking of all things in heaven and earth and a little besides and sometimes even laughing as if we had twenty people to laugh with us or rather hadnt we know not a creature i am happy to say except an italian professor of the university here who called on us the other evening and praised aloud the scholars of england english latin was best he said and english greek foremost do you clap your hands  the new pope is more liberal than popes in general and people write odes to him in consequence  robert is going to bring out a new edition of his collected poems and you are not to read any more if you please till this is done i heard of carlyles saying the other day that he hoped more from robert browning for the people of england than from any living english writer which pleased me of course i am just sending off an antislavery poem for america155 too ferocious perhaps for the americans to publish but they asked for a poem and shall have it  if i ask for a letter shall i have it i wonder remember me and love me a little and pray for me dearest friend and believe how gratefully and ever affectionately  i am your  elibet  though robert always calls me ba and thinks it the prettiest name in the world which is a proof you will say not only of blind love but of deaf love  footnote 155 the runaway slave at pilgrims point poetical works ii 192 it was first printed in a collection called the liberty bell for sale at the boston national antislavery bazaar of 1848 it was separately printed in england in 1849 as a small pamphlet which is now a rare bibliographical curiosity   it was during the stay at pisa and early in the year 1847 that mr browning first became acquainted with his wifes sonnets from the portuguese written during the course of their courtship and engagement they were not shown even to him until some months after their marriage the story of it was told by mr browning in later life to mr edmund gosse with leave to make it known to the world in general and from mr gosses publication it is here quoted in his own words156  footnote 156 critical kitkats by e gosse p 2 1896  their custom was mr browning said to write alone and not to show each other what they had written this was a rule which he sometimes broke through but she never he had the habit of working in a downstairs room where their meals were spread while mrs browning studied in a room on the floor above one day early in 1847 their breakfast being over mrs browning went upstairs while her husband stood at the window watching the street till the table should be cleared he was presently aware of some one behind him although the servant was gone it was mrs browning who held him by the shoulder to prevent his turning to look at her and at the same time pushed a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat she told him to read that and to tear it up if he did not like it and then she fled again to her own room  the sonnets were intended for her husbands eye alone in the first instance not even for his no poems can ever have been composed with less thought of the public perhaps for that very reason they are unmatched for simplicity and sincerity in all mrs brownings work her genius in them has full mastery over its material as it has in few of her other poems all impurities of style or rhythm are purged away by the fire of love and they stand not only highest among the writings of their authoress but also in the very forefront of english lovepoems with the single exception of rossetti no modern english poet has written of love with such genius such beauty and such sincerity as the two who gave the most beautiful example of it in their own lives  fortunately for all those who love true poetry mr browning judged rightly of the obligation laid upon him by the possession of these poems i dared not he said reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language since shakespeares accordingly he persuaded his wife to commit the printing of them to her friend miss mitford and in the course of the year they appeared in a slender volume entitled sonnets by ebb with the imprint reading 1847 and marked not for publication it was not until three years later that they were offered to the general public in the volumes of 1850 here first they appeared under the title of sonnets from the portuguesea title suggested by mr browning in preference to his wifes proposal sonnets translated from the bosnian for the sake of its halfallusion to her other poem catarina to camoens which was one of his chief favourites among her works  to these sonnets there is however no allusion in the letters here published which say little for some time of her own work   to miss mitford february 8 1847  but my dearest miss mitford your scheme about leghorn is drawn out in the clouds now just see how impossible leghorn is fifteen miles off and though there is a railroad there is no liberty for french books to wander backwards and forwards without inspection and seizure why do remember that we are in italy after all nevertheless i will tell you what we have done transplanted our subscription from the italian library which was wearing us away into a misanthropy or at least despair of the wits of all southerns into a library which has a tolerable supply of french books and gives us the privilege besides of having a french newspaper the siècle left with us every evening also this library admits is allowed to admit on certain conditions some books forbidden generally by the censureship which is of the strictest and though balzac appears very imperfectly i am delighted to find him at all and shall dun the bookseller for the instruction criminelle which i hope discharges your lucien as a forçatneither man nor womanand true poet least of all  the siècle has for a feuilleton a new romance of souliés called saturnin fichet which is really not good and tiresome to boot robert and i began by each of us reading it but after a little while he left me alone being certain that no good could come of such a work so of course ever since i have been exclaiming and exclaiming as to the wonderful improvement and increasing beauty and glory of it just to justify myself and to make him sorry for not having persevered the truth is however that but for obstinacy i should give up too deplorably dull the story is and there is a crowd of people each more indifferent than each to you the pith of the plot being very characteristically that the hero has somebody exactly like him to the reader its all one in every sensewhos who and whats what robert is a warm admirer of balzac and has read most of his books but certainlyoh certainlyhe does not in a general way appreciate our french people quite with our warmth he takes too high a standard i tell him and wont listen to a story for a storys sake i can bear to be amused you know without a strong pull on my admiration so we have great wars sometimes and i put up dumas flag or souliés or eugène sues yet he was properly possessed by the mystères de paris and carry it till my arms ache the plays and vaudevilles he knows far more of than i do and always maintains they are the happiest growth of the french schoolsetting aside the masters observefor balzac and george sand hold all their honours and before your letter came he had told me about the kean and the other dramas then we read together the other day the rouge et noir that powerful book of stendhals beyle and he thought it very striking and observedwhat i had thought from the first and again and againthat it was exactly like balzac in the raw in the material and undeveloped conception what a book it is really and so full of pain and bitterness and the gall of iniquity the new dumas i shall see in time perhaps and it is curious that robert had just been telling me the very story you speak of in your letter from the causes célèbres i never read itthe more shame dearest friend all this talk of french books and no talk about youthe most shame you dont tell me enough of yourself and i want to hear because besides the usual course of reasons mr chorley spoke of you as if you were not as cheerful as usual do tell me ah if you fancy that i do not love you as near through being so far you are unjust to me as you never were before for myself the brightness round me has had a cloud on it lately by an illness of poor wilsons she would not go to dr cook till i was terrified one night while she was undressing me by her sinking down on the sofa in a shivering fit oh so frightened i was and robert ran out for a physician and i could have shivered too with the fright but she is convalescent now thank god and in the meanwhile i have acquired a heap of practical philosophy and have learnt how it is possible in certain conditions of the human frame to comb out and twist up ones own hair and lace ones very own stays and cause hooks and eyes to meet behind ones very own back besides making toast and water for wilsonwhich last miracle it is only just to say was considerably assisted by roberts counsels not quite to set fire to the bread while one was toasting it he was the best and kindest all that time as even he could be and carried the kettle when it was too heavy for me and helped me with heart and head mr chorley could not have praised him too much be very sure i who always rather appreciated him do set down the thoughts i had as merely unjust things he exceeds them all indeed yes mr chorley has been very kind to us i had a kind note myself from him a few days since and do you know that we have a sort of hope of seeing him in italy this year with dearest mr kenyon who has the goodness to crown his goodness by a dream of coming to see us we leave pisa in april did i tell you that and pass through florence towards the north of italyto venice for instance in the way of writing i have not done much yetjust finished my rough sketch of an antislavery ballad and sent it off to america where nobody will print it i am certain because i could not help making it bitter if they do print it i shall thank them more boldly in earnest than i fancy now tell me of mary howitts new collection of balladsare they good i warmly wish that mr chorley may succeed with his play but how can miss cushman promise a hundred nights for an untried work perhaps you may find the two last numbers of the bells and pomegranates less obscureit seems so to me flush has grown an absolute monarch and barks one distracted when he wants a door opened robert spoils him i think do think of me as your ever affectionate and grateful  ba  have you seen agnes de misanie the new play by the author of lucretia a witty feuilletoniste says of it that besides all the unities of aristotle it comprises from beginning to end unity of situation not bad is it madame ancelot has just succeeded with a comedy called une année à paris by the way shall you go to paris this spring157  footnote 157 a list of the works composing balzacs comédie humaine is attached to this letter for miss mitfords benefit   from mr brownings family though she had as yet had no opportunity of making acquaintance with them face to face mrs browning from the first met with an affectionate reception the following is the first now extant of a series of letters written by her to miss browning the poets sister the abrupt and private nature of the marriage never seems to have caused the slightest coldness of feeling in this quarter though it must have caused anxiety and the tone of the early letters in which so new and unfamiliar a relation had to be taken up does equal honour to the writer and to the recipient   to miss browning pisa about february 1847  i must begin by thanking dearest sarianna again for her note and by assuring her that the affectionate tone of it quite made me happy and grateful togetherthat i am grateful to all of you do feel that i am for the rest when i see afar off roberts minute manuscripts a certain distrust steals over me of anything i can possibly tell you of our way of living lest it should be the vainest of repetitions and by no means worth repeating both at once such a quiet silent life it isgoing to hear the friar preach in the duomo a grand event in it and the wind laying flat all our schemes about volterra and lucca i have had to give up even the friar for these three days past there is nothing for me when i have driven out robert to take his necessary walk but to sit and watch the pinewood blaze he is grieved about the illness of his cousin only i do hope that your next letter will confirm the happy change which stops the further anxiety and come soon for that purpose besides others your letters never can come too often remember even when they have not to speak of illness and i for my part must always have a thankful interest in your cousin for the kind part he took in the happiest event of my life you have to tell us too of your dear motherrobert is so anxious about her always how deeply and tenderly he loves her and all of you never could have been more manifest than now when he is away from you and has to talk of you instead of to you by the way or rather out of the way i quite took your view of the purposed ingratitude to poor miss haworth158it would have been worse in him than the sins of examiner and athenaeum if authors wont feel for one another theres an end of the world of writing oh i think he proposed it in a moment of hardheartednesswe all put on tortoiseshell now and then and presently come out into the sun as sensitively as ever besides miss haworth has written to us very kindly and kindness doesnt spring up everywhere like the violets in your gravel walks see how i understand hatcham do try to love me a little dearest sarianna and with my grateful love always to your father and mother let me be your affectionate sister  elizabeth barrett browning or rather ba  footnote 158 miss ef haworth several letters to whom are given farther on was an old friend of robert brownings and published a volume of verse in 1847 to which this passage seems to allude   the correspondence with mr westwood which had lapsed for a considerable time was resumed with the following letter   to mr westwood collegio ferdinando pisa march 10 1847  if really my dear mr westwood it was an ill temper in you causing the brief note it was a most flattering ill temper and i thank you just as i have had reason to do for the good nature which has caused you to bear with me so often and so long you have been misled on some points i did not go to italy last year or rather the year before last i was disappointed and forced to stay in wimpole street after all but the winter being so mild so miraculously mild for england you may remember i was spared my winter relapse and left liberty for new plans such as i never used to think were in my destiny such a change it is to me such a strange happiness and freedom and you must not in your kindness wish me back again but rather be contented like a friend as you are to hear that i am very happy and very well and still doubtful whether all the brightness can be meant for me it is just as if the sun rose again at 7 oclock pm the strangeness seems so great  i am now very well and so happy as not to think much of it except for the sake of another and do you fancy how i feel carried into the visions of nature from my gloomy room even now i walk as in a dream we made a pilgrimage from avignon to vaucluse in right poetical duty and i and my husband sate upon two stones in the midst of the fountain which in its dark prison of rocks flashes and roars and testifies to the memory of petrarch it was louder and fuller than usual when we were there on account of the rains and flush though by no means born to be a hero considered my position so outrageous that he dashed through the water to me splashing me all over so he is baptised in petrarchs name the scenery is full of grandeur the rocks sheathe themselves into the sky and nothing grows there except a little cypress here and there and a straggling olive tree and the fountain works out its soul in its stony prison and runs away in a green rapid stream such a striking sight it is i sate upon deck too in our passage from marseilles to genoa and had a vision of mountains six or seven deep one behind another as to pisa call it a beautiful town you cannot do less with arno and its palaces and above all the wonderful duomo and campo santo and leaning tower and baptistery all of which are a stones throw from our windows we have rooms in a great collegehouse built by vasari and fallen into desuetude from collegiate purposes and here we live the quietest and most têteàtête of lives knowing nobody hearing nothing and for nearly three months together never catching a glimpse of a paper oh how wrong you were about the times now however we subscribe to a french and italian library and have a french newspaper every evening the siècle and so look through a loophole at the world yet not too proud are we even now for all the news you will please to send us in charity da obolum belisario  what do you mean about poor tennyson i heard of him last on his return from a visit to the swiss mountains which disappointed him he was said to say very wrong either of mountains or poet  tell me if you make acquaintance with mrs hewitts new ballads  mrs jameson is engaged in a work on art which will be very interesting  flushs love to your flopsy flush has grown very overbearing in this italy i think because my husband spoils him if not for the glory at vaucluse robert declares that the said flush considers him my husband to be created for the especial purpose of doing him service and really it looks rather like it  never do i see the athenaeum now but before i left england some pure gushes between the rocks reminded me of you tell me all you can it will all be like rain upon dry ground my husband bids me offer his regards to youif you will accept them and that you may do it ask your heart i will assure you aside that his poetry is as the prose of his nature he himself is so much better and higher than his own works   in the middle of april the brownings left pisa and journeyed to florence arriving there on april 20 there however the programme was arrested and save for an abortive excursion to vallombrosa whence they were repulsed by the misogynist principles of the monks they continued to reside in florence for the remainder of the year their first abode was in the via delle belle donne but after the return from vallombrosa in august they moved across the river and took furnished rooms in the palazzo guidi the building which under the name of casa guidi is for ever associated with their memory   to mrs martin florence april 24 1847  i received your letter my dearest friend by this days post and wrote a little note directly to the office as a trap for the feet of your travellers if they escape us after all therefore they may praise their stars for it rather than my intentionsour intentions i should say for robert will gladly do everything he can in the way of expounding a text or two of the glories of florence and we both shall be much pleased and cordially pleased to learn more of fanny and her brother than the glance at pisa could teach us as for me she will let me have a little talking for my share i cant walk about or see anything i lie here flat on the sofa in order to be wise i rest and take port wine by wineglasses and a few more days of it will prepare me i hope and trust for an interview with the venus de medici think of my having been in florence since tuesday this being saturday and not a step taken into the galleries it seems a disgrace a sort of involuntary disgraceful act or rather noact which to complain of relieves one to some degree and how kind of you to wish to hear from me of myself there is nothing really much the matter with me i am just weak sleeping and eating dreadfully well considering that florence isnt seen yet and looking well too says mrs jameson who with her niece is our guest just now it would have been wise if i had rested longer at pisa but you see there was a long engagement to meet mrs jameson here and she expressed a very kind unwillingness to leave italy without keeping it also she had resolved to come out of her way on purpose for this and as i had the consent of my physician we determined to perform our part of the compact and in order to prepare for the longer journey i went out in the carriage a little too soon perhaps and a little too long at least if i had kept quite still i should have been strong by this timenot that i have done myself harm in the serious sense observeand now the affair is accomplished i shall be wonderfully discreet and selfdenying and resist venuses and apollos like some one wiser than the gods themselves my chest is very well there has been no symptom of evil in that quarter we took the whole coupé of the diligencebut regretted our first plan of the vettura neverthelessand now are settled in very comfortable rooms in the via delle belle donne just out of the piazza santa maria novella very superior rooms to our apartment in pisa in which we were cheated to the uttermost with all the subtlety of italy and to the full extent of our ignorance think what that must have been our present apartment with the hire of a grand piano and music does not cost us so much within ever so many francisconi oh and you dont frighten me though we are on the north side of the arno we have taken our rooms for two months and may be here longer and the fear of the heat was stronger with me than the fear of the cold or we might have been in the pitti and arrostiti by this time we expected dear mrs jameson on saturday but she came on friday evening having suddenly remembered that it was shakespeares birthday and bringing with her from arezzo a bottle of wine to drink to his memory with two other poets so there was a great deal of merriment as you may fancy and robert played shakespeares favorite air the light of love and everybody was delighted to meet everybody and roman news and pisan dullness were properly discussed on every side she saw a good deal of cobden in rome and went with him to the sistine chapel he has no feeling for art and being very true and earnest could only do his best to try to admire michael angelo but here and there where he understood the pleasure was expressed with a blunt characteristic simplicity standing before the statue of demosthenes he said that man is persuaded himself of what he speaks and will therefore persuade others she liked him exceedingly for my part i should join in more admiration if it were not for his having accepted money but paid patriots are no heroes of mine verily they have their reward oconnell had arrived in rome and it was considered that he came only to die among the artists gibson and wyatt were doing great things she wishes us to know gibson particularly as to the pope he lives in an atmosphere of love and admiration and he is doing what he can mrs jameson believes robert says a dreadful situation after all for a man of understanding and honesty i pity him from my soul for he can at best only temporise with truth but human nature is doomed to pay a high price for its opportunities delighted i am to have your good account of dear mr martin though you are naughty people to persist in going to england so soon do write to me and tell me all about both of you i will do what i canlike the popebut what can i do yes indeed i mean to enjoy art and nature too one shall not exclude the other this florence seems divine as we pass the bridges and my husband who knows everything is to teach and show me all the great wonders so that i am reasonably impatient to try my advantages his kind regards to you both and my best love dearest friends  your very affectionate ba   to mrs jameson florence may 12 1847  i was afraid we both were afraid for you dearest friend when we saw the clouds gather and heard the rain fall as it did that day at florence it seemed impossible that you should be beyond the evil influence should you have travelled ever so fast but after all a storm in the apennines like many a moral storm will be better perhaps than a calm to look back upon we talked of you and thought of you and missed you at coffee time and regretted that so pleasant a week for us should have gone so fast as fast as a dull week or rather a good deal faster dearest friend do believe that we felt your goodness in coming to usin making us an objectbefore you left italy it fills up the measure of goodness and kindness for which we shall thank and love you all our lives never fancy that we can forget you or be less touched by the memory of what you have been to us in affection and sympathynever and dont you lose sight of us do write often and do do make haste and come back to italy and then make use of us in any and every possible way as housetakers or housemates for we are ready to accept the lowest place or the highest the week you gave us would be altogether bright and glad if it had not been for the depression and anxiety on your part may god turn it all to gain and satisfaction in some unlookedfor way to be a roadmaker is weary work even across the apennines of life we have not science enough for it if we have strength which we havent either do you remember how sindbad shut his eyes and let himself be carried over the hills by an eagle that was better than to set about breaking stones also what you could do you have done you have finished your part and the sense of a fulfilled duty is in itself satisfyingis and must be my sympathies go with you entirely while i wish your dear gerardine to be happy i wish it from my heart just after you left us arrived our box with the precious deeds which are thrown into the cabinet for want of witnesses and then robert has had a letter from mr forster with the date of shakespeares birthday and overflowing with kindness really both to himself and me it quite touched me that letter also we have had a visitation from an american but on the point of leaving florence and very tame and inoffensive and we bore it very well considering he sent us a new literary periodical of the old world in which among other interesting matter i had the pleasure of reading an account of my own blindness taken from a french paper the presse and mentioned with humane regret well and what more news is there to tell you i have been out once only once and only for an inglorious glorious drive round the piazza gran duca past the duomo outside the walls and in again at the cascine it was like the trail of a vision in the evening sun i saw the perseus in a sort of flash the duomo is more after the likeness of a duomo than pisa can show i like those masses in ecclesiastical architecture now we are plotting how to engage a carriage for a months service without ruining ourselves for we must see and i cant walk and see though much stronger than when we parted and looking much better as robert and the looking glass both do testify i have seemed at last to leap to a conclusion of convalescence but the heatoh so hot it is if it is half as hot with you you must be calling on the name of st lawrence by this time and require no turning i should not like to travel under such a sun it would be too like playing at snapdragon yes brightly happy women generally lose by marriage but i have gained the world by mine if it were not for some griefs which are and must be griefs i should be too happy perhaps which is good for nobody may god bless you my dear dearest friend robert must be content with sending his love today and shall write another day we both love you every day my love and a kiss to dearest gerardine who is to remember to write to me  your ever affectionate ba   to hs boyd florence may 26 1847       i should have answered your letter my dearest friend more quickly but when it came i was ill as you may have heard and afterwards i wished to wait until i could send you information about the leaning tower and the bells159 the book you required about the cathedral robert has tried in vain to procure for you plenty of such books but not in english in london such things are to be found i should think without difficulty for instance murrays handbook to northern italy though rather dear 12s would give you sufficiently full information upon the ecclesiastical glories both of pisa and of this beautiful florence from whence i write to you i will answer for the harmony of the bells as we lived within a stones throw of them and they began at four oclock every morning and rang my dreams apart the pasquareccia the fourth especially has a profound note in it which may well have thrilled horror to the criminals heart160 it was ghastly in its effects dropped into the deep of night like a thought of death often have i said oh how ghastly and then turned on my pillow and dreamed a bad dream but if the bell founders at pisa have a merited reputation let no one say as much for the bellringers the manner in which all the bells of all the churches in the city are shaken together sometimes would certainly make you groan in despair of your ears the discord is fortunately indescribable wellbut here we are at florence the most beautiful of the cities devised by man  in the meanwhile i have seen the venus i have seen the divine raphaels i have stood by michael angelos tomb in santa croce i have looked at the wonderful duomo this cathedral after all the elaborate grace of the pisan cathedral is one thing and the massive grandeur of this of florence is another and better thing it struck me with a sense of the sublime in architecture at pisa we say how beautiful here we say nothing it is enough if we can breathe the mountainous marble masses overcome as we look upwe feel the weight of them on the soul tesselated marbles the green treading its elaborate pattern into the dim yellow which seems the general hue of the structure climb against the sky selfcrowned with that prodigy of marble domes it struck me as a wonder in architecture i had neither seen nor imagined the like of it in any way it seemed to carry its theology out with it it signified more than a mere building tell me everything you want to know i shall like to answer a thousand questions florence is beautiful as i have said before and must say again and again most beautiful the river rushes through the midst of its palaces like a crystal arrow and it is hard to tell when you see all by the clear sunset whether those churches and houses and windows and bridges and people walking in the water or out of the water are the real walls and windows and bridges and people and churches the only difference is that down below there is a double movement the movement of the stream besides the movement of life for the rest the distinctness of the eye is as great in one as in the other remember me to such of my friends as remember me kindly when unreminded by me i am very happyhappier and happier  elibet  roberts best regards to you always  footnote 159 it will be remembered that mr boyd took a great interest in bells and bell ringing the passage omitted below contains an extract from murrays handbook with reference to the bells of pisa  footnote 160 this bell was tolled on the occasion of an execution   to mrs jameson palazzo guidi via maggio florence august 7 1847 postmark  you will be surprised perhaps and perhaps not dearest friend to find that we are still at florence florence holds us with a glittering eye theres a charm cast round us and we cant get away in the first place your news of recoaro came so late that as you said yourself we ought to have been there before your letter reached us nobody would encourage us to go north on any grounds indeed and if anybody speaks a word now in favour of venice straight comes somebody else speaking the direct contrary altogether we took to making a plan of our owna great wild delightful plan of plunging into the mountains and spending two or three months at the monastery of vallombrosa until the heat was passed and dear mr kenyon decided and we could either settle for the winter at florence or pass on to rome could anything look more delightful than that well we got a letter of recommendation to the abbot and left our apartment via delle belle donne a week before our three months were done thoroughly burned out by the sun set out at four in the morning reached pelago and from thence travelled five miles along a via non rotabile through the most romantic scenery oh such mountainsas if the whole world were alive with mountainssuch ravinesblack in spite of flashing waters in themsuch woods and rockstravelled in basket sledges drawn by four white oxenwilson and i and the luggageand robert riding step by step we were four hours doing the five miles so you may fancy what rough work it was whether i was most tired or charmed was a tug between body and soul the worst was that there being a new abbot at the monasteryan austere man jealous of his sanctity and the approach of womenour letter and roberts eloquence to boot did nothing for us and we were ingloriously and ignominiously expelled at the end of five days for three days we were welcome for two more we kept our ground but after that out we were thrust with baggage and expectations nothing could be much more provoking and yet we came back very merrily for disappointed people to florence getting up at three in the morning and rolling or sliding as it might happen down the precipitous path and seeing round us a morning glory of mountains clouds and rising sun such as we never can forgetback to florence and our old lodgings and an eatable breakfast of coffee and bread and a confession one to another that if we had won the day instead of losing it and spent our summer with the monks we should have grown considerably thinner by the victory they make their bread i rather imagine with the sawdust of their fir trees and except oil and wineyes and plenty of beef of fleisch as your germans say of all kinds indeed which isnt precisely the fare to suit uswe were thrown for nourishment on the great sights around oh but so beautiful were mountains and forests and waterfalls that i could have kept my ground happily for the two monthseven though the only book i saw there was the chronicle of their san gualberto is he not among your saints being routed fairly and having breakfasted fully at our old apartment robert went out to find cool rooms if possible and make the best of our position and now we are settled magnificently in this palazzo guidi on a first floor in an apartment which looks quite beyond our means and would be except in the dead part of the seasona suite of spacious rooms opening on a little terrace and furnished elegantlyrather to suit our predecessor the russian prince than ourselvesbut cool and in a delightful situation six paces from the piazza pitti and with right of daily admission to the boboli gardens we pay what we paid in the via belle donne isnt this prosperous you would be surprised to see me i think i am so very well and look sodispensed from being carried upstairs and inclined to take a run for a walk every now and then i scarcely recognise myself or my ways or my own spirits all is so different  we have made the acquaintance of mr powers161 who is delightfulof a most charming simplicity with those great burning eyes of his tell me what you think of his boy listening to the shell oh your raphaels how divine and m angelos sculptures his pictures i leap up to in vain and fall back regularly write of your book and yourself and write soon and let me be as always your affectionate ba  we are here for two months certain and perhaps longer do write  dear aunt ninaba has said something for me i hope in any case my love goes with hers i trust you are well and happy as we are and as we would make you if we could love to geddie ever yours rb  footnote 161 the american sculptor   to mrs martin florence august 7 1847  my dearest mrs martinhow i have been longing to get this letter which comes at last and justifies the longing by the pleasure it gives how kind how affectionate you are to me and how strong your claim is that i should thrust on you in defiance of good taste and conventions every evidence and assurance of my happiness so as to justify your faith to yourselves and others indeed indeed dearest mrs martin you may exult for meand this though it should all end here and now the uncertainties of life and death seem nothing to me a year nearly is saved from the darkness and if that one year has compensated for those that preceded itwhich it has abundantlywhy let it for those that shall follow if it so please god come what may i feel as if i never could have a right to murmur i have been happy enough brought about too it was indeed by a sort of miracle which to this moment when i look back bewilders me to think of and if you knew the details counted the little steps and could compare my moral position three years and a half ago with this you would come to despise san gualbertos miraculous tree at vallombrosa which being dead gave out green leaves in recognition of his approach as testified by the inscriptiondo you remember but you cant stop today to read mine so rather i shall tell you of our exploit in the mountains only one thing i must say first one thing which you must forgive me for the vanity of resolving to say at last having had it in my head very often theres a detestable engraving which if you have the ill luck to see and you may because horrible to relate it is in the shop windows will you have the kindness for my sake not to fancy like robertit being as he says himself the very image of a young man at waterloo house in a moment of inspirationa lovely blue maam it is as like robert as flush and now i am going to tell you of vallombrosa you heard how we meant to stay two months there and you are to imagine how we got up at three in the morning to escape the heat imagine meand with all our possessions and a dozen of port which my husband doses me with twice a day because once it was necessary proceeded to pelago by vettura and from thence in two sledges drawn each by two white bullocks up to the top of the holy mountain robert was on horseback precisely it must be as you left it who can make a road up a house we were four hours going five miles and i with all my goodwill was dreadfully tired and scarcely in appetite for the beef and oil with which we were entertained at the house of strangers we are simple people about diet and had said over and over that we would live on eggs and milk and bread and butter during these two months we might as well have said that we would live on manna from heaven the things we had fixed on were just the impossible things oh that bread with the fetid smell which stuck in the throat like macbeths amen i am not surprised you recollect it the hens had got them to a nunnery and objected to lay eggs and the milk and the holy water stood confounded but of course we spread the tablecloth just as you did over all drawbacks of the sort and the beef and oil as i said and the wine too were liberal and excellent and we made our gratitude apparent in roberts best tuscanin spite of which we were turned out ignominiously at the end of five days having been permitted to overstay the usual three days by only two no nothing could move the lord abbot he is a new abbot and given to sanctity and has set his face against women while he is abbot he said to our mediating monk he will be abbot so he is abbot and we had to come back to florence as i read in the life of san gualberto laid on the table for the edification of strangers the brothers attain to sanctification among other means by cleaning out pigsties with their bare hands without spade or shovel but that is uncleanliness enoughthey wouldnt touch the little finger of a woman angry i was i do assure you i should have liked to stay there in spite of the bread we should have been only a little thinner at the end and the sceneryoh how magnificent how we enjoyed that great silent inkblack pine wood and do you remember the sea of mountains to the left how grand it is we were up at three in the morning again to return to florence and the glory of that morning sun breaking the clouds to pieces among the hills is something ineffaceable from my remembrance we came back ignominiously to our old rooms but found it impossible to stay on account of the suffocating heat yet we scarcely could go far from florence because of mr kenyon and our hope of seeing him here since lost a perplexity ended by roberts discovery of our present apartments on the pitti side of the river indeed close to the grand dukes palace consisting of a suite of spacious and delightful rooms which come within our means only from the deadness of the summer season comparatively quite cool and with a terrace which i enjoy to the uttermost through being able to walk there without a bonnet by just stepping out of the window the church of san felice is opposite so we havent a neighbour to look through the sunlight or moonlight and take observations isnt that pleasant altogether we ordered back the piano and the book subscription and settled for two months and forgave the vallombrosa monks for the wrong they did us like secular christians what is to come after i cant tell you but probably we shall creep slowly along toward rome and spend some hot time of it at perugia which is said to be cool enough i think more of other things wishing that my dearest kindest sisters had a present as bright as mineto think nothing at all of the future dearest henriettas position has long made me uneasy and since she frees me into confidence by her confidence to you i will tell you so most undesirable it is that this should be continued and yet where is there a door open to escape162  my dear brothers have the illusion that nobody should marry on less than two thousand a year good heavens how preposterous it does seem to me we scarcely spend three hundred and i have every luxury i ever had and which it would be so easy to give up at need and robert wouldnt sleep i think if an unpaid bill dragged itself by any chance into another week he says that when people get into pecuniary difficulties his sympathies always go with the butchers and bakers so we keep out of scrapes yet you see  your grateful and most affectionate ba  we have had the most delightful letter from carlyle who has the goodness to say that not for years has a marriage occurred in his private circle in which he so heartily rejoiced as in ours he is a personal friend of roberts so that i have reason to be very proud and glad  roberts best regards to you both always and he is no believer in magnetism only i am do mention mr c hanfords health how strange that he should come to witness my marriage settlement did you hear  footnote 162 miss henrietta barrett was engaged to captain surtees cook an engagement of which her brothers as well as her father disapproved partly on the ground of insufficiency of income ultimately the difficulty was solved in the same way as in the case of mrs browning   to miss mitford florence august 20 1847  i have received your letter at last my ever dearest miss mitford not the missing letter but the one which comes to make up for it and to catch up my thoughts which were grumbling at high tide i do assure you as you observed last year not without reason these are the days of marrying and giving in marriage mr horne you see163  with all my heart i hope he may be very happy men risk a good deal in marriage though not as much as women do and on the other hand the singleness of a man when his youth is over is a sadder thing than the saddest which an unmarried woman can suffer nearly all my friends of both sexes have been draining off into marriage these two years scarcely one will be left in the sieve and i may end by saying that i have happiness enough for my own share to be divided among them all and leave everyone contented for me i take it for pure magic this life of mine surely nobody was ever so happy before i shall wake some morning with my hair all dripping out of the enchanted bucket or if not we shall both claim the flitch next september if you can find one for us in the land of cockaigne drying in expectancy of the revolution in tennysons commonwealth well i dont agree with mr harness in admiring the lady of locksley hall i must either pity or despise a woman who could have married tennyson and chose a common man if happy in her choice i despise her thats matter of opinion of course you may call it matter of foolishness when i add that i personally would rather be teased a little and smoked over a good deal by a man whom i could look up to and be proud of than have my feet kissed all day by a mr smith in boots and a waistcoat and thereby chiefly distinguished neither i nor another perhaps had quite a right to expect a combination of qualities such as meet though in my husband who is as faultless and pure in his private life as any mr smith of them all who would not owe five shillings who lives like a woman in abstemiousness on a pennyworth of wine a day never touches a cigar even do you hear as we do from mr forster that his164 new poem is his best work as soon as you read it let me have your opinion the subject seems almost identical with one of chaucers is it not so we have spent here the most delightful of summers notwithstanding the heat and i begin to comprehend the possibility of st lawrences ecstasies on the gridiron very hot it certainly has been and is yet there have been cool intermissions and as we have spacious and airy rooms and as robert lets me sit all day in my white dressing gown without a single masculine criticism and as we can step out of the window on a sort of balcony terrace which is quite private and swims over with moonlight in the evenings and as we live upon water melons and iced water and figs and all manner of fruit we bear the heat with an angelic patience and felicity which really are edifying we tried to make the monks of vallombrosa let us stay with them for two months but their new abbot said or implied that wilson and i stank in his nostrils being women and san gualberto the establishes of their order had enjoined on them only the mortification of cleaning out pigsties without fork or shovel so here a couple of women besides was as dickenss american said a piling it up rayther too mountainious so we were sent away at the end of five days so provoking such scenery such hills such a sea of hills looking alive among the clouds which rolled it was difficult to discern such pine woods supernaturally silent with the ground black as ink such chestnut and beech forests hanging from the mountains such rocks and torrents such chasms and ravines there were eagles there too and there was no road robert went on horseback and flush wilson and i were drawn in a sledge ie an old hamper a basket wine hamper without a wheel by two white bullocks up the precipitous mountains think of my travelling in that fashion in those wild places at four oclock in the morning a little frightened dreadfully tired but in an ecstasy of admiration above all it was a sight to see before one died and went away to another world well but being expelled ignominiously at the end of five days we had to come back to florence and find a new apartment cooler than the old and wait for dear mr kenyon and dear mr kenyon does not come not this autumn but he may perhaps at the first dawn of spring and on september 20 we take up our knapsacks and turn our faces towards rome i think creeping slowly along with a pause at arezzo and a longer pause at perugia and another perhaps at terni then we plan to take an apartment we have heard of over the tarpeian rock and enjoy rome as we have enjoyed florence more can scarcely be this florence is unspeakably beautiful by grace both of nature and art and the wheels of life slide on upon the grass according to continental ways with little trouble and less expense dinner unordered comes through the streets and spreads itself on our table as hot as if we had smelt cutlets hours before the science of material life is understood here and in france now tell me what right has england to be the dearest country in the world but i love dearly dear england and we hope to spend many a green summer in her yet the winters you will excuse us will you not people who are like us neither rich nor strong claim such excuses i am wonderfully well and far better and stronger than before what you call the pisan crisis robert declares that nobody would know me i look so much better and you heard from dearest henrietta ah both of my dearest sisters have been perfect to me no words can express my feelings towards their goodness otherwise i have good accounts from home of my fathers excellent health and spirits which is better even than to hear of his loving and missing me i had a few kind lines yesterday from miss martineau who invites us from florence to westmoreland she wants to talk to me she says of her beloved jordan she is looking forward to a winter of work by the lakes and to a summer of gardening the kindest of letters robert has had from carlyle who makes us very happy by what he says of our marriage shakespeares favorite air of the light of love with the full evidence of its being shakespeares favorite air is given in charles knights edition seek for it there now do write to me and at length and tell me everything of yourself flush hated vallombrosa and was frightened out of his wits by the pine forests flush likes civilised life and the society of little dogs with turnedup tails such as florence abounds with unhappily it abounds also with fleas which afflict poor flush to the verge sometimes of despair fancy robert and me down on our knees combing him with a basin of water on one side he suffers to such a degree from fleas that i cannot bear to witness it he tears off his pretty curls through the irritation do you know of a remedy direct to me poste restante florence put via france let me hear do and everything of yourself mind is mrs partridge in better spirits do you read any new french books dearest friend let me offer you my husbands cordial regards with the love of your own affectionate  ebb ba  footnote 163 mr horne was just engaged to be married  footnote 164 tennysons princess had just been published   to mr westwood florence september 1847  yes indeed my dear mr westwood i have seen friars we have been on a pilgrimage to vallombrosa and while my husband rode up and down the precipitous mountain paths i and my maid and flush were dragged in a hamper by two white bullocksand such scenery such hilly peaks such black ravines and gurgling waters and rocks and forests above and below and at last such a monastery and such friars who wouldnt let us stay with them beyond five days for fear of corrupting the fraternity the monks had a new abbot a st sejanus of a holy man and a petticoat stank in his nostrils said he and all the i beseeching which we could offer him with joined hands was classed with the temptations of st anthony so we had to come away as we went and get the better as we could of our disappointment and really it was a disappointment not to be able to stay our two months out in the wilderness as we had planned it to say nothing of the heat of florence to which at the moment it was not pleasant to return but we got new lodgings in the shade and comforted ourselves as well as we could comfortedtheres a word for florencethat ingratitude was a slip of the pen believe me only we had set our hearts upon a two months seclusion in the deep of the pine forests which have such a strange dialect in the silence they speak with and the mountains were divine and it was provoking to be crossed in our ambitions by that little holy abbot with the red face and to be driven out of eden even to florence it is said observe that milton took his description of paradise from vallombrosaso driven out of eden we were literally to florence though and what florence is the tongue of man or poet may easily fail to describe the most beautiful of cities with the golden arno shot through the breast of her like an arrow and non dolet all the same for what helps to charm here is the innocent gaiety of the people who for ever at feast day and holiday celebrations come and go along the streets the women in elegant dresses and with glittering fans shining away every thought of northern cares and taxes such as make people grave in england no little orphan on a house step but seems to inherit naturally his slice of watermelon and bunch of purple grapes and the rich fraternise with the poor as we are unaccustomed to see them listening to the same music and walking in the same gardens and looking at the same raphaels even also we were glad to be here just now when there is new animation and energy given to italy by this new wonderful pope who is a great man and doing greatly i hope you give him your sympathies think how seldom the liberation of a people begins from the throne à fortiori from a papal throne which is so high and straight165 and the spark spreads here is even our grand duke conceding the civic guard166 and forgetting his austrian prejudices the world learns it is pleasant to observe  so well i am dear mr westwood and so happy after a years trial of the stuff of marriage happier than ever perhaps and the revolution is so complete that one has to learn to stand up straight and steadily like a landsman in a sailing ship before one can do any work with ones hand and brain  we have had a delightful letter from carlyle who loves my husband i am proud to say    footnote 165this country saving is a glorious thing   and if a common man achieved it well   say a rich man did excellent a king   that grows sublime a priest improbable   a pope ah there we stop and cannot bring   our faith up to the leap with historys bell    so heavy round the neck of italbeit   we fain would grant the possibility   for thy sake pio nono  casa guidi windows part i  footnote 166 the grant of a national guard was made by the grand duke of tuscany on september 4 1847 in defiance of the threat of austria to occupy any italian state in which such a concession was made to popular aspirations   to miss mitford florence october i 1847 postmark  ever dearest miss mitfordi am delighted to have your letter and lose little time in replying to it the lost letter meanwhile does not appear the moon has it to make more shine on these summer nights if still one may say summer now that september is deep and that we are cool as people hoped to be when at hottest do tell me your full thought of the commonwealth of women168 i begin by agreeing with you as to his implied underestimate of women his women are too voluptuous however of the most refined voluptuousness his gardeners daughter for instance is just a rose and a rose one might beg all poets to observe is as precisely sensual as fricasseed chicken or even boiled beef and carrots did you read mrs butlers year of consolation and how did you think of it in the main as to mr homes illustrations of national music i dont know i feel a little jealous of his doing well what many inferior men have done wellmen who couldnt write orion and the death of marlowe now dearest dear miss mitford you shall call him tiresome if you like because i never heard him talk and he may be tiresome for aught i know of course but you shant say that he has not done some fine things in poetry now you know what the first book of orion is and marlowe and cosmo and you shant say that you dont know it and that when you forgot it for a moment i did not remind you it was our plan to leave florence on the 21st we stay however one month longer half through temptation half through reason which is strongest who knows we quite love florence and have delightful rooms and then though i am quite well now as to my general health it is thought better for me to travel a month hence so i suppose we shall stay in the meanwhile our florentines kept the anniversary of our wedding day and the establishment of the civic guard most gloriously a day or two or three ago forty thousand persons flocking out of the neighbourhood to help the expression of public sympathy and overflowing the city the procession passed under our eyes into the piazza pitti where the grand duke and all his family stood at the palace window melting into tears to receive the thanks of his people the joy and exultation on all sides were most affecting to look upon grave men kissed one another and grateful young women lifted up their children to the level of their own smiles and the children themselves mixed their shrill little vivas with the shouts of the people at once a more frenetic gladness and a more innocent manifestation of gladness were never witnessed during three hours and a half the procession wound on past our windows and every inch of every house seemed alive with gazers all that time the white handkerchiefs fluttering like doves and clouds of flowers and laurel leaves floating down on the heads of those who passed banners too with inscriptions to suit the popular feelinglibertythe union of italythe memory of the martyrsviva pio nonoviva leopoldo secondowere quite stirred with the breath of the shouters i am glad to have seen that sight and to be in italy at this moment when such sights are to be seen167 my wrist aches a little even now with the waving i gave to my handkerchief i assure you for robert and i and flush sate the whole sight out at the window and would not be reserved with the tribute of our sympathy flush had his two front paws over the window sill with his ears hanging down but he confessed at last that he thought they were rather long about it particularly as it had nothing to do with dinner and chicken bones and subjects of consequence he is less tormented and looks better in excellent spirits and appetite alwaysand thinner like your flushand very fond of robert as indeed he ought to be on the famous evening of that famous day i have been speaking of we lost himhe ran away and stayed away all nightwhich was too bad considering that it was our anniversary besides and that he had no right to spoil it but i imagine he was bewildered with the crowd and the illumination only as he did look so very guilty and conscious of evil on his return theres room for suspecting him of having been very much amused motu proprio as our grand duke says in the edict he was found at nine oclock in the morning at the door of our apartment waiting to be let inmind i dont mean the grand duke very few acquaintances have we made at florence and very quietly lived out our days mr powers the sculptor is our chief friend and favorite a most charming simple straightforward genial american as simple as the man of genius he has proved himself needs be he sometimes comes to talk and take coffee with us and we like him much his wife is an amiable woman and they have heaps of children from thirteen downwards all except the eldest boy florentines and the sculptor has eyes like a wild indians so black and full of light you would scarcely wonder if they clave the marble without the help of his hands we have seen besides the hoppners lord byrons friends at venice you will remember and miss boyle the niece of the earl of cork and authoress and poetess on her own account having been introduced once to robert in london at lady morgans has hunted us out and paid us a visit a very vivacious little person with sparkling talk enough lord holland has lent her mother and herself the famous careggi villa where lorenzo the magnificent died and they have been living there among the vines these four months these and a few american visitors are all we have seen at florence we live a far more solitary life than you do in your village and with the prestige of the country wrapping you round pray give your sympathies to our pope and call him a great man for liberty to spring from a throne is wonderful but from a papal throne is miraculous thats my doxy i suppose dear mr kenyon and mr chorley are still abroad french books i get at but at scarcely a new one which is very provoking at rome it may be better i have not read martin even since the first volume in england nor g sands lucretia  may god bless you think sometimes of your ever affectionate  ebb  footnote 167 in tennysons princess  footnote 168 a picture of the same scene in verse will be found in casa guidi windows part i    shall i say   what made my heart beat with exulting love   a few weeks back c  the month lengthened itself out and december found the brownings still in florence and definitely established there for the winter during this time although there is no allusion to it in the letters mrs browning must have been engaged in writing the first part of casa guidi windows with its hopeful aspirations for italian liberty it was indeed a time when hope seemed justifiable pius ix had ascended the papal thronethen a temporal as well as a spiritual sovereigntyin june 1846 with the reputation of being anxious to introduce liberal reforms and even to promote the formation of a united italy the english government was diplomatically advocating reform in spite of the opposition of austria and its representative lord minto who was sent on a special mission to italy to bring this influence to bear on the rulers of the various italian states was received with enthusiastic joy by the zealots for italian liberty the grand duke of tuscany as was noticed above had taken the first step in the direction of popular government by the institution of a national guard and charles albert of piedmont was always supposed to have the cause of italy at heart in spite of the vacillations of his policy the catastrophe of 1848 was still in the distance and for the moment a friend of freedom and of italy might be permitted to hope much  yet a difference will be noticed between the tone of mrs brownings letters at this time and that which marks her language in 1859 in 1847 she was still comparatively new to the country she is interested in the experiment which she sees enacted before her she feels as any poet must feel the attraction of the idea of a free and united italy but her heart is not thrown into the struggle as it was at a later time she can write and does for the most part write of other matters the disappointment of milan and novara could not break her heart as the disappointment of villafranca went near to doing they are not indeed so much as mentioned in detail in the letters that follow it is in casa guidi windowsthe first part written in 18478 the second in 1851that her reflections upon italian politics alike in their hopes and in their failures must be sought   to miss mitford florence december 8 1847  have you thought me long my dearest miss mitford in writing when your letter came we were distracted by various uncertainties torn by wild horses of sundry speculations and then when one begins by delay in answering a letter you are aware how a silence grows and grows also i heard of you through my sisters and mrs duprey and that made me lazier still now dont treat me according to the jewish law an eye for an eye no but a heart for a heart if you please and you never can have reason to reproach mine for not loving you think what we have done since i wrote last to you taken two houses that is two apartments each for six months presigning the contract you will set it down as excellent poets work in the way of domestic economy but the fault was altogether mine as usual and my husband to please me took rooms which i could not be pleased by three days through the absence of sunshine and warmth the consequence was that we had to pay heaps of guineas away for leave to go away ourselves any alternative being preferable to a return of illness and i am sure i should have been ill if we had persisted in staying there you can scarcely fancy the wonderful difference which the sun makes in italy oh he isnt a mere round o in the air in this italy i assure you he makes us feel that he rules the day to all intents and purposes so away we came into the blaze of him here in the piazza pitti precisely opposite the grand dukes palace i with my remorse and poor robert without a single reproach any other man a little lower than the angels would have stamped and sworn a little for the mere relief of the thing but as to his being angry with me for any cause except not eating enough dinner the said sun would turn the wrong way first so here we are on the pitti till april in small rooms yellow with sunshine from morning to evening and most days i am able to get out into the piazza and walk up and down for some twenty minutes without feeling a shadow of breath from the actual winter also it is pleasant to be close to the raffaels to say nothing of the immense advantage of the festa days when day after day the civic guard comes to show the whole population of florence their grand duke inclusive the new helmets and epaulettes and the glory thereof they have swords too i believe somewhere the crowds come and come like children to see rows of dolls only the children would tire sooner than the tuscans robert said musingly the other morning as we stood at the window surely after all this they would use those muskets its a problem a grand peutêtre i was rather amused by hearing lately that our civic heroes had the gallantry to propose to the ancient military that these last should do the night work ie when nobody was looking on and there was no credit as they found it dull and fatiguing ah one laughs you see one cant help it now and then but at the real and rising feeling of the people by night and day one doesnt laugh indeed i hear and see with the deepest sympathy of soul on the contrary i love the italians too and none the less that something of the triviality and innocent vanity of children abounds in them a delightful and most welcome letter was the last you sent me my dearest friend your bridal visit must have charmed you and i am glad you had the gladness of witnessing some of the happiness of your friend mrs acton tyndal you who have such quick sympathies and to whom the happiness of a friend is a gain counted in your own the swans shadow is something in a clear water for poor mrs if she is really as you say mrs tyndal thinks pining in an access of literary despondency why that only proves to me that she is not happy otherwise that her life and soul are not sufficiently filled for her womans need i cannot believe of any woman that she can think of fame first a woman of genius may be absorbed indeed in the exercise of an active power engrossed in the charges of the course and the combat but this is altogether different to a vain and bitter longing for prizes and what prizes oh gracious heavens the empty cup of cold metal so cold so empty to a woman with a heart so if your friends belief is true still more deeply do i pity that other friend who is supposed to be unhappy from such a cause a few days ago i saw a bride of my own family mrs reynolds arlette butler who married captain reynolds some five months since many were her exclamations at seeing me she declared that such a change was never seen i was so transfigured with my betterness oh ba it is quite wonderful indeed we had been calculated on during her three months in rome as a piece of resistance and it was a disappointment to find us here in a corner with the salt just as i was praised was poor flush criticised flush has not recovered from the effects yet of the summer plague of fleas and his curls though growing are not grown i never saw him in such spirits nor so ugly and though robert and i flatter ourselves upon the sensible improvement arlette could only see him with reference to the past when in his wimpole street days he was sleek and over fat and she cried aloud at the loss of his beauty then we have had another visitor mr hillard an american critic who reviewed me in the old world and so came to view me in the new a very intelligent man of a good noble spirit and miss boyle ever and anon comes at night at nine oclock to catch us at our hot chestnuts and mulled wine and warm her feet at our fire and a kinder more cordial little creature full of talent and accomplishment never had the worlds polish on it very amusing too she is and original and a good deal of laughing she and robert make between them did i tell you of her before and how she is the niece of lord cork and poetess by grace of certain irish muses neither of us know her writings in any way but we like her and for the best reasons and this is nearly all i think we see of the face divine masculine and feminine and i cant make robert go out a single evening not even to a concert nor to hear a play of alfieris yet we fill up our days with books and music and a little writing has its share and wonder at the clock for galloping its twentyfour oclock with us almost as soon as we begin to count do tell me of tennysons book and of miss martineaus i was grieved to hear a distant murmur of a rumour of an apprehension of a return of her complaint somebody said that she could not bear the pressure of dress and that the exhaustion resulting from the fits of absorption in work and enthusiasm on the new subject of egypt was painfully great and that her friends feared for her i should think that the bodily excitement and fatigue of her late travels must have been highly hazardous and that indeed throughout her convalescence she should have more spared herself in climbing hills and walking and riding distances a strain obviously might undo everything still i do hope that the bitter cup may not be filled for her again what a wonderful discovery this substitute for ether inhalations169 seems to be do you hear anything of its operation in your neighbourhood we have had a letter from mr horne who appears happy and speaks of his success in lecturing on ireland and of a new novel which he is about to publish in a separate form after having printed it in a magazine we have not set up the types even of our plans about a book very distinctly but we shall do something some day and you shall hear of it the evening before being too happy doesnt agree with literary activity quite as well as i should have thought and then dear mr kenyon cant persuade us that we are not rich enough so as to bring into force a lower order of motives he talks of rome still now write dear dearest miss mitford and tell me of yourself and your health and do do love me as you used to do as to french books one may swear but you cant get a new publication except by accident at this excellent celebrated library of vieusseux and i am reduced to read some of my favorites over again i and robert together you ought to hear how we go to single combat ever and anon with shield and lance the greatest quarrel we have had since our marriage by the way always excepting my crying conjugal wrong of not eating enough was brought up by massons pamphlet on the iron mask and fouquet i wouldnt be persuaded that fouquet was in it and so the anger of my lord waxed hot to this day he says sometimes dont be cross ba fouquet wasnt the iron mask after all  god bless you dearest miss mitford your ever affectionate ebb  we are here till april  footnote 169 chloroform then beginning to come into use   to mrs jameson florence december 1847  indeed my dear friend you have a right to complain of me whether or not we had any in thinking ourselves deeply injured creatures by your last silence yet when in your letter which came at last you said write directly i meant to write directly i did not take out my vengeance in a foregone malice be very sure just at the time we were in a hard knot of uncertainties about rome and venice and florence and a cold house and a warm house for instance we managed that is i did for altogether it was my fault to take two apartments in the course of ten days each for a term of six months getting out of one of them by leaving the skirts of our garments rent literally in the hand of the proprietor you have heard most of this i dare say from mr kenyon or my sisters now too you are aware of our being in piazza pitti in a charmed circle of sun blaze our rooms are small but of course as cheerful as being under the very eyelids of the sun must make everything and we have a cook in the house who takes the office of traiteur on him and gives us english mutton chops at florentine prices both of us quite well and in spirits and though you never will believe this happier than ever for my own part you know i need not say a word if it were not true and i must say to you who saw the beginning with us that this end of fifteen months is just fifteen times better and brighter the mystical moon growing larger and larger till scarcely room is left for any stars at all the only differences which have touched me being the more and more happiness it would have been worse than unreasonable if in marrying i had expected one quarter of such happiness and indeed i did not to do myself justice and every now and then i look round in astonishment and thankfulness together yet with a sort of horror seeing that this is not heaven after all we live just as we did when you knew us just as shutup a life robert never goes anywhere except to take a walk with flush which isnt my fault as you may imagine he has not been out one evening of the fifteen months but what with music and books and writing and talking we scarcely know how the days go its such a gallop on the grass we are going through some of old sacchettis novelets now characteristic work for florence if somewhat dull elsewhere boccaccios cant be expected to spring up with the vines in rows even in this climate we got a newly printed addition to savonarolas poems the other day very flat and cold they did not catch fire when he was burnt the most poetic thing in the book is his face on the first page with that eager devouring soul in the eyes of it you may suppose that i am able sometimes to go over to the gallery and adore the raphaels and robert will tell you of the divine apollino which you missed seeing in poggio imperiale and which i shall be set face to face before some day soon i hope  father prout was in florence for some two hours in passing to rome and of course according to contract of spirits of the air robert met him and heard a great deal of you and geddie saw geddies picture by the way and thought it very like was told much to the advantage of mr macpherson170 and at the end of all kissed in the open street as the speaker was about to disappear in the diligence when you write tell me of the book surely it will be out anon and then you will be free shall you not have you seen tennysons new poem and what of it miss martineau is to discourse about egypt i suppose but in the meanwhile do you hear that she forswears mesmerism as mr spenser hall does according to the report robert brings me home from the newspaper reading now i shall leave him room to stand on and speak a word to you give my love to gerardine and dont forget to mention her letter i hope you are happy about your friends and that in particular lady byrons health is strengthening and to strengthen always my dear friends  most affectionate ebb  dear aunt ninaa corner is just the place for eating christmas pies in but for venting christmas wishes hardly what has ba told you and wished you in the way of love i wish you the same and love you the same but geddie being part of you gets her due part we are as happy as two owls in a hole two toads under a tree stump or any other queer two poking creatures that we let live after the fashion of their black hearts only ba is fat and rosy yes indeed florence is empty and pleasant goodbye therefore till next yearshall it not be then we meet god bless you rb  footnote 170 miss bates fiancé   to miss mitford florence february 22 1848  your letter my dearest friend which was written a part at least before christmas came lingering in long after the new year had seen out its matins oh i had wondered so and wished so over the long silence my fault perhaps in a measure for i know how silent i was before yes and you tell me of your having been unwell bad news and of your dear flushs death which made me sorrowful for you as i might reasonably be and now tell me more have you a successor to him once you told me that one of the race was in training but as you say nothing now i am all in a doubt let me hear everything if i had been you i think i should have preferred some quite other kind of dog as the unlikeness of a likeness would be apt to bring a pain to me but people cant reason about feelings and feelings are like the colour of eyes not the same in different faces however general may be the proximity of noses the great subject with everybody just now is the new hope of italy and the liberal constitution given nobly by our good excellent grand duke whose praise is in all the houses streets and piazzas the other evening the evening after the gift he went privately to the opera was recognised and in a burst of triumph and a glory of waxen torches was brought back to the pitti by the people i was undressing to go to bed had my hair down over my shoulders under wilsons ministry when robert called me to look out of the window and see through the dark night a great flock of stars seemed sweeping up the piazza but not in silence nor with very heavenly noises the evvivas were deafening so glad i was i too stood at the window and clapped my hands if ever grand duke deserved benediction this duke does we hear that he was quite moved overpowered and wept like a child nevertheless the most of italy is under the cloud and god knows how all may end as the thunder ripens now i mustnt i suppose write politics our plans about england are afloat impossible to know what we shall do but if not this summer the summer after must help us to the sight of some beloved faces it will be a midsummer dream and we shall return to winter in italy my flush is as well as ever and perhaps gayer than ever i knew him he runs out in the piazza whenever he pleases and plays with the dogs when they are pretty enough and wags his tail at the sentinels and civic guard and takes the grand duke as a sort of neighbour of his whom it is proper enough to patronise but who has considerably less inherent merit and dignity than the spotted spaniel in the alley to the left we have been reading over again andré and leone leoni171 and robert is in an enthusiasm about the first happy person you are to get so at new books blessed is the man who reads balzac or even dumas i have got to admire dumas doubly since that fight and scramble for his brains in paris now do think of me and love me and let me be as ever your affectionate  ba  roberts regards always say particularly how you are and may god bless you dearest miss mitford and make you happy  footnote 171 novels by george sand   to miss mitford florence april 15 1848   my flush has recovered his beauty and is in more vivacious spirits than i remember to have seen him still the days come when he will have no pleasure and plenty of fleas poor dog for savonarolas martyrdom here in florence is scarcely worse than flushs in the summer which doesnt prevent his enjoying the spring though and just now when by medical command i drive out two hours every day his delight is to occupy the seat in the carriage opposite to robert and me and look disdainfully on all the little dogs who walk afoot we drive day by day through the lovely cascine where the trees have finished and spread their webs of full greenery undimmed by the sun yet first sweeping through the city past such a window where bianca capello looked out to see the duke go by172 and past such a door where lapo stood and past the famous stone where dante drew his chair out to sit173 strange to have all that oldworld life about us and the blue sky so bright besides and ever so much talk on our lips about the new french revolution and the king of prussias cunning and the fuss in germany and elsewhere not to speak of our own particular troubles and triumphs in lombardy close by the english are flying from florence by the way in a helter skelter just as they always do fly except to do them justice on a field of battle the family englishman is a dreadful coward be it admitted frankly see how they run from france even to my dear excellent uncle hedley who has too many little girls in his household to stay longer at tours oh i dont blame him exactly i only wish that he had waited a little longer the time necessary for being quite reassured he has great stakes in the countrya house at tours and in paris and twenty thousand pounds in the rouen railway but florence will fall upon her feet we may all be certain let the worst happen that can meanwhile republicans as i and my husband are by profession we very anxiously anxiously even to pain look on the work being attempted and done just now by the theorists in paris far from half approving of it we are and far from being absolutely confident of the durability of the other half tell me what you think and if you are not anxious too as to communism surely the practical part of that the only not dangerous part is attainable simply by the consent of individuals who may try the experiment of associating their families in order to the cheaper employment of the means of life and successfully in many cases but make a government scheme of even so much and you seem to trench on the individual liberty all such patriarchal planning in a government issues naturally into absolutism and is adapted to states of society more or less barbaric liberty and civilisation when married together lawfully rather evolve individuality than tend to generalisation is this not true i fear i fear that mad theories promising the impossible may in turn make the people mad i louis blanc knows not what he says have i not mentioned to you a very gifted woman a sculptress mademoiselle de fauveau who lives in florence with her mother practising her profession an exile from france in consequence of their royalist opinions and participation in the vendée struggle some sixteen or fifteen years on that occasion she was mistaken for and allowed herself to be arrested as madame de la roche jacquelin therefore she has justified by suffering in the cause her passionate attachment to it a most interesting person she is she called upon us a short time ago and interested us much and mrs jameson would tell you that her celebrity in her art is not comparative for a woman but that since benvenuto cellini more beautiful works of the kind have not been accomplished an exquisite fountain she has lately done for the emperor of russia she has workmen under her and is as professional in every respect as if neither woman nor noble at the first throb of this revolution of course she dreamt the impossible about that dear henri cinq who is as much out of the question as henri quatre himself and now it ends with the french legation coming to settle in the house precisely opposite to hers with a hideous signpainting appended o the gallic cock on one leg and at full crow inscribed liberté egalité fraternité this and the death of her favorite dog whom after seventeen years affection she was forced to have destroyed on account of a combination of diseases has quite saddened the sculptress when she came to see us i observed that after so long a residence at florence she must regard it as a second country ah non the answer was il ny a pas de seconde patrie what you tell me of jane eyre makes me long to see the book i may long i fancy it is dismal to have to disappoint my dearest sisters who hoped for me in england this summer but our english visit must be for next summer instead there seems too much against it just now the drawback of italy is the distance from england if it were but as near as paris for instance why in that case we should settle here at once i do think the conveniences and luxuries of life are of such incredible cheapness the climate so divine and the way of things altogether so serene and suited to our tastes and instincts but to give up england and the english the dear dearest treasure of english love is impossible so we just linger and linger the boyles go to england from the press of panic lady boyle being old and infirm ah but your talking friend would interest you and you might accept the talk in infinitesimal doses you know lamartine has surely acted down the fallacy of the impractical tendencies of imaginative men i am full of france just now are you all prepared for an outbreak in ireland i hope so my husband has the second edition of his collected poems174 in the press by this time by grace of chapman and hall who accept all risks you speak of tennysons vexation about the reception of the princess why did mr harness and others who never could understand his former divine works praise this in manuscript till the poets hope grew to the height of his ambition strangely unfortunate we have not read it yet i hear that tennyson had the other day everything packed for italy then turned his face toward ireland and went there oh for a talk with you but this is a sort of talk isnt it accept my husbands regards as to my love i throw it to you over the sea with both hands god bless you  your ever affectionate ba  footnote 172 see brownings the statue and the bust  footnote 173 the stone called dantesa plain flat stone scarce discerned from others in the pavementwhereupon he used to bring his quiet chair out turned to brunelleschis church and pour alone the lava of his spirit when it burned casa guidi windows part i  footnote 174 this edition published in 1849 in two volumes contained only paracelsus and the plays and poems of the bells and pomegranates series   to john kenyan florence may i 1848  my dearest mr kenyonsurely it is quite wrong that we three robert you and i should be satisfied with writing little dry notes as short as so many proclamations and those of the order of your antichartist magistracy whereas certain evil disposed persons c c instead of our antiaustrian grand duchys o figli amati how characteristic of the north and the south to be sure is this contrast yet after all they might have managed it rather better in englandlittle dry notes brief and businesslike as an antichartist proclamation and indeed two of us are by no means satisfied whatever the third may be the other day we were looking over some of the dear delightful letters you used to write to us real letters those were and not little dry notes at all robert said when i write to dear mr kenyon i really do feel overcome by the sense of what i owe to him and so as it is beyond words to say why generally i say as little as possible of anything keeping myself to matters of business an alternative very objectionable i told him for to have a dumb devil from ever such grateful and sentimental reasons when the alps stand betwixt friend is damnatory in the extreme then as you are not too grateful to us why dont you write pray do my dear friend let us all write as we used to do and to make sure of it i begin  since i ended last the world has turned over on its other side in order one must hope to some happy change in the dream our friend miss bayley in that very kind letter which has just reached me and shall be answered directly will you tell her with my thankful love asks if robert and i are communists and then half draws back her question into a discreet reflection that i at least was never much celebrated for acumen on political economy most true indeed and therefore and on that very ground is it not the more creditable to me that i dont set up for a communist immediately in proportion to the ignorance might be the stringency of the embrace of la vérité sociale so i claim a little credit that it isnt for really we are not communists farther than to admit the wisdom of voluntary association in matters of material life among the poorer classes and to legislate even on such points seems as objectionable as possible all intermeddlings of government with domesticities from lacedaemon to peru were and must be objectionable and of the growth of absolutism let us theorise as we choose i would have the government educate the people absolutely and then give room for the individual to develop himself into life freely nothing can be more hateful to me than this communist idea of quenching individualities in the mass as if the hope of the world did not always consist in the eliciting of the individual man from the background of the masses in the evolvement of individual genius virtue magnanimity do you know how i love france and the french robert laughs at me for the mania of it or used to laugh long before this revolution when i was a prisoner my other mania for imaginative literature used to be ministered to through the prison bars by balzac george sand and the like immortal improprieties they kept the colour in my life to some degree and did good service in their time to me i can assure you though in dear discreet england women oughtnt to confess to such reading i believe or you told me so yourself one day well but through reading the books i grew to love france in a mania too and the interest which all must feel in the late occurrences there has been with me and is quite painful i read the newspapers as i never did in my life and hope and fear in paroxysms yes and am guilty of thinking far more of paris than of lombardy itself and try to understand financial difficulties and social theories with the best will in the world much as flush tries to understand me when i tell him that barking and jumping may be unseasonable things both of us open our eyes a good deal but the comprehension is questionable after all what however i do seem least of all to comprehend is your hymn of triumph in england just because you have a lower ideal of liberty than the french people have see if in louis philippes time france was not in many respects more advanced than england is now property better divided hereditary privilege abolished are we to blow with the trumpet because we respect the ruts while everywhere else they are mending the roads i do not comprehend as to the chartists it is only a pity in my mind that you have not more of them thats their fault mine you will say is being pert about politics when you would rather have anything else in a letter from italy you have heard of my illness and will have been sorry for me i am certain but with blessings edging me round i need not catch at a thistle in the hedge to make a sorrowful complaignte of our plans have floated round and round in and out of all the bays and creeks of the happy islands  meanwhile here we areand when do you mean to come to see us pray mind i hold by the skirts of the vision for next winter why surely you wont talk of disturbances and revolutions and the like disloyal reasons which send our brave countrymen flying on all sides as if every separate individual expected to be bombarded per se now mind you come dear dear mr kenyon how delighted past expression we should be to see you ah do you fancy that i have no regret for our delightful gossips if i have the feeling i told you of for balzac and george sand what must i have for you now come and let us see you and still sooner if you please write to usand write of yourself and in detailand tell us particularly first if the winter has left no sign of a cough with you and next what you mean by something which suggests to my fancy that you have a book in the course of printing is that true tell me all about itall who can be interested pray if i am not for your and mr chorleys and mr forsters kind dealings with roberts poems i thank you gratefully and as a third volume can bring up the rear quickly in the case of success i make no wailing for my luria however dear it may be175  illustration casa guidi from a photograph  you are not to fancy that i am unwell now on the contrary i am nearly as strong as ever and go out in the carriage for two hours every day besides a little walk sometimes not a word more today writedoand you shall hear from us at length robert sends his own love i suppose we both love you from our hearts  your ever affectionate and grateful ba who cant read over and writes in such a hurry  it was about this time as appears from the following letter that the brownings finally anchored themselves in florence by taking an unfurnished suite of rooms in the palazzo guidi and making there a home for themselves here in the via maggio almost opposite the pitti palace and within easy distance of the ponte vecchio is the dwelling known to all lovers of english poetry as casa guidi and bearing now upon its walls the name of the english poetess whose life and writings formed in the graceful words of the italian poet a golden ring between italy and england whatever might be their migrationsand they were many especially in later yearscasa guidi was henceforth their home176  footnote 175 apparently it had been proposed to omit luria from the new edition but if so the intention was not carried out  footnote 176 it will interest many readers to know that casa guidi is now the property of mr r barrett browning   to miss mitford may 28 1848   and now i must tell you what we have done since i wrote last little thinking of doing so you see our problem was to get to england as much in our summers as possible the expense of the intermediate journeys making it difficult of solution on examination of the whole case it appeared manifest that we were throwing money into the like to hear you talk of poor france how i hope that you are able to hope for her oh this absurdity of communism and mythological fêteism where can it end they had better have kept louis philippe after all if they are no more practical your madame must be insufferable indeed seeing that her knowledge of these subjects and men did not make her sufferable to you my curiosity never is exhausted what i hold is that the french have a higher ideal than we and that all this clambering leaping struggling of indefinite awkwardness simply proves it but success in the republic is different still i fear for them my uncle and his family are safe at tunbridge wells my aunt longing to be able to get back again for those who are still nearer to me i have no heart to speak of them loving them as i do and must to the end whatever that end may be but my dearest sisters write often to menever let me miss their affection i am quite well again and strong and robert and i go out after tea in a wandering walk to sit in the loggia and look at the perseus or better still at the divine sunsets on the arno turning it to pure gold under the bridges after more than twenty months of marriage we are happier than everi may say we italy will regenerate herself in all senses i hope and believe in florence we are very quiet and the english fly in proportion nbalways first fly the majors and gallant captains unless theres a general how i should like to see dear mr hornes poem hes bold at leastyes and has a great heart to be bold with a cloud has fallen on me some few weeks ago in the illness and death of my dear friend mr boyd177 but he did not suffer and is not to be mourned by those without hope sic still it has been a cloud may god bless you my beloved friend write soon and of yourself to your ever affectionate  ba  my husbands regards go to you of course  footnote 177 mr boyd died on may 10 1848   to miss browning florence about june 1848  my dearest sariannaat last you see i give sign of life the love i hope you believed in without sign or symbol and even for the rest robert promised to answer for me like godfather or godmother and bear the consequence of my sins  we are a little uneasy just now as to whether you will be overjoyed or under joyed by our new scheme of taking an unfurnished apartment it would spoil all for instance if your dear mother seemed disappointedvexedin the least degree and i can understand how to persons at a distance and of course unable to understand the whole circumstances of the case the fact of an apartment taken and furnished may seem to involve some dreadful giving up for ever and ever of country and familywhich would be as dreadful to us as to you how could we give you up do you think when we love you more and more oh no if robert has succeeded in making clear the subject to you you will all perceive just as we know that we have simply thus solved the problem of making our small income carry us to england not only next summer but many a summer after we should like to give every summer to dear england and hide away from the cold only when it comes by our scheme we shall have saved money even at the end of the present year while for afterward heres a residencethat is apied à terrein italy all but free when we wish to use it and when we care to let it producing eight or ten pounds a month in help of travelling expenses its the best investment for mr moxons money we could have looked the world over for so the learned tell us and after all you know we only pay in the proportion of your working classes in the pancras building contrived for them by the philanthropy of your southwood smiths i do wish you could see what rooms we have what ceilings what height and breadth what a double terrace for orange trees how cool how likely to be warm how perfect every way robert leaned once to a ground floor in the frescobaldi palace being bewitched by a garden full of camellias and a little pond of gold and silver fish but while he saw the fish i saw the mosquitos in clouds such an apocalypse of them as has not yet been visible to me in all florence and i dread mosquitos more than austrians and he in his unspeakable goodness deferred to my fear in a moment and gave up the camellias without one look behind a heavy conscience i should have if it were not that the camellia garden was certainly less private than our terrace here where we can have camellias also if we please how pretty and pleasant your cottage at windsor must be we had a long muse over your fathers sketch of it and set faces at the windows that the dear invalid is better for the change must have brightened it too to her companions and the very sound of a forest is something peculiarly delightful and untried to me i know hills well and of the sea too much but now i want forests or quite quite mountains such as you have not in england  robert says that if blackwood likes to print a poem of mine and send you the proofs you will be so very good as to like to correct them to me it seems too much to ask when you have work for him to do beside will it be too much or is nothing so to your kindness i would ask my other sisters who would gladly dear things do it for me but i have misgivings through their being so entirely unaccustomed to occupations of the sort or any critical reading of poetry of any sort robert is quite well and in the best spirits and has the headache now only very occasionally i am as well as he having quite recovered my strength and power of walking so we wander to the bridge of trinità every evening after tea to see the sunset on the arno may god bless you all give my true love to your father and mother and my loving thanks to yourself for that last stitch in the stool how good you are sarianna to your ever affectionate sister  ba  always remind your dear mother that we are no more bound here than when in furnished lodgings it is a mere name   to mrs martin palazzo guidi june 20 1848  my dearest mrs martinnow i am going to answer your letter which i all but lost and got ever so many days beyond the right day because you directed it to mrs william browning pray remember robert browning for the future in right descent from robert brunnyng178 the first english poet mrs jameson says its ominous of the actual roberts being the last english poet a saying which i give you to remember us by rejecting the omen we have grown to be florentine citizens as perhaps you have heard health and means both forbade our settlement in england and the journey backwards and forwards being another sort of expense and very necessary with our ties and affections we had to think how to live here when we were here at the cheapest the difference between taking a furnished apartment and an unfurnished one is something immense for our furnished rooms we have had always to pay some four guineas a month and unfurnished rooms of equal pretension we could have for twelve a year and the furniture out and out for fifty pounds this calculation together with the consideration that we could let our apartment whenever we travelled and receive back the whole cost could not choose of course but determine us on coming to the point however we grew ambitious and preferred giving fiveandtwenty guineas for a noble suite of rooms in the palazzo guidi a stones throw from the pitti and furnishing them after our own taste rather than after our economy the economy having a legitimate share of respect notwithstanding and the satisfactory thing being that the whole expense of this furnishingrococo chairs spring sofas carved bookcases satin from cardinals beds and the restis covered by the proceeds of our books during the last two winters this is satisfying isnt it we shall stand safe within the borders of our narrow income even this year and next year comes the harvest we shall go to england in the spring and return home to italy do you understand mr kenyon our friend and counsellor writes to applaudsuch prudence was never known before among poets then we have a plan that when the summer this summer grows too hot we shall just take up our carpetbag and wilson and plunge into the mountains in search of the monasteries beyond vallombrosa from arezzo go to st sepolchro in the apennines and thence to fano on the seashore making a round back perhaps after seeing the great fair at sinigaglia to ravenna and bologna home as to rome our plan is to give up rome next winter seeing that we must go to england in the spring i must see my dearest sisters and whoever else dear will see me and robert must see his family beside and going to rome will take us too far from the route and cost too much and then we are not inclined to give the firstfruits of our new apartment to strangers if we could let it ever so easily this year you cant think how well the rooms look already you must come and see them you and dear mr martin three immense rooms we have and a fourth small one for a book room and winter roomwindows opening on a little terrace eight windows to the south two good bedrooms behind with a smaller terrace and kitchen c all on a first floor and count guidis favorite suite the guidi were connected by marriage with the ugolino of pisa dantes ugolino only we shun all traditions of the tower of famine and promise to give you excellent coffee whenever you will come to give us the opportunity we shall have vines and myrtles and orange trees on the terrace and i shall have a wateringpot and garden just as you do though it must be on the bricks instead of the ground for temperature the stoves are said to be very effective in the winter and in the summer we are cool and airy the advantage of these thickwalled palazzos is coolness in summer and warmth in winter i am very well and quite strong again or rather stronger than ever and able to walk as far as cellinis perseus in the moonlight evenings on the other side of the arno oh that arno in the sunset with the moon and evening star standing by how divine it is  think of me as ever your most affectionate ba  footnote 178 otherwise known as robert mannyng or robert de brunne author of the handlyng synne and a chronicle of england he flourished about 12881338   to miss mitford florence july 4 1848  it does grieve me my ever dearest miss mitford to hear of the suffering which has fallen upon you oh rheumatism or not whatever the name may be do take care do consider and turn your dear face toward the seaside somewhere where you can have warm sea bathing and sea air and be able to associate the word a drive not with mad ponies but the mildest of donkeys on a flat sand the good it would do you is incalculable i am certain it is precisely a case for change of air with quiet  as for when you come to florence we wont have a pony carriage between us if you please because we may have a carriage and a pair of horses and a coachman and pay as little as for the ponychair in england for three hundred a year one may live much like the grand duchess and go to the opera in the evening at fivepencehalfpenny inclusive indeed poor people should have their patriotism tenderly dealt with when after certain experiments they decide on living upon the whole on the continent the differences are past belief beyond expectation and when the sunshine is thrown in the head turns at once and you fall straight into absenteeism ah for the long chats and the having england at one anothers fireside you talk of delightful things indeed we are very quiet politically speaking and though we hear now and then of melancholy mothers who have to part with their sons for lombardy179 and though there are processions for the blessing of flags and an occasional firing of guns for a victory or a cry in the streets notizie della guerraleggete signori this is all we know of radetsky in florence while for civil politics the meeting of the senate took place a few days since to the satisfaction of everybody and the grand dukes speech was generally admired the elections have returned moderate men and many landproprietors and robert who went out to see the procession of members was struck by the grave thoughtful faces and the dignity of expression we are going some day to hear the debates but it has pleased their signoria to fix upon twelve noon for meeting and really i do not dare to go out in the sun the hour is sufficiently conclusive against dangerous enthusiasm poor france poor france news of the dreadful massacre at paris just reaches us and the letters and newspapers not arriving today everybody fears a continuation of the crisis how is it to end who despairs of the republic why i do i fear i fear that it cannot stand in france and you seem to have not much more hope my husband has a little with melancholy intermediate prospects but my own belief that the people have had enough of democratic institutions and will be impatient for a kingship anew whom will they have how did you feel when the cry was raised vive lempereur only prince napoleon is a napoleon cut out in paper after all the prince de joinville is said to be very popular it makes me giddy to think of the awful precipices which surround franceto think too that the great danger is on the question of property which is perhaps divided there more justly than in any other country of europe lamartine has comprehended nothing that is clear even if his amount of energy had been effectual yes do send me the list of balzac after les misères de la vie conjugale i mean i left him in the midst of la femme de soixante ans who seemed on the point of turning the heads of all la jeunesse around her and after all she did not strike me as so charming but balzac charms me let him write what he will hes an inspired man tell me too exactly what sue has done after martin i read only one volume of martin and did poor soulié finish his dramas and after lucretia what did george sand write when robert and i are ambitious we talk of buying balzac in full some day to put him up in our bookcase from the convent if the carvedwood angels infants and serpents should not finish mouldering away in horror at the touch of him but i fear it will rather be an expensive purchase even here would that he gave up the drama for which as you observe he has no faculty whatever in fact the faculty he has is the very reverse of the dramatic ordinarily understood dearest mr kenyon is called quite well and delightful by the whole world though he suffered from cough in the winter and he is bringing out a new book of poems a day at tivoli and others and he talks energetically of coming to florence this autumn also we have hopes of mr chorley i congratulate you on the going away of madame coming and going bring very various associations in this life of ours why if you were to come we should appreciate our fortune and you should have my particular chair which robert calls mine because i like sitting in a cloud its so sybaritically soft a chair now i love you for the kind words you say of him who deserves the best words of the best women and men wherever spoken yes indeed i am happy otherwise i should have a stone where the heart is and sink by the weight of it you must have faith in me for i never can make you thoroughly to understand what he is of himself and to methe noblest and perfectest of human beings after a year and ten months absolute soultosoul intercourse and union i have to look higher still for my first ideal you wont blame me for bad taste that i say these things for can i help it when i am writing my heart to you it is a heart which runs over very often with a grateful joy for a most peculiar destiny even in the midst of some bitter drawbacks which i need not allude to farther  may god bless you continually even as i am  your affectionate ba  footnote 179 the insurrection of lombardy against austrian rule had taken place in march and was immediately followed by war between sardinia and austria in which the italians gained some initial successes fighting continued through the summer and was temporarily closed by an armistice in august   to mrs jameson palazzo guidi july 15 1848  now at last my very dear friend i am writing to you and the reproach you sent to me in your letter shall not be driven inwardly any more by my selfreproaches wasnt it your fault after all a little that we did not hear one anothers voice oftener you are so long in writing then i have been putting off and putting off my letter to you just because i wanted to make a full letter of it and robert always says that its the bane of a correspondence to make a full letter a condition of writing at all but so much i had to tell you while the mere outline of facts you had from others i knew which is just said that you may forgive us both and believe that we think of you and love you yes and talk of you even when we dont write to you and that we shall write to you for the future more regularly indeed your letter notwithstanding its reproach was very welcome and very kind only you must be fagged with the book and saddened by lady byrons state of health and anxious about gerardine perhaps the best of all was the prospect you hold out to us of coming to italy this year do do come delighted we shall be to see you in florence and wise it will be in you to cast behind your back both the fear of radetsky and as much english care as may be now would it not do infinite good to lady byron if you could carry her with you into the sun surely it would do her great good the change the calm the atmosphere of beauty and brightness which harmonises so wonderfully with every shade of human feeling florence just now and thanks to the panic is tolerably clean of the englishyou scarcely see an english face anywhereand perhaps this was a circumstance that helped to give robert courage to take our apartment here and settle down you were surprised at so decided a step i dare say and i believe though too considerate to say it in your letter you have wondered in your thoughts at our fixing at florence instead of rome and without seeing more of italy before the finality of making a choice but observe florence is wonderfully cheap one lives here for just nothing and the convenience in respect to england letters and the facility of letting our house in our absence is incomparable altogether at rome a house would be habitable only half the year and the distance and the expense are objections at the first sight of the subject altogether if i could but get a supply of french books turning the cock easily it would be perfect but as to anything new in the book way vieusseux seems to have made a vow against it and poor robert comes and goes in a state of desperation between me and the bookseller but what can i do ba and only brings news of some pitiful revolution or other which promises a full flush of republican virtues and falls off into the fleur de lis as usual think of our not having read lucretia yetgeorge sands and balzac is six or seven works deep from us but these are evils to be borne we live on just in the same way having very few visitors and receiving them in the quietest of hospitalities mr ware the american who wrote the letters from palmyra and is a delightful earnest simple person comes to have coffee with us once or twice a week and very much we like him mr hillard another cultivated american friend of ours you have in london and we should gladly have kept longer mr powers does not spend himself much upon visiting which is quite right but we do hope to see a good deal of mademoiselle de fauveau robert exceedingly admires her as to italian society one may as well take to longing for the evening star for it seems quite as inaccessible and indeed of society of any sort we have not much nor wish for it nor miss it dearest friend if i could open my heart to you in all seriousness you would see nothing there but a sort of enduring wonder of happinessyes and some gratitude i do hope besides could everything be well in england i should only have to melt out of the body at once in the joy and the glow of it happier and happier i have been month after month and when i hear him talk of being happy too my very soul seems to swim round with feelings which cannot be spoken but i tell you a little because i owe the telling to you and also that you may set down in your philosophy the possibility of bookmaking creatures living happily together i admit though to begin or end that my husband is an exceptional human being and that it wouldnt be just to measure another by him we are planning a great deal of enjoyment in this going to the fair at sinigaglia meaning to go by arezzo and san sepolchro and urbino to fano where we shall pitch our tent for the benefit as robert says of the sea air and the oysters fano is very habitable and we may get to pesaro and the footsteps of castigliones courtier to say nothing of bernardo tasso and ancona beckons from the other side of sinigaglia and loreto beside only we shall have to restrain our flights a little the passage of the apennine is said to be magnificent and altogether surely it must be delightful and we take only two carpet bagsnot to be weighed down by impedimenta and have our own home left in charge of the porter to return to at last i am very well and shall be better for the change though robert is dreadfully afraid as usual that i shall fall to pieces at the first motion  may god bless you ever i am your affectionate ba  write to florence as usualposte restante you will hear how we are in great hopes of dear mr kenyon  dear aunt ninaonly a word in all the hurry of setting off we love you as you love us and are pretty nearly as happy as you would have us all love and prosperity to dear geddie too what do you say of landor and my not sending it to forster or somebody che che as the tuscans exclaim who was it promised to call at my peoples who would have tendered it forthwith i will see about it as it is goodbye dearest aunt and let no revolution disturb your good will to ba and  rb   to miss mitford florence august 24 1848  ever dearest miss mitfordits great comfort to have your letter for as it came more lingeringly than usual i had time to be a little anxious and even my husband has confessed since that he thought what he would not say aloud for fear of paining me as to the probability of your being less well than usual your letters come so regularly to the hour you see that when it strikes without them we ask why thank god you are better after all and reviving in spirits as i saw at the first glance before the words said it clearly  as for ourselves we have scarcely done so well yet well having enjoyed a great deal in spite of drawbacks murray the traitor sent us to fano as a delightful summer residence for an english family and we found it uninhabitable from the heat vegetation scorched with paleness the very air swooning in the sun and the gloomy looks of the inhabitants sufficiently corroborative of their words that no drop of rain or dew ever falls there during the summer a circulating library which doesnt give out books and a refined and intellectual italian society i quote murray for that phrase which never reads a book through i quote mrs wiseman dr wisemans mother who has lived in fano seven years complete the advantages of the place yet the churches are beautiful and a divine picture of guercinos is worth going all that way to see180 by a happy accident we fell in with mrs wiseman who having married her daughter to count gabrielli with ancestral possessions in fano has lived on there from year to year in a state of permanent moaning as far as i could apprehend she is a very intelligent and vivacious person and having been used to the best french society bears but ill this exile from the common civilities of life i wish dr wiseman of whose childhood and manhood she spoke with touching pride would ask her to minister to the domestic rites of his bishops palace in westminster there would be no hesitation i fancy in her acceptance of the invitation agreeable as she and her daughter were however we fled from fano after three days and finding ourselves cheated out of our dream of summer coolness resolved on substituting for it what the italians call un bel giro so we went to ancona a striking sea city holding up against the brown rocks and elbowing out the purple tides beautiful to look upon an exfoliation of the rock itself you would call the houses that seem to grow there so identical is the colour and character i should like to visit ancona again when there is a little air and shadow we stayed a week as it was living upon fish and cold water water water was the cry all day long and really you should have seen me or you should not have seen me lying on the sofa and demoralised out of all sense of female vanity not to say decency with dishevelled hair at full length and sans gown sans stays sans shoes sans everything except a petticoat and white dressing wrapper i said something feebly once about the waiter but i dont think i meant it for earnest for when robert said oh dont mind dear certainly i didnt mind in the least people dont i suppose when they are in ovens or in exhausted receivers never before did i guess what heat wasthats sure we went to loreto for a day back through ancona sinigaglia oh i forgot to tell you there was no fair this year at sinigaglia italy will be content i suppose with selling her honour fano pesaro rimini to ravenna back again over the apennines from forli a bel giro wasnt it ravenna where robert positively wanted to go to live once has itself put an end to those yearnings the churches are wonderful holding an atmosphere of purple glory and if one could live just in them or in dantes tombwell otherwise keep me from ravenna the very antiquity of the houses is whitewashed and the marshes on all sides send up stenches new and old till the hot air is sick with them to get to the pine forest which is exquisite you have to go a mile along the canal the exhalations pursuing you step for step and what ruffled me more than all beside we were not admitted into the house of dantes tomb without an especial permission from the authorities quite furious i was about this and both of us too angry to think of applying but we stood at the grated window and read the pathetic inscription as plainly as if we had touched the marble we stood there between three and four in the morning and then went straight on to florence from that tomb of the exiled poet just what we should have done had the circumstances been arranged in a dramatic intention from forli the air grew pure and quick again and the exquisite almost visionary scenery of the apennines the wonderful variety of shape and colour the sudden transitions and vital individuality of those mountains the chestnut forests dropping by their own weight into the deep ravines the rocks cloven and clawed by the living torrents and the hills hill above hill piling up their grand existences as if they did it themselves changing colour in the effortof these things i cannot give you any idea and if words could not painting could not either indeed the whole scenery of our journey except when we approached the coast was full of beauty the first time we crossed the apennine near borgo san sepolcro we did it by moonlight and the flesh was weak and one fell asleep and saw things between sleep and wake only the effects were grand and singular so even though of course we lost much in the distinctness well but you will understand from all this that we were delighted to get homei was i assure you florence seemed as cool as an oven after the fire indeed we called it quite cool and i took possession of my own chair and put up my feet on the cushions and was charmed both with having been so far and coming back so soon three weeks brought us home flush was a fellow traveller of course and enjoyed it in the most obviously amusing manner never was there so good a dog in a carriage before his time think of flush too he has a supreme contempt for trees and hills or anything of that kind and in the intervals of natural scenery he drew in his head from the window and didnt consider it worth looking at but when the population thickened and when a village or a town was to be passed through then his eyes were starting out of his head with eagerness he looked east he looked west you would conclude that he was taking notes or preparing them his eagerness to get into the carriage first used to amuse the italians ah poor italy i am as mortified as an italian ought to be they have only the rhetoric of patriots and soldiers i fear tuscany is to be spared forsooth if she lies still and here she lies eating ices and keeping the feast of the madonna perdoni but she has a review in the cascine besides and a gallant show of some ten thousand men they are said to have made of itonly dont think that i and robert went out to see that sight we should have sickened at it too much an amiable refined people too these tuscans are conciliating and affectionate when you look out into the streets on feast days you would take it for one great rout everybody appears dressed for a drawing room and you can scarcely discern the least difference between class and class from the grand duchess to the donna di facenda also there is no belying of the costume in the manners the most gracious and graceful courtesy and gentleness being apparent in the thickest crowds this is all attractive and delightful but the people wants stamina wants conscience wants selfreverence dantes soul has died out of the land enough of this as for france i have despaired of the republic for very long but the nation is a great nation and will right itself under some flag white or red dont you think so thank you for the news of our authors it is as the sound of a trumpet afar off and i am like the warhorse neglectful that i am i forgot to tell you before that you heard quite rightly about mr thackerays wife who is ill so since your question i had in gossip from england that the book jane eyre was written by a governess in his house and that the preface to the foreign edition refers to him in some marked way we have not seen the book at all but the first letter in which you mentioned your oxford student caught us in the midst of his work upon art181 very vivid very graphic full of sensibility but inconsequent in some of the reasoning it seemed to me and rather flashy than full in the metaphysics robert who knows a good deal about art to which knowledge i of course have no pretence could agree with him only by snatches and we both of us standing before a very expressive picture of domenichinos the davidat fano wondered how he could blaspheme so against a great artist still he is no ordinary man and for a critic to be so much a poet is a great thing also we have by no means i should imagine seen the utmost of his stature how kindly you speak to me of my dearest sisters yes go to see them whenever you are in london they are worthy of the gladness of receiving you and will you write soon to me and tell me everything of yourself how you are how home agrees with you and the little details which are such gold dust to absent friends  may god bless you my beloved friend let me ever be my husband joining in all warm regards your most affectionate  ba  footnote 180guercino drew this angel i saw teach   alfred dear friend that little child to pray   holding his little hands up each to each   pressed gently with his own head turned away   over the earth where so much lay before him   of work to do though heaven was opening oer him   and he was left at fano by the beach    we were at fano and three times we went   to sit and see him in his chapel there   and drink his beauty to our souls content   my angel with me too  footnote 181 the first two volumes of modern painters bore no authors name but were described as being by a graduate of oxford at a later date mrs browning made mr ruskins acquaintance as some subsequent letters testify   to miss mitford florence october 10 1848  my ever dearest miss mitfordhave you not thought some hard thoughts of me for not instantly replying to a letter which necessarily must have been to one who loved you of such painful interest do i not love you truly yes indeed but while preparing to write to you my deep regret at hearing that you had been so ill illness came in another form to prevent me from writing my husband being laid up for nearly a month with fever and ulcerated sore throat i had not the heart to write a line to anyone much less to prepare a packet to escort your letter free from foreign postage and to make you pay for a chapter of lamentations without the spirit of prophecy would have been too hard on you wouldnt it quite unhappy i have been over those burning hands and languid eyes the only unhappiness i ever had by them and then he wouldnt see a physician and if it hadnt been that just at the right moment mr mahony the celebrated jesuit and father prout of fraser knowing everything as those jesuits are apt to do came in to us on his way to rome pointed out that the fever got ahead through weakness and mixed up with his own kind hand a potion of eggs and port wine to the horror of our italian servant who lifted up his eyes at such a prescription for a fever crying o inglesi inglesi the case would have been far worse i have no kind of doubt for the eccentric prescription gave the power of sleeping and the pulse grew quieter directly i shall always be grateful to father prout always the very sight of some one with a friends name and a cheerful face his very jests at me for being a bambina and frightened without cause were as comforting as the salutation of angels also he has been in florence ever since and we have seen him every day he came to doctor and remained to talk a very singular person of whom the world tells a thousand and one tales you know but of whom i shall speak as i find him because the utmost kindness and warmheartedness have characterised his whole bearing towards us robert met him years ago at dinner at emerson tennents and since has crossed paths with him on various points of europe the first time i saw him was as he stood on a rock at leghorn at our disembarkation in italy not refined in a social sense by any manner of means yet a most accomplished scholar and vibrating all over with learned associations and vivid combinations of fancy and experiencehaving seen all the ends of the earth and the men thereof and possessing the art of talk and quotation to an amusing degree in another week or two he will be at rome how graphically you give us your oxford student well the picture is more distinct than turners and if you had called it in the manner of the master a rock limpet we should have recognised in it the corresponding type of the gifted and eccentric writer in question very eloquent he is i agree at once and true views he takes of art in the abstract true and elevating it is in the application of connective logic that he breaks away from one so violently we are expecting our books by an early vessel and are about to be very busy building up a rococo bookcase of carved angels and demons also we shall get up curtains and get down bedroom carpets and finish the remainder of our furnishing business now that the hot weather is at an end i say at an end though the glass stands at seventy as to the war that is rather different it is painful to feel ourselves growing gradually cooler and cooler on the subject of italian patriotism valour and good sense but the process is inevitable the childs play between the livornese and our grand duke provokes a thousand pleasantries every now and then a day is fixed for a revolution in tuscany but up to the present time a shower has come and put it off two sundays ago florence was to have been sacked by leghorn when a drizzle came and saved us you think this a bad joke of mine or an impotent sarcasm perhaps whereas i merely speak historically brave men good men even sensible men there are of course in the land but they are not strong enough for the times or for masterdom for france it is a great nation but even in france they want a man and cavaignacso182 only a soldier if louis napoleon had the muscle of his uncles little finger in his soul he would be president and king but he is flaccid altogether you see and joinville stands nearer to the royal probability after all henri cinq is said to be too closely espoused to the church and his connections at naples and parma dont help his cause robert has more hope of the republic than i have but call ye this a republic do you know that miss martineau takes up the history of england under charles knight in the continuation of a popular book i regret her fine imagination being so wasted so you saw mr chorley what a pleasant flashing in the eyes we hear of him in holland and norway dear mr kenyon wont stir from england we see plainly ah frederic soulié he is too dead i fear perhaps he goes on though writing romances after the fashion of poor miss pickering that prove nothing i long for my french fountains of living literature which pure or impure plashed in ones face so pleasantly some old french mémoires we have got at lately brienne for instance it is curious how the leaders of the last revolution under louis xviii seem to have despised one another brienne is very dull and flat for puseyism it runs counter to the spirit of our times after all and will never achieve a church may god bless you roberts regards go with the love of your ever affectionate  ba  footnote 182 at this time president of the council after suppressing the communist rising of june 1848   to mrs martin florence december 3 1848  my dearest mrs martinit seemed long to me that you had not written and it seems long to me now that i have not answered the kind letter which came at last then henrietta told me of your being unwell at the moment of her mad excursion into herefordshire altogether i want to speak to you and hear from you and shall be easier and gladder when both are done do forgive my sins and write directly and tell me everything about both of you and how you are in spirits and health and whether you really make up your minds to see more danger in the stormy influences of the continent in the moral point of view than in those of england in the physical for my part i hold to my original class of fear and would rather face two or three revolutions than an east wind of an english winter if i were you i would go to pau as usual and take poor abdelkaders place my husband is furious about the treatment of abdelkader so i hear a good deal about him183 or i would go to italy and try florence where really democratic ministries roar as gently as sucking doves particularly when they are safe in place we have listened to dreadful rumoursflorence was to have been sacked several times by the livornese the grand duke went so far as to send away his family to siena and we had morte a fiorentini chalked up on the walls still somehow or other the peace has been kept in florentine fashion it has rained once or twice which is always enough here to moderate the most revolutionary when they wear their best surtouts and i look forward to an unbroken tranquillity just as i used to do even though the windows of the ridolfi palace the ambassador in london were smashed the other evening a few yards from ours perhaps a gentle and affectionate approach to contempt for our florentines mixes a little with this feeling of security but what then they are an amiable refined graceful people with much of the artistic temperament as distinguished from that of men of geniuseffeminate no rather feminine in a better senseof a fancy easily turned into impulse but with no strenuous and determinate strength in them what they comprehend best in the italian league is probably a league to wear silk velvet and each a feather in his hat to carry flags and cry vivas and keep a grand festa day in the piazzas better and happier in this than in stabbing prime ministers or hanging up their dead bodies to shoot at and not much more childish than these french patriots and republicans who crown their great deeds by electing to the presidency such a man as prince louis napoleon simply because cest le neveu de son oncle184 a curious precedent for a president certainly but oh heavens and earth what curious things abroad everywhere just now inclusive of the sea serpent i agree with you that much of all is very melancholy and disheartening though holding fast by my hope and belief that good will be the end as it always is gods end to mans frenzies and that all we observe is but the fermentation necessary to the new wine which presently we shall drink pure meanwhile the saddest thing is the impossibility which i for one feel to sympathise to go along with the people to whom and to whose cause all my natural sympathies yearn the word liberty ceases to make me thrill as at something great and unmistakable as for instance the other great words truth and justice do the salt has lost its savour the meaning has escaped from the term we know nothing of what people will do when they aspire to liberty the holiness of liberty is desecrated by the sign of the asss hoof fixed principles either of opinion or action seem clearly gone out of the world the principle of destruction is in the place of the principle of reintegration or of radical reform as we called it in england i look all round and can sympathise nowhere the rulers hold by rottenness and the people leap into the abyss and nobody knows why this is or why that is as to france my tears which i really couldnt help at the time of the expulsion of poor louis philippe and his family not being very strong just then are justified it appears though my husband thought them foolish and so did i and though we both began by an adhesion to the republic in the cordial manner but just see the republic was a man in an iron mask or helmet and turns out a military dictatorship a throttling of the press a starving of the finances and an election of louis napoleon to be president louis philippe was better than all this take him at worst and at worst he did not deserve the mud and stones cast at him which i have always maintained and maintain still england might have got up happy country more crying grievances than france at the moment of outbreak but what makes outbreaks nowadays is not the cause my soul but the stuff of the people you are huckaback on the other side of the channel and you wear out the poor irish linen let the justice of the case be what it may politics enough and too much surely especially now when they are depressing to you and more or less to everybody we are still in the slow agonies of furnishing our apartment you see being the poorest and most prudent of possible poets we had to solve the problem of taking our furniture out of our years income proceeds of poems and the like and of not getting into debt oh i take no credit to myself i was always in debt in my little way small im morals as dr bowring might call it before i married but robert though a poet and dramatist by profession being descended from the blood of all the puritans and educated by the strictest of dissenters has a sort of horror about the dreadful fact of owing five shillings five days which i call quite morbid in its degree and extent and which is altogether unpoetical according to the traditions of the world so we have been dragging in by inches our chairs and tables throughout the summer and by no means look finished and furnished at this late moment the slow italians coming at the heels of our slowest intentions with the putting up of our curtains which begin to be necessary in this november tramontana yet in a month or three weeks we shall look quite comfortablebefore christmas and in the meantime we heap up the pine wood and feel perfectly warm with these thick palace walls between us and the outside air also my husbands new edition is on the edge of coming out and we have had an application from mr phelps of sadlers wells for leave to act his blot on the scutcheon which if it doesnt succeed its public can have neither hearts nor intellects that being an impartial opinion and which if it succeeds will be of pecuniary advantage to us look out in the papers my love and my husbands go to you our dear friends let me be always  your affectionate and grateful ba   while italy shows herself so politically demoralised and the blood of poor russia smokes from the ground the ground seems to care no more for it than the newspapers or anybody else  such a jar of flowers we have to keep december white roses as in june  footnote 183 abdelkader surrendered to the french in algeria early in 1848 under an express promise that he should be sent either to alexandria or to st jean dacre in spite of which he was sent to france and kept there as a prisoner for several years  footnote 184 louis napoleon was elected president of the french republic by a popular vote on december 10   to miss mitford florence december 16 1848   you are wondering perhaps how we are so foolhardy as to keep on furnishing rooms in the midst of anarchy the pope a fugitive and the crowned heads packing up ah but we have faith in the softness of our florentines who must be well spurred up to the leap before they do any harm these things look worse at a distance than they do near although seen far and near nothing can be worse than the evidence of demoralisation of people governors and journalists in the sympathy given everywhere to the assassination of poor rossi185 if rossi was retrocessive he was at least a constitutional minister and constitutional means of opposing him were open to all but italy understands nothing constitutional liberty is a fair word and a watchword nothing more an idea it is not in the minds of any the poor pope i deeply pity he is a weak man with the noblest and most disinterested intentions his faithful flock have nearly broken his heart by the murder of his two personal friends rossi and palma and the threat which they sent him by embassy of murdering every man woman and child in the quirinal with the exception of his holiness unless he accepted their terms he should have gone out to them and so died but having missed that opportunity nothing remained but flight he was a mere pope hostage as long as he stayed in rome curious the intervention of the french so long desired by the italians and vouchsafed so186 the florentines open their eyes in mute astonishment and some of them wont read the journals any more the boldest say softly that the romans are sure not to bear it and what is to happen in france why what a world we have just now father prout is gone to rome for a fortnight has stayed three weeks and day by day we expect him back again i dont understand how the prout papers should have hurt him ecclesiastically but that he should be known for their writer is not astonishing as the secret was never i believe attempted to be kept we have been at least i have been a little anxious lately about the fate of the blot on the scutcheon which mr phelps applied for my husbands permission to revive at sadlers of course putting the request was a mere form as he had every right to act the play and there was nothing to answer but one thing only it made one anxiousmade me anxioustill we heard the result and we both of us are very grateful to dear mr chorley who not only made it his business to be at the theatre the first night but before he slept sat down like a true friend to give us the story of the result and never he says was a more complete and legitimate success the play went straight to the heart of the audience it seems and we hear of its continuance on the stage from the papers so far so well you may remember or may not have heard how macready brought it out and put his foot on it in the flash of a quarrel between manager and author and phelps knowing the whole secret and feeling the power of the play determined on making a revival of it on his own theatre which was wise as the event proves mr chorley called his acting really fine i see the second edition of the poetical works advertised at last in the athenaeum and conclude it to be coming out directly also my second edition is called for only nothing is yet arranged on that point we have had a most interesting letter from mr home giving terrible accounts to be sure of the submersion of all literature in england and france since the french revolution but noble and instructive proof of individual waveriding energy such as i have always admired in him he and his wife he says live chiefly on the produce of their garden and keep a cheerful heart for the rest even the institutes expect gratuitous lectures so that the sweat of the brain seems less productive than the sweat of the brow i am glad that mr serjeant talfourd and his wife spoke affectionately of my husband for he is attached to both of them my flush has grown to be passionately fond of grapes devouring bunch after bunch and looking so fat and well that we attribute some virtue to them when he goes to england he will be as much in a strait as an italian who related to us his adventures in london he had had a long walk in the heat and catching sight of grapes hanging up in a grocers shop he stopped short to have a pennyworth as he said inwardly to himself down he sat and made out a tuscan luncheon in purple bunches at last taking out his purse to look for the halfpence fifteen shillings sir if you please said the shopman now do write soon and speak particularly of your health and take care of it and dont be too complaisant to visitors may god bless you my very dear friend think of me as  ever your affectionate and grateful ebb my husbands regards always  footnote 185 count pellegrino rossi chief minister to the pope was assassinated in rome at the entrance of the chamber of deputies on november 15 1848 ten days later the pope fled to gaeta and his experiments in reform came to a final end  footnote 186 the pope having declared war against

of his people     chapter vi  18491851  there is here a pause of two months in the correspondence of mrs browning during which the happiness of her already happy life was crowned by the birth on march 9 1849 of her son robert wiedeman barrett browning187 how great a part this child henceforward played in her life will be shown abundantly by the letters that follow some passages referring to the childs growth progress and performances have been omitted partly in the necessary reduction of the bulk of the correspondence and partly because too much of one subject may weary the reader but enough has been left to show that in the case of mrs browning and of her husband likewise the parent was by no means lost in the poet there is little in what she says which might not equally be said and is in substance said by hundreds of happy mothers in every age but it would be a suppression of one essential part of her nature and an injury to the pleasant picture which the whole life of this poet pair presents if her enthusiasms over her child were omitted or seriously curtailed biographers are fond of elaborating the details in which the lives of poets have not conformed to the standard of the moral virtues let us at least recognise that in the case of robert and elizabeth browning the moral and the intellectual virtues flourished side by side each contributing its share to the completeness of the whole character  footnote 187 wiedeman was the maiden name of mr brownings mother her father having been a german who settled in scotland and married a scotch wife  the joy of this firstborns birth was however very quickly dimmed by the news of the death only a few days later of mr brownings mother to whom he was devotedly attached her death was very sudden and the shock of the reaction completely prostrated him for a long time the following letters from mrs browning tell how he felt this loss   to miss browning april i 1849 postmark  i do indeed from the bottom of my heart pity you and grieve with you my dearest sarianna i may grieve with you as well as for you for i too have lost believe that though i never saw her face i loved that pure and tender spirit tender to me even at this distance and that she will be dear and sacred to me to the end of my own life  dearest sarianna i thank you for your consideration and admirable selfcontrol in writing those letters i do thank and bless you if the news had come unbroken by such precaution to my poor darling robert it would have nearly killed him i think as it is he has been able to cry from the first and i am able to tell you that though dreadfully affected of course for you know his passionate love for her he is better and calmer nowmuch better he and i dwell on the hope that you and your dear father will come to us at once comedear dear sariannai will at least love you as you deserveyou and himif i can do no more if you would comfort robert come  no day has passed since our marriage that he has not fondly talked of her i know how deep in his dear heart her memory lies god comfort you my dearest sarianna the blessing of blessed duties heroically fulfilled must be with you may the blessing of the blessed in heaven be added to the rest  robert stops me my dear love to your father  your ever attached sister ba   to miss browning april 1849  you will have comfort in hearing my dearest sarianna that robert is better on the whole than when i wrote last though still very much depressed i wish i could get him to go somewhere or do somethingat any rate gods comforts are falling like dew on all this affliction and must in time make it look a green memory to you both continually he thinks of you and of his fatherbelieve how continually and tenderly he thinks of you dearest sarianna i feel so in the quick of my heart how you must feel that i scarcely have courage to entreat you to go out and take the necessary air and exercise and yet that is a duty clear as other duties and to be discharged like others by you as fully and with as little shrinking of the will if your health should suffer what grief upon grief to those who grieve already and besides we who have to live are not to lie down under the burden there will be time enough for lying down presently very soon and in the meanwhile there is plenty of gods work to do with the body and with the soul and we have to do it as cheerfully as we can dearest sarianna you can look behind and before on blessed memories and holy hopeslove is as full for you as ever in the old relation even though her life in the world is cut off there is no drop of bitterness in all this flood of sorrow in the midst of the great anguish which god has given you have to thank him for some blessing with every pang as it comes never was a more beautiful serene assuring death than this we are all in tears forfor believe me my very dear sister i have mourned with you knowing what we all have lost i who never saw her nor shall see her until a few years shall bring us all together to the place where none mourn nor are parted sarianna will it not be possible do you think for you and your father to come here if only for a few months then you might decide on the future upon more knowledge than you have now it would be comfort and joy to robert and me if we could all of us live together henceforward think what you would like and how you would best like it your living on even through this summer at that house i who have well known the agony of such bindings to the rack do protest against dearest sarianna it is not good or right either for you or for your dear father for robert to go back to that house unless it were to do one of you some good think how it would be with him tell us now for he yearns towards youwe both do what is the best way of bringing us all together so as to do every one of us some good if florence is too far off is there any other place where we could meet and arrange for the future could not your dear fathers leave of absence be extended this summer out of consideration of what has happened and would he not be so enabled to travel with you and meet us somewhere we will do anything for my part i am full of anxiety and for robert you may guess what his is you who know him very bitter has it been to me to have interposed unconsciously as i have done and deprived him of her last words and kissesvery bitterand nothing could be so consolatory to me as to give him back to you at least so think for me dearest sariannathink for your father and yourself think for robertand remember that robert and i will do anything which shall appear possible to you may god bless you both of you give my true love to your father feeling for you and with you always and most tenderly i am your affectionate sister ba   to miss mitford florence april 30 1849  i am writing to you at last you will say ever dearest miss mitford but except once to wimpole street this is the first packet of letters which goes from me since my confinement you will have heard how our joy turned suddenly into deep sorrow by the death of my husbands mother an unsuspected disease ossification of the heart terminated in a fatal way and she lay in the insensibility precursive of the graves when the letter written in such gladness by my poor husband and announcing the birth of his child reached her address it would have made her heart bound said her daughter to us poor tender heart the last throb was too near the medical men would not allow the news to be communicated the next joy she felt was to be in heaven itself my husband has been in the deepest anguish and indeed except for the courageous consideration of his sister who wrote two letters of preparation saying that she was not well and she was very ill when in fact all was over i am frightened to think what the result would have been to him he has loved his mother as such passionate natures only can love and i never saw a man so bowed down in an extremity of sorrownever even now the depression is great and sometimes when i leave him alone a little and return to the room i find him in tears i do earnestly wish to change the scene and air but where to go england looks terrible now he says it would break his heart to see his mothers roses over the wall and the place where she used to lay her scissors and gloves which i understand so thoroughly that i cant say let us go to england we must wait and see what his father and sister will choose to do or choose us to do for of course a duty plainly seen would draw us anywhere my own dearest sisters will be painfully disappointed by any change of plan only they are too good and kind not to understand the difficulty not to see the motive so do you i am certain it has been very very painful altogether this drawing together of life and death robert was too enraptured at my safety and with his little son and the sudden reaction was terrible you see how natural that was how kind of you to write that note to him full of affectionate expressions towards me thank you dearest friend he had begged my sisters to let you know of my welfare and i hope they did and now it is my turn to know of you and so i do entreat you not to delay but to let me hear exactly how you are and what your plans are for the summer do you think of paris seriously am i not a sceptic about your voyages round the world its about the only thing that i dont thoroughly believe you can do but not to be impertinent i want to hear so much i want first and chiefly to hear of your health and occupations next and next your plans for the summer louis napoleon is astonishing the world you see by his firmness and courage and though really i dont make out the aim and end of his french republicans in going to rome to extinguish the republic there i wait before i swear at him for it till my information becomes fuller if they have at rome such a republic as we have had in florence without a public imposed by a few bawlers and brawlers on many mutes and cowards why the sooner it goes to pieces the better of course probably the french government acts upon information in any case if the romans are in earnest they may resist eight thousand men1 we shall see my faith in every species of italian is however nearly tired out i dont believe they are men at all much less heroes and patriots since i wrote last to you i think we have had two revolutions here at florence grand duke out grand duke in188 the bells in the church opposite rang for both they first planted a tree of liberty close to our door and then they pulled it down the same tune sung under the windows did for viva la republica and viva leopoldo the genuine popular feeling is certainly for the grand duke o santissima madre di dio said our nurse clasping her hands how the people do love him only nobody would run the risk of a pins prick to save the ducal throne if the leghornese who put up guerazzi on its ruins had not refused to pay at certain florentine cafés we shouldnt have had revolution the second and all this shooting in the street dr harding who was coming to see me had time to get behind a stable door just before there was a fall against it of four shot corpses and robert barely managed to get home across the bridges he had been out walking in the city apprehending nothing when the storm gathered and broke sad and humiliating it all has been and the author of vanity fair might turn it to better uses for a chapter by the way we have just been reading vanity fair very clever very effective but cruel to human nature a painful book and not the pain that purifies and exalts partial truths after all and those not wholesome but i certainly had no idea that mr thackeray had intellectual force for such a book the power is considerable for balzac balzac may have gone out of the world as far as we are concerned isnt it hard on us exiles from balzac the bookseller here having despaired of the republic and the grand duchy both i suppose and taking for granted on the whole that the world must be coming shortly to an end doesnt give us the sign of a new book we ought to be done with such vanities there and almost i have done my paper without a single word to you of the baby ah you wont believe that i forgot him even if i pretend so i wont he is a lovely fat strong child with double chins and rosy cheeks and a great wide chest undeniable lungs i can assure you dr harding called him a robust child the other day and a more beautiful child he never saw i never saw a child half as beautiful for my part dear mr chorley has written the kindest letter to my husband i much regard him indeed may god bless you let me ever be with roberts thanks and warm remembrance  your most affectionate ba  flushs jealousy of the baby would amuse you for a whole fortnight he fell into deep melancholy and was proof against all attentions lavished on him now he begins to be consoled a little and even condescends to patronise the cradle  footnote 1 as they did until the 8000 had been increased to 35000  footnote 188 a revolution fomented chiefly by the leghornese expelled the grand duke in march 1849 about seven weeks later a counterrevolution chiefly by the peasantry recalled him   to miss browning florence may 2 1849  robert gives me this blank and three minutes to write across it thank you my very dear sarianna for all your kindness and affection i understand what i have lost i know the worth of a tenderness such as you speak of and i feel that for the sake of my love for robert she was ready out of the fullness of her heart to love me also it has been bitter to me that i have unconsciously deprived him of the personal facetoface shining out of her angelic nature for more than two years but she has forgiven me and we shall all meet when it pleases god before his throne in the meanwhile my dearest sarianna we are thinking much of you and neither of us can bear the thought of your living on where you are if you could imagine the relief it would be to usto me as well as to robertto be told frankly what we ought to do where we ought to go to please you bestyou and your dearest fatheryou would think the whole matter over and use plain words in the speaking of it robert naturally shrinks from the idea of going to new cross under the circumstances of dreary change and for his sake england has grown suddenly to me a land of clouds still to see you and his father and to be some little comfort to you both would be the best consolation to him i am very sure and so dearest sarianna think of us and speak to us could not your father get a long vacation could we not meet somewhere think how we best may comfort ourselves by comforting you never think of us sarianna as apart from youas if our interest or our pleasure could be apart from yours the child is so like robert that i can believe in the other likeness and may the inner nature indeed as you say be after that pure image he is so fat and rosy and strong that almost i am sceptical of his being my child i suppose he is after all may god bless you both of you i am ashamed to send all these letters but robert makes me he is better but still much depressed sometimes and over your letters he drops heavy tears then he treasures them up and reads them again and again better however on the whole he is certainly poor little babe who was too much rejoiced over at first fell away by a most natural recoil even i felt it to be most natural from all that triumph but robert is still very fond of him and goes to see him bathed every morning and walks up and down on the terrace with him in his arms if your dear father can toss and rock babies as robert can he will be a nurse in great favour  dearest sarianna take care of yourself and do walk out no grief in the world was ever freer from the corroding drop of bitternesswas ever sweeter holier and more hopeful than this of yours must be love is for you on both sides of the grave and the blossoms of love meet over it may gods love too bless you  your ever affectionate sister ba   to mrs martin florence may 14 1849  my dearest mrs martinat last i come to thank you for all your kindness all your goodness all your sympathy for both of us robert would have written to you in the first instance for we both thought of you if we had not agreed that you would hear as quickly from henrietta we not knowing your direct address also your welcome little note should have had an immediate acknowledgment from him if he had not been so depressed at that time that i was glad to ask him to wait till i should be ready to write myself in fact he has suffered most acutely from the affliction you have since of course heard of and just because he was too happy when the child was born the pain was overwhelming afterwards that is easy to understand i think while he was full of joy for the child his mother was dying at a distance and the very thought of accepting that new affection for the old became a thing to recoil fromdo you not see so far from suffering less through the particular combination of circumstances as some people seemed to fancy he would he suffered much more i am certain and very naturally even now he is looking very unwellthinner and paler than usual and his spirits which used to be so good have not rallied i long to get him away from florence somewherewhere i cant fix my wishes our english plans seem flat on the ground for the present that is one sad certainty my dearest sisters will be very grieved if we dont go to england and yet how can i even try to persuade my husband back into the scene of old associations where he would feel so much pain do i not know what i myself should suffer in some places and he loved his mother with all his power of loving which is deeper and more passionate than love is with common men she hearts of men are generally strong in proportion to their heads well i am not to send you such a dull letter though after waiting so long and after receiving so much to speak thankfully of my child you never would believe to be my child from the evidence of his immense cheeks and chinsfor pray dont suppose that he has only one chin people call him a lovely child and if i were to call him the same it wouldnt be very extraordinary only i assure you a robust child i may tell you that he is with a sufficient modesty and also that wilson says he is universally admired in various tongues when she and the nurse go out with him to the cascinewhat a beautiful baby and che bel bambino he has had a very stormy entrance upon life poor little fellow and when he was just three days old a grand festa round the liberty tree planted at our door attended with military music civic dancing and singing and the firing of cannons and guns from morning to night made him start in his cradle and threw my careful nurse into paroxysms of devotion before the vergine santissima that i mightnt have a fever in consequence since then the tree of liberty has come down with a crash and we have had another festa as noisy on that occasion revolution and counterrevolution guerazzi189 and leopold sacking of florence and entrance of the austrian armywe live through everything you see and baby grows fat indiscriminately for my part i am altogether blasée about revolutions and invasions dont think it want of feeling in me or want of sympathy with the people but really i cant help a certain political latitudinarianism from creeping over me in relation to this tuscany you ought to be here to understand what i mean and how i think oh heavens how ignoble it all has been and is a revolution made by boys and vivas and unmade by boys and vivasno there was blood shed in the unmakingsome horror and terror but not as much patriotism and truth as could lift up the blood from the kennel the counterrevolution was strictly counter observe i mean that if the leghornese troops here bad paid their debts at the florentine coffee houses the florentines would have let their beloved grand duke stay on at gaeta to the end of the world the grand duke too whose part i have been taking hitherto because he did seem to me a good man more sinned against than sinningthe grand duke i give up from henceforth seeing that he has done this base thing of taking again his austrian titles in his proclamations coincidently with the approach of the austrians of rome knowing nothing i dont like to speak if a republic in earnest is established there louis napoleon should not try to set his foot on it dearest mrs martin how you mistake me about france and how too lightly i must have spoken if you knew how i admire the french as a nation robert always calls them my beloved french their very faults appear to me to arise from an excess of ideality land aspiration but i was vexed rather at their selection of louis napoleona selection since justified by the firmness and apparent integrity of the man his reputation in england you will admit did not promise the conclusion will he be emperor do you imagine and shall i ever have done talking politics i would far rather talk of you after all henrietta tells me of your looking well but of your not being strong yet now do for once have a fit of egotism and tell me a little about yourself surely i ought especially to thank you dearest kind friend for your goodness in writing to of which henrietta very properly told me i never shall forget this and other proofs of your affection for me and shall remember them with warm gratitude always as to i have held out both my hands and my husbands hands in mine again and again to him he cannot possibly in the secret place of his heart expect more from either of us my husband would have written to him in the first place but for the obstacles raised by himself and others and now what could robert write and say except the bare repetition of what i have said over and over for him and myself it is exactly an excusenot more and not less just before i was ill i sent my last messages because with certain hazards before me my heart turned to them naturally i might as well have turned to a rockhas been by far the kindest and has written to me two or three little notes and one since the birth of our child i love them all far too well to be proud and my husband loves me too well not to wish to be friends with every one of them we have neither of us any stupid feeling about keeping up our dignity yes i had a letter fromsome time ago in which something was said of roberts being careless of reconciliation i answered it most explicitly and affectionately with every possible assurance from robert and offering them from himself the affection of a brother not a word in answer to my poor dearest papa i have written very lately and as my letter has not after a week been sent back i catch at the hope of his being moved a little if he neither sends it back nor replies severely i shall take courage to write to him again after a while it will be an immense gain to get him only to read my letters my father and my brothers hold quite different positions of course and though he has acted sternly towards me i knowing his peculiarities do not feel embittered and astonished and disappointed as in the other cases absolutely happy my marriage has beennever could there be a happier marriage as there are no marriages in heaven but dear henrietta is quite wrong in fancying or seeming to fancy that this quarrel with my family has given or gives me slight pain old affections are not so easily trodden out of me indeed and while i live unreconciled to them there must be a void and drawback do write to me and tell me of both of you my very dear friends dont fancy that we are not anxious for brave venice and sicily and that we dont hate this austrian invasion but tuscany has acted a vile part altogetherso vile that i am sceptical about the romans we expect daily the austrians in florence and have made up our minds to be very kind may god bless you do write and mention your health particularly as i am anxious about it i am quite well myself and as ever  your affectionate ba  dont you both like macaulays history we are delighted just now with it  footnote 189 chief administrator of the republic of tuscany during the short absence of the grand duke leopold   to miss browning florence about june 1849  i must say to my dearest sarianna how delighted we are at the thought of seeing her in florence i wish it had been before the autumn but since autumn is decided for we must be content to reap our golden harvest at the time for such things certainly the summer heat of florence is terrible enoughonly we should have carried you with us into the shade somewhere to the sea or to the mountainsand robert has of course told you of our spezzia plan the fatling of the flock has been sheared closely of his long petticoats did he tell you that and you cant think how funny the little creature looks without his train his wise baby face appearing to approve of the whole arrangement he talks to himself now and smiles at everybody and admired my roses so much the other day that he wanted to eat them having a sublime transcendental notion about the mouth being the receptacle of all beauty and glory in this world tell your dear father that certainly he is a sweet baby theres no denying it we lay him down on the floor to let him kick at ease and he makes violent efforts to get up by himself and wilson declares that the least encouragement would set him walking roberts nursing does not mend his spirits much i shall be very glad to get him away from florence he has suffered too much here to rally as i long to see him do because dearest sarianna we have to live after all and to live rightly we must turn our faces forward and press forward and not look backward morbidly for the footsteps in the dust of those beloved ones who travelled with us but yesterday they themselves are not behind but before and we carry with us our tenderness living and undiminished towards them to be completed when the round of this life is complete for us also dearest sarianna why do i say such things but because i have known what grief is oh and how i could have compounded with you grief for grief mine for yours for i had no last words nor gestures sarianna god keep you from such a helpless bitter agony as mine then was dear sarianna you will think of us and of florence my dear sister and remember how you have made us a promise and have to keep it may god bless you and comfort you we think of you and love you continually and i am always your most affectionate  ba   in july the move from florence of which mrs browning speaks in the above letter was effected the place ultimately chosen for escape from the summer heat in the valley of the arno being the bagni di lucca here three months were spent as the following letters describe by this time the struggle for italian liberty had ended in failure everywhere the battle of novara on march 23 had prostrated piedmont and caused the abdication of its king charles albert the tuscan republic had come and gone and the grand duke had reentered his capital under the protection of austrian bayonets sicily had been reduced to subjection to the bourbons of naples on july 2 the french entered rome bringing back the pope cured of his leanings to reform and constitutional government on the 24th venice after an heroic resistance capitulated to the austrians the struggle was over for the time the longing for liberty becomes of necessity silent and we hear little for a space of italian politics for the moment it might seem justifiable to despair of the republic   to miss mitford bagni di lucca toscana about july 1849  at last you will say dearest friend the truth is i have not been forgetting you how far from that but wandering in search of cool air and a cool bough among all the olive trees to build our summer nest on my husband has been suffering beyond what one could shut ones eyes to in consequence of the great mental shock of last marchloss of appetite loss of sleep looks quite worn and altered his spirits never rallied except with an effort and every letter from new cross threw him back into deep depressions i was very anxious and feared much that the end of it all the intense heat of florence assisting would be a nervous fever or something similar and i had the greatest difficulty in persuading him to leave florence for a month or twohe who generally delights so in travelling had no mind for change or movement i had to say and swear that baby and i couldnt bear the heat and that we must and would go away ce que femme veut if the latter is at all reasonable or the former persevering at last i gained the victory it was agreed that we two should go on an exploring journey to find out where we could have most shadow at least expense and we left our child with his nurse and wilson while we were absent we went along the coast to spezzia saw carrara with the white marble mountains passed through the olive forests and the vineyards avenues of acacia trees chestnut woods glorious surprises of most exquisite scenery i say olive forests advisedly the olive grows like a forest tree in those regions shading the ground with tents of silvery network the olive near florence is but a shrub in comparison and i have learnt to despise a little too the florentine vine which does not swing such portcullises of massive dewy green from one tree to another as along the whole road where we travelled beautiful indeed it was spezzia wheels the blue sea into the arms of the wooded mountains and we had a glance at shelleys house at lerici it was melancholy to me of course i was not sorry that the lodgings we inquired about were far above our means we returned on our steps after two days in the dirtiest of possible inns saw seravezza a village in the mountains where rock river and wood enticed us to stay and the inhabitants drove us off by their unreasonable prices it is curious but just in proportion to the want of civilisation the prices rise in italy if you havent cups and saucers you are made to pay for plate well so finding no rest for the sole of our feet i persuaded robert to go to the baths of lucca only to see them we were to proceed afterwards to san marcello or some safer wilderness we had both of us but he chiefly the strongest prejudice against these baths of lucca taking them for a sort of wasps nest of scandal and gaming and expecting to find everything trodden flat by the continental english yet i wanted to see the place because it is a place to see after all so we came and were so charmed by the exquisite beauty of the scenery by the coolness of the climate and the absence of our countrymen political troubles serving admirably our private requirements that we made an offer for rooms on the spot and returned to florence for baby and the rest of our establishment without further delay here we are then we have been here more than a fortnight we have taken an apartment for the seasonfour monthspaying twelve pounds for the whole term and hoping to be able to stay till the end of october the living is cheaper than even at florence so that there has been no extravagance in coming here in fact florence is scarcely tenable during the summer from the excessive heat by day and night even if there were no particular motive for leaving it we have taken a sort of eagles nest in this place the highest house of the highest of the three villages which are called the bagni di lucca and which lie at the heart of a hundred mountains sung to continually by a rushing mountain stream the sound of the river and of the cicala is all the noise we hear austrian drums and carriage wheels cannot vex us god be thanked for it the silence is full of joy and consolation i think my husbands spirits are better already and his appetite improved certainly little babes great cheeks are growing rosier and rosier he is out all day when the sun is not too strong and wilson will have it that he is prettier than the whole population of babies here he fixes his blue eyes on everybody and smiles universal benevolence rather too indiscriminately it might be if it were not for flush but certainly on the whole he prefers flush he pulls his ears and rides on him and flush though his dignity does not approve of being used as a pony only protests by turning his head round to kiss the little bare dimpled feet a merrier sweetertempered child there cant be than our baby and people wonder at his being so forward at four months old and think there must be a mistake in his age he is so strong that when i put out two fingers and he has seized them in his fists he can draw himself up on his feet but we discourage this forwardness which is not desirable say the learned children of friends of mine at ten months and a year cant do so much is it not curious that my child should be remarkable for strength and fatness he has a beaming thinking little face too oh i wish you could see it then my own strength has wonderfully improved just as my medical friends prophesied and it seems like a dream when i find myself able to climb the hills with robert and help him to lose himself in the forests i have been growing stronger and stronger and where it is to stop i cant tell really i can do as much or more now than at any point of my life since i arrived at womans estate the air of this place seems to penetrate the heart and not the lungs only it draws you raises you excites you mountain air without its keenness sheathed in italian sunshine think what that must be and the beauty and the solitudefor with a few paces we get free of the habitations of menall is delightful to me what is peculiarly beautiful and wonderful is the variety of the shapes of the mountains they are a multitude and yet there is no likeness none except where the golden mist comes and transfigures them into one glory for the rest the mountain there wrapt in the chestnut forest is not like that bare peak which tilts against the sky nor like that serpent twine of another which seems to move and coil in the moving coiling shadow oh i wish you were here you would enjoy the shade of the chestnut trees and the sound of the waterfalls and at nights seem to be living among the stars the fireflies are so thick you would like that too we have subscribed to a french library where there are scarcely any new books i have read bernards gentilhomme campagnard see how arriérés we are in french literature and thought it the dullest and worst of his books i wish i could see the memoirs of louis napoleon but there is no chance of such good fortune all this egotism has been written with a heart full of thoughts of you and anxieties for you do write to me directly and say first how your precious health is and then that you have ceased to suffer pain for your friends but your dear self chieflyhow are you my dearest miss mitford i do long so for good news of you on our arrival here mr lever called on us a most cordial vivacious manner a glowing countenance with the animal spirits somewhat predominant over the intellect yet the intellect by no means in default you cant help being surprised into being pleased with him whatever your previous inclination may be natural too and a gentleman past mistake his eldest daughter is nearly grown up and his youngest six months old he has children of every sort of intermediate age almost but he himself is young enough still not the slightest irish accent he seems to have spent nearly his whole life on the continent and by no means to be tired of it ah dearest miss mitford hearts feel differently adjust themselves differently before the prick of sorrow and i confess i agree with robert there are places stained with the blood of my heart for ever and where i could not bear to stand again if duty called him to new cross it would be otherwise but his sister is rather inclined to come to us i think for a few weeks in the autumn perhaps only these are scarcely times for plans concerning foreign travel it is something to talk of it has been a great disappointment to me the not going to england this year but i could not run the risk of the bitter pain to him may god bless you from all pain love me and write to me who am ever and ever your affectionate ebb   to mrs jameson bagni di lucca august 11 1849  i thank you dearest friend for your most affectionate and welcome letter would seem to come by instinct and we have thanked you in our thoughts long before this moment when i begin at last to write some of them do believe that to value your affection and to love you back again are parts of our life and that it must be always delightful to us to read in your handwriting or to hear in your voice that we are not exiled from your life give us such an assurance whenever you can shall we not have it face to face at florence when the booksellers let you go and meantime there is the post do write to us did you ever see this place i wonder the coolness the charm of the mountains whose very heart you seem to hear beating in the rush of the little river the green silence of the chestnut forests and the seclusion which anyone may make for himself by keeping clear of the valleyvillages all these things drew us we took a delightful apartment over the heads of the whole world in the highest house of the bagni caldi where only the donkeys and the portantini can penetrate and where we sit at the open windows and hear nothing but the cicale not a mosquito think of that the thermometer ranges from sixtyeight to seventyfour but the seventyfour has been a rare excess the nights mornings and evenings are exquisitely cool robert and i go out and lose ourselves in the woods and mountains and sit by the waterfalls on the starry and moonlit nights and neither by night nor day have the fear of picnics before our eyes we were observing the other day that we never met anybody except a monk girt with a rope now and then or a barefooted peasant the sight of a pink parasol never startles us into unpleasant theories of comparative anatomy one cause perhaps may be that on account of political matters it is a delightfully bad season but also we are too high for the ordinary walkers who keep to the valley and the flatter roads robert is better looking better and in more healthy spirits and we are both enjoying this great sea of mountains and our way of life here altogether of course we remembered to go back to florence for baby and the rest of our little establishment and we mean to stay as long as we can perhaps to the end of october baby is in the triumph of health and fullblown roses and as he does not hide himself in the woods like his ancestors but smiles at everybody he is the most popular of possible babies we had him baptised before we left florence without godfathers and godmothers in the simplicities of the french lutheran church i gave him your kiss as a precious promise that you would love him one day like a true dear aunt nina and i promise you on my part that he shall be taught to understand both the happiness and the honour of it robert is expecting a visit from his sister in the course of this autumn she has suffered much and the change will be good for her even if as she says she can stay with us only a few weeks with her we shall have your book to be disinherited of which so long has been hard on us roberts own we have not seen yet it must be satisfactory to you to have had such a clear triumph after all the dust and toil of the way and now tell me wont it be necessary for you to come again to italy for what remains to be done poor florence is quiet enough under the heel of austria and leopold lintrepido as he was happily called by a poet of viareggio in a welcoming burst of inspiration sits undisturbed at the pitti i despair of the republic in italy or rather of italy altogether the instructed are not patriotic and the patriots are not instructed we want not only a man but men and we must throw i fear the bones of their race behind us before the true deliverers can spring up still it is not all over there will be deliverance presently but it will not be now we are full of painful sympathy for poor venice there why write more about politics it makes us sick enough to think of austrians in our florence without writing the thought out into greater expansion only dont let the times newspaper persuade you that there is no stepping with impunity out of england  we have lectures on shakespeare just now by a mr stuart who is enlightening the english barbarians at the lower village and quoting mrs jameson to make his discourse more brilliant we like to hear mrs jameson observes give our love to dear gerardine i am anxious for her happiness and yours involved in it love and remember us dearest friend  your ebb or rather ba   the following note is added in mr brownings handwriting  dear aunt ninawill there be three years before i see you again and geddie does she not come to italy when we passed through pisa the other day we went to your old inn in love of you and got your very room to dine in the landlord is dead and gone as is peverudaof the other house you remember there were the old vile prints the old lookout into the garden with its orange trees and painted sentinel watching them ba must have told you about our babe and the little else there is to tellthat is for her to tell for she is not likely to encroach upon my story which i could tell of her entirely angel nature as divine a heart as god ever made i know more of her every day i who thought i knew something of her five years ago i think i know you too so i love you and am  ever yours and dear geddies rb   to miss mitford bagni di lucca august 31 1849  i told mr lever what you thought of him dearest friend and then he said all in a glow and animation that you were not only his own delight but the delight of his children which is affection by refraction isnt it quite gratified he seemed by the hold of your good opinion not only is he the notability par excellence of these baths of lucca where he has lived a whole year during the snows upon the mountains but he presides over the weekly balls at the casino where the english do congregate all except robert and me and is said to be the light of the flambeaux and the spring of the dancers there is a general desolation when he will retire to play whist in addition to which he really seems to be loving and loveable in his family you always see him with his children and his wife he drives her and her baby up and down along the only carriageable road of lucca so set down that piece of domestic life on the bright side in the broad charge against married authors now do i believe he is to return to florence this winter with his family having had enough of the mountains have you read roland cashel isnt that the name of his last novel the athenaeum said of it that it was new ground and praised it i hear that he gets a hundred pounds for each monthly number oh how glad i was to have your letter written in such pain read in such pleasure it was only fair to tell me in the last lines that the faceache was better to keep off a fit of remorse i do hope that mr may is not right about neuralgia because that is more difficult to cure than pain which arises from the teeth tell me how you are in all ways i look into your letters eagerly for news of your health then of your spirits which are a part of health the cholera makes me very frightened for my dearest people in london and silence the last longer than usual ploughs up my days and nights into long furrows the disease rages in the neighbourhood of my husbands family and though wimpole street has been hitherto clear who can calculate on what may be my head goes round to think of it and papa who will keep going into that horrible city even if my sisters and brothers should go into the country as every year he will be left he is no more movable than st pauls my sisterinlaw will probably not come to us as soon as she intended through a consideration for her father who ought not robert thinks to stay alone in the midst of such contingencies so perhaps we may go to seek her ourselves in the spring if she does not seek us out before in italy god keep us all and near to one another love runs dreadful risks in the world yet love is how much the best thing in the world we have had a great event in our house baby has cut a tooth his little happy laugh is always ringing through the rooms he is afraid of nobody or nothing in the world and was in fits of ecstasy at the tossing of the horses head when he rode on wilsons knee five or six miles the other day to a village in the mountainsscreaming for joy she said he is not six months yet by a fortnight his father loves him passionately and the sentiment is reciprocated i assure you we have had the coolest of italian summers at these baths of lucca the thermometer at the hottest hour of the hottest day only at seventysix and generally at sixtyeight or seventy the nights invariably cool now the freshness of the air is growing almost too fresh i only hope we shall be able for the cold to keep our intention of staying here till the end of october i have enjoyed it so entirely and shall be so sorry to break off this happy silence into the austrian drums at poor florence and then we want to see the vintage some grapes are ripe already but it is not vintage time we have every kind of good fruit great watermelons which with both arms i can scarcely carry at twopence halfpenny each and figs and peaches cheap in proportion and the place agrees with baby and has done good to my husbands spirits though the only amusement or distraction he has is looking at the mountains and climbing among the woods with me yes we have been reading some french romances monte cristo for instance i for the second timebut i have liked it to read it with him that dumas certainly has power and to think of the scramble there was for his brains a year or two ago in paris for a man to write so much and so well together is a miracle do you mean that they have left off writingthose french writersor that they have tired you out with writing that looks faint beside the rush of facts as the range of french politics show those has not eugène sue been illustrating the passions somebody told me so do you tell me how you like the french president and whether he will ever in your mind sit on napoleons throne it seems to me that he has given proof as far as the evidence goes of prudence integrity and conscientious patriotism the situation is difficult and he fills it honorably the rome business has been miserably managed this is the great blot on the character of his government but i for my own part my husband is not so minded do consider that the french motive has been good the intention pure the occupation of rome by the austrians being imminent and the french intervention the only means with the exception of a european war of saving rome from the hoof of the absolutists at the same time if pius ix is the obstinate idiot he seems to be good and tenderhearted man as he surely is and if the old abuses are to be restored why austria might as well have done her own dirty work and saved french hands from the disgrace of it it makes us two very angry robert especially is furious we are not within reach of the book you speak of portraits des orateurs français oh we might nearly as well live on a desert island as far as modern books go and here at lucca even robert cant catch sight of even the athenaeum we have a twoday old galignani and think ourselves royally off and then this little shop with french books in it just a few and the gentilhomme campagnard the latest published yes but somebody lent us the first volume of chateaubriands mémoires have you seen it curiously uninteresting considering the man and the hour he writes of his youth with a grey goose quill the paper is all wrinkled and then he is not frank he must have more to tell than he tells i looked for a more intense and sincere book outre tombe certainly i am busy about my new edition that is all at present but some things are written good of mr chorley he is good to place you face to face with roberts books and i am glad you like colombe and luria dear mr kenyons poems we have just received and are about to read and i am delighted at a glance to see that he has inserted the gipsy carol which in ms was such a favorite of mine really is he so rich i am glad of it if he is money could not be in more generous and intelligent hands dearest miss mitford you are only just in being trustful of my affection for you never do i forget nor cease to love you write and tell me of your dear self how you are exactly and whether you have been at three mile cross all the summer may god bless you roberts regards can you read love a little your    ever affectionate   ebb  to mrs jameson bagni di lucca october 1 1849  there seems to be a fatality about our letters dearest friend only the worst fate comes to me i lose and you are near losing and i should not have liked you to lose any least proof of my thinking of you lest a worst loss should happen to me as a consequence even worse than the loss of your letters for then perhaps and by degrees you might leave off thinking of robert and me which rich as we are in this mortal world i do assure you we could neither of us afford we have had much quiet enjoyment here in spite of everything read some amusing books dumas and sueshake your head and seen our child grow fuller of roses and understanding day by day before he was six months old he would stretch out his hands and his feet too when bidden to do so and his little mouth to kiss you this is said to be a miracle of forwardness among the learned he knows robert and me quite well as papa and mama and laughs for joy when he meets us out of doors robert is very fond of him and threw me into a fit of hilarity the other day by springing away from his newspaper in an indignation against me because he hit his head against the floor rolling over and over oh ba i really cant trust you down robert was on the carpet in a moment to protect the precious head he takes it to be made of venetian glass i am certain we may leave this place much sooner than the end of october as everything depends upon the coming in of the cold it will be the end of october wont it before gerardine can reach florence i wish i knew we have made an excursion into the mountains five miles deep with all our household baby and all on horseback and donkeyback and people open their eyes at our having performed such an exploiti and the child because it is five miles straight up the duomo you wonder how any horse could keep its footing the way is so precipitous up the exhausted torrent courses and with a palms breadth between you and the headlong ravines such scenery such a congregation of mountains looking alive in the stormy light we saw them by we dined with the goats and baby lay on my shawl rolling and laughing he wasnt in the least tired not he i wont say so much for myself the mr stuart who lectured here on shakespeare i think i told you that couldnt get through a lecture without quoting you and wound up by a declaration that no english critic had done so much for the divine poet as a womanmrs jameson he appears to be a cultivated and refined person and especially versed in german criticism and we mean to use his society a little when we return to florence where he resides what am i to say about roberts idleness and mine i scold him about it in a most anticonjugal manner but you know his spirits and nerves have been shaken of late we must have patience as for me i am much better and do something really now and then wait and you shall have us both on you too soon perhaps may god bless you how are your friends lady byron madame de goethe the dreadful cholera has made us anxious about england  your ever affectionate ba  mr browning adds the following note  dear aunt ninaba will have told you everything and how we wish you and geddie all manner of happiness i hope we shall be in florence when she passes through it the place is otherwise distasteful to me with the creeping curs and the floggers of the same but the weather is breaking up here and i suppose we ought to go back soon shall you indeed come to italy next year that will indeed be pleasant to expect we hope to go to england in the spring what comes of hoping however we know by this time  ever yours affectionately rb   to miss mitford bagni di lucca october 2 1849  thank you my dearest miss mitford it is great comfort to know that you are better and that the cholera does not approach your neighbourhood my brothers and sisters have gone to worthing for a few weeks and though my father dearest papa is not persuadeable i fear into joining them yet it is something to know that the horrible pestilence is abating in london oh it has made me so anxious i have caught with such a frightened haste at the newspaper to read the returns leaving even such subjects as rome and the presidents letter to quite the last as if they were indifferent or at most bits of mrs mannings murder by the way and talking of murder how do you account for the crown of wickedness which england bears just now over the heads of the nations in murders of all kinds by poison by pistol by knife in this poor tuscany which has not brains enough to govern itself as you observe and as really i cant deny there have been two murders properly so called since we came just three years ago one from jealousy and one from revenge respectable motives compared to the advantages of the burying societies and the horror on all sides was great as if the crime were some rare prodigy which indeed it is in this country we have no punishment of death here observe the people are gentle courteous refined and tenderhearted what balzac would call femmelette all tuscany is lucien himself the leaning to the artistic nature without the strength of genius implies demoralisation in most cases and it is this which makes your good for nothing poets and poetesses about which i love so to battle with you genius i maintain always you know is a purifying power and goes with high moral capacities well and so you invite us home to civilisation and the times newspaper we mean to go next spring and shall certainly do so unless something happen to catch us and keep us in a net but always something does happen and i have so often built upon seeing england and been precipitated from the fourth storey that i have learnt to think warily now i hunger and thirst for the sight of some faces must i not long do you think to see your face and then i shall be properly proud to show my child to those who loved me before him he is beginning to understand everythingchiefly in italian of course as his nurse talks in her sleep i fancy and cant be silent a second in the dayand when told to dare un bacio a questo povero flush he mixes his little face with flushs ears in a moment you would wonder to see flush just now he suffered this summer from the climate somewhat as usual though not nearly as much as usual and having been insulted oftener than once by a supposition of mange robert wouldnt bear it any longer he is as fond of flush as i am and taking a pair of scissors clipped him all over into the likeness of a lion much to his advantage in both health and appearance in the winter he is always quite well but the heat and the fleas together are too much in the summer the affection between baby and him is not equal babys love being far the stronger he on the other hand looks down upon baby what bad news you tell me of our french writers what is it possible that dumas even is struck dumb by the revolution his first works are so incomparably the worst that i cant admit your theory of the first runnings so of balzac so of sue george sand is probably writing banners for the reds which considering the state of parties in france does not really give me a higher opinion of her intelligence or virtue ledru rollins190 confidante and councillor cant occupy an honorable position and i am sorry for her sake and ours when we go to florence we must try to get the portraits and lamartines autobiography which i still more long to see so two women were in love with him were they that must be a comfort to look back upon now when nobody will have him i see by extracts from his newspaper in galignani that he cant be accused of temporising with the socialists any longer whatever other charge may be brought against him and if as he says it was he who made the french republic he is by no means irreproachable having made a bad and false thing the presidents letter about rome191 has delighted us a letter worth writing and reading we read it first in the italian papers long before it was printed in paris and the amusing thing was that where he speaks of the hostile influences of the cardinals they had misprinted it orribili influenze which must have turned still colder the blood in the veins of absolutist readers the misprint was not corrected until long aftermore than a week i think the pope is just a pope and since you give george sand credit for having known it i am the more vexed that blackwood under orribili influenze did not publish the poem i wrote two years ago192 in the full glare and burning of the popeenthusiasm which robert and i never caught for a moment then i might have passed a little for a prophetess as well as george sand only to confess a truth the same poem would have proved how fairly i was taken in by our tuscan grand duke oh the traitor  i saw the ambarvalia193 reviewed somewherei fancy in the spectator and was not much struck by the extracts they may however have been selected without much discrimination and probably were i am very glad that you like the gipsy carol in dear mr kenyons volume because it is and was in ms a great favorite of mine there are excellent things otherwise as must be when he says them one of the most radiant of benevolences with one of the most refined of intellects how the paper seems to dwindle as i would fain talk on more i have performed a great exploit ridden on a donkey five miles deep into the mountains to an almost inaccessible volcanic ground not far from the stars robert on horseback and wilson and the nurse with baby on other donkeys guides of course we set off at eight in the morning and returned at six pm after dining on the mountain pinnacle i dreadfully tired but the child laughing as usual and burnt brickcolour for all bad effect no horse or ass untrained to the mountains could have kept foot a moment where we penetrated and even as it was one could not help the natural thrill no road except the bed of exhausted torrents above and through the chestnut forests and precipitous beyond what you would think possible for ascent or descent ravines tearing the ground to pieces under your feet the scenery sublime and wonderful satisfied us wholly however as we looked round on the world of innumerable mountains bound faintly with the grey sea and not a human habitation i hope you will go to london this winter it will be good for you it seems to me take care of yourself my much and ever loved friend i love you and think of you indeed write of your health remembering this  and your affectionate ebb  my husbands regards always you had better i think direct to florence as we shall be there in the course of october  footnote 190 minister of the interior in the republic of 1848 and one of the most prominent f the advanced republican leaders  footnote 191 a letter addressed to a private friend but intended to be made public denouncing the reactionary and oppressive administration of the restored pope  footnote 192 probably the first part of casa guidi windows  footnote 193 by ah clough and t burbidge   to florence accordingly they returned in october and settled down once more in casa guidi for the winter mrs brownings principal literary occupation at this time was the preparation of a new edition of her poems including nearly all the contents of the seraphim volume of 1838 more or less revised as well as the poems of 1844 this edition published in 1850 has formed the basis of all subsequent editions of her poems meanwhile her husband was engaged in the preparation of christmas eve and easter day which was also published in the course of 1850   to miss mitford florence december i 1849  my ever loved friend you will have wondered at this unusual silence and so will my sisters to whom i wrote just now after a pause as little in my custom it was not the fault of my head and heart but of this unruly body which has been laid up again in the way of all flesh of mine  i am well again now only obliged to keep quiet and give up my grand walking excursions which poor robert used to be so boastful of if he is vain about anything in the world it is about my improved health and i used to say to him but you neednt talk so much to people of how your wife walked here with you and there with you as if a wife with a pair of feet was a miracle of nature now the poor feet have fallen into their old ways again ah but if god pleases it wont be for long  the american authoress miss fuller with whom we had had some slight intercourse by letter and who has been at rome during the siege as a devoted friend of the republicans and a meritorious attendant on the hospitals has taken us by surprise at florence retiring from the roman field with a husband and child above a year old nobody had even suspected a word of this underplot and her american friends stood in mute astonishment before this apparition of them here the husband is a roman marquis appearing amiable and gentlemanly and having fought well they say at the siege but with no pretension to cope with his wife on any ground appertaining to the intellect she talks and he listens i always wonder at that species of marriage but people are so different in their matrimonial ideals that it may answer sometimes this mdme ossoli saw george sand in pariswas at one of her soiréesand called her a magnificent creature the soirée was full of rubbish in the way of its social composition which george sand likes nota bene if mdme ossoli called it rubbish it must have been really rubbishnot expressing anything conventionally soshe being one of the out and out reds and scorners of grades of society she said that she did not see balzac balzac went into the world scarcely at all frequenting the lowest cafés so that it was difficult to track him out which information i receive doubtingly the rumours about balzac with certain parties in paris are not likely to be too favorable nor at all reliable i should fancy besides i never entertain disparaging thoughts of my demigods unless they should be forced upon me by evidence you must know i have not made a demigod of louis napoleon by the wayno and i dont mean it i expect some better final result than he has just proved himself to be of the french revolution with all its bitter and cruel consequences hitherto so i cant quite agree with you only so far that he has shown himself up to this point to be an upright man with noble impulses and that i give him much of my sympathy and respect in the difficult position held by him a man of genius he does not seem to beand what after all will he manage to do at rome i dont take up the frantic republican cry in italy i know too well the want of knowledge and the consequent want of i effective faith and energy among the italians but there is a stain upon france in the present state of the roman affair and i dont shut my eyes to that either to cast rome helpless and bound into the hands of the priests is dishonor to the actors however we consider the act and for the sake of france even more than for the sake of italy i yearn to see the act cancelled oh we have had the sight of clough and burbidge at last clough has more thought burbidge more music but i am disappointed in the book on the whole what i like infinitely better is cloughs bothie of topernafuosich a long vacation pastoral written in loose and morethanneedbe unmusical hexameters but full of vigour and freshness and with passages and indeed whole scenes of great beauty and eloquence it seems to have been written before the other poems try to get it if you have not read it already i feel certain you will like it and think all the higher of the poet oh it strikes both robert and me as being worth twenty of the other little book with its fragmentary dislocated unartistic character arnolds volume has two good poems in it the sick king of bokhara and the deserted merman i like them both but none of these writers are artists whatever they may be in future days have you read shirley and is it as good as jane eyre we heard not long since that mr chorley had discovered the author the currer bell a woman most certainly we hear too that three large editions of the princess are sold so much the happier for england and poetry  dearest dear miss mitford mind you write to me and dont pay me out in my own silence you have not been ill i hope and trust write and tell me every little thing of yourselfhow you are and whether there is still danger of your being uprooted from three mile cross i love and think of you always fancy flush being taken in the light of a rival by baby oh baby was quite jealous the other day and strugggled and kicked to get to me because he saw flush leaning his pretty head on my lap theres a great strife for privileges between those two may god bless you my husbands kind regards always while i am your most  affectionate ebb   to miss mitford florence january 9 1850  thank you ever dearest miss mitford for this welcome letter written on your birthday may the fear of smallpox have passed away long before now and every hope and satisfaction have strengthened and remained  may god bless you and give you many happy years you who can do so much towards the happiness of others may i not answer for my own  little wiedeman began to crawl on christmas day before he used to roll we throw things across the floor and he crawls for them like a little dog on all fours  he has just caught a cold which i make more fuss about than i ought say the wise but i cant get resigned to the association of any sort of suffering with his laughing dimpled little bodyit is the blowing about in the wind of such a heap of roses so you prefer shirley to jane eyre yet i hear from nobody such an opinion yet you are very probably right for shirley may suffer from the natural reaction of the public mind what you tell me of tennyson interests me as everything about him must i like to think of him digging gardensroom for cabbage and all at the same time what he says about the public hating poetry is certainly not a word for tennyson perhaps no true poet having claims upon attention solely through his poetry has attained so certain a success with such short delay instead of being pelted as nearly every true poet has been he stands already on a pedestal and is recognised as a master spirit not by a coterie but by the great public three large editions of the princess have already been sold if he isnt satisfied after all i think he is wrong divine poet as he is and no laurel being too leafy for him yet he must be an unreasonable man and not understanding of the growth of the laurel trees and the nature of a reading public with regard to the other gardendigger dear mr home i wish as you do that i could hear something satisfactory of him i wrote from lucca in the summer and have no answer the latest word concerning him is the announcement in the athenaeum of a third edition of his gregory the seventh which we were glad to see but very very glad we should be to have news of his prosperity in the flesh as well as in the litterae scriptae  i have not been out of doors these two months but people call me looking well and a newly married niece of miss bayleys the accomplished miss thomson who has become the wife of dr emil braun the learned german secretary of the archaeological society and just passed through florence on her way to rome where they are to reside declared that the change she saw in me was miraculouswonderful indeed i took her to look at wiedeman in his cradle fast asleep and she won my heart over again for always she was a favorite of mine by exclaiming at his prettiness charmed too we both were with dr brauni mean robert and i were charmed he has a mixture of fervour and simplicity which is still more delightfully picturesque in his foreign english oh he speaks english perfectly only with an obvious accent enough i am sure we should be cordial friends if the lines had fallen to us in the same pleasant places but he is fixed at rome and we are half afraid of the enervating effects of the roman climate on the constitutions of children tell me do you hear often from mr chorley it quite pains us to observe from his manner of writing the great depression of his spirits his mother was ill in the summer but plainly the sadness does not arise entirely or chiefly from this cause he seems to me overworked taxed in the spirit i advise nobody to give up work but that athenaeum labour is a sort of treadmill discipline in which there is no progress nor triumph and i do wish he would give that up and come out to us with a new set of anvils and hammers only of course he couldnt do it even if he would while there is illness in his family may there be a whole sun of success shining on the new play robert is engaged on a poem194 and i am busy with my edition so much to correct i find and many poems to add plainly jane eyre was by a woman it used to astound me when sensible people said otherwise write to me will you i long to hear again tell me everything of yourself accept my husbands true regards and think of me as your  ever affectionate ebb  footnote 194 christmas eve and easter day   to miss browning florence january 29 1850  my dearest sariannai have waited to thank you for your great and ready kindness about the new edition until now when it is fairly on its way to england thank you thank you i am only afraid not that you will find anything too learned as you suggest but a good many things too careless i was going to say only robert with various deep sighs for his poor sarianna devoted himself during several days to rearranging my arrangements and simplifying my complications it was the old story of order and disorder over again he pulled out the knotted silks with an indefatigable patience so that really you will owe to him every moment of ease and facility which may be enjoyable in the course of the work i am afraid that at the easiest you will find it a vexatious business but i throw everything on your kindness and am not distrustful on such a point of weights and measures  your letter was full of sad news robert was deeply affected at the account of the illness of his cousinwas in tears before he could end the letter i do hope that in a day or two we may hear from you that the happy change was confirmed as time passed on i do hope so it will be joy not merely to robert but to me for indeed i never forget the office which his kindness performed for both of us at a crisis ripe with all the happiness of my life  then it was sad to hear of your dear father suffering from lumbago may the last of it have passed away long before you get what i am writing tell him with my love that wiedeman shall hear some day if we all live the verses he wrote to him and i have it in my head that little wiedeman will be very sensitive to verses and kindness toohe likes to hear anything rhythmical and musical and he likes to be petted and kissedthe most affectionate little creature he issitting on my knee while i give him books to turn the leaves over a favorite amusement every two minutes he puts up his little rosebud of a mouth to have a kiss his cold is quite gone and he has taken advantage of the opportunity to grow still fatter as to his activities theres no end to them his nurse and i agree that he doesnt remain quiet a moment in the day195  now the love of nephews cant bear any more sarianna can it only your father will take my part and say that it isnt tediousbeyond pardoning  may god bless both of you and enable you to send a brighter letter next time robert will be very anxious  your ever affectionate sister ba mention yourself do  footnote 195 a long description of the babys meals and daily programme follows the substance of which can probably be imagined by connoisseurs in the subject   to miss mitford florence february 18 1850  ever dearest miss mitford you always give me pleasure so for loves sake dont say that you seldom give it and such a magical act as conjuring up for me the sight of a new poem by alfred tennyson196 is unnecessary to prove you a right beneficent enchantress thank you thank you we are not so unworthy of your redundant kindness as to abuse it by a word spoken or sign signified you may trust us indeed but now you know how free and sincere i am always now tell me apart from the fact of this lyrics being a fragment of fringe from the great poets singing clothes as leigh hunt says somewhere and apart from a certain sweetness and rise and fall in the rhythm do you really see much for admiration in the poem is it new in any way i admire tennyson with the most worshipping part of the multitude as you are aware but i do not perceive much in this lyric which strikes me and robert also who goes with me throughout as quite inferior to the other lyrical snatches in the princess by the way if he introduces it in the princess it will be the only rhymed verse in the work robert thinks that he was thinking of the rhine echoes in writing it and not of any heard in his irish travels i hear that tennyson has taken rooms above mr forsters in lincolns inn fields and is going to try a london life so says mr kenyon i am writing with an easier mind than when i wrote last for i was for a little time rendered very unhappy so unhappy that i couldnt touch on the subject which is always the way with me when pain passes a certain point by hearing accidentally that papa was unwell and looking altered my sister persisted in replying to my anxieties that they were unfounded that i was quite absurd indeed in being anxious at all only people are not generally reformed from their absurdities through being scolded for them now however it really appears that the evil has passed he left his doctor who had given him lowering medicines and coincidently with the leaving he has recovered looks and health altogether arabel says that i should think he was looking as well as ever if i saw him and that appetite and spirits are even redundant thank god to have this good news has made me very happy and i overflow to you accordingly oh there is pain enough from that quarter without hearing of his being out of health i write to him continually and he does not now return my letters which is a melancholy something gained now enough of such a subject  i certainly dont think that the qualities half savage and half freethinking expressed in jane eyre are likely to suit a model governess or schoolmistress and it amuses me to consider them in that particular relation your account falls like dew upon the parched curiosity of some of our friends here to whom as mere gossip which did not leave you responsible i couldnt resist the temptation of communicating it people are so curiouseven here among the raffaelsabout this particular authorship yet nobody seems to have read shirley we are too slow in getting new books first galignani has to pirate them himself and then to hand us over the spoils by the way theres to be an international copyright isnt there something is talked of it in the athenaeum meanwhile the americans have already reprinted my husbands new edition landthieves i mean pirates i used to take that for a slip of the pen in shakespeare but it was a slip of the pen into prophecy sorry i am at mrs  falling short of your warmhearted ideas about her can you understand a womans hating a girl because it is not a boyher first child too i understand it so little that scarcely i can believe it some women have however undeniably an indifference to children just as many men have though it must be unnatural and morbid in both sexes men often affect itvery foolishly if they count upon the scenic effects affectation never succeeds well and this sort of affectation is peculiarly unbecoming except in old bachelors for there is a pathetic side to the question so viewed for my part and my husbands we may be frank and say that we have caught up our parental pleasures with a sort of passion but then wiedeman is such a darling little creature who could help loving the child little darling so much mischief was not often put before into so small a body fancy the childs upsetting the water jugs till he is drenched which charms him pulling the brooms to pieces and having serious designs upon cutting up his frocks with a pair of scissors he laughs like an imp when he can succeed in doing anything wrong now see what you get in return for your kindness of liking to hear about him almost i have the grace to be ashamed a little just before i had your letter we sent my new edition to england i gave much time to the revision and did not omit reforming some of the rhymes although you must consider that the irregularity of these in a certain degree rather falls in with my system than falls out through my carelessness so much the worse you will say when a person is systematically bad the work will include the best poems of the seraphim volume strengthened and improved as far as the circumstances admitted of i had not the heart to leave out the wretched sonnet to yourself for your dear sake but i rewrote the latter half of it for really it wasnt a sonnet at all and una and her lion are rococo and so placed it with my other poems of the same class there are some new verses also197 the miss hardings i have seen and talked with them of you a sure way of finding them delightful but my dearest friend i shall not see any of the trollope partyit is not likely you can scarcely image to yourself the retired life we live or how we have retreated from the kind advances of the english society here now people seem to understand that we are to be left alone that nothing is to be made of us the fact is we are not like our child who kisses everybody who smiles at him neither my health nor our pecuniary circumstances nor our inclinations perhaps would admit of our entering into english society here which is kept up much after the old english models with a proper disdain for continental simplicities of expense we have just heard from father prout who often he says sees mr horne who is as dreamy as ever so glad i am for i was beginning to be uneasy about him he has not answered my letter from lucca the verses in the athenaeum198 are on sophia cottrells child  may god bless you dearest friend speak of yourself more particularly to your ever affectionate  ebb  roberts kindest regards tell us of mr chorleys play do  footnote 196 apparently the echosong which now precedes canto iv of the princess though one is surprised at the opinion here expressed of it it will be remembered that this and the other lyrical interludes did not appear in the original edition of the princess  footnote 197 notably the sonnets from the portuguese  footnote 198 a childs death at florence which appeared in the athenaeum of december 22 1849   to mrs martin florence february 22 1850  my dearest mrs martinhave you wondered that i did not write before it was not that i did not thank you in my heart for your kind considerate letter but i was unconquerably uncomfortable about papa and what with the weather which always has me in its power somehow and other things i fell into a dislike of writing which i hope you didnt mistake for ingratitude because it was not in the least like the same fault now the severe weather such weather for italy has broken up and i am relieved in all ways having received the most happy satisfactory news from wimpole street and the assurance from my sisters that if i were to see papa i should think him looking as well as ever he grew impatient with dr elliotsons medicines which it appears were of a very lowering charactersuddenly gave them up and as suddenly recovered his looks and all the rest and everybody at home considers him to be quite well it has relieved me of a mountains weight and i thank god with great joy oh you must have understood how natural it was for me to be unhappy under the other circumstances but if you thought dearest friend that they were necessary to induce me to write to him the humblest and most beseeching of letters you do not know how i feel his alienation or my own love for him i with regard to my brothers it is quite different though even towards them i may faithfully say that my affection has borne itself higher than my pride but as to papa i have never contended about the right or the wrong i have never irritated him by seeming to suppose that his severity to me has been more than justice i have confined myself simply to a supplication forhis forgiveness of what he called in his own words the only fault of my life towards him and an expression of the love which even i must feel i for him whether he forgives me or not this has been done in letter after letter and they are not sent backit is all in my last letter i ventured to ask him to let it be an understood thing that he should before the world and to every practical purpose act out his idea of justice by excluding me formally me and mine from every advantage he intended his other childrenthat having so been just he might afford to be merciful by giving me his forgiveness and affectionall i asked and desired my husband and i had talked this over again and again only it was a difficult thing to say you see at last i took courage and said it because doing it papa might seem to himself to reconcile his notion of strict justice and whatever remains of pity and tenderness might still be in his heart towards me if there are any such i know he has strong feelings at bottomotherwise should i love him sobut he has adopted a bad system and he as well as i is crushed by it if i were to write to you the political rumours we hear every day you would scarcely think our situation improved in safety by the horrible austrian army florence bristles with cannon on all sides and at the first movement we are promised to be bombarded on the other hand if the red republicans get uppermost there will be a universal massacre not a priest according to their own profession will be left alive in italy the constitutional party hope they are gaining strength but the progress which depends on intellectual growth must necessarily be slow that the papacy has for ever lost its prestige and power over souls is the only evident truth bright and strong enough to cling to i hear even devout women say this cursed pope its all his fault protestant places of worship are thronged with italian faces and the minister of the scotch church at leghorn has been threatened with exclusion from the country if he admits tuscans to the church communion politically speaking much will depend upon france and i have strong hope for france though it is so strictly the fashion to despair of her tell me dear mr martins impression and your owneverything is good that comes from you but most particularly tell me how you both aretell me whether you are strong again dearest mrs martin for indeed i do not like to hear of your being in the least like an invalid do speak of yourself a little more do you know you are very unsatisfactory as a letterwriter when you write about yourselfthe reason being that you never do write about yourself except by the suddenest snatches when you cant possibly help the reference  robert sends his true regards with those of your gratefully affectionate ba   to mrs jameson april 2 1850  you have perhaps thought us ungrateful people my ever dear friend for this long delay in thanking you for your beautiful and welcome present199 here is the truth though we had the books from rome last month they were snatched from us by impatient hands before we had finished the first volume the books are hungered and thirsted for in florence and although the english reading club has them they cant go fast enough from one to another four of our friends entreated us for the reversion and although it really is only just that we should be let read our own books first yet roberts generosity cant resist the need of this person who is going away and of that person who is so particularly anxiousfor particular reasons perhapsso we renounce the privilege you gave us with the pomps of this world and are still waiting to finish even the first volume our cultivated friends the ogilvys who had the work from us earliest because they were going to naples were charmed with it mr kirkup the artist who disputes with mr bezzi the glory of finding dantes portraityes and breathes fire in the disputehas it now madame ossoli margaret fuller the american authoress who brought from the siege of rome a noble marquis as her husband asks for it and your adorer mr stuart who has lectured upon shakespeare all the winter entreats for it so when we shall be free to enjoy it thoroughly for ourselves remains doubtful robert promises every day you shall have it next certainly and i only hope you will put him and me in your next edition of the martyrs for such a splendid exercise of the gifts of selfrenunciation but dont fancy that we have not been delighted with the sight of the books with your kindness and besides with the impressions gathered from a rapid examination of the qualities of the work it seems to us in every way a valuable and most interesting work it must render itself a necessity for art students and general readers and seers of pictures like me who carry rather sentiment than science into the consideration of such subjects we much admire your introductionexcellent in all ways besides the grace and eloquence altogether the work must set you higher with a high class of the public and i congratulate you on what is the gain of all of us robert has begun a little pencil list of trifling criticisms he means to finish we both cry aloud at what you say of guercinos angels and never would have said if you had been to fano and seen his divine picture of the guardian angel which affects me every time i think of it our little wiedeman had his part of pleasure in the book by being let look at the engravings he screamed for joy at the miracle of so many birdmen and kissed some of them very reverentially which is his usual way of expressing admiration  whether you will like roberts new book i dont know but i am sure you will admit the originality and power in it i wish we had the option of giving it to you but chapman  hall never seem to think of our giving copies away nor leave them at our disposal there is nothing italian in the book poets are apt to be most present with the distant a remark of wilsons200 used to strike me as eminently truethat the perfectest descriptive poem descriptive of rural scenery would be naturally produced in a london cellar i have read shirley lately it is not equal to jane eyre in spontaneousness and earnestness i found it heavy i confess though in the mechanical part of the writingthe compositional savoir fairethere is an advance robert has exhumed some french books just now from a little circulating library which he had not tried and we have been making ourselves uncomfortable over balzacs cousin pons but what a wonderful writer he is who else could have taken such a subject out of the lowest mud of humanity and glorified and consecrated it he is wonderfulthere is not another word for himprofound as nature is s i complain of florence for the want of books we have to dig and dig before we can get anything new and i can read the newspapers only through roberts eyes who only can read them at vieusseuxs in a room sacred from the foot of woman and this isnt always satisfactory to me as whenever he falls into a state of disgust with any political régime he throws the whole subject over and wont read a word more about it every now and then for instance he ignores france altogether and i who am more tolerant and more curious find myself suspended over an hiatus valde deflendus and whats to be said and done m thiers speechthiers is a rascal i make a point of not reading one word said by m thiers m prudhonprudhon is a madman who cares for prudhon the presidentthe presidents an ass he is not worth thinking of and so we treat of politics  i wish you would write to us a little oftener or rather a good deal and tell us much of yourself it made me very sorry that you should be suffering in the grief of your sisteryou whose sympathies are so tender and quick may it be better with you now mention lady byron i shall be glad to hear that she is stronger notwithstanding this cruel winter we have lovely weather here now and i am quite well and able to walk out and little wiedeman rolls with flush on the grass of the cascine dear kind wilson is doatingly fond of the child and sometimes gives it as her serious opinion that there never was such a child before of course i dont argue the point much now will you write to us speak of your plans particularly when you do we have taken this apartment on for another year from may may god bless you robert unites in affectionate thanks and thoughts of all kinds with your  ebbrather ba  this letter has waited some days to be sent away as you will see by the date  footnote 199 mrs jamesons legends of the monastic orders which had just been published  footnote 200 presumably not mrs brownings maid but christopher north   at the end of march 1850 the longdeferred marriage of mrs brownings sister henrietta to captain surtees cook took place it is of interest here mainly as illustrating mr barretts behaviour to his daughters an application for his consent only elicited the pronouncement if henrietta marries you she turns her back on this house for ever and a letter to henrietta herself reproaching her with the insult she had offered him in asking his consent when she had evidently made up her mind to the conclusion and declaring that if she married her name should never again be mentioned in his presence the marriage having thereupon taken place his decision was forthwith put into practice and a second child was thenceforward an exile from her fathers house   to miss mitford florence end of april 1850  you will have seen in the papers dearest friend the marriage of my sister henrietta and will have understood why i was longer silent than usual indeed the event has much moved me and so much of the emotion was painfulpainfulness being inseparable from events of the sort in our familythat i had to make an effort to realise to myself the reasonable degree of gladness and satisfaction in her release from a long anxious transitional state and her prospect of happiness with a man who has loved her constantly and who is of an upright honest reliable and religious mind our fathers objections were to his tractarian opinions and insufficient income i have no sympathy myself with tractarian opinions but i cannot under the circumstances think an objection of the kind tenable by a third person and in truth we all know that if it had not been this objection it would have been anotherthere was no escape any way an engagement of five years and an attachment still longer were to have some results and i cant regret or indeed do otherwise than approve from my heart what she has done from hers most of her friends and relatives have considered that there was no choice and that her step is abundantly justified at the same time i thank god that a letter sent to me to ask my advice never reached me the second letter of my sisters lost since i left them because no advice ought to be given on any subject of the kind and because i especially should have shrunk from accepting such a responsibility so i only heard of the marriage three days before it took placeno four days beforeand was upset as you may suppose by the sudden news captain surtees cooks sister was one of the bridesmaids and his brother performed the ceremony the means are very small of coursehe has not much and my sister has nothingstill it seems to me that they will have enough to live prudently on and he looks out for a further appointment papa will never again let her name be mentioned in his hearing he says but we must hope the dreadful business passed off better on the whole than poor arabel expected and things are going on as quietly as usual in wimpole street now i feel deeply for her who in her pure disinterestedness just pays the price and suffers the loss she represents herself however to be relieved at the crisis being passed i earnestly hope for her sake that we may be able to get to england this yeara sight of us will be some comfort henrietta is to live at taunton for the present as he has a military situation there and they are preparing for a round of visits among their many friends who are anxious to have them previous to their settling all this you see will throw me back with papa even if i can be supposed to have gained half a step and i doubt it oh yes dearest miss mitford i have indeed again and again thought of your emily stripping the situation of the favour and prettiness associated with that heroine wiedeman might compete though in darlingness with the child as the poem shows him still i can accept no omen my heart sinks when i dwell upon peculiarities difficult to analyse i love him very deeply when i write to him i lay myself at his feet even if i had gained half a step and i doubt it as i said see how i must be thrown back by the indisposition to receive others but i cannot write of this subject let us change it  madame ossoli sails for america in a few days with the hope of returning to italy and indeed i cannot believe that her roman husband will be easily naturalised among the yankees a very interesting person she is far better than her writingsthoughtful spiritual in her habitual mode of mind not only exalted but exaltée in her opinions and yet calm in manner we shall be sorry to lose her we have lost besides our friends mr and mrs ogilvy cultivated and refined people they occupied the floor above us the last winter and at the baths of lucca and florence we have seen much of them for a year past she published some time since a volume of scottish minstrelsy graceful and flowing and aspires strenuously towards poetry a pretty woman with three pretty children of quick perceptions and active intelligence and sensibility they are upright excellent people in various ways and it is a loss to us that they should have gone to naples now dearest friend how your letter delighted me with its happy account of your improved strength take care of yourself do to lose no ground the power of walking must refresh your spirits as well as widen your daily pleasures i am so glad thank god we have heard from mr chorley who seems to have received very partial gratification in respect to his play and yet prepares for more plays more wrestlings in the same dust well i cant make it out a man of his sensitiveness to choose to appeal to the coarsest side of the publicwhich whatever you dramatists may say you all certainly dois incomprehensible to me then i cannot help thinking that he might achieve other sorts of successes more easily and surely your criticism is very just but i like his music and manners in germany better than anything he has done i believe i always did like it best and since coming to florence i have heard cultivated americans speak of it with enthusiasm yes with enthusiasm pomfret they would scarcely believe to be by the same author i agree with you but it is a pity indeed for him to tie himself to the wheels of the athenaeum to approfondir the ruts what other end and by the way the athenaeum since mr dilke left it has grown duller and duller colder and colder flatter and flatter mr dilke was not brilliant but he was a brutus in criticism and though it was his speciality to condemn his most particular friends to the hangman the survivors thought there was something grand about it on the whole and nobody could hold him in contempt now it is all different we have not even public virtue to fasten our admiration to you will be sure to think i am vexed at the article on my husbands new poem201 why certainly i am vexed who would not be vexed with such misunderstanding and mistaking dear mr chorley writes a letter to appreciate most generously so you see how little power he has in the paper to insert an opinion or stop an injustice on the same day came out a burning panegyric of six columns in the examiner a curious crossfire if you read the little book i wish i could send you a copy but chapman  hall have not offered us copies and you will catch sight of it somewhere i hope you will like things in it at least it seems to me full of power two hundred copies went off in the first fortnight which is a good beginning in these days so i am to confess to a satisfaction in the american piracies well i confess then only it is rather a complex smile with which one hears sir or madam we are selling your book at half price as well printed as in england those apples we stole from your garden we sell at a halfpenny instead of a penny as you do they are much appreciated very gratifying indeed its worth while to rob us thats plain and theres something magnificent in supplying a distant market with apples out of ones garden still the smile is complex in its character and the moralitysimple thats all i meant to say a letter from henrietta and her husband glowing with happiness it makes me happy she says i wonder if i shall be as happy as you ba god grant it it was signified to her that she should at once give up her engagement of five years or leave the house she married directly i do not understand how it could be otherwise indeed my brothers have been kind and affectionate i am glad to say in her case poor dearest papa does injustice chiefly to his own nature by these severities hard as they seem write soon and talk of yourself to  ever affectionate ba  i am rejoicing in the peoples edition of your work viva roberts best regards  footnote 201 the athenaeum review of christmas eve and easter day while recognising the beauty of many passages in the two poems criticised strongly the discussion of theological subjects in doggrel verse and its analysis of the theology would hardly be satisfactory to the author   to mrs jameson florence may 4 1850  dearest friendthis little note will be given to you by the mr stuart of whom i once told you that he was holding you up to the admiration of all florence and the baths of lucca as the best english critic of shakespeare in his lectures on the great poet  robert bids me say that he wrote you a constrained halfdozen lines by mr henry greenough who asked for a letter of introduction to you while the asker was sitting in the room and the form of dear mrs jameson couldnt well be escaped from he loves you as well as ever you are to understand through every complication of forms and you are to love him and me for i come in as a part of him if you please did you get my thanks for the dear petrarch pen so steeped in doubledistilled memories that it seems scarcely fit to be steeped in ink and our appreciation as well as gratitude for the bookswhich indeed charm us more and more robert has been picking up pictures at a few pauls each hole and corner pictures which the dealers had not found out and the other day he covered himself with glory by discovering and seizing on in a corn shop a mile from florence five pictures among heaps of trash and one of the best judges in florence mr kirkup throws out such names for them as cimabue ghirlandaio giottino a crucifixion painted on a banner giottesque if not giotto but unique or nearly so on account of the linen material and a little virgin by a byzantine master the curious thing is that two angel pictures for which he had given a scudo last year prove to have been each sawn off the sides of the ghirlandaio so called representing the eterno padre clothed in a mystical garment and encircled by a rainbow the various tints of which together with the scarlet tips of the flying seraphs wings are darted down into the smaller pictures and complete the evidence line for line it has been a grand altarpiece cut to bits now come and see for yourself we cant say decidedly yet whether it will be possible or impossible for us to go to england this year but in any case you must come to see gerardine and italy and we shall manage to catch you by the skirts thenso do come never mind the rumbling of political thunders because even if a storm breaks you will slip under cover in these days easily whether in france or italy i cant make out for my part how anybody can be afraid of such things  will you be among the likers or dislikers i wonder sometimes of roberts new book the faculty you will recognise in all cases he can do anything he chooses i have complained of the asceticism in the second part but he said it was one side of the question dont think that he has taken to the cilixindeed he has notbut it is his way to see things as passionately as other people feel them  chapman  hall offer us no copies or you should have had one of course so wordsworth is gonea great light out of heaven  may god bless you my dear friend  love your affectionate and grateful for so many reasons ba   the death of wordsworth on april 23 left the laureateship vacant and though there was probably never any likelihood of mrs brownings being invited to succeed him it is worth noticing that her claims were advocated by so prominent a paper as the athenaeum which not only urged that the appointment would be eminently suitable under a female sovereign but even expressed its opinion that there is no living poet of either sex who can prefer a higher claim than mrs elizabeth barrett browning no doubt there would have been a certain appropriateness in the post of laureate to a queen being held by a poetess but the claims of tennyson to the primacy of english poetry were rightly regarded as paramount the fact that in robert browning there was a poet of equal calibre with tennyson though of so different a type seems to have occurred to no one   to miss mitford florence june 15 1850  my ever dear friendhow it grieves me that you should have been so unwell again from what you say about the state of the house i conclude that your health suffers from that cause precisely and that when you are warmly and dryly walled in you will be less liable to these attacks grievous to your friends as to you oh i dont praise anybody i assure you for wishing to entice you to live near them we come over the alps for a sunny climate what should we not do for a moral atmosphere like yours i dare say you have chosen excellently your new residence and i hope you will get over the fuss of it with great courage remembering the advantages which it is likely to secure to you tell me as much as you can about it all that i may shift the scene in the right grooves and be able to imagine you to myself out of three mile cross you have the local feeling so eminently that i have long been resolved on never asking you to migrate doves wont travel with swallows who should persuade them this is no migrationonly a shifting from one branch to another with reading on one side of you still you will lose nothing neither sight nor friend oh do write to me as soon as you can and say that the deepening summer has done you good and given you strength say it if possible i shall be very anxious for the next letter my only objection to florence is the distance from london and the expense of the journey ones heart is pulled at through different english ties and cant get the right rest and i think we shall move northwardstry france a little after a time the present year has been full of petty vexation to us about the difficulty of going to england and it becomes more and more doubtful whether we can attain to the means of doing it there are four of us and the child you see and precisely this year we are restricted in means as far as our present knowledge goes but i cant say yet only i do very much fear nobody will believe our promises i think any more and my poor arabel will be in despair and i shall lose the opportunity of authenticating wiedeman for as robert says all our fine stories about him will go for nothing and he will be set down as a sham child if not sham how could human vanity resist the showing him off bodily that sounds reasonable  certainly you are disinterested about america and of course all of us who have hearts and heads must feel the sympathy of a greater nation to be more precious than a thick purse still it is not just and dignified this vantage ground of american pirates liking the ends and motives one disapproves the means yes even you do and if i were an american i should dissent with still more emphasis it should be made a point of honour with the nation if there is no point of law against the re publishers for my own part i have every possible reason to thank and love america she has been very kind to me and the visits we receive here from delightful and cordial persons of that country have been most gratifying to us the american minister at the court of vienna with his family did not pass through florence the other day without coming to see usgeneral watson webbewith an air of moral as well as military command in his brow and eyes he looked and talked too like one of oar dignities of the old world the goahead principle didnt seem the least overstrong in him nor likely to disturb his official balance what is to happen next in france do you trust still your president he is in a hard position and if he leaves the pope where he is in a dishonored one as for the change in the electoral law and the increase of income i see nothing in either to make an outcry against there is great injustice everywhere and a rankling partyspirit and to speak the truth and act it appears still more difficult than usual i was sorry do you know to hear of dear mr hornes attempt at shylock he is fit for higher things did i tell you how we received and admired his judas iscariot yes surely i did he says that louis blanc is a friend of his and much with him speaking with enthusiasm i should be more sorry at his being involved with the socialists than with shylockstill more sorry for i love liberty so intensely that i hate socialism i hold it to be the most desecrating and dishonouring to humanity of all creeds i would rather for me live under the absolutism of nicholas of russia than in a fourier machine with my individuality sucked out of me by a social airpump oh if you happen to write again to mrs deane thank her much for her kind anxiety but indeed if i had lost my darling i should not write verses about it202 as for the laureateship it wont be given to me be sure though the suggestion has gone the round of the english newspapersgalignani and alland notwithstanding that most kind and flattering recommendation of the athenaeum for which i am sure we should be grateful to mr chorley i think leigh hunt should have the laureateship he has condescended to wish for it and has worn his singing clothes longer than most of his contemporaries deserving the price of long as well as noble service whoever has it will be of course exempted from court lays and the distinction of the title and pension should remain for spensers sake if not for wordsworths we are very anxious to know about tennysons new work in memoriam do tell us about it you are aware that it was written years ago and relates to a son of mr hallam who was tennysons intimate friend and the betrothed of his sister i have heard through someone who had seen the ms that it is full of beauty and pathos dearest ever dear miss mitford speak particularly of your health may god bless you prays  your ever affectionate ebb roberts kindest regards  footnote 202 referring to the lines entitled a childs grave at florence which had apparently been misunderstood as implying the death of mrs brownings own child   to miss mitford florence july 8 1850  my dearest miss mitfordi this moment have your note and as a packet of ours is going to england i snatch up a pen to do what i can with it in the brief moments between this and post time i dont wait till it shall be possible to write at length because i have something immediate to say to you your letter is delightful yet it is not for that that i rush so upon answering it nor even is it for the excellent news of your consenting for dear mr chorleys sake to give us some more of your papers203 though blessed be the hour and month and year when he set about editing the ladies companion and persuading you to do such a thing no what i want to say is strictly personal to me you are the kindest warmesthearted most affectionate of critics and precisely as such it is that you have thrown me into a paroxysm of terror my dearest friend for the love of mei dont argue the point with youbut i beseech you humblykissing the hem of your garment and by all sacred and tender recollections of sympathy between you and me dont breathe a word about any juvenile performance of minedont if you have any love left for me dear friend disinter anybody or anything you please but dont disinter me unless you mean the ghost of my vexation to vex you ever after blessed be she who spares these stones all the saints know that i have enough to answer for since i came to my mature mind and that i had difficulty enough in making most of the seraphim volume presentable a little in my new edition because it was too ostensible before the public to be caught back but if the sins of my rawest juvenility are to be thrust upon meand sins are extant of even twelve or thirteen or earlier and i was in print once when i was ten i thinkwhat is to become of me i shall groan as loud as christian did dearest miss mitford now forgive this ingratitude which is gratitude all the time i love you and thank you but right or wrong mind what i say and let me love and thank you still more when you see my new edition you will see that everything worth a straw i ever wrote is there and if there were strength in conjuration i would conjure you to pass an act of oblivion on the stubble that remainsif anything does remain indeed now more than enough of this for the rest i am delighted i am even so generous as not to be jealous of mr chorley for prevailing with you when nobody else could i had given it up long ago i never thought you would stir a pen again by what charm did he prevail your series of papers will be delightful i do not doubt though i never could see anything in some of your heroes american or irish longfellow is a poet i dont refer to him still whatever you say will be worth hearing and the guide through pompeii will be better than many of the ruins the pleaders guide i never heard of before praed has written some sweet and tender things then i shall like to hear you on beaumont and fletcher and andrew marvell  i have seen nothing of tennysons new poem do you know if the echosong is the most popular of his verses it is only another proof to my mind of the noworth of popularity that song would be eminently sweet for a common writer but tennyson has done better surely his eminences are to be seen above as for the laurel in a sense he is worthier of it than leigh hunt only tennyson can wait that is the single difference  so anxious i am about your house your health seems to me mainly to depend on your moving and i do urge your moving if not there elsewhere may god bless you ever dear friend  i dare say you will think i have given too much importance to the rococo verses you had the goodness to speak of but i have a horror of being disinterred theres the truth leave the violets to grow over me because that wretched schoolexercise of a version of the prometheus had been named by two or three people wasnt i at the pains of making a new translation before i left england so to erase a sort of halfvisible and half invisible blot on the scutcheon after such an expenditure of lemonjuice you will not wonder that i should trouble you with all this talk about nothing  i am so delighted that you are to lift up your voice again and so grateful to mr chorley  ah yes if we go to paris we shall draw you mr chorley shant have all the triumphs to himself  not a word more says robert or the post will be missed god bless you do take care of yourself and dont stay in that damp house and do make allowances for love  your ever affectionate ba  how glad i shall be if it is true that tennyson is married i believe in the happiness of marriage for men especially  footnote 203 these are the papers subsequently published under the title recollections of a literary life among them was an article on the brownings giving biographical detail with respect to mrs brownings early life especially as to the loss of her brother which caused extreme pain to her sensitive nature as a later letter testifies   through the greater part of the summer of 1850 the brownings held fast in florence and it was not until september when mrs browning was recovering from a rather sharp attack of illness that they took a short holiday going for a few weeks to siena a place which they were again to visit some years later during the last two summers of mrs brownings life the letter announcing their arrival is the first in the present collection addressed to miss isa blagden miss blagden was a resident in florence for many years and was a prominent member of english society there her friendship not only with mrs browning but with her husband was of a very intimate character and was continued after mrs brownings death until the end of her own life in 1872   to miss i blagden siena september 1850  here i am keeping my promise my dear miss blagden we arrived quite safely and i was not too tired to sleep at night though tired of course and the baby was a miracle of goodness all the way only inclining once to a rabbia through not being able to get at the electric telegraph but in ecstasies otherwise at everything new we had to stay at the inn all night we heard of a multitude of villas none of which could be caught in time for the daylight on sunday however just as we were beginning to give it up in robert came with good news and we were settled in half an hour afterwards here a small house of some seven rooms two miles from siena and situated delightfully in its own grounds of vineyard and olive ground not to boast too much of a pretty little square flowergarden the grapes hang in garlands too tantalising to wiedeman about the walls and before them and through and over we have magnificent views of a noble sweep of country undulating hills and various verdure and on one side the great maremma extending to the foot of the roman mountains our villa is on a hill called poggio dei venti and the winds give us a turn accordingly at every window it is delightfully cool and i have not been able to bear my window open at night since our arrival also we get good milk and bread and eggs and wine and are not much at a loss for anything think of my forgetting to tell you robert would not forgive me for that how we have a specola or sort of belvedere at the top of the house which he delights in and which i shall enjoy presently when i have recovered my taste for climbing staircases he carried me up once but the being carried down was so much like being carried down the flue of a chimney that i waive the whole privilege for the future what is better to my mind is the expected fact of being able to get books at sienanearly as well as at breckers really though dumas fils seems to fill up many of the interstices where you think you have found something three pauls a month the subscription is and for seven we get a galignani or are promised to get it we pay for our villa ten scudi the month so that altogether it is not ruinous the air is as fresh as english air without english dampness and transition yes and we have english lanes with bowery tops of trees and brambles and blackberries and not a wall anywhere except the walls of our villa  for my part i am recovering strength i hope and believe certainly i can move about from one room to another without reeling much but i still look so ghastly as to back recoil perfectly knowing why from everything in the shape of a looking glass robert has found an armchair for me at siena to say the truth my time for enjoying this country life except the enchanting silence and the look from the window has not come yet i must wait for a little more strength wiedemans cheeks are beginning to redden already and he delights in the pigeons and the pig and the donkey and a great yellow dog and everything else now only he would change all your trees except the apple trees he says for the austrian band at any moment he is rather a town baby  our drawback is dear miss blagden that we have not room to take you in so sorry we both are indeed write and tell me whether you have decided about vallombrosa i hope we shall see much of you still at florence if not here we could give you everything here except a bed  roberts kindest regards with those of your ever affectionate elizabeth b browning  my love to miss agassiz whenever you see her   to miss mitford siena september 24 1850  to think that it is more than two months since i wrote last to you my beloved friend makes the said two months seem even longer to me than otherwise they would necessarily bea slow heavy two months in every case with all the weights of care and death hung at them your letter reached me when i was confined to my bed and could scarcely read it for all the strength at my heart as soon as i could be moved and before i could walk from one room to another dr harding insisted on the necessity of change of air for my part i seemed to myself more fit to change the world than the air and robert carried me into the railroad like a baby and off we came here to siena we took a villa a mile and a half from the town a villa situated on a windy hill called poggio al vento with magnificent views from all the windows and set in the midst of its own vineyard and olive ground apple trees and peach trees not to speak of a little square flowergarden for which we pay eleven shillings one penny farthing the week and at the end of these three weeks our medical comforters prophecy to which i listened so incredulously is fulfilled and i am able to walk a mile and am really as well as ever in all essential respects our poor little darling too see what disasters was ill fourandtwenty hours from a species of sunstroke and frightened us with a heavy hot head and glassy staring eyes lying in a halfstupor terrible the silence that fell suddenly upon the house without the small pattering feet and the singing voice but god spared us he grew quite well directly and sang louder than ever since we came here his cheeks have turned into roses  what still further depressed me during our latter days at florence was the dreadful event in americathe loss of our poor friend madame ossoli204 affecting in itself and also through association with that past when the arrowhead of anguish was broken too deeply into my life ever to be quite drawn out robert wanted to keep the news from me till i was stronger but we live too close for him to keep anything from me and then i should have known it from the first letter or visitor so there was no use trying the poor ossolis spent part of their last evening in italy with us he and she and their child and we had a note from her off gibraltar speaking of the captains death from smallpox afterwards it appears that her child caught the disease and lay for days between life and death recovered and then came the final agony deep called unto deep indeed now she is where there is no more grief and no more sea and none of the restless in this world none of the shipwrecked in heart ever seemed to me to want peace more than she did we saw much of her last winter and over a great gulf of differing opinion we both felt drawn strongly to her high and pure aspiration she hadyes and a tender womans heartand we honoured the truth and courage in her rare in woman or man the work she was preparing upon italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you indeed she told me it was the only production to which she had given time and labour but if rescued the manuscript would be nothing but the raw material i believe nothing was finished nor if finished could the work have been otherwise than deeply coloured by those blood colours of socialistic views which would have drawn the wolves on her with a still more howling enmity both in england and america therefore it was better for her to go only god and a few friends can be expected to distinguish between the pure personality of a woman and her professed opinions she was chiefly known in america i believe by oral lectures and a connection with the newspaper press neither of them happy means of publicity was she happy in anything i wonder she told me that she never was may god have made her happy in her death  such gloom she had in leaving italy so full she was of sad presentiment do you know she gave a bible as a parting gift from her child to ours writing in it in memory of angelo eugene ossolia strange prophetical expression that last evening a prophecy was talked of jestinglyan old prophecy made to poor marquis ossoli that he should shun the sea for that it would be fatal to him i remember how she turned to me smiling and said our ship is called the elizabeth and i accept the omen  now i am making you almost dull perhaps and myself certainly duller rather let me tell you dearest miss mitford how delightedly i look forward to reading whatever you have written or shall write you write as well as twenty years ago why i should think so indeed dont i know what your letters are havent i had faith in you always havent i in fact teased you half to death in proof of it i who was a sort of brutus and oughtnt to have done it you hinted moreover robert is a great admirer of yours as i must have told you before and has the pretension unjustly though as i tell him to place you still higher among writers than i do so that we are two in expectancy here may mr chorleys periodical live a thousand years  as my seagull wont but you will find it in my new edition and the doves and everything else worth a straw of my writing heres a fact which you must try to settle with your theories of simplicity and popularity none of these simple poems of mine have been favorites with general readers the unintelligible ones are always preferred i observe by extracters compilers and ladies and gentlemen who write to tell me that im a muse the very corn law leaguers in the north used to leave your seagulls to fly where they could and clap hands over mysteries of iniquity dearest miss mitfordfor the rest dont mistake what i write to you sometimesdont fancy that i undervalue simplicity and think nothing of legitimate famei only mean to say that the vogue which begins with the masses generally comes to nought béranger is an exceptional case from the form of his poems obviously while the appreciation beginning with the few always ends with the masses wasnt wordsworth for instance both simple and unpopular when he was most divine to go to the great from the small when i complain of the lamentable weakness of much in my seraphim volume i dont complain of the seagull and doves and the simple verses but exactly of the more ambitious ones i have had to rewrite pages upon pages of that volume oh such feeble rhymes and turns of thoughtsuch a dingy mistiness even robert couldnt say a word for much of it i took great pains with the whole and made considerable portions new only your favourites were not touchednot a word touched i think in the seagull and scarcely a word in the doves you wont complain of me a great deal i do hope and trust also i put back your little words into the house of clouds the two volumes are to come out it appears at the end of october not before because mr chapman wished to inaugurate them for his new house in piccadilly there are some new poems and one rather long ballad written at request of antislavery friends in america205 i arranged that it should come next to the cry of the children to appear impartial as to national grievances  ohbalzacwhat a loss one of the greatest and most original writers of the age gone from us to hear this news made robert and me very melancholy indeed there seems to be fatality just now with the writers of france soulié bernard gone too george sand translating mazzini sue in a socialistical state of decadencewhat he means by writing such trash as the péchés i really cant make out only alexandre dumas keeping his head up gallantly and he seems to me to write better than ever here is a new book just published by jules sandeau called sacs et parchemins have you seen it it miraculously comes to us from the little siena library  we stay in this villa till our month is out and then we go for a week into siena that i may be nearer the churches and pictures and see something of the cathedral and sodomas we calculated that it was cheaper to move our quarters than to have a carriage to and fro and then dr harding recommended repeated change of air for me and he has proved his ability so much so kindly too that we are bound to act on his opinions as closely as we can perhaps we may even go to volterra afterwards if the finances will allow of it if we do it may be for another week at farthest and then we return to florence you had better direct there as usual and do write and tell me much of yourself and set me down in your thoughts as quite well and ever yours in warm and grateful affection  ebb   footnote 204 drowned with her husband on their way to america  footnote 205 the runaway slave at pilgrims point   to miss mitford florence november 13 1850 postmark  i meant to cross your second letter and so my very dear friend you are a second time a prophetess as to my intentions while i am still more grateful than i could have been with the literal fulfilment delightful it is to hear from youdo always write when you can and though this second letter speaks of your having been unwell still i shall continue to flatter myself that upon the whole the better part prevails and that if the rains dont wash you away this winter i may have leave to think of you as strengthening and to strengthen still meanwhile you certainly as you say have roots to your feet never was anyone so pure as you from the drop of gypsey blood which tingles in my veins and my husbands and gives us every now and then a fever for roaming strong enough to carry us to mount caucasus if it were not for the healthy state of depletion observable in the purse i get fond of places so does he we both of us grew rather pathetical on leaving our sienese villa and shrank from parting with the pig but setting out on ones travels has a great charm oh i should like to be able to pay our way down the nile and into greece and into germany and into spain every now and then we take out the roadbooks calculate the expenses and groan in the spirit when its proved for the hundredth time that we cant do it one must have a home you see to keep ones books in and ones springsofas in but the charm of a home is a home to come back to do you understand no not you you have as much comprehension of the pleasure of that sort of thing as in the peculiar taste of the three ladies who hung themselves in a french balloon the other day operatically nude in order i conjecture to the ultimate perfection of french delicacy in morals and manners  i long to see your papers and dare say they are charming at the same time just because they are sure to be charming and notwithstanding their kindness to me notwithstanding that i live in a glass house myself warmed by such rare stoves i am a little in fear that your generosity and excess of kindness may run the risk of lowering the ideal of poetry in england by lifting above the mark the names of some poetasters do you know you take up your heart sometimes by mistake to admire with when you ought to use it only to love with and this is apt to be dangerous with your reputation and authority in matters of literature see how impertinent i am but we should all take care to teach the world that poetry is a divine thing should we not that is not mere versemaking though the verses be pretty in their way rather perish every verse i ever wrote for one than help to drag down an inch that standard of poetry which for the sake of humanity as well as literature should be kept high as for simplicity and clearness did i ever deny that they were excellent qualities never surely only they will not make poetry and absolutely vain they are and indeed all other qualities without the essential thing the genius the inspiration the insightlet us call it what we pleasewithout which the most accomplished versewriters had far better write prose for their own sakes as for the worldsdont you think so which i say because i sighed aloud over many names in your list and now have taken pertly to write out the sigh at length too charmingly you are sure to have writtenand see the danger but miss fanshawe is well worth your writing of let me say that i am sensible warmly of that as one of the most witty of our wits in verse men or women i have only seen manuscript copies of some of her verses and that years ago but they struck me very much and really i do not remember another female wit worthy to sit beside her even in french literature motherwell is a true poet but oh i dont believe in your john clares thomas davises whittiers hallocksand still less in other names which it would be invidious to name again how pert i am but you give me leave to be pert and you know the meaning of it all after all your editor quarrelled a little with me once and i with him about the poetesses of the united empire in whom i couldnt or wouldnt find a poet though there are extant two volumes of them and lady winchilsea at the head i hold that the writer of the ballad of robin gray was our first poetess rightly so called before joanna baillie  mr lever is in florence i believe now and was at the baths of lucca in the summer we never see him it is curious he made his way to us with the sunniest of faces and cordialest of manners at lucca and i who am much taken by manner was quite pleased with him and wondered how it was that i didnt like his books well he only wanted to see that we had the right number of eyes and no odd fingers robert in return for his visit called on him three times i think and i left my card on mrs lever but he never came againhe had seen enough of us he could put down in his private diary that we had neither claw nor tail and there an end properly enough in fact he lives a different life from ours he in the ballroom and we in the cave nothing could be more different and perhaps there are not many subjects of common interest between us i have seen extracts in the examiner from tennysons in memoriam which seemed to me exquisitely beautiful and pathetical oh theres a poet talking of poets have you read wordsworths last workthe legacy with regard to the elder miss jewsbury do you know i take mr chorleys part against you because although i know her only by her writings the writings seem to me to imply a certain vigour and originality of mind by no means ordinary for instance the fragments of her letters in his memorials of mrs hemans are much superior to any other letters almost in the volumecertainly to mrs hemanss own isnt this so and so you talk you in england of prince alberts folly do you really well among the odd things we lean to in italy is to an actual belief in the greatness and importance of the future exhibition we have actually imagined it to be a noble idea and you take me by surprise in speaking of the general distaste to it in england is it really possible for the agriculturists i am less surprised at coldness on their part but do you fancy that the manufacturers and freetraders are cold too is mr chorley against it equally yes i am glad to hear of mrs butlers successor fanny kembles ought i to say our little wiedeman who cant speak a word yet waxes hotter in his ecclesiastical and musical passion think of that baby just cutting his eyeteeth screaming in the streets till he is taken into the churches kneeling on his knees to the first sound of music and folding his hands and turning up his eyes in a sort of ecstatical state one scarcely knows how to deal with the sort of thing it is too soon for religious controversy he crosses himself i assure you robert says it is as well to have the eyeteeth and the puseyistical crisis over together the child is a very curious imaginative child but too excitable for his age thats all i complain of  god bless you my much loved friend write to  your ever affectionate ebb   what books by soulié have appeared since his death do you remember i have just got les enfants de lamour by sue i suppose he will prove in it the illegitimacy of legitimacy and vice versâ sue is in decided decadence for the rest since he has taken to illustrating socialism   to miss i blagden florence sunday morning about 1850  my dear miss blagdenin spite of all your drawing kindness we find it impossible to go to you on monday we are expecting friends from rome who will remain only a few days perhaps in florence now it seems to me that you very often pass our door do you not too often leave the trace of your goodness with me and would it not be better of you still if you would at once make use of us and give us pleasure by pausing here you and miss agassiz to rest and refresh yourselves with tea coffee or whatever else you may choose we shall be delighted to see you always and dont fancy that i say so out of form or tinkling cymbalism  thank you for your intention about the leader robert and i shall like much to see anything of john mills on the subject of socialism or any other by the british review do you mean the north british i read a clever article in that review some months ago on the german socialists ably embracing in its analysis the fraternity in france and attributed i have since heard to dr hanna the soninlaw and biographer of chalmers christian socialists are by no means a new sect the moravians representing the theory with as little offence and absurdity as may be what is it after all but an outofdoor extension of the monastic system the religious principle more or less apprehended may bind men together so absorbing their individualities and presenting an aim beyond the world but upon merely human and earthly principles no such system can stand i feel persuaded and i thank god for it if fourierism could be realised which it surely cannot out of a dream the destinies of our race would shrivel up under the unnatural heat and human nature would in my mind be desecrated and dishonoredbecause i do not believe in purification without suffering in progress without struggle in virtue without temptation least of all do i consider happiness the end of mans life we look to higher things have nobler ambitions  also in every advancement of the world hitherto the individual has led the masses thus to elicit individuality has been the object of the best political institutions and governments now in these new theories the individual is ground down into the multitude and society must be moving all together if it moves at allrestricting the very possibility of progress by the use of the lights of genius genius is always individual  heres a scribble upon grave matters i ought to be acknowledging instead your scrupulous honesty as illustrated by fivefranc pieces and tuscan florins make us as useful as you can do for the future and please us by coming often i am afraid your german baroness could not make an arrangement with you as you do not mention her give our best regards to miss agassiz and accept them yourself dear miss blagden from  your affectionate elizabeth barrett browning   to mr westwood florence thursday december 12 1850  my dear mr westwoodyour book has not reached us yet and so if i waited for that to write i might wait longer still but i dont wait for that because you bade me not to do so and besides we have only this moment finished reading in memoriam and it was a sort of miracle with us that we got it so soon  december 13the above sentences were written yesterday and hardly had they been written when your third letter came with its enclosure how very kind you are to me and how am i to thank you enough if you had not sent me the athenaeum article i never should have seen it probably for my husband only saw it in the reading room where women dont penetrate because in italy we cant read you see and where the periodicals are kept so strictly like hesperian apples by the dragons of the place that none can be stolen away even for half an hour so he could only wish me to catch sight of that articleand you are good enough to send it and oblige us both exceedingly for which kindness thank you thank you the favor shown to me in it is extreme and i am as grateful as i ought to be shall i ask the note and query magazine why the athenaeum does show me so much favor while as in a late instance so little justice is shown to my husband its a problem like another as for poetry i hope to do better things in it yet though i have a child to stand in my sunshine as you suppose he must but he only makes the sunbeams brighter with his glistening curls little darlingand who can complain of that you cant think what a good sweet curious imagining child he is half the day i do nothing but admire himtheres the truth he doesnt talk yet much but he gesticulates with extraordinary force of symbol and makes surprising revelations to us every halfhour or so meanwhile flush loses nothing i assure you on the contrary he is hugged and kissed rather too hard sometimes and never is permitted to be found fault with by anybody under the new régime if flush is scolded baby cries as matter of course and he would do admirably for a whippingboy if that excellent institution were to be revived by young england and the tractarians for the benefit of our deteriorated generations i was ill towards the end of last summer and we had to go to siena for the sake of getting strength again and there we lived in a villa among a sea of little hills and wrapt up in vineyards and olive yards enjoying everything much the worst of italy is the drawback about books somebody said the other day that we sate here like posterityreading books with the gloss off them but our case in reality is far more dreary seeing that prince posterity will have glossy books of his own how exquisite in memoriam is how earnest and true after all the gloss never can wear off books like that  and as to your book it will come it will come and meantime i may assure you that posterity is very impatient for it the italian poem will be read with the interest which is natural you know its a more than doubtful point whether shakespeare ever saw italy out of a vision yet he and a crowd of inferior writers have written about venice and vineyards as if born to the manner of them we hear of carlyle travelling in france and germanybut i must leave room for the words you ask for from a certain hand below  ever dear mr westwoods obliged and faithful  ebb  and the certain hand will write its best and far better than any poor pippa passes in recording a feeling which does not pass at all that of gratitude for all such generous sympathy as dear mr westwoods for ebb and in his proper degree r browning   to miss mitford florence december 13 1850  did i write a scolding letter dearest miss mitford so much the better when people deserve to be scolded the worst is however that it sometimes does them no sort of good and that they will sit on among the ruins of carthage let ever so many messages come from italy my only hope now is that you will have a mild winter in england as we seem likely to have it here and that in the spring by the help of some divine interposition of friends supernaturally endowed after the manner of mr chorley you may be made to go away into a house with fast walls and chimneys certainly if you could be made to write anything else is possible thats my comfort and the others my hope as i said and so between hope and consolation i neednt scold any more let me tell you what i have heard of mrs gaskell for fear i should forget it later she is connected by marriage with mrs at thompson and from a friend of mrs thompsons it came to me and really seems to exonerate chapman  hall from the charge advanced against them mary barton was shown in manuscript to mrs thompson and failed to please her and in deference to her judgment certain alterations were made subsequently it was offered to all or nearly all the publishers in london and rejected chapman  hall accepted and gave a hundred pounds as you heard for the copyright of the work and though the success did not perhaps that is quite possible induce any liberality with regard to copies they gave another hundred pounds upon printing the second edition and it was not in the bond to do so i am told that the liberality of the proceeding was appreciated by the author and her friends accordinglyand theres the end of my story two hundred pounds is a good priceisnt itfor a novel as times go miss lynn had only a hundred and fifty for her egyptian novel or perhaps for the greek one taking the long run of poetry if it runs at all i am half given to think that it pays better than the novel does in spite of everything not that we speak out of golden experience alas no we have had not a sou from our books for a year past the booksellers being bound of course to cover their own expenses first then this christmas account has not yet reached us but the former editions paid us regularly so much a year and so will the present ones i hope only i was not thinking of them in preferring what may strike you as an extravagant paradox but of tennysons returns from moxon last year which i understand amounted to five hundred pounds to be sure in memoriam was a new success which should not prevent our considering the fact of a regular income proceeding from the previous books a novel flashes up for a season and does not often outlast it for mary barton i am a little little disappointed do you know i have just done reading it there is power and truthshe can shake and she can piercebut i wish half the book away it is so tedious every now and then and besides i want more beauty more air from the universal worldthese classbooks must always be defective as works of art how could i help being disappointed a little when mrs jameson told me that since the bride of lammermoor nothing had appeared equal to mary barton then the style of the book is slovenly and given to a kind of phraseology which would be vulgar even as colloquial english oh it is a powerful book in many ways you are not to set me down as hypercritical probably the author will write herself clear of many of her faults she has strength enough as to in memoriam i have seen it i have read itdear mr kenyon had the goodness to send it to me by an american travellerand now i really do disagree with you for the book has gone to my heart and soul i think it full of deep pathos and beauty all i wish away is the marriage hymn at the end and that for every reason i wish awayits a discord in the music the monotony is a part of the positionthe sea is monotonous and so is lasting grief your complaint is against fate and humanity rather than against the poet tennyson who that has suffered has not felt wave after wave break dully against one rock till brain and heart with all their radiances seemed lost in a single shadow so the effect of the book is artistic i think and indeed i do not wonder at the opinion which has reached us from various quarters that tennyson stands higher through having written it you see what he appeared to want according to the view of many was an earnest personality and direct purpose in this last book though of course there is not room in it for that exercise of creative faculty which elsewhere established his fame he appeals heart to heart directly as from his own to the universal heart and we all feel him nearer to usi doand so do others have you read a poem called the roman which was praised highly in the athenaeum but did not seem to robert to justify the praise in the passages extracted written by somebody with certainly a nom de guerresidney yendys observe yendys is sidney reversed have you heard anything about it or seen the athenaeum has been gracious to me beyond gratitude almost nothing could by possibility be kinder a friend of mine sent me the article from brusselsa mr westwood who writes poems himself yes and poetical poems too written with an odorous fresh sense of poetry about them he has not original power mores the pity but he has stayed near the rose in the sweet breath and buddings of the spring and although that wont make anyone live beyond springweather it is the expression of a sensitive and aspirant nature and the man is interesting and amiablean old correspondent of mine and kind to me always from the little i know of mr bennett i should say that mr westwood stood much higher in the matter of gifts though i fear that neither of them will make way in that particular department of literature selected by them for action oh my dearest friend you may talk about coteries but the english society at florence from what i hear of the hum of it at a distance is worse than any coteriesociety in the world a coterie if i understand the thing is informed by a unity of sentiment or faith or prejudice but this society here is not informed at all people come together to gamble or dance and if theres an end why so much the better but theres not an end in most cases by any manner of means and against every sort of innocence mind i imply nothing about mr lever who lives irreproachably with his wife and family rides out with his children in a troop of horses to the cascine and yet is as social a person as his joyous temperament leads him to be but we live in a cave and peradventure he is afraid of the damp of uswho knows we know very few residents in florence and these with chance visitors chiefly americans are all that keep us from solitude every now and then in the evening somebody drops in to tea would indeed you were near but should i be satisfied with you once a week do you fancy ah you would soon love robert you couldnt help it i am sure i should be soon turned down to an underplace and under the circumstances would not struggle do you remember once telling me that all men are tyrantsas sweeping an opinion as the apostles that all men are liars well if you knew robert you would make an exception certainly talking of the artistical english here somebody told me the other day of a young cambridge or oxford man who deducted from his researches in rome and florence that michael angelo was a wag another after walking through the florentine galleries exclaimed to a friend of mine i have seen nothing here equal to those magnificent pictures in paris by paul de kock my friend humbly suggested that he might mean paul de la roche but see what english you send us for the most part we have had one very interesting visitor lately the grandson of goethe he did us the honour he said of spending two days in florence on our account he especially wishing to see robert on account of some sympathy of view about paracelsus there can scarcely be a more interesting young manquite young he seems and full of aspiration of the purest kind towards the good and true and beautiful and not towards the poor laurel crowns attainable from any possible public i dont know when i have been so charmed by a visitor and indeed robert and i paid him the highest compliment we could by wishing one to another that our little wiedeman might be like him some day i quite agree with you about the church of your henry it surprises me that a child of seven years should find pleasure even once a day in the long english servicetoo long according to my doxy for matured years as to fanaticism it depends on a defect of intellect rather than on an excess of the adoring faculty the latter cannot i think be too fully developed how i shall like you to see our wiedeman he is a radiant little creature really yet he wont talk he does nothing but gesticulate only making his will and pleasure wonderfully clear and supreme i assure you hes a tyrant ready made for your theory if your book is better than i expect what will it be god bless you be well and love me and write to me for i am your ever affectionate  ba   to mrs martin florence january 30 1851  here i am at last dearest friend but you forget how you told me when you wrote your long letter that you were going away into chaos somewhere and that your address couldnt be known yet it was this which made me delay the answer to that welcome letterand to begin to put off is fatal as perhaps you know now forgive me and i will behave better in future indeed  i am quite well and looking well they say but the frightful illness of the autumn left me paler and thinner long after the perfect recovery the physician told robert afterwards that few women would have recovered at all and when i left siena i was as able to walk and as well in every respect as ever notwithstanding everythingthink for instance of my walking to st miniato here in florence you remember perhaps what that pull is i dare say you heard from henrietta how we enjoyed our rustication at siena it is pleasant even to look back on it we were obliged to look narrowly at the economies more narrowly than usual but the cheapness of the place suited the occasion and the little villa like a mere tent among the vines charmed us though the doors didnt shut and though on account of the smallness robert and i had to whisper all our talk whenever wiedeman was asleep oh i wish you were in italy i wish you had come here this winter which has been so mild and which with ordinary prudence would certainly have suited dear mr martin i tried to dissuade the peytons from making the experiment through the fear of its not answering we cant get them into society you see because we are out of it having struggled to keep out of it with hands and feet and partially having succeeded knowing scarcely anybody except bringers of letters of introduction and those chiefly americans and not residents in florence the other day however mrs trollope and her daughterinlaw called on us and it is settled that we are to know them though robert had made a sort of vow never to sit in the same room with the author of certain books directed against liberal institutions and victor hugos poetry i had a longer battle to fight on the matter of this vow than any since my marriage and had some scruples at last of taking advantage of the pure goodness which induced him to yield to my wishes but i did because i hate to seem ungracious and unkind to people and human beings besides are better than their books than their principles and even than their everyday actions sometimes i am always crying out blessed be the inconsistency of men then i thought it probable that the first shock of the cold water being over he would like the proposed new acquaintances very muchand so it turns out she was very agreeable and kind and goodnatured and talked much about you which was a charm of itself and we mean to be quite friends and to lend each other books and to forget one anothers offences in print or otherwise also she admits us on her private days for she has public days dreadful to relate and is in the full flood and flow of florentine society do write to me will you or else i shall set you down as vexed with me the state of politics here is dismal newspapers put down protestant places of worship shut up it is so bad that it must soon be better what are you both thinking of the papal aggression206 are you frightened are you frenzied for my part i cant get up much steam about it the great insult was simply a great mistake the consequence natural enough of the tractarian idiocies as enacted in italy  god bless both of you dearest and always remembered friends roberts best regards he says  your affectionate ba  tell me your thoughts about france i am so anxious about the crisis there207 we have had a very interesting visit lately from the grandson of goethe  footnote 206 the papal bull appointing roman catholic bishops throughout england was issued on september 24 1850 and england was now in the throes of the antipapal excitement produced by it  footnote 207 where louis napoleon was engaged in his series of encroachments on the power of the assembly and intrigues for the imperial throne   to miss browning florence april 23 1851 postmark  my dearest sariannai do hope that robert takes his share of the blame in using and abusing you as we have done it was altogether too badshamefulto send that last ms for you to copy out and i did indeed make a little outcry about it only he insisted on having it so was it very wrong i wonder your kindness and affectionateness i never doubt of but if you are not quite strong just now you might be teased in spite of your heart by all that copying worknot pleasant at any time well believe that i thank you at least gratefully for what you have done so quickly too the advertisement at the end of the week proves how you must have worked for me thank you dear sarianna  robert will have told you our schemes and how we are going to work and are to love you near for the future i hope you who are wise will approve of us i think for keeping on our florentine apartment so as to run no more risk than is necessary in making the paris experiment we shall let the old dear rooms and make money by them and keep them to fall back upon in case we fail at paris but well not fail well i hope not though i am very brittle still and susceptible to climate dearest sarianna it will do you infinite good to come over to us every now and thenyou want change absolute change of scene and air and climate i am confident and you never will be right till you have had it we talk robert and i of carrying you back with us to rome next year as an english trophy meanwhile you will see wiedeman you and dear mr browning dont expect to see a baby of anak thats all robert is always measuring him on the door and reporting such wonderful growth some inch a week i think that if you receive his reports you will cry out on beholding the child at least youll say how little he must have been to be no larger now youll fancy he must have begun from a mustardseed the fact is he is small only full of life and joy to the brim i am not afraid of your not loving him nor of his not loving you he has a loving little heart i assure you if anyone pricks a finger with a needle he begins to cryhe cant bear to see the least living thing hurt and when he loves it is well robert says i must finish so here ends dearest sariannas  ever affectionate sister ba     end of the first volume smith elder  cos new books
