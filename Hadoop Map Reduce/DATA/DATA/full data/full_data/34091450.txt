so rang forth the supplication echoing from rock and fell as the people of claudiodunum streamed forth in the may sunshine to invoke a blessing on the cornlands olives and vineyards that won vantage ground on the terraces carefully kept up on the slopes of the wonderful needleshaped hills of auvergne  very recently had the church of gaul commenced the custom of going forth on the days preceding the ascension feast to chant litanies calling down the divine protection on field and fold corn and wine basket and store  it had been begun in a time of deadly peril from famine and earthquake wild beast and wilder foes and it had been adopted in the neighbouring dioceses as a regular habit as indeed it continued throughout the western church during the fourteen subsequent centuries  one great procession was formed by different bands  the children were in two troops a motley collection of all shades the deep olive and the rolling black eye betraying ethiopian or moorish slave ancestry the soft dark complexion and deep brown eye showing the roman and the rufous hair and freckled skin the lower grade of cymric kelt while a few had the more stately pose violet eye and black hair of the gael  the boys were marshalled with extreme difficulty by two or three young monks their sisters walked far more orderly under the care of some consecrated virgin of mature age  the men formed another troop the hardy mountaineers still wearing the gallic trousers and plaid though the artisans and mechanics from the town were clad in the tunic and cloak that were the later roman dress and such as could claim the right folded over them the white purpleedged scarf to which the toga had dwindled  among the women there was the same scale of decreasing nationality of costume according to rank though the culmination was in resemblance to the graceful classic robe of rome instead of the last parisian mode  the poorer women wore bright dark crimson or blue in gown or wrapping veil the ladies were mostly in white or black as were also the clergy excepting such as had officiated at the previous eucharist and who wore their brilliant priestly vestments heavy with gold and embroidery  beautiful alike to eye and ear was the procession above all from a distance now filing round a delicate young green wheatfield now lost behind a rising hill now glancing through a vineyard or contrasting with the gray tints of the olive all that was incongruous or disorderly unseen and all that was discordant unheard as only the harmonious cadence of the united response was wafted fitfully on the breeze to the two elderly men who unable to scale the wild mountain paths in the procession had after the previous service in the basilica and the blessing of the nearer lands returned to the villa where they sat watching its progress  it was as entirely a roman villa as the form of the ground and the need of security would permit  lying on the slope of a steep hill which ran up above into a fantastic column or needle piercing the sky the courts of the villa were necessarily a succession of terraces levelled and paved with steps of stone or marble leading from one to the other  a strong stone wall enclosed the whole cloistered as a protection from sun and storm  the lowest court had a gateway strongly protected and thence a broad walk with box trees on either side trimmed into fantastic shapes led through a lawn laid out in regular flowerbeds to the second court which was paved with polished marble and had a fountain in the midst with vases of flowers and seats around  above was another broad flight of stone steps leading to a portico running along the whole front of the house with the principal chambers opening into it  behind lay another court serving as stables for the horses and mules as farmyard and with the quarters of the slaves around it and higher up there stretched a dense pine forest protecting the whole establishment from avalanches and torrents of stones from the mountain peak above  under the portico whose pillars were cut from the richlycoloured native marbles reposed the two friends on low couches  one was a finelooking man with a grand bald forehead encircled with a wreath of oak showing that in his time he had rescued a romans life  he also wore a richlyembroidered purple toga the token of high civic rank for he had put on his full insignia as a senator and of consular rank to do honour to the ceremonial  indeed he would not have abstained from accompanying the procession but that his guest though no more aged than himself was manifestly unequal to the rugged expedition begun fasting in the morning chill and concluded likewise fasting in the noonday heat  still it would scarcely have distressed those sturdy limbs well developed and preserved by roman training never permitted by him to degenerate into effeminacy  and as his fine countenance and well knit frame testified marcus aemilius victorinus inherited no small share of genuine roman blood  his noble name might be derived through clientela and his lineage had a gallic intermixture but the true quirite predominated in his character and temperament  the citizenship of his family dated back beyond the first establishment of the colony and rank property and personal qualities alike rendered him the first man in the district its chief magistrate and protector from the visigoths who claimed it as part of their kingdom of aquitania  so much of the spirit of vercingetorix survived among the remnant of his tribe that arvernia had never been overrun and conquered but had held out until actually ceded by one of the degenerate augusti at ravenna and then favourable terms had been negotiated partly by aemilius the senator as he was commonly called and partly by the honoured friend who sat beside him another relic of the good old times when southern gaul enjoyed perfect peace as a favoured province of the empire  this guest was a man of less personal beauty than the senator and more bowed and aged but with care and illhealth more than years for the two had been comrades in school fellowsoldiers and magistrates working simultaneously and with firm mutual trust all their days  the dress of the visitor was shaped like that of the senator but of somewhat richer and finer texture  he too wore the toga praetextata but he had a large gold cross hanging on his breast and an episcopal ring on his finger and instead of the wreath of bay he might have worn and which encircled his bust in the capitol the scanty hair on his finelymoulded head showed the marks of the tonsure  his brow was a grand and expansive one his gray eyes were full of varied expression keen humour and sagacity a lofty devotion sometimes changing his countenance in a wonderful manner even in the present wreck of his former self when the cheeks showed furrows worn by care and suffering and the once flexible and resolute mouth had fallen in from loss of teeth  for this was the scholar soldier poet gentleman letterwriter statesman sidonius apollinaris who had stood on the steps of the imperial throne of the west had been crowned as an orator in the capitol and then had been called by the exigences of his country to give up his learned ease and become the protector of the arvernii as a patriot bishop where he had well and nobly served his god and his country and had won the respect not only of the catholic gauls but of the arian goths  jealousy and evil tongues had however prevailed to cause his banishment from his beloved hills and when he repaired to the court of king euric to solicit permission to return he was long detained there and had only just obtained license to go back to his see  he had arrived only a day or two previously at the villa exhausted by his journey and though declaring that his dear mountain breezes must needs restore him and that it was a joy to inhale them yet as he heard of the oppressions that were coming on his people the mountain gales could only a momentary bliss bestow and aemilius justly feared that the decay of his health had gone too far for even the breezes and baths of arvernia to reinvigorate him  his own mountain estate where dwelt his son was of difficult access early in the year and aemilius hoped to persuade him to rest in the villa till after pentecost and then to bless the nuptials of columba aemilia the last unwedded daughter of the house with titus julius verronax a young arvernian chief of the lineage of vercingetorix highly educated in all latin and greek culture and a roman citizen much as a highland chieftain is an englishman  his home was on an almost inaccessible peak or puy which the senator pointed out to the bishop saying  i would fain secure such a refuge for my family in case the tyranny of the barbarians should increase  are there any within the city asked the bishop  i rejoice to see that thou art free from the indignity of having any quartered upon thee  for which i thank heaven responded the senator  the nearest are on the farm of deodatus in the valley  there is a stout old warrior named meinhard who calls himself of the kings trust not a bad old fellow in himself to deal with but with endless sons followers and guests whom poor deodatus and julitta have to keep supplied with whatever they choose to call for being forced to witness their riotous orgies night after night  even so we are far better off than our countrymen who have the heathen franks for their lords  that heaven forbid said aemilius  these goths are at least christians though heretics yet i shall be heartily glad when the circuit of deodatuss fields is over  the good man would not have them left unblest but the heretical barbarians make it a point of honour not to hear the blessed name invoked without mockery such as our youths may hardly brook  they are unarmed said the bishop  true but as none knows better than thou dost dear father and friend the arvernian blood has not cooled since the days of caius julius caesar and offences are frequent among the young men  so often has our community had to pay wehrgeld as the barbarians call the price they lay upon blood that i swore at last that i would never pay it again were my own son the culprit  such oaths are perilous said sidonius  hast thou never had cause to regret this  my father thou wouldst have thought it time to take strong measures to check the swaggering of our young men and the foolish provocations that cost more than one life  one would stick a peacocks feather in his cap and go strutting along with folded arms and swelling breast and when the goths scowled at him and called him by welldeserved names a challenge would lead to a deadly combat  another such fight was caused by no greater offence than the treading on a dogs tail but in that it was the roman or more truly the gaul who was slain and i must say the wehrgeld was honourably paid  it is time however that such groundless conflicts should cease and in truth only a barbarian could be satisfied to let gold atone for life  it is certainly neither divine law nor human equity said the bishop  yet where no distinction can be made between the deliberate murder and the hasty blow i have seen cause to be thankful for the means of escaping the utmost penalty  has this oath had the desired effect  there has been only one case since it was taken replied aemilius that was a veritable murder  a vicious dissolute lad stabbed a wounded goth in a lonely place out of vengeful spite  i readily delivered him up to the kinsfolk for justice and as this proved me to be in earnest these wanton outrages have become much more rare unfortunately however the fellow was son to one of the widows of the churcha holy woman and a favourite of my little columba who daily feeds and tends the poor thing and thinks her old father very cruel  alas from the beginning the doom of the guilty has struck the innocent said the bishop  in due retribution as even the heathen knew   perfect familiarity with the great greek tragedians was still the mark of a gentleman and then sidonius quoted from sophocles      compassd with dazzling light    throned on olympuss height his front the eternal god uprears by toils unwearied and unaged by years    far back through ages past       far on through time to come    hath been and still must last       sins neverchanging doom   aemilius capped it from aeschylus   but justice holds her equal scales    with everwaking eye oer some her vengeful might prevails    when their lifes sun is high    on some her vigorous judgments light    in that dread pause twixt day and night       lifes closing twilight hour but soon as once the genial plain has drunk the lifeblood of the slain indelible the spots remain       and aye for vengeance call   yea said the bishop such was the universal law given to noah ere the parting of the nationsblood for blood  and yet where should we be did not mercy rejoice against justice and the blood of sprinkling speak better things than the blood of abel  nay think not that i blame thee my dear brother  thou art the judge of thy people and well do i know that one act of stern justice often as in this instance prevents innumerable deeds of senseless violence  moreover returned the senator it was by the relaxing of the ancient roman sternness of discipline and resolution that the horrors of the triumvirate began and that later on spirit decayed and brought us to our present fallen state  by this time the procession which had long since passed from their sight was beginning to break up and disperse  a flock of little children first appeared all of whom went aside to the slaves quarters except one who came running up the path between the box trees  he was the eldest grandson and namesake of the senator a darkeyed brownhaired boy of seven with the golden bulla hanging round his neck  up he came to the old mans knee proud to tell how he had scaled every rock and never needed any help from the pedagogue slave who had watched over him  sawest thou any barbarians my victorinus asked his grandfather  they stood thickly about deodatuss door and publius said they were going to mock but we looked so bold and sang so loud that they durst not  and verronax is come down papa with celer and celer wanted to sing too but they would not let him and he was so good that he was silent the moment his master showed him the leash  then is celer a hound asked the bishop amused  a hound of the old stock that used to fight battles for bituitus returned the child  oh papa i am so hungry  he really did say papa the fond domestic name which passed from the patriarch of the household to the father of the roman church  thy mother is watching for thee  run to her and she will give thee a cakeaye and a bath before thy dinner  so verronax is come  i am glad thou wilt see him my father  the youth has grown up with my own children and is as dear to me as my own son  ah here comes my columba  for the maidens were by this time returning and columba robed in white with a black veil worn mantilla fashion over her raven hair so as to shade her soft liquid dark eyes came up the steps and with a graceful obeisance to her father and the bishop took the seat to which the former drew her beside them  has all gone well my little dove asked her father  perfectly well so far my father she replied but there was anxiety in her eyes until the gate again opened and admitted the male contingent of the procession  no sooner had she seen them safely advancing up the box avenue than she murmured something about preparing for the meal and desiring a dismissal from her father disappeared into the womens apartments while the old man smiled at her pretty maidenly modesty  of the three men who were advancing one marcus aemilius about seven or eight and twenty years of age was much what the senator must have been at his agesturdy resolute with keen eyes and crisp curled short black hair  his younger brother lucius was taller slighter more delicately made with the same pensive italian eyes as his sister and a gentle thoughtful countenance the tonsure had not yet touched his soft dark brown locks but it was the last time he would march among the laity for both by his own desire and that of his dead mother he was destined to the priesthood  beside these two brothers came a much taller figure the arvernii seem to have been gael rather than cymri and the mountain chief titus julius verronax as the romans rendered his name of fearnagh was of the purest descent  he had thick wavy chestnut hair not cut so short as that of the romans though kept with the same care  his eyebrows were dark his eyes both in hue and brightness like a hawks his features nobly moulded and his tall form though large and stately was in perfect symmetry and had the free bearing and light springiness befitting a mountaineer he wore the toga as an official scarf but was in his national garb of the loose trousers and short coat and the gold torq round his neck had come to him from prehistoric ages  he had the short roman sword in his belt and carried in his hand a long huntingspear without which he seldom stirred abroad as it served him both as alpenstock and as defence against the wolves and bears of the mountains  behind him stalked a magnificent dog of a kind approaching the irish wolfhound a perfect picture of graceful outline and of strength swiftness and dignity slightly shaggy and of tawny colouringin all respects curiously like his master  in language learning and manners verronax the arvernian was however a highly cultivated roman as sidonius perceived in the first word of respectful welcome that he spoke when presented to the bishop  all had gone off well  old meinhard had been on the watch and had restrained any insult if such had been intended by the other goths who had stood watching in silence the blessing of the fields and vineyards of deodatus  the peril over the aemilian household partook cheerfully of the social meal  marina the wife of marcus and columba sat on carved chairs the men of the family reclining on the couches constructed to hold three  the bright wit of sidonius an eminent conversationalist shone the more brightly for his rejoicing at his return to his beloved country and flock and to the friend of his youth  there were such gleams in the storms that were overwhelming the tottering empire to which indeed these men belonged only in heart and in name  the meal was for a fast day and consisted of preparations of eggs milk flour and fish from the mountain streams but daintily cooked for the traditions of the old roman gastronomy survived and marina though half a gaul was anxious that her housekeeping should shine in the eyes of the bishop who in his secular days had been known to have a full appreciation of the refinements of the table  when the family rose and the benediction had been pronounced columba was seen collecting some of the remnants in a basket  thou surely dost not intend going to that widow of thine today exclaimed her sisterinlaw marina after such a walk on the mountain  indeed i must sister replied columba she was in much pain and weakness yesterday and needs me more than usual  and it is close to the farm of deodatus marina continued to object where the slaves tell me there are i know not how many fresh barbarian guests  i shall of course take stentor and athenais said columba  a pair of slaves can be of no use  marcus dost thou hear  forbid thy sisters folly  i will guard my sister said lucius becoming aware of what was passing  who should escort her save myself said the graceful verronax turning at the same moment from replying to some inquiries from the bishop  i doubt whether his escort be not the most perilous thing of all sighed marina  come marina said her husband goodhumouredly be not always a boder of ill  thou deemest a goth worse than a gorgon or hydra whereas i assure you they are very good fellows after all if you stand up to them like a man and trust their word  old meinhard is a capital hunting comrade  wherewith the worthy marcus went off with his little son at his heels to inspect the doings of the slaves in the farmcourt in the rear having no taste for the occupation of his father and the bishop who composed themselves to listen to a ms of the letters of s gregory nazianzen which sidonius had lately acquired and which was read aloud to them by a secretary slave  some time had thus passed when a confused sound made the senator start up  he beheld his daughter and her escort within the lower court but the slaves were hastily barring the gates behind them and loud cries of justice  vengeance in the gothic tongue struck his only too wellaccustomed ears  columba flung herself before him crying  o father have pity  it was for our holy faith  he blasphemed was all that was uttered by verronax on whose dress there was blood  open the gates called out the senator as the cry outside waxed louder  none shall cry for justice in vain at the gate of an aemilius  go marcus admit such as have a right to enter and be heard  rise my daughter show thyself a true roman and christian maiden before these barbarians  and thou my son alas what hast thou done he added turning to verronax and taking his arm while walking towards the tribunal where he did justice as chief magistrate of the roman settlement  a few words told all  while columba was engaged with her sick widow a young stranger goth strolled up one who had stood combing his long fair hair and making contemptuous gestures as the rogation procession passed in the morning  he and his comrades began offensively to scoff at the two young men for having taken part in the procession uttering the blasphemies which the invocation of our blessed lord was wont to call forth  verronax turned wrathfully round a hasty challenge passed a rapid exchange of blows and while the arvernian received only a slight scratch the goth fell slain before the hovel  his comrades were unarmed and intimidated  they rushed back to fetch weapons from the house of deodatus and there had been full time to take columba safely home verronax and his dog stalking statelily in the rear as her guardians  thou shouldst have sought thine impregnable crag my son said the senator sadly  to bring the barbarian vengeance upon this house responded verronax  alas my son thou knowst mine oath  i know it my father  it forbids not thy ransoming thyself  verronax smiled slightly and touched the collar at his throat  this is all the gold that i possess  the senator rapidly appraised it with his eye  there was a regular tariff on the lives of free romans free goths guests and trusted men of the king and if the deceased were merely a lite or freeman of the lowest rank it was just possible that the gold collar might purchase its masters life provided he were not too proud to part with the ancestral badge  by this time the tribunal had been reacheda special portion of the peristyle with a curule chair inlaid with ivory placed on a tesselated pavement as in the old days of the republic and a servant on each side held the lictors axe and bundle of rods which betokened stern roman justice wellnigh a mockery now  the forum of the city would have been the regular place but since an earthquake had done much damage there and some tumults had taken place among the citizens the seat of judgment had by general consent been placed in the aemilian household as the place of chief security and as he was the accredited magistrate with their gothic masters as sidonius had been before his banishment  as sidonius looked at the grave face of the senator set like a rock but deadly pale he thought it was no unworthy representative of brutus or manlius of old who sat on that seat  alas would he not be bound by his fatal oath to be only too true a representative of their relentless justice  on one side of the judgmentseat stood verronax towering above all around behind him marina and columba clinging together trembling and tearful but their weeping restrained by the looks of the senator and by a certain remnant of hope  to the other side advanced the goths all much larger and taller men than any one except the young gaulish chieftain  the foremost was a ruggedlooking veteran with grizzled locks and beard and a sunburnt face  this was meinhard the head of the garrison on deodatuss farm a man well known to aemilius and able to speak latin enough to hold communication with the romans  several younger men pressed rudely behind him but they were evidently impressed by the dignity of the tribunal though it was with a loud and fierce shout that they recognised verronax standing so still and unmoved  silence exclaimed the senator lifting his ivory staff  meinhard likewise made gestures to hush them and they ceased while the senator greeting meinhard and inviting him to share his seat of authority demanded what they asked  right was their cry  right on the slayer of odorik the son of odo of the lineage of odin our guest and of the kings trust  right shall ye have o goths returned aemilius  a roman never flinches from justice  who are witnesses to the deed  didst thou behold it o meinhard son of thorulf  no noble aemilius  it had not been wrought had i been present but here are those who can avouch it  stand forth egilulf son of amalrik  it needs not said verronax  i acknowledge the deed  the goth scoffed at us for invoking a created man  i could not stand by to hear my master insulted and i smote him but in open fight whereof i bear the token  that is true said meinhard  i know that verronax the arvernian would strike no coward blow  therefore did i withhold these comrades of odorik from rushing on thee in their fury but none the less art thou in feud with odo the father of odorik who will require of thee either thy blood or the wehrgeld  wehrgeld i have none to pay returned verronax in the same calm voice  i have sworn said aemilius in a clear low voice steady but full of suppressed anguish  a shriek was heard among the women and sidonius stepped forth and demanded the amount of wehrgeld  that must be for king euric to decide returned meinhard  he will fix the amount and it will be for odo to choose whether he will accept it  the mulct will be high for the youth was of high baltic blood and had but lately arrived with his father from the north  enough said verronax  listen meinhard  thou knowest me and the arvernian faith  leave me this night to make my peace with heaven and my parting with man  at the hour of six tomorrow morning i swear that i will surrender myself into thine hands to be dealt with as it may please the father of this young man  so let it be meinhard said aemilius in a stifled voice  i know aemilius and i know verronax returned the goth  they grasped hands and then meinhard drew off his followers leaving two at the request of marcus to act as sentinels at the gate  the senator sat with his hands clasped over his face in unutterable grief columba threw herself into the arms of her betrothed marina tore her hair and shrieked out  i will not hold my peace  it is cruel  it is wicked  it is barbarous  silence marina said verronax  it is just  i am no ignorant child  i knew the penalty when i incurred it  my columba remember though it was a hasty blow it was in defence of our masters name  the thought might comfort her by and by as yet it could not  the senator rose and took his hand  thou dost forgive me my son he said  i should find it hard to forgive one who lessened my respect for the aemilian constancy returned verronax  then he led marcus aside to make arrangements with him respecting his small mountain estate and the remnant of his tribe since marina was his nearest relative and her little son would if he were cut off be the sole heir to the ancestral glories of vercingetorix  and i cannot stir to save such a youth as that cried the senator in a tone of agony as he wrung the hand of sidonius  i have bound mine own hands when i would sell all i have to save him  o my friend and father well mightest thou blame my rashness and doubt the justice that could be stern where the heart was not touched  but i am not bound by thine oath my friend said sidonius  true it is that the master would not be served by the temporal sword yet such zeal as that of this youth merits that we should strive to deliver him  utmost justice would here be utmost wrong  may i send one of your slaves as a messenger to my son to see what he can raise  though i fear me gold and silver is more scarce than it was in our younger days  this was done and young lucius also took a summons from the bishop to the deacons of the church in the town authorising the use of the sacred vessels to raise the ransom but almost all of these had been already parted with in the time of a terrible famine which had ravaged arvernia a few years previously and had denuded all the wealthy and charitable families of their plate and jewels  indeed verronax shrank from the treasure of the church being thus applied columba might indeed weep for him exultingly as a martyr but as he well knew martyrs do not begin as murderers and passion pugnacity and national hatred had been uppermost with him  it was the hap of war and he was ready to take it patiently and prepare himself for death as a brave christian man but not a hero or a martyr and there was little hope either that a ransom so considerable as the rank of the parties would require could be raised without the aid of the aemilii or that even if it were the fierce old father would accept it  the more civilised goths whose families had ranged italy spain and aquitaine for two or three generations made murder the matter of bargain that had shocked aemilius but this was an old man from the mountain cradle of the race unsophisticated and but lately converted  in the dawn of the summer morning bishop sidonius celebrated the holy eucharist for the mournful family in the oratory a vaulted chamber underground which had served the same purpose in the days of persecution and had the ashes of two tortured martyrs of the aemilian household mistress and slave enshrined together beneath the altar which had since been richly inlaid with coloured marble  afterwards a morning meal was served for verronax and for the elder aemilius who intended to accompany him on his sad journey to bordigala where the king and the father of odorik were known to be at the time  sidonius who knew himself to have some interest with euric would fain have gone with them but his broken health rendered a rapid journey impossible and he hoped to serve the friends better by remaining to console the two women and to endeavour to collect the wehrgeld in case it should be accepted  the farewells owing to the roman dignity of aemilius and the proud selfrespect of the arvernian were more calm than had been feared even thus thought sidonius must vercingetorix have looked when he mounted his horse and rode from his lines at alesia to save his people by swelling caesars triumph and dying beneath the capitol oh absit omen  columba was borne up by hopes which verronax would not dash to the ground and she received his embrace with steadfast though brimming eyes and an assurance that she would pray without ceasing  lucius was not to be found having no doubt gone forward intending to direct his friend on his journey and there part with him but the saddest part of the whole was the passionate wailings and bemoanings of the remnants of his clan  one of his attendants had carried the tidings wild keltic men and women had come down for one last sight of their fearnagh macfearccadorigh as they called him by his true gaulish namepassionately kissing his hands and the hem of his mantle beating their breasts amid howls of lamentation and throwing themselves in his path as with the high spirit which could not brook to be fetched as a criminal he made his way to the gate  mounted on two strong mules the only animals serviceable in the mountain paths the senator and verronax passed the gate marcus walking beside them  we are beforehand with the goth said verronax as he came out  lazy hounds said marcus  their sentinels have vanished  it would serve them right if thou didst speed over the border to the burgundians  i shall have a laugh at old meinhard said verronax  little he knows of discipline  no doubt they have had a great lyke wake as they barbarously call their obsequies said the senator and are sleeping off their liquor  we will rouse them said the arvernian it will be better than startling poor columba  so on they moved the wildlyclad barefooted gauls with locks streaming in the wind still keeping in the rear  they reached the long low farmbuildings belonging to deodatus a halfbred roman gaul with a large vineyard and numerous herds of cattle  the place was wonderfully quiet  the goths seemed to be indulging in very sound slumbers after their carouse for nothing was to be seen but the slaves coming in with bowls of milk from the cattle  some of them must have given notice of the approach of the senator for deodatus came to his door with the salutation ave clarissime and then stood staring at verronax apparently petrified with wonder and as the young chief demanded where was meinhard he broke forth  does his nobility ask me  it is two hours since every goth quitted the place except the dead man in the house of the widow dubhina and we are breathing freely for once in our lives  up they went towards the aemilian villa with clamour and threats enough to make ones blood run cold and they must be far on their way to bordigala gergovia by this time  his nobility must have passed through their midst unseen and unheard cried old julitta a hardworking driedup woman clasping her sinewy wrinkled hands a miracle and no wonder since our holy bishop has returned  the excitable household was on the point of breaking out into acclamation but verronax exclaimed  silence children  miracles are not for the bloodguilty  if it be as i fear they have met lucius and seized him in my stead we must push on at once to save him  meinhard could not mistake your persons returned aemilius but while he was speaking a messenger came up and put into his hand one of the waxen tablets on which notes were written   l aem  vic to m aem vic  s qpardon and bless thy son meinhard assures me that i shall be accepted as equal in birth and accessory to the deed  remember columba and the value of verronaxs life and let me save him  consent and hold him back  greet all the dear onesvale   the little tablet could hold no more than thisalmost every word curtailed  the senators firm lip quivered at last as he exclaimed my brave son  thus does he redeem his fathers rash oath  verronax whose roman breeding had held his impulsive keltic nature in check as long as it was only himself that was in danger now broke into loud weeping  my lucius my brother beloved and didst thou deem arvernian honour fallen so low that i could brook such a sacrifice  let us hasten on instantly my father while yet it is time  it would have been impossible to withhold him and marcus returned with the strange tidings while his father and verronax set forth with a few servants mounted like themselves on mules to reach the broad roman road that led from gergovia to bordigala  three wild barefooted gauls of verronaxs clan shook their heads at all his attempts to send them home and went running along after him with the same fidelity as poor celer whom he had left tied up at the villa as his parting gift to little victorinus but who had broken loose and came bounding to his master caressing him with nose and tongue at their first halt  there had been as in all roman roads regular posting stations at intervals along the way where horses and mules could be hired but the troubles of the empire invasion and scarcity had greatly disturbed the system  many of the stations were deserted and at others either the whole of the animals or all the fleeter ones had been taken up by meinhard and his convoy  indeed it almost seemed that not only lucius was anxious not to be overtaken but that meinhard was forwarding his endeavours to consummate his sacrifice before the arvernian could prevent it  hotly did verronax chafe at each hindrance  he would have dashed onwards with feverish headlong speed using his own fleet limbs when he could not obtain a horse but aemilius feared to trust him alone lest coming too late to rescue lucius he should bring on himself the fury of the goths strike perhaps in revenge and not only lose his own life and render the sacrifice vain but imperil many more  so while making all possible speed he bound the young arvernian by all the ties of paternal guardianship and authority to give his word not to use his lighter weight and youthful vigour to outstrip the rest of the party  the senator himself hardly knew what was his own wish for if his fatherly affection yearned over his gentle dutiful studious lucius yet columbas desolation and the importance of verronax as a protector for his family so weighed down the other scale that he could only take refuge in committing his way unto the lord  the last haltingplace was at a villa belonging to a roman where they heard that an assembly was being held in the fields near bordigala for judgment on the slaughter of a young goth of high rank  on learning how deeply they were concerned their host lent them two horses and rode with them himself as they hastened on in speechless anxiety  these early teutonic nations all had their solemn assemblies in the open air and the goths had not yet abandoned the custom so that as the senator and the chieftain turned the summit of the last low hill they could see the plain beneath swarming like an anthill with people and as they pressed onward they could see a glittering tent woven with cloth of gold a throne erected in front and around it a space cleared and guarded by a huge circle of warriors lites whose shields joined so as to form a wall  near the throne stood the men of higher degree all alike to join the king in his judgment like the homeric warriors of old as indeed sidonius had often said that there was no better comment on the iliad than the meetings of the barbarians  by the time aemilius and verronax had reached the spot and gained an entrance in virtue of their rank and concern in the matter euric sat enthroned in the midst of the assembly  he was far removed from being a savage though he had won his crown by the murder of his brother  he and the counts comrades around him wore the roman garb and used by preference the latin speech learning arms and habits just as european civilisation is adopted by the egyptian or japanese of the present day  he understood roman jurisprudence and was the author of a code for the goths but in a case like this he was obliged to conform to national customs  there he sat a small lightcomplexioned man of slighter make than those around him holding in his hand a scroll  it was a letter from sidonius sent beforehand by a swiftfooted mountaineer and containing a guarantee for 1200 soldi twice the price for a goth of ordinary rank  on the one side stood unbound and unguarded the slender form of lucius on the other a gigantic old visigoth blind and with long streaming snowy hair and beard his face stern with grief and passion and both his knotted hands crossed upon the handle of a mighty battleaxe  the king had evidently been explaining to him the terms of the bishops letter for the first words that met the ear of aemilius were  nay i say nay king euric  were i to receive treble the weight of gold how should that enable me to face my son in the halls of odin with his blood unavenged  there was a murmur and the king exclaimed  now now odo we know no more of odin  odin knows us no more retorted the old man since we have washed ourselves in the name of another than the mighty thor and taken up the weakly worship of the conquered  so my son would have it  he talked of a new valhal of the christian but let him meet me where he will he shall not reproach me that he only of all his brethren died unavenged  where is the slayer  set him before me that i may strike him dead with one blow  lucius crossed himself looked upwards and was stepping forwards when verronax with a shout of hold leapt into the midst full before the avengers uplifted weapon crying  slay me old man  it was i who killed thy son i fearnagh the arvernian  ho said odo  give me thine hand  let me feel thee  yea these be sinews  it is well  i marvelled how my odorik should have fallen by the soft roman hand of yonder stripling but thou art a worthy foe  what made the priestling thrust himself between me and my prey  his generous love returned verronax as lucius flung himself on his neck crying  o my verronax why hast thou come  the bitterness of death was past  the gates were opening  meanwhile aemilius had reached euric and had made him understand the substitution  old odo knew no latin and it was the king an able orator in both tongues who expounded all in gothic showing how lucius aemilius had offered his life in the stead of his friend and how verronax had hurried to prevent the sacrifice reiterating almost in a tone of command the alternative of the wehrgeld  the lites all burst into acclamations at the nobility of the two young men and some muttered that they had not thought these romans had so much spirit  euric made no decision  he did full justice to the courage and friendship of the youths and likewise to the fact that odorik had provoked the quarrel and had been slain in fair fight but the choice lay with the father and perhaps in his heart the politic visigoth could not regret that arvernia should lose a champion sure to stand up for roman or national claims  odo listened in silence leaning on his axe  then he turned his face to the bystanders and demanded of them  which of them is the bolder  which of them flinched at my axe  the spectators were unanimous that neither had blenched  the slender lad had presented himself as resolutely as the stately warrior  it is well said odo  either way my son will be worthily avenged  i leave the choice to you young men  a brief debate ended in an appeal to the senator who in spite of all his fortitude could not restrain himself from groaning aloud hiding his face in his hands and hoarsely saying draw lots  yes said euric commit the judgment to heaven  it was hailed as a relief but lucius stipulated that the lots should be blessed by a catholic priest and verronax muttered impatiently  what matters it  let us make an end as quickly as may be  he had scarcely spoken when shouts were heard the throng made way the circle of lites opened as waving an olive branch a wearied exhausted rider and horse appeared and staggering to the foot of the throne there went down entirely spent the words being just audible he lives  odorik lives  it was marcus aemilius covered with dust and at first unable to utter another word as he sat on the ground supported by his brother while his father made haste to administer the wine handed to him by an attendant  am i in time he asked  in time my son replied his father repeating his announcement in gothic  odorik lives  he lives he will live repeated marcus reviving  i came not away till his life was secure  is it truth demanded the old goth  romans have slippery ways  meinhard was quick to bear testimony that no man in arvernia doubted the word of an aemilius but marcus taking a small dagger from his belt held it out saying  his son said that he would know this token  odo felt it  it is my sons knife he said still cautiously but it cannot speak to say how it was taken from him  the old barbarian heathen quoth verronax under his breath he would rather lose his son than his vengeance  marcus had gathered breath and memory to add tell him odorik said he would know the token of the redbreast that nested in the winged helm of helgund  i own the token said odo  my son lives  he needs no vengeance  he turned the handle of his axe downwards passed it to his left hand and stretched the right to verronax saying young man thou art brave  there is no blood feud between us  odo son of helgund would swear friendship with you though ye be romans  compensation is still due according to the amount of the injury said the senator scrupulously  is it not so o king  euric assented but odo exclaimed  no gold for me  when odo son of helgund forgives he forgives outright  where is my son  food had by this time been brought by the kings order and after swallowing a few mouthfuls marcus could stand and speak  odorik apparently dead had been dragged by the goths into the hut of the widow dubhina to await his fathers decision as to the burial and the poor woman had been sheltered by her neighbour julitta leaving the hovel deserted  columba not allowing her grief and suspense to interfere with her visits of mercy to the poor woman had come down as usual on the evening of the day on which her father and her betrothed had started on their sad journey  groans not likely to be emitted by her regular patient had startled her and she had found the floor occupied by the huge figure of a young goth his face and hair covered with blood from a deep wound on his head insensible but his moans and the motion of his limbs betraying life  knowing the bitter hatred in claudiodunum for everything gothic the brave girl would not seek for aid nearer than the villa  thither she despatched her male slave while with her old nurse she did all in her power for the relief of the wounded man with no inconsiderable skill  marcus had brought the greek physician of the place but he had done nothing but declare the patient a dead man by all the laws of galen and hippocrates  however the skull and constitution of a vigorous young goth fresh from the mountains were tougher than could be imagined by a member of one of the exhausted races of the levant  bishop sidonius had brought his science and sagacity to the rescue and under his treatment odorik had been restored to his senses and was on the fair way to recovery  on the first gleam of hope marcus had sent off a messenger but so many of his household and dependents were absent that he had no great choice so that as soon as hope had become security he had set forth himself and it was well he had done so for he had overtaken the messenger at what was reckoned as three days journey from bordigala  he had ridden ever since without rest only dismounting to change his steed scarcely snatching even then a morsel of food and that morning neither he nor the horse he rode had relaxed for a moment the desperate speed with which he rode against time so that he had no cause for the shame and vexation that he felt at his utter collapse before the barbarians  king euric himself declared that he wished he had a goth who could perform such a feat of endurance  while marcus slept aemilius and the two young men offered their heartfelt thanks in the catholic church of bordigala and then euric would not be refused their presence at a great feast of reconciliation on the following day two of verronaxs speedyfooted followers having been sent off at once to bear home tidings that his intelligence had been in time  the feast was served in the old proconsular house with the roman paraphernalia arranged with the amount of correct imitation that is to be found at an english dinnerparty in the abode of an indian rajah  it began with roman etiquette but ended in a gothic revel which the sober and refined aemilii could hardly endure  they were to set off on their return early on the morrow meinhard and odo with them but when they at length escaped from the barbarian orgies they had little expectation that their companions would join them in the morning  however the two goths and their followers were on the alert as soon as they and as coolheaded as if they had touched no drop of wine  old odo disdained a mule and would let no hand save his own guide his horse  verronax and lucius constituted themselves his guides and whenever he permitted the slightest assistance it was always from the arvernian whom he seemed to regard as a sort of adopted son  he felt over his weapons and told him long stories of which verronax understood only a word or two here and there though the old man seemed little concerned thereat  now and then he rode along chanting to himself an extemporary song which ran somewhat thus   maids who choose the slain disappointed now the hawk of the mountain the wolf of the west meet in fierce combat sinks the bold wolfcub folds his wing the falcon shall the soft priestling step before him to valhal cheating loks daughter of weakhearted prey lo the wolf wakens valkyr relaxes waits for a battlefield wolfcub to claim friendly the falcon friendly the graywolf   so it ran on to the great scandal of lucius who longed for better knowledge of the gothic tongue to convince the old man of the folly of his heathen dreams  meinhard who was likewise rather shocked explained that the father and son had been recent arrivals who had been baptized because euric required his followers to embrace his faith but with little real knowledge or acceptance on the part of the father  young odorik had been a far more ardent convert and after the fashion of many a believer had taken up the distinctions of sect rather than of religion and zealous in the faith he knew had thought it incumbent on him to insult the catholics where they seemed to him idolatrous  a message on the road informed the travellers that they would find odorik at the villa  thither then they went and soon saw the whole household on the steps in eager anticipation  a tall young figure with a bandage still round his fair flowing locks came down the steps as verronax helped the blind man to dismount and odo with a cry of my son with a ring of ecstasy in the sound held the youth to his breast and felt him all over  are we friends said odorik turning to verronax when his father released him  that is as thou wiliest returned the arvernian gravely  know then said odorik that i know that i erred  i knew not thy lord when i mocked thine honour to him  father we had but half learnt the christians god  i have seen it now  it was not thy blow o arvernian that taught me but the master who inspired yonder youth to offer his life and who sent the maiden there to wait upon her foe  he is more than man  i own in him the eternal creator redeemer and lord  yea said sidonius to his friend aemilius a great work hath been wrought out  thus hath the parable of actual life led this zealous but halftaught youth to enter into the higher truth  lucius will be none the worse priest for having trodden in the steps of him who was highpriest and victim  who may abide strict divine justice had not one stood between the sinner and the judge  thus mercy and truth have met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other    the cat of cat copse    a hampshire tradition  i  the dane the dane  the heathen dane is wasting hampshires coast again from ravaged church and plundered farm flash

five ships bear forth to fiords and islets of the north a thousand years shall pass away and leave those keels in hambles bay  iv  ill were it in my rhyme to tell the work of slaughter that befell in sooth it was a savage time crime ever will engender crime each viking as he swam to land fell by a saxons vengeful hand turn we from all that vengeance wild where on the deck there cowered a child and closely to his bosom prest a snowwhite kitten found a nest that tender boy with tresses fair was edric egberts cherished heir the plaything of the homestead he now fondled on his grandames knee or as beside the hearth he sat oft sporting with his snowwhite cat now by the chaplain taught to read and lisp his pater and his creed well nurtured at his mothers side and by his father trained to ride to speak the truth to draw the bow and all an english thane should know his days had been as one bright dream as smooth as his own rivers stream until at good king alfreds call thane egbert left his native hall  v  then five days later shout and yell and shrieks and howls of slaughter fell upon the peaceful homestead came mid flashing sword and axe and flame snatched by a vikings iron grasp from his slain mothers dying clasp saved from the households flaming grave edric was dragged a destined slave some northern dame to serve or heed the flocks that on the saeter feed still with scarce conscious hold he clung to the white cat that closely hung seeking her refuge in his arm her shelter in the wild alarm and who can tell how oft his moan was soothed by her soft purring tone time keeping with retracted claw or patting with her velvet paw although of home and friends bereft still this one comforter was left so lithe so swift so soft so white she might have seemed his guardian sprite    the rude danes deemed her such and whispered tales of disir bound to human lords as bird or hound nor one mid all the fleet was found    to hurt one tender paw and when the captive knelt to pray none would his orisons gainsay for as they marked him day by day    increased their wondering awe  vi  crouched by the mast the child and cat through the dire time of slaughter sat    by terror both spellbound but when night came a silence drear fell on the coast and far or near no voice caught edrics wakeful ear    save waters lapping sound he wandered from the stern to prow ate of the stores and marvelled how    he yet might reach the ground till low and lower sank the tide dark banks of mud spread far and wide    around that fastbound wreck then the lone boy climbed down the ship to cross the mud by bound and skip    his cat upon his neck light was his weight and swift his leap now would he softly tread now creep for treacherous was the mud and deep from stone to weed from weed to plank leaving a hole whereer he sank with panting breath and sore taxed strength the solid earth he felt at length sheltered within the copse he lay when dawn had brightened into day for when one moment there was seen his red cap glancing mid the green    a fearful cry arose here lurks a dane  the dane seek out with knife and axe the rabble rout made the copse ring with yell and shout    to find their dreaded foes and edric feared to meet a stroke before they knew the tongue he spoke hid mid the branches of an oak    he heard their calls and blows of food he had a simple store and when the churls the chase gave oer and evening sunk upon the vale with rubbing head and upright tail pacing before him to and fro puss lured him on the way to go coaxing him on with tender wile oer

we will we cannot trace the inborn skill nor fathom how whereer she roam the cat neer fails to find her home  vii  what pen may dare to paint the woe when egbert saw his home laid low where by the desolated hearth the mother lay who gave him birth and close beside his fair young wife and servants slain in bootless strife    mournful the king stood near alfred who came to be his guest and deeply rued that his behest had all unguarded left that nest    to meet such ruin drear with hand and heart and lip he gave all king or friend both true and brave could give one pang of grief to save    to comfort or to cheer as from the blackened walls they drew each corpse and laid with reverence due and then it was that egbert knew    all save the child were here king alfreds noble head was bent a monarchs pain his bosom rent kindly he wrung thane egberts hand lo these have won the blissful land where foemans shout is heard no more nor wild waves beat upon the shore brief was the pang the strife is oer    they are at peace my friend safe where the weary are at rest safe where the banishd and opprest    find joys that never end thane egbert groaned and scarce might speak for tears that ploughed his hardy cheek    as his dread task was done and for the slain from monk and priest rose requiems that never ceased    while still he sought his son oh would to heaven that father said there lay my darling calmly dead rather than as a thrall be bred    his christian faith undone nay life is hope bespake the king god oer the child can spread his wing and shield him in the northmans power safe as in alswyths guarded bower treaty and ransom may be found to win him back to english ground  viii  the funeral obsequies were oer    but lingered still the thane hanging around his home once more    feeding his bitter pain the king would fain with friendly force urge him anew to mount his horse turn from the piteous sight away and fresh begin lifes saddened day his loved ones looking yet to greet where neer shall part the blest who meet just then a voice that well he knew a sound that mixed the purr and mew    went to the fathers heart on a large stone king alfred sat against his buskin rubbed a cat    snowwhite in every part though drenched and soiled from head to tail the poor thanes tears poured down like hail poor puss in vain thy loving wail    then came a joyful start a little hand was on his cloak father a voice beside him spoke    emerging from the wood all travelstained and marked with mire with trace of blood and toil and fire yet safe and sound beside his sire    edric before them stood and as his father wept for joy king alfred blessed the rescued boy    and thanked his maker good who doth the captives prayer fulfil making his creatures work his will    by means not understood  notethe remains of the five danish vessels still lie embedded in the mud of the hamble river near southampton though parts have been carried off and used as wood for furniture in the farmhouses  the neighbouring wood is known as cat copse and a tradition has been handed down that a cat and a boy in a red cap escaped from the danish ships took refuge there    de facto and de jure    i  de facto  the later summer sunbeams lay on an expanse of slightly broken ground where purple and crimson heather were relieved by the golden blossoms of the dwarf gorse interspersed with white stars of stitchwort  here and there on the slopes grew stunted oaks and hollies whose polished leaves gleamed white with the reflection of the light but there was not a trace of human habitation save a track as if trodden by horses feet clear of the furze and heath and bordered by soft bent grass beginning to grow brown  near this trackfor path it could hardly be calledstood a slender lad waiting and watching a little round cap covering his shortcut brown hair a crimson tunic reaching to his knee leggings and shoes of deerhide and a sword at his side fastened by a belt of the like skin guarded and clasped with silver  his features were delicate though sunburnt and his eyes were riveted on the distance where the path had disappeared amid the luxuriant spires of ling  a huntinghorn sounded and the youth drew himself together into an attitude of eager attention the baying of hounds and trampling of horses hoofs came nearer and nearer and by and by there came in view the ends of boarspears the tall points of bows a cluster of heads of men and horsesstrong sturdy shaggy surefooted creatures almost ponies but the only steeds fit to pursue the chase on this rough and encumbered ground  foremost rode with ivory and gold huntinghorn slung in a rich spanish baldrick and a slender gilt circlet round his green huntingcap a stout figure with a face tanned to a fiery colour keen eyes of a dark auburn tint and a shock of hair of the same deep red  at sight of him the lad flung himself on his knees on the path with the cry haro  haro  justice sir king  out of my way english hound cried the king  this is no time for thy haro  nay but one word good fair king  i am frenchfrench by my fathers side cried the lad as there was a halt more from the instinct of the horse than the will of the king  bertram de maisonforte  my father married the lady of boyatt and her inheritance was confirmed to him by your father brave king william my lord but now he is dead and his kinsman roger de maisonforte hath ousted her and me her son and lawful heir from house and home and we pray for justice sir king  ha roger thou there  what sayst thou to this bold beggar shouted the red king  i say returned a black bronzed hunter pressing to the front that what i hold of thee king william on tenure of homage and of two good horses and staunch hounds yearly i yield to no english mongrel churl who dares to meddle with me  thou hearst lad said rufus with his accustomed oath homage hath been done to us for the land nor may it be taken back  out of our way or  sir sir entreated the lad grasping the bridle if no more might be we would be content if sir roger would but leave my mother enough for her maintenance among the nuns of romsey and give me a horse and suit of mail to go on the holy war with duke robert  ho ho a modest request for a beggarly english clown cried the king aiming a blow at the lad with his whip and pushing on his horse so as almost to throw him back on the heath  ho ho fit him out for a fools errand  well fit him  well teach him to take the cross at other mens expense shouted the followers seizing on the boy  nay well bestow his cross on him for a free gift exclaimed roger de maisonforte  and bertram struggling desperately in vain among the band of ruffians found his left arm bared and two long and painful slashes in the form of the crusaders cross inflicted amid loud laughter as the blood sprang forth  there sir crusader said roger grinding his teeth over him  go on thy way nowas a horseboy if so please thee and know better than to throw thy mean false english pretension in the face of a gentle norman  men horses dogs all seemed to trample and scoff at bertram as he fell back on the elastic stems of the heath and gorse whose prickles seemed to renew the insults by scratching his face  when the kings horn the calls the brutal laughter and the baying of the dogs had begun to die away in the distance he gathered himself together sat up and tried to find some means of stanching the blood  not only was the wound in a place hard to reach but it had been ploughed with the point of a boarspear and was grievously torn  he could do nothing with it and as he perceived he had further been robbed of his sword his last possession his fathers sword  the large tears of mingled rage grief and pain might well spring from the poor boys eyes in his utter loneliness as he clenched his hand with powerless wrath and regained his feet to retrace as best he might his way to where his widowed mother had found a temporary shelter in a small religious house  the sun grew hotter and hotter bertrams wound bled though not profusely the smart grew upon him his tongue was parched with thirst and though he kept resolutely on his breath came panting his head grew dizzy his eyes dim his feet faltered and at last just as he attained a wider and more trodden way he dropped insensible by the side of the path his dry lips trying to utter the cry lord have mercy on me   ii  de jure   when bertram de maisonforte opened his eyes again cold waters were on his face wine was moistening his lips the burning of his wound was assuaged by cooling oil while a bandage was being applied and he was supported on a breast and in arms clad indeed in a hauberk but as tenderly kind as the full deep voice that spoke in english he comes round  how now my child  father murmured bertram with dreamy senses  better now another sup from the flask david again said the kind voice and looking up he became aware of the beautiful benignant face deep blue eyes and long light locks of the man in early middle age who had laid him on his knee while a priest was binding his arm and a fair and graceful boy a little younger than himself was standing by with the flask of wine in his hand and a face of such girlish beauty that as he knelt to hold the wine to his lips bertram asked  am i among the angels  not yet said the elder man  art thou near thine home  alack  i have no home kind sir said bertram now able to raise himself and to perceive that he was in the midst of a small hand of armed men such as every knight or noble necessarily carried about with him for protection  there was a standard with a dragon and their leader himself was armed all save his head and as bertram saw was a man of massive strength noble stature and kingly appearance  what shall we do for thee he asked  who hath put thee in this evil case  bertram gave his name and at its norman sound there was a start of repulsion from the boy  french after all he exclaimed  nay david said the leader if i mind me rightly the lady elftrud of boyatt wedded a brave norman of that name  art thou her son  i see something of her face and thou hast an english tongue  i am i am her only son exclaimed bertram and as he told of his wrongs and the usage he had met with young david cried out with indignation  uncle uncle how canst thou suffer that these things should be here are our faithful cnihts  let us ride to the forest  wherefore should it not be with red william and his ruffians as with scottish duncan and donald  hush thee david my nephew  thou knowest that may not be  but for thee young bertram we will see what can be done  canst sit a horse now  yea my lord full well  i know not what came over me even now said bertram much ashamed of the condition in which he had been found  a sumpter horse was found for him the leader of the party saying that they would go on to his own home where the youths wound should be looked to and they could then decide what could be done for him  bertram was still so far faint suffering weak and weary that he was hardly awake to curiosity as to his surroundings and had quite enough to do to keep his seat in the saddle and follow in the wake of the leaders tall white horse above which shone his bright chain mail and his still brighter golden locks so that the exhausted boy began in some measure to feel as if he were following st michael on his way to some better world  now and then the tall figure turned to see how it was with him and as he drooped more with fatigue and pain bade one of the retainers keep beside him and support him  thus at length the cavalcade left the heathery expanse and reached a valley green with meadowland and waving corn with silvery beards of barley rippling in the evening light and cows and sheep being gathered for the night towards a dwelling where the river had been trained to form a moat round low green ramparts enclosing a number of onestoried thatched houses and barns with one round tower a strong embattled gateway and at a little distance a square church tower and other cottages standing outside  a shout of ecstasy broke out from the village as the advancing party was seen and recognised  men women and children rudely but substantially clad and many wearing the collar of the thrall ran out from their houses baring their heads bowing low and each in turn receiving some kind word or nod of greeting from the lord whom they welcomed while one after another of his armed followers turned aside and was absorbed into a happy family by wife or parent  a drawbridge crossed the moat and there was a throng of joyful servants in the archwayforemost a priest stretching out his hands in blessing and a foreignlooking old woman grayhaired and dark eyed who gathered young david into her embrace as he sprang from his horse calling him her hearts darling and her sunshine and demanding with a certain alarm where were his brothers  in scotland dear nurse agneseven where they should be was davids answer  we are conquerors do you see  edgar is a crowned and anointed kingseated on the holy stone of scone and alexander is beside him to fight for him  it is even so nurse said the elder man turning from the priest to whom he had more briefly spoken god hath blessed our arms and young edgar has his right  god shield him in it  and now nurse here is a poor youth who needs thy care after one of red williams rough jests   iii  king at home   weary faint and feverish as bertram de maisonforte was he was past caring for anything but the relief of rest cool drink and the dressing of his wound nor did he even ask where he was until he awoke in broad daylight the next morning to the sound of church bells to the sight of a low but spacious chamber with stone walls deerskins laid on the floor and the old nurse standing by him with a cup of refreshing drink and ready to attend to his wound  it was then that feeling greatly refreshed he ventured upon asking her in whose house he was and who was the good lord who had taken pity on him  who should it be save him who should be the good lord of every englishman she replied mine own dear fosterson the princely athelinghe who takes up the cause of every injured man save his own  bertram was amazed for he had only heard normans speak of edgar atheling the heir of the ancient race as a poor tamespirited wretched creature unable to assert himself and therefore left unmolested by the conquerors out of contempt  he proceeded to ask what the journey was from which the atheling was returning and the nurse nothing loth beguiled the tendance on his arm by explaining how she had long ago travelled from hungary with her charges edgar margaret and christina how it had come about that the crown which should have been her darlings had been seized by the fierce duke from beyond the sea how edgar then a mere child had been forced to swear oaths of fealty by which he held himself still bound how her sweetest pearl of ladies her jewel margaret had been wedded to the rude wild king of scots and how her gentle sweetness and holiness had tamed and softened him so that she had been the blessing of his kingdom till he and his eldest son had fallen at alnwick while she lay adying how the fierce savage scots had risen and driven forth her young children and how their uncle the atheling had ridden forth taken them to his home bred them in all holiness and uprightness and good and knightly courage and when edgar and alexander the two eldest were full grown had gone northward with them once more and had won back in fair field the throne of their father malcolm  truly there might well be rejoicing and triumph on the estate where the atheling ruled as a father and had been sorely missed  he was at his early mass of thanksgiving at present and bertram was so much better that nurse agnes did not withstand his desire to rise and join the household and villagers who were all collected in the building low and massive but on which edgar atheling had lavished the rich ornamental work introduced by the normans  the round arched doorway was set in a succession of elaborate zigzags birds heads lions faces twists and knots and within the altar hangings and the priests robes were stiff with the exquisite and elaborate embroidery for which the english nunneries were famed  the whole building with its lowbrowed roof circular chancel arch still more richly adorned and stout short columns was filled with kneeling figures in rough homespun or sheepskin garments and with shaggy heads above which towered the shining golden locks of the atheling which were allowed to grow to a much greater length than was the norman fashion and beside him was the still fairer head of his young nephew david of scotland  it was a thanksgiving service for their victory and safe return and bertram was just in time for the te deum that followed the mass  the atheling after all was over came forth exchanging greetings with one after another of his franklins cnihts and thralls all of whom seemed to be equally delighted to see him back again and whom he bade to a feast in the hall which would be prepared in the course of the day  some meantime went to their homes near at hand others would amuse themselves with games at ball archery singlestick and the like in an open space within the moatwhere others fished  bertram was not neglected  the atheling inquired after his health heard his story in more detail and after musing on it said that after setting affairs in order at home he meant to visit his sister and niece in the abbey at romsey and would then make some arrangement for the lady of maisonforte also he would endeavour to see the king on his return to winchester and endeavour to plead with him  william will at times hearken to an old comrade he said but it is an ill time to take him when he is hot upon the chase  meantime thou art scarce yet fit to ride and needest more of good agness leechcraft  bertram was indeed stiff and weary enough to be quite content to lie on a bearskin in the wide hall of the dwelling or under the eaves without and watch the doings with some amusement  he had been bred in some contempt of the saxons  his fathers marriage had been viewed as a mesalliance and though the knight of maisonforte had been honourable and kindly and the lady elftrud had fared better than many a saxon bride still the french and the breton dames of the neighbourhood had looked down on her and the retainers had taught her son to look on the english race as swine boors and churls ignorant of all gentle arts of skill and grace  but here was young david among youths of his own age tilting as gracefully and well as any young norman couldmaking bertram long that his arm should cease to be so heavy and burning so that he might show his prowess  here was a contention with bow and arrow that would not have disgraced the best menatarms of maisonfortehere again later in the day was minstrelsy of a higher order than his fathers ears had cared for but of which his mother had whispered her traditions  here again was the chaplain showing his brotherpriests with the greatest pride and delight a scroll of latin copied from a ms psalter of the holy and venerable beda by the hand of his own dear pupil young david  bertram who could neither read nor write and knew no more latin than his paternoster credo and ave absolutely did not believe his eyes and ears till he had asked the question whether this were indeed the youths work  how could it be possible to wield pen as well as lance  but the wonder of all was the atheling  after an absence of more than a year there was much to be adjusted and his authority on his own lands was thoroughly judicial even for life or death since even under norman sway he held the power of an earl  seated in a highbacked crosslegged chairhis majestic form commanding honour and respecthe heard one after another causes that came before him reserved for his judgment questions of heirship disputes about cattle complaints of thievery encroachments on land and bertram listening with the interest that judgment never fails to excite was deeply impressed with the clear headedness the ready thought and the justice of the decision even when the dispute lay between saxon and norman always with reference to the laws of alfred and edward which he seemed to carry in his head  indeed ere long two norman knights hearing of the athelings return came to congratulate him and lay before him a dispute of boundaries which they declared they would rather entrust to him than to any other  and they treated him far more as a prince than as a saxon churl  they willingly accepted his invitation to go in to the feast of welcome and a noble one it was with music and minstrelsy hospitality to all around plenty and joy wassail bowls going round and the atheling presiding over it and with a strange and quiet influence breaking up the entertainment in all good will by the memory of his sweet sister margarets gracecup ere mirth had become madness or the english could incur their reproach of coarse revelry  and as the norman knight who had prevailed said to bertram sir edgar the atheling had thus shown himself truly an uncrowned king   iv  who shall be king   the noble cloisters of romsey with the grand church rising in their midst had a lodgingplace strictly cut off from the nunnery for male visitors  into this edgar atheling rode with his armed train and as they entered some strange expression in the faces of the porters and guards met them  had my lord heard the news demanded a priest who hastened forward bowing low  no holy father  no ill of my sister anxiously inquired the prince  the mother abbess is well my lord atheling but the kingwilliam the redis gone to his account  he was found two eves ago pierced to the heart with an arrow beneath an oak in malwood chace  god have mercy on his poor soul ejaculated edgar crossing himself  no moment vouchsafed for penitence  alas  who did the deed father dunstan  that is not known returned the priest save that walter tyrrel is fled like a hunted felon beyond seas and my lord henry to winchester  young david pressed up to his uncles side  sir sir he said what a time is this  duke robert absent none know where our men used to war all ready to gather round you this rule will be ended the old race restored  say but the word and i will ride back and raise our franklins as one man  thou wilt too bertram  with all mine heart cried bertram  let me be the first to do mine homage  and as edgar atheling stood in the outer court with lofty head and noble thoughtful face purecomplexioned and highbrowed each who beheld him felt that there stood a king of men  a shout of king edgar  edgar king of england echoed through the buildings and priests menatarms and peasants began to press forward to do him homage  but he raised his hand  hold children he said  i thank you all but much must come ere ye imperil yourselves by making oaths to me that ye might soon have to break  let me pass on and see my sister  abbeys were not strictly cloistered then and the abbess christina was at the door a tall woman older than her brother and somewhat hardfeatured and beside her was a lovely fair girl with peach like cheeks and bright blue eyes who threw herself into davids arms full of delight  brother said christina did i hear aright  and have they hailed thee king  are the years of cruel wrong ended at last  victor for others wilt thou be victor for thyself  what is consistent with gods will and with mine oaths that i hope to do was edgars reply  but even as he stood beside the abbess in the porch without having yet entered there was a clattering and trampling of horse and through the gate came hastily a young man in a hauberk with a ring of gold about his helmet holding out his hands as he saw the atheling  sire edgar he said i knew not i should find you here when i came to pay my first devoirs as a king to the lady mother abbess he kissed her unwilling hand and the lady edith  edith turned away a blushing face and the abbess faltered  as a king  yea lady  as such have i been owned by all at winchester  i should be at westminster for my coronation save that i turned from my course to win her who shall share my crown  is it even thus henry said edgar  hast not thought of other rights  of that crazed fellow roberts demanded henry  trouble not thine head for him  even if he came back living from this holy war in the east my father had too much mercy on england to leave it to the like of him  there be other and older rights sir henry said the abbess  henry looked up for a moment in some consternation  ho  sir edgar thou hast been so long a peaceful man that i had forgotten thou knowest thy day went by with hereward le wake  see fair edith and i know one anothershe shall be my queen  veiled and vowed began the abbess  oh not yet  tell her not yet whispered edith in davids ear  thou little traitress  wed thy houses foe who takes thine uncles place  nay  i will none of thee said david shaking her off roughly but her uncle threw his arm round her kindly  at that moment a norman knight spurred up to henry with some communication that made him look uneasy and christina laying her hand on edgars arm said  brother we have vaults  thy troop outnumbers his  the people of good old wessex are with thee  now is thy time  save thy country  restore the line and laws of alfred and edward  thou knowst not what thou wouldst have christina said edgar one sea of blood wherever a norman castle rises  i love my people too well to lead them to a fruitless struggle with all the might of normandy unless i saw better hope than lies before me now  mind thee i swore to duke william that i would withstand neither him nor any son of his whom the english duly hailed  yet i will see how it is with this young man he added as she fell back muttering craven  who ever won throne without blood  henry had an anxious face when he turned from his knight who no doubt had told him how completely he was in the athelings power  sir edgar he said a word with you  winchester is not far off nor porchesternor my brother williams free companies and his treasure  normans will scarce see duke williams son tampered with nor bow their heads to the english  belike henry of normandy said edgar rising above him in his grave majesty  yet have i a question or two to put to thee  thou art a graver more scholarly man than thy brother less like to be led away by furies  have the people of england and normandy sworn to thee willingly as their king  even so in the minster henry began and would have said more but edgar again made his gesture of authority  wilt thou grant them the charter of alfred and edward with copies spread throughout the land  i will  wilt thou do equal justice between english and norman  to the best of my power  wilt thou bring home the archbishop fill up the dioceses do thy part by the church  so help me god i will  then henry of normandy i edgar atheling kiss thine hand and become thy man and may god deal with thee as thou dost with england  the noble form of edgar bent before the slighter younger figure of henry who burst into tears genuine at the moment and vowed most earnestly to be a good king to the entire people  no doubt he meant itthen  and nowfar more humbly he made his suit to the atheling for the hand of his niece  edgar took her apart  edith canst thou brook this man  uncle he was good to me when we were children together at the old kings court  i have made no vows i tore the veil mine aunt threw over me from mine head  methinks with me beside him he would never be hard to our people  so be it then edith  if he holds to this purpose when he hath been crowned at westminster he shall have thee though i fear thou hast chosen a hard lot and wilt rue the day when thou didst quit these peaceful walls  and one more stipulation was made by edgar the atheling ere he rode to own henry as king in the face of the english people at westminsternamely that boyatt should be restored to the true heiress the lady elftrud  and to roger compensation was secretly made at the athelings expense ere departing with bertram in his train for the holy war  for bertram could not look at the scar without feeling himself a crusader and edgar judged it better for england to remove himself for awhile while he laid all earthly aspirations at the feet of the king of kings  the little english troop arrived just in time to share in the capture of the holy city to join in the eager procession of conquerors to the holy sepulchre and to hear godfrey de bouillon elected to defend the sacred possession refusing to wear a crown where the king of saints and lord of heaven and earth had worn a crown of thorns    sigberts guerdon    a feudal castle of massive stone with donjon keep and high crenellated wall gateway tower moat and drawbridge was a strange incongruous sight in one of the purplered stony slopes of palestine with hermons snowy peak rising high above  it was accounted for however by the golden crosses of the kingdom of jerusalem waving above the watchtower that rose like a pointing finger above the keep in company with a lesser ensign bearing a couchant hound sable  it was a narrow rocky pass that the castle of gebelaroun guarded overlooking a winding ravine between the spurs of the hills descending into the fertile plain of esdraelon from the heights of galilee hills noted in many an israelite battle and now held by the crusaders  bare hard and rocky were the hills aroundthe slopes and the valley itself which in the earlier season had been filled with rich grass calvary clover bloodred anemones and pale yellow amaryllis only showed their arid brown or gray remnants  the moat had become a deep waterless cleft and beneath on the accessible sides towards the glen clustered a collection of black horsehair tents the foremost surmounted by the illomened crescent  the burning sun had driven every creature under shelter and no one was visible but well was it known that watch and ward was closely kept from beneath those dark tents that to the eyes within had the air of couching beasts of prey  yes couching to devour what could not fail to be theirs in spite of the mighty walls of rock and impregnable keep for those deadly and insidious foes hunger and thirst were within gaining the battle for the saracens without who had merely to wait in patience for the result  some years previously sir william de hundberg a norman knight had been expelled from his english castle by the partisans of stephen and with wife and children had followed count fulk of anjou to his kingdom of palestine and had been endowed by him with one of the fortresses which guarded the passes of galilee under that exaggeration of the feudal system which prevailed in the crusading kingdom of jerusalem  climate speedily did its work with the lady warfare with two of her sons and there only remained of the family a youth of seventeen walter and his sister mabel fourteen who was already betrothed to the young baron of courtwood then about to return to england  the treaty with stephen and the success of young henry of anjou gave sir william hopes of restitution but just as he was about to conduct her to jerusalem for the wedding before going back to england he fell sick of one of the recurring fevers of the country and almost at the same time the castle was beleaguered by a troop of arabs under the command of a muchdreaded sheik  his constitution was already much shaken and sir william after a few days of alternate torpor and delirium passed away without having been conscious enough to leave any counsel to his children or any directions to father philip the chaplain or sigbert his english squire  at the moment sorrow was not disturbed by any great alarm for the castle was well victualled and had a good well supplied by springs from the mountains and father philip after performing the funeral rites for his lord undertook to make his way to tiberias or to jerusalem with tidings of their need and it was fully anticipated that succour would arrive long before the stores in the castle had been exhausted  but time went on and though food was not absolutely lacking the spring of water which had hitherto supplied the garrison began to fail  whether through summer heats or whether the wily enemy had succeeded in cutting off the source where once there had been a clear crystal pool in the rock cold as the snow from which it came there only dribbled a few scanty drops caught with difficulty and only imbibed from utter necessity so great was the suspicion of their being poisoned by the enemy  the wine was entirely gone and the salted provision which alone remained made the misery of thirst almost unbearable  on the cushions richly embroidered in dainty eastern colouring lay mabel de hundberg with dry lips half opened and panting too weary to move yet listening all intent  another moment and in chamois leather coat his helmet in hand entered her brother from the turret stair and threw himself down hopelessly answering her gesture  no no of course no  the dust was only from another swarm of those hateful saracens  i knew it would be so  pah it has made my tongue more like old boot leather than ever  have no more drops been squeezed from the well  its time the cup was filled  it was rogers turn  sigbert said he should have the next said mabel  walter uttered an imprecation upon roger and a still stronger one on sigberts meddling  but instantly the cry was where is sigbert  walter even took the trouble to shout up and down the stair for sigbert and to demand hotly of the weary dejected menatarms where sigbert was but no one could tell  gone over to the enemy the old traitor said walter again dropping on the divan  never  sigbert is no traitor returned his sister  he is an english churl and all churls are traitors responded walter  the old nurse who was fitfully fanning mabel with a dried palm leaf made a growl of utter dissent and mabel exclaimed none was ever so faithful as good old sigbert  it was a promising quarrel but their lips were too dry to keep it up for more than a snarl or two  walter cast himself down and bade old tata fan him why should mabel have it all to herself  then sounds of wrangling were heard below and walter roused himself to go down and interfere  the men were disputing over some miserable dregs of wine at the bottom of a skin  walter shouted to call them to order but they paid little heed  do not meddle and make young sir said a lowbrowed swarthy fellow  theres plenty of cool drink of the right sort out there  traitor cried walter better die than yield  if one have no mind for dying like an old crab in a rock said the man  they would think nought of making an end of us out there said another  id as lief be choked at once by a cord as by thirst was the answer  that you are like to be if you talk such treason threatened walter  seize him richardmartin  richard and martin however hung back one muttering that gil had done nothing and the other that he might be in the right of it and when walter burst out in angry threats he was answered in a gruff voice that he had better take care what he said there was no standing not only wasting with thirst and hunger but besides being blustered at by a hotheaded lad that scarce knew a hauberk from a helmet  walter in his rage threw himself with drawn sword on the mutineer but was seized and dragged back by half a dozen stalwart arms such as he had no power to resist and he was held fast amid rude laughs and brutal questions whether he should thus be carried to the saracens and his sister with him  the old sheik would give a round sum for a fair young damsel like her were the words that maddened her brother into a desperate struggle baffled with a hoarse laugh by the menatarms who were keeping him down hand and foot when a new voice sounded  how now fellows  whats this  in one moment walter was released and on his feet and the men fell back ashamed and gloomy as a sturdy figure with sunbrowned face light locks worn away by the helmet and slightly grizzled stood among them in a muchrubbed and soiled chamois leather garment  walter broke out into passionate exclamations the men evidently ashamed met them with murmurs and growls  bad enough bad enough broke in sigbert but theres no need to make it worse better to waste with hunger and thirst than be a nidering fellow rising against your lord in his distress  we would never have done it if he would have kept a civil tongue  civilitys hard to a tongue dried up returned sigbert  but look you here comrades leave me a word with my young lord here and i plight my faith that you shall have enow to quench your thirst within six hours at the least  there was an attempt at a cheer broken by the murmur we have heard enough of that  it is always six hours and six hours  and the saracen hounds outside would at least give us a draught of water ere they made away with us said another  saracens forsooth said sigbert  you shall leave the saracens far behind you  a few words first with my lord and you shall hear meanwhile you john cook take all the beef remaining make it in small fardels such as a man may easily carry  thats soon done muttered the cook  the entire weight would scarce bow a lads shoulders  the rest of you put together what you would save from the enemy and is not too heavy to carry  one man made some attempt at growling at a mere lad being consulted while the stout warriors were kept in ignorance but the spirit of discipline and confidence had returned with sigbert and no one heeded the murmur  meantime sigbert followed the young lord walter up the rough winding stairs to the chamber where mabel lay on her cushions  what what demanded the boy pausing to enter  sigbert by way of answer quietly produced from some hidden pouch two figs  walter snatched at one with a cry of joy  mabel held out her hand then with a gasp drew it back  has roger had one  sigbert signed in the affirmative and mabel took a bite of the luscious fruit with a gasp of pleasure yet paused once more to hold the remainder to her nurse  the saints bless you my sweet lamb exclaimed the old woman finish it yourself  i could not  if you dont want it give it to me put in walter  for shame my lord sigbert did not scruple to say nor could the thirsty girl help finishing the refreshing morsel while walter with some scanty murmur of excuse demanded where it came from and what sigbert had meant by promises of safety  sir said sigbert you may remember how some time back your honoured father threw one of the fellaheen into the dungeon for maiming old leo  the villain  i remember  i thought he was hanged  no sir  he escaped  i went to take him food and he was gone  i then found an opening in the vault of which i spoke to none save your father for fear of mischief but i built it up with stones now in our extremity i bethought me of it and resolved to try whether the prisoner had truly escaped for where he went we might go  long and darksome is the way underground but it opens at last through one of the old burialplaces of the jews into the thickets upon the bank of the jordan  the jordan  little short of a league exclaimed walter  a league underground and in the dark sighed mabel  better than starving here like a rat in a trap returned her brother  ah yes oh yes  i will think of the cool river and the trees at the end  you will find chill enough lady long ere you reach the river said sigbert  you must wrap yourself well  tis an ugsome passage but your heart must not fail you for it is the only hope left us  the two young people were far too glad to hear of any prospect of release to think much of the dangers or discomforts of the mode walter danced for joy up and down the room like a young colt as he thought of being in a few hours more in the free open air with the sound of water rippling below and the shade of trees above him mabel threw herself on her knees before her rude crucifix partly in thankfulness partly in dread of the passage that was to come first  like going through the grave to life she murmured to her nurse  and when the scanty garrison was gathered together as many as possible provided with brands that might serve as torches and sigbert led them lower and lower down rugged steps hewn in the rock through vaults where only a gleam came from above and then through deeper cavernous places intensely dark there was a shudder perceptible by the clank and rattle of the armour which each had donned  in the midst walter paused and exclaimed  our banner  how leave it to the paynim dogs  its here sir said sigbert showing a bundle on his back  warning to the foe to break in and seek us grumbled gilbert  not so replied sigbert  i borrowed an old wrapper of nurses that will cheat their eyes till we shall be far beyond their ken  in the last dungeon a black opening lay before them just seen by the light of the lamp sigbert carried but so low that there was no entrance save on hands and knees  that den exclaimed walter  tis a rathole  never can we go that way  i have tried it sir quoth sigbert  where i can go you can go your sister quails not  it is fearful said mabel unable to repress a shiver but walter think what is before us if we stay here  the saints will guard us  the worst and lowest part only lasts for a few rods explained sigbert  now sir give your orders  torches and lanterns save huberts and nurses to be extinguished  we cannot waste them too soon but beware of loosing hold on them  walter repeated the orders thus dictated to him and sigbert arranged the file  it was absolutely needful that sigbert should go first to lead the way  mabel was to follow him for the sake of his help then her brother next nurse happily the only other female between two stout and trustworthy men the wounded roger came  then one after another the rest of the menatarms and servants five andtwenty in number  the last of the file was hubert with a lamp the others had to move in darkness  there had been no horse of any value in the castle for the knights charger had been mortally hurt in his last expedition and there had been no opportunity of procuring another  a deerhound however pushed and scrambled to the front and sigbert observed that he might be of great use in running before them  before entering however sigbert gave the caution that no word nor cry must be uttered aloud hap what might until permission was given for they would pass under the saracen camp and there was no knowing whether the sounds would reach the ears above ground  a strange plunge it was into the utter darkness crawling on hands and knees with the chill cavernous gloom and rock seeming to press in upon those who slowly crept along the dim light of sigberts lamp barely showing as he slowly moved on before  one of the two in the rear was dropped and extinguished in the dismal passage a loss proclaimed by a suppressed groan passing along the line and a louder exclamation from walter causing sigbert to utter a sharp hush enforced by a thud and tramp above as if the rock were coming down on them but which probably was the trampling of horses in the camp above  the smoke of the lamp in front drifted back and the air was more and more oppressive  mabel with set teeth and compressed lips struggled on clinging tight to the end of the cord which sigbert had tied to his body for her to hold by while in like manner walters hand was upon her dress  it became more and more difficult to breathe or crawl on till at last just as there was a sense that it was unbearable and that it would be easier to lie still and die than be dragged an inch farther the air became freer the roof seemed to be farther away the cavern wider and the motion freer  sigbert helped his young lady to stand upright and one by one all the train regained their feet  the lamp was passed along to be rekindled speech was permitted crevices above sometimes admitted air sometimes dripped with water  the worst was overprobably the first part had been excavated the farther portion was one of the many natural dens and caves of the earth in which palestine abounds  there was still a considerable distance to be traversed the lamps burnt out and had to be succeeded by torches carefully husbanded for the way was rough and rocky and a stumble might end in a fall into an abyss  in time however openings of side galleries were seen niches in the wall and tokens that the outer portion of the cavern had been once a burialplace of the ancient israelitesthe dog jews as the crusaders called them with a shudder of loathing and contempt  and joy infiniteclear daylight and a waving tree were perceptible beyond  it was daylight was it but the sun was low  five hours at least had been spent in that dismal transit before the exhausted soiled and chilled company stepped forth into a green thicket with the jordan rushing far below  five weeks siege in a narrow fortress then the two miles of subterranean strugglethese might well make the grass beneath the wild sycamore the corktree the long reeds the willows above all the sound of the flowing water absolute ecstasy  there was an instant rush for the river impeded by many a thornbush and creeper but almost anything green was welcome at the moment and the only disappointment was at the height and steepness of the banks of rock  however at last one happy man found a place where it was possible to climb down to the shingly bed of the river close to a great mass of the branching headed papyrus reed  into the muddy but eminently sweet water most of them waded helmets became cups hands scooped up the water there were gasps of joy and refreshment and blessing on the cool wave so long needed  sigbert and walter between them helped down mabel and her nurse and found a secure spot for them where weary faces feet and hands might be laved in the pool beneath a rock  then taking up a bow and arrows laid down by one of the men sigbert applied himself to the endeavour to shoot some of the water fowl which were flying wildly about over the reeds in the unwonted disturbance caused by the bathers  he brought down two or three of the duck kind and another of the party had bethought him of angling with a string and one of the only too numerous insects and had caught sundry of the unsuspecting and excellent fish  he had also carefully preserved a little fire and setting his boy to collect fuel he produced embers enough to cook both fish and birds sufficiently to form an appetising meal for those who had been reduced to scraps of salt food for full a fortnight  all is well so far said walter with his little lordly air  we have arranged our retreat with great skill  the only regret is that i have been forced to leave the castle to the enemy the castle we were bound to defend  nay sir if it be your will said sigbert the tables might yet be turned on the saracen  with great eagerness walter asked how this could be and sigbert reminded him that many a time it had been observed from the tower that though the saracens kept careful watch on the gates of the besieged so as to prevent a sally they left the rear of their camp absolutely undefended after the ordinary eastern fashion and sigbert with some dim recollection of rhymed chronicles of gideon and of jonathan believed that these enemies might be surprised after the same fashion as theirs  walter leapt up for joy but sigbert had to remind him that the sun was scarcely set and that time must be given for the saracens to fall asleep before the attack besides that his own men needed repose  there is all the distance to be traversed said walter  barely a league sir  it was hard to believe that the space so endless underground was so short above and walter was utterly incredulous till climbing the side of the ravine so high as to be above the trees sigbert showed him the familiar landmarks known in hunting excursions with his father  he was all eagerness but sigbert insisted on waiting till past midnight before moving that the men might have time to regain their vigour by sleep and also that there might be time for the saracens to fall into the deepest of all slumbers in full security  the moon was low in the west when sigbert roused the party having calculated that it would light them on the way but would be set by the time the attack was to be made  for mabels security it was arranged that a small and most unwilling guard should remain with her near enough to be able to perceive how matters went and if there appeared to be defeat and danger for her brother there would probably be full time to reach tiberias even on foot  however the men of the party had little fear that flight would be needed for though perhaps no one would have thought of the scheme for himself there was a general sense that what sigbert devised was prudent and that he would not imperil his young lord and lady upon a desperate venture  keeping well and compactly together the little band moved on along arid rocky paths starting now and then at the howls of the jackals which gradually gathered into a pack and began to follow as if some one whisperedthey scented prey on whom was the question  on a cliff looking down on the arab camp and above it on the dark mass of the castle where in the watchtower sigbert had left a lamp burning they halted just as the halfmoon was dipping below the heights towards the mediterranean  here the lady mabel and her guard were to wait until they heard the sounds which to their practised ears would show how the fight went  the arab shout of victory they knew only too well and it was to be the signal of flight towards tiberias but if success was with the assailants the warcry deus vult and st hubert for hundberg were to be followed by the hymn of victory as the token that it was safe to descend  all was dark save for the magnificent stars of an eastern night as mabel her nurse and the five men commanded by the wounded roger stood silently praying while listening intently to the muffled tramp of their own people descending on the blacker mass denoting the saracen tents  the sounds of feet died away only the jackals whine and moan were heard  then suddenly came a flash of lights in different directions and shouts here there everywhere cries yells darkness an undistinguishable medley of noise the shrill shriek of the moslem and the exulting warcry of the christian ringing farther and farther off in the long valley leading towards the jordan fords  dawn began to breakoverthrown tents could be seen  mabel had time to wonder whether she was forgotten when the hymn began to sound pealing on her ears up the pass and she had not had time for more than an earnest thanksgiving and a few steps down the rocky pathway before a horses tread was heard and a manatarms came towards her leading a slender beautiful arab horse  all well the young lord and all  the saracens surprised fled without ever guessing the number of their foes  the sheik made prisoner in his tent  ay and a greater still the emir hussein bey who had arrived to take possession of the castle only that very evening what a ransom he would pay  horses and all were taken the spoil of the country round and master sigbert had sent this palfrey for lady mabel to ride down  perhaps sigbert in all his haste and occupation had been able to discern that the gentle little mare was not likely to display the arab steeds perilous attachment to a master for mabel was safely mounted and ere sunrise was greeted by her joyous and victorious brother  is not this noble sister  down went the pagan dogs before my good sword  there are a score of them dragged off to the dead mans hollow for the jackals and vultures but i kept one fellow uppermost to show you the gash i made  come and see  roger here observed that the horse might grow restive at the carcase and mabel was excused the sight though walter continued to relate his exploits and demand whether he had not won his spurs by so grand a ruse and victory  truly i think sigbert has said his sister  it was all his doing  sigbert an english churl  what are you thinking of mabel  i am thinking to whom the honour is due  you are a mere child sister or you would know better  sigbert is a very fair squire but what is a squires business but to put his master in the way of honour  do not talk such folly  mabel was silenced and after being conducted across the bare trampled ground among the tents of the arabs she reentered the castle where in the court groups of disarmed arabs stood their bournouses pulled over their brows their long lances heaped in a corner grim and disconsolate at their discomfiture and captivity  a repast of stewed kid fruit and sherbet was prepared for her and her brother from the spoil after which both were weary enough to throw themselves on their cushions for a long sound sleep  mabel slept the longer and when she awoke she found that the sun was setting and that supper was nearly ready  walter met her just as she had arranged her dress to bid nurse make ready her bales for they were to start at dawn on the morrow for tiberias  it was quite possible that the enemy might return in force to deliver their emir  a small garrison freshly provisioned could hold out the castle until relief could be sent but it would be best to conduct the two important prisoners direct to the king to say nothing of walters desire to present them and to display these testimonies of his prowess before the court of jerusalem  the emir was a tall slim courteous arab with the exquisite manners of the desert  both he and the sheik were invited to the meal  both looked startled and shocked at the entrance of the fair haired damsel and the sheik crouched in a corner with a savage glare in his eye like a freshly caught wild beast though the emir sat crosslegged on the couch eating and talking in the lingua franca which was almost a native tongue to the son and daughter of the crusader  from him walter learnt that king fulk was probably at tiberias and this quickened the eagerness of all for a start  it took place in the earliest morning so as to avoid the heat of the day  how different from the departure in the dark underground passage  horses enough had been captured to afford the emir and the sheik each his own beautiful steed the more readily that the creatures could hardly have been ridden by any one else and their parole was trusted not to attempt to escape  walter mabel sigbert and roger were also mounted and asses were found in the camp for the nurse and the men who had been hurt in the nights surprise  the only mischance on the way was that in the noontide halt just as the shimmer of the lake of galilee met their eyes under a huge terebinthtree growing on a rock when all except sigbert had composed themselves to a siesta there was a sudden sound of loud and angry altercation and as the sleepers started up the emir was seen grasping the bridle of the horse on which the sheik sat downcast and abject under the storm of fierce indignant words hurled at him for thus degrading his tribe and all islam by breaking his plighted word to the christian  this was in arabic and the emir further insisted on his prostrating himself to ask pardon while he himself in lingua franca explained that the man was of a low and savage tribe of bedouins who knew not how to keep faith  walter broke out in loud threats declaring that the traitor dog ought to be hung up at once on the tree or dragged along with hands tied behind him but sigbert contented himself with placing a man at each side of his horses head as they proceeded on their way to the strongly fortified town of the ancient herods perched at the head of the dark gray lake of galilee shut in by mountain peaks  the second part of the journey was necessarily begun in glowing heat for it was most undesirable to have to spend a night in the open country and it was needful to push on to a fortified hospice or monastery of st john which formed a halfway house  weary dusty athirst they came in sight of it in the evening and walter and roger rode forward to request admittance  the porter begged them to wait when he heard that the party included women and saracen prisoners and walter began to storm  however a few moments more brought a tall old knight hospitalier to the gate and he made no difficulties as to lodging the saracens in a building at the end of the court where they could be well guarded and mabel and her nurse were received in a part of the precincts appropriated to female pilgrims  it was a bare and empty place a round turret over the gateway with a stone floor and a few mats rolled up in the corner mats which former pilgrims had not left in an inviting condition  however the notions of comfort of the twelfth century were not exacting  water to wash away the dust of travel was brought to the door and was followed by a substantial meal on roasted kid and thin cakes of bread  sigbert came up with permission for the women to attend compline though only strictly veiled and mabel knelt in the little cool cryptlike chapel almost like the late place of her escape and returned thanks for the deliverance from their recent peril  then fresh mats and cushions having been supplied the damsel and her nurse slept profoundly and were only roused by a bell for a mass in the darkness just before dawn after which they again set forth the commander of the hospice himself and three or four knights accompanying them and conversing familiarly with the emir on the current interests of palestine  about halfway onward the glint and glitter of spears was seen amid a cloud of dust on the hillpath opposite  the troop drew together on their guard though as the hospitalier observed from the side of tiberias an enemy could scarcely come  a scout was sent forward to reconnoitre but even before he came spurring joyously back the golden crosses of jerusalem had been recognised and confirmed his tidings that it was the rearguard of the army commanded by king fulk himself on the way to the relief of the castle of gebelaroun  in a brief halfhour more young walter de hundberg with his sister by his side was kneeling before an alert slender wiry figure in plain chamois leather with a worn sunburnt face and keen blue eyes fulk of anjouwho had resigned his french county to lead the crusading cause in palestine  stand up fair youth and tell thy tale and how thou hast forestalled our succour  walter told his tale of the blockaded castle the underground passage and the dexterous surprise of the besiegers ending by presenting not ungracefully his captives to the pleasure of the king  why this is well done exclaimed fulk  thou art a youth of promise and wilt well be a prop to our grandsons english throne thou shalt take knighthood from mine own hand as thy prowess well deserveth  and thou fair damsel here is one whom we could scarce hold back from rushing with single hand to deliver his betrothed sir raymond of courtwood you are balked of winning thy lady at the swords point but thou wilt scarce rejoice the less  a darkeyed slender young knight in bright armour drew towards mabel and she let him take her hand but she was intent on something else and exclaimed  oh sir sir king let me speak one word  the guerdon should not be only my brothers  the device that served us wasour squires  the baron of courtwood uttered a fierce exclamation  walter muttered mabel do not be such a meddling fool but the king asked and who may this same squire be  an old english churl said walter impatiently  my father took him as his squire for want of a better  and he has been like a father to us added mabel  silence sister  it is not for you to speak petulantly cried walter  not that the baron of courtwood need be jealous added he laughing somewhat rudely  where is the fellow  stand forth sigbert  travel and heatsoiled sunburnt gray and ragged armour rusted leathern garment stained the rugged figure came forward footsore and lame for he had given up his horse to an exhausted manatarms a laugh went round at the bare idea of the young ladys preferring such a form to the splendid young knight her destined bridegroom  is this the esquire who hath done such good service according to the young lady asked the king  ay sir returned walter he is true and faithful enough though nothing to be proud of in looks and he served us well in my sally and attack  it was his mabel tried to say but sigbert hushed her  let be let be my sweet lady it was but my bounden duty  whats that  speak out what passes there demanded young courtwood halfjealously still  a mere english villein little better than a valet of the camp were the exclamations around  a noble damsel take note of him fie for shame  he has been true and brave said the king  dost ask a guerdon for him young sir he added to walter  what wouldst have old sigbert asked walter in a patronising voice  i ask nothing sir returned the old squire  to have seen my lords children in safety is all i wish  i have but done my duty  king fulk who saw through the whole more clearly than some of those around yet still had the true angevin and norman contempt for a saxon here said  old man thou art trusty and shrewd and mayst be useful  wilt thou take service as one of my menatarms  thou mayst said walter thou art not bound to me  england hath enough of saxon churls without thee and i shall purvey myself an esquire of youthful grace and noble blood  mabel looked at her betrothed and began to speak  no no sweet lady i will have none of that rough old masterful sort about me  sir king said sigbert i thank thee heartily  i would still serve the cross but my vow has been when my young lord and lady should need me no more to take the cross of st john with the hospitaliers  as a lay brother  bethink thee said fulk of anjou  noble blood is needed for a knight of the order  sigbert smiled slightly in spite of all the sadness of his face and the knight commander who had ridden with them a fleming by birth said  for that matter sir king we are satisfied  sigbert the son of sigfrid hath proved his descent from the old english kings of the east saxons and the order will rejoice to enrol in the novitiate so experienced a warrior  is this indeed so asked fulk  a good lineage even if english  but rebel muttered courtwood  it is so sir king said sigbert  my father was disseised of the lands of hundberg and died in the fens fighting under hereward le wake  my mother dwelt under the protection of the abbey of colchester and by and by i served under our atheling and when king henrys wars in normandy were over i followed the lord of hundbergs banner because the menatarms were mine own neighbours and his lady my kinswoman  roger can testify to my birth and lineage  so thou art true heir of hundberg if that be the name of thine english castle  ay sir save for the norman  but i would not if i could meddle with thee my young lord though thou dost look at me askance spite of having learnt of me to ride and use thy lance  i am the last of the english line of old sigfrid the wormbane and a childless man and i trust the land and the serfs will be well with thee who art english born and son to wulfrida of lexden  and i trust that thou my sweet lady mabel will be a happy bride and wife  all i look for is to end my days under the cross in the cause of the holy sepulchre whether as warrior or lay brother  yes dear lady that is enough for old sigbert  and mabel had to acquiesce and believe that her old friend found peace and gladness beneath the eightpointed cross when she and her brother sailed for england where she would behold the green fields and purple heather of which he had told her amid the rocks of palestine  moreover she thought of him when on her way through france she heard the young monk bernard then rising into fame preach on the beleaguered city saved by the poor wise man and tell how when the city was safe none remembered the poor man  true the preacher gave it a mystic meaning and interpreted it as meaning the emphatically poor man by whom salvation came and whom too few bear in mind  yet such a higher meaning did not exclude the thought of one whose deserts surpassed his honours here on earth    the beggars legacy    an alderman bold henry smith was enrolled    of the silversmiths company highly praised was his name his skill had high fame    and a prosperous man was he  knights drank to his health and lauded his wealth    sailors came from the western main their prizes they sold of ingots of gold    or plate from the galleys of spain  then beakers full fine to hold the red wine    were cast in his furnaces mould or tankards rich chased in intricate taste    gimmal rings of the purest gold  on each new years morn no man thought it scorn    whether statesman or warrior brave the choicest device of costliest price    for a royal offring to crave  bring here such a toy as the most may joy    the eyes of our gracious queen rows of orient pearls gold pins for her curls    silver network all glistening sheen  each buyer who camelord squire or dame    behaved in most courteous guise showing honour due as to one they knew    to be at once wealthy and wise  in london guild hall the citizens all    esteemed him their future lord mayor not one did he meet in market or street    but made him a reverence fair  ho said master smith i will try the pith    of this smoothfaced courtesy do they prize myself do they prize my pelf    do they value whats mine or me  his gold chain of pride he hath laid aside    and furred

guarding well his bags    his small messan dog would abide  so thus up and down through village and town    in rain or in sunny weather through surreys fair land his staff in his hand    went he and the dog together  good folk hear my prayer of your bounty spare    help a wanderer in his need better days i have seen a rich man i have been    esteemed both in word and deed  in the first long street certain forms he did meet    but scarce might behold their faces from matted elflocks eyes stared like an ox    and shambling were their paces  not one gave him cheer nor would one come near    as he turned him away to go then a heavy stone at the dog was thrown    to deal a right cowardly blow  in mitchams fair vale the men gan to rail    not a vagabond may come near each mothers son ran each boy and each man    to summon the constable here  the carts tail behind the beggar they bind    they flogged him full long and full sore they hunted him out did that rabble rout    and bade him come thither no more  all weary and bruised and scurvily used    he went trudging along his track the lesson was stern he had come to learn    and yet he disdained to turn back  where waltononthames gleams fair through the stems    of its tufted willow palms there were loitering folk who most vilely spoke    nor would give him one groat in alms  dog smith was the cry behold him go by    the fool

child mid the bushes wild    thy face and thine arms that thus tear the wool the sheep leave to spin and to weave    it makes us our clothes to wear  then she led him in where her mother did spin    and make barley bannocks to eat they gave him enough though the food was rough    the kindliness made it most sweet  many years had past report ran at last    the rich alderman smith was dead then each knight and dame and each merchant came    to hear his last testament read  i harry smith found of mind clear and sound    thus make and devise my last will while england shall stand i bequeath my land    my last legacies to fulfil  to the muddy spot where they cleaned them not    when amongst their fields i did roam to every one there with the unkempt hair    i bequeath a smalltoothed comb

stranger cheer i leave as my doles to the pious souls    full seventy pounds by the year  to cobham the thrifty i leave a good fifty    to be laid out in cloth dyed dark on sabbathday to be given away    and known by smiths badge and mark  to leatherhead too my gratitudes due    for a welcome most freely given let my bounty remain for each village to gain    whence the poor man was never driven  so in each sweet dale and bright sunny vale    in the garden of england blest those have found a friend whose gifts do not end    who gave to that stranger a rest   henry smiths history is literally true  he was a silversmith of immense wealth in london in the latter part of the sixteenth century but in his later years he chose to perambulate the county of surrey as a beggar and was known as dog smith  he met with various fortune in different parishes and at mitcham was flogged at the carts tail  on his death apparently in 1627 he was found to have left bequests to almost every place in surrey according to the manners of the inhabitantsto mitcham a horsewhip to waltonon thames a bridle to betchworth leatherhead and many more endowments which produce from 50 to 75 pounds a year and to cobham a sum to be spent annually in woollen cloth of a uniform colour bearing smiths badge to be given away in church to the poor and impotent as the following tablet still records  1627  itemthat the gift to the impotent and aged poor people shall be bestowed in apparell of one coulour with some badge or other mark that it may be known to be the gift of the said henry smith or else in bread flesh or fish on the sabbathday publickly in the church in witness whereof the said henry smith did put to his hand and seal the twentyfirst day of january in the second year of the reign of our most gracious sovereign lord king charles the first    a review of nieces    general sir edward fulford kgc to his sister miss fulford united service club 29th june  my dear charlottei find i shall need at least a month to get through the necessary business so that i shall only have a week at last for my dear mother and the party collected at new cove  you will have ample time to decide which of the nieces shall be asked to accompany us but you had better give no hint of the plan till you have studied them thoroughly  after all the years that you have accompanied me on all my stations you know how much depends on the young lady of our house being one able to make things pleasant to the strange varieties who will claim our hospitality in a place like malta yet not likely to flag if left in solitude with you  she must be used enough to society to do the honours genially and gracefully and not have her head turned by being the chief young lady in the place  she ought to be well bred if not high bred enough to give a tone to the society of her contemporaries and above all she must not flirt  if i found flirtation going on with the officers i should send her home on the spot  of course all this means that she must have the only real spring of good breeding and be a thoroughly good religious unselfish rightminded girl otherwise we should have to rue our scheme  in spite of all you would do towards moulding and training a young maiden there will be so many distractions and unavoidable counterinfluences that the experiment would be too hazardous unless there were a character and manners ready formed  there ought likewise to be cultivation and intelligence to profit by the opportunities she will have  i should not like greece and italy to say nothing of egypt and palestine to be only so much gape seed  you must have an eye likewise to good temper equal to cope with the various emergencies of travelling nb  you should have more than one in your eye for probably the first choice will be of some one too precious to be attainable your affectionate brother  edward fulford   miss fulford to sir edward fulford 1 shingle cottages new cove s clements 30th june  my dear edwardwhen sydney smith led perfection to the pea because the pea would not come to perfection he could hardly have had such an ideal as yours  your intended niece is much like the not impossible she of a youth under twenty  one comfort is that such is the blindness of your kind that you will imagine all these charms in whatever good ladylike simplehearted girl i pitch upon and such i am sure i shall find all my nieces  the only difficulty will be in deciding and that will be fixed by details of style and the parents willingness to spare their child  this is an excellent plan of yours for bringing the whole family together round our dear old mother and her home daughter  this is the end house of three on a little promontory and has a charming viewof the sea in the first place and then on the one side of what is called by courtesy the parade on the top of the sea wall where there is a broad walk leading to s clements nearly two miles off  there are not above a dozen houses altogether and the hotel is taken for the two families from london and oxford while the druces are to be in the house but one next to us the middle one being unluckily let off to various inhabitants  we have one bedroom free where we may lodge some of the overflowings and i believe the whole party are to take their chief meals together in the large room at the hotel  the houses are mostly scattered being such as fortunate skippers build as an investment and that their wives may amuse themselves with lodgers in their absence  the church is the weakest point in this otherwise charming place  the nearest and actually the parish church is a hideous compo structure built in the worst of times as a chapel of ease to s clements  i am afraid my mothers loyalty to the parochial system will make her secure a pew there though at the farther end of the town there is a new church which is all that can be wished and about a mile and a half inland there is a village church called hollyford held i believe by a former fellowcurate of horace druce  perhaps they will exchange duties if horace can be persuaded to take a longer holiday than merely for the three weeks he has provided for at bourne parva they cannot come till monday week but our oxford professor and his party come on thursday and edith will bring her girls the next day her husband our qc cannot come till his circuit is over but of course you know more about his movements than i do  i wonder you have never said anything about those girls of his but i suppose you class them as unattainable  i have said nothing to my mother or emily of our plans as i wish to be perfectly unbiased and as i have seen none of the nieces for five years and am prepared to delight in them all i may be reckoned as a blank sheet as to their meritsyour affectionate sister  charlotte fulford   july 4by noon today arrived martyn 127 with mary his wife margaret and avice their daughters uchtred their second son and poor harry fulfords orphan isabel who has had a home with them ever since she left school  though she is only a cousin once removed she seems to fall into the category of eligible nieces and indeed she seems the obvious companion for us as she has no home and seems to me rather set aside among the others  i hope there is no jealousy for she is much better looking than her cousins with gentle liquid eyes a pretty complexion and a wistful expression moreover she is dressed in a quiet ladylike way whereas grandmamma looked out just now in the twilight and said my dear martyn have you brought three boys down  it was a showery chilly evening and they were all out admiring the waves  ulsters and sailor hats were appropriate enough then but the genders were not easy to distinguish especially as the elder girl wears her hair shortno improvement to a keen face which needs softening  she is much too like a callow undergraduate altogether and her sister follows suit though perhaps with more refinement of featureindeed she looks delicate and was soon called in  they are in slight mourning and appear in gray serges  they left a strap of books on the sofa of somewhat alarming light literature for the seaside  bacons essays and elements of logic were the first emily beheld and while she stood regarding them with mingled horror and respect in ran avice to fetch them as the two sisters are reading up for the oxford examination she added when she saw her two feebleminded aunts looking for the rest of the word  however she says it is only pica who is going up for it this time  she herself was not considered strong enough  yet there have those two set themselves down with their books under the rocks blind to all the glory of sea and shore deaf to the dash and ripple of the waves  i long to go and shout wordsworths warning about growing double to them  i am glad to say that uchtred has come and fetched avice away  i can hardly believe martyn and mary parents to this grownup family they look as youthful as ever and are as active and vigorous and full of their jokes with one another and their children  they are now gone out to the point of the rocks at the end of our promontory fishing for microscopical monsters and comporting themselves boy and girl fashion  isabel has meantime been chatting very pleasantly with grandmamma and trying to extricate us from our bewilderment as to names and nicknames  my poor mother after strenuously preventing abbreviations in her own family has to endure them in her descendants and as every one names a daughter after her there is some excuse  this oxford margaret goes by the name of pie or pica apparently because it is the remotest portion of magpie and her london cousin is universally known as metelillthe danish form i believe but in the bourne parva family the young margaret druce is nothing worse than meg and her elder sister remains jane  nobody would dare to call her anything else says isa  avice cannot but be sometimes translated into the bird while my poor name in my second london niece has become the masculine charley  i shall know why when i see her says isa laughing  this goodnatured damsel is coming out walking with us old folks and will walk on with me when grandmamma turns back with emily  her great desire is to find the whereabouts of a convalescent home in which she and her cousins have subscribed to place a poor young dressmaker for a six weeks rest but i am afraid it is on the opposite side of s clements too far for a walk  july 5why did you never tell me how charming metelill is  i never supposed the fulford features capable of so much beauty and the whole manner and address are so delightful that i do not wonder that all her cousins are devoted to her uchtred or butts as they are pleased to name him has brightened into another creature since she came and she seems like sunshine to us all  as to my namesake i am sorry to say that i perceive the appropriateness of charley but i suppose it is style for the masculine dress which in pica and avice has an air of being worn for mere convenience sake and is quite ladylike especially on avice has in her an appearance of defiance and coquetry  her foxterrier always shares her room which therefore is eschewed by her sister and this has made a change in our arrangements  we had thought the room in our house which it seems is an object of competition would suit best for jane druce and one of her little sisters but a hint was given by either pica or her mother that it would be a great boon to let jane and avice share it as they are very great friends and we had the latter there installed  however this foxterrier made metelill protest against sleeping at the hotel with her sister and her mother begged us to take her in  thereupon emily saw isa looking annoyed and on inquiry she replied sweetly oh never mind aunty dear i daresay wasp wont be so bad as he looks and ill try not to be silly and then i daresay charley will not tease me  only i had hoped to be with dear metelill but no doubt she will prefer her birdpeople always do  so they were going to make that poor child the victim  for it seems pica has a room to herself and will not give it up or take in any one  emily went at once to avice and asked whether she would mind going to the hotel and letting isa be with metelill and this she agreed to at once  i dont know why i tell you all these details except that they are straws to show the way of the wind and you will see how isabel is always the sacrifice unless some one stands up for her  here comes martyn to beguile me out to the beach  july 6 sundaymy mother drove to church and took edith who was glad neither to walk nor to have to skirmish for a seat  isa walked with emily and me and so we made up our five for our seat which to our dismay is in the gallery but happily for my mother the stairs are easy  the pews there are not quite so close to ones nose as those in the body of the church they are a little wider and are furnished with hassocks instead of traps to prevent kneeling so that we think ourselves well off and we were agreeably surprised at the service  there is a new incumbent who is striving to modify things as well as his people and their architecture permit and who preached an excellent sermon  so we triumph over the young folk who try to persuade us that the gallery is a judgment on us for giving in to the hired pew system  they may banter me as much as they like but i dont like to see them jest with grandmamma about it as if they were on equal terms and she does not understand it either  my dear she gravely says your grandpapa always said it was a duty to support the parish church nothing will do but the congregational system in these days dont you think so began pica dogmatically when her father called her off  martyn cannot bear to see his mother teased  he and his wife with the young ones made their way to hollyford where they found a primitive old church and a service to match but were terribly late and had to sit in wormeaten pews near the door amid scents of peppermint and southernwood  on the way back martyn fraternised with a mr methuen a cambridge tutor with a reading party who has i am sorry to say arrived at the house visavis to ours on the other side of the cove  our oxford young ladies turn up their noses at the light blue and say the men have not the finish of the dark but charley is in wild spirits  i heard her announcing the arrival thus  i say isa what a stunning lark  not but that i was up to it all the time or else i should have skedaddled for this place was bound to be as dull as ditchwater  but how did you know asked isa  why bertie elwood tipped me a line that he was coming down here with his coach or else i should have told the mater i couldnt stand it and gone to stay with some one  this bertie elwood is it seems one of the many london acquaintance  he looks inoffensive and so do the others but i wish they had chosen some other spot for their studies and so perhaps does their tutor though he is now smoking very happily under a rock with martyn  july 7such a delightful evening walk with metelill and isa as emily and i had last night going to evensong in our despised church  the others said they could stand no more walking and heat and yet we met martyn and mary out upon the rocks when we were coming home after being i must confess nearly fried to death by the gas and bad air  they laughed at us and our exertions all in the way of good humour but it was not wholesome from parents  mary tried to make me confess that we were coming home in a self complacent fakir state of triumph in our headaches much inferior to her humble revelling in cool sea sky and moonlight  it was like the difference between the benedicite and the te deum i could not help thinking while emily said a few words to martyn as to how mamma would be disappointed at his absenting himself from church and was answered ah  emily you are still the good home child of the primitive era which she did not understand but i faced about and asked if it were not what we all should be  he answered rather sadly if we could and his wife shrugged her shoulders  alas i fear the nineteenth century tone has penetrated them and do not wonder that this poor isabel does not seem happy in her home  9what a delightful sight is a large family of young things together  the party is complete for the druces arrived yesterday evening in full force torn from their bucolic life as martyn tells them  my poor dear old margaret  she does indeed look worn and aged dragged by cares like a colonists wife and her husband is quite bald and as spare as a hermit  it is hard to believe him younger than martyn but then his whole soul is set on bourne parva and hers on him on the children on the work and on making both ends meet and they toil five times more severely in one month than the professor and his lady in a year besides having just twice as many children all of whom are here except the schoolboys  margaret declares that the entire rest and the talking to something not entirely rural will wind her husband up for the year and it is good to see her sitting in a basketchair by my mother knitting indeed but they both do that like breathing while they purr away to one another in a state of perfect repose and felicity  meantime her husband talks oxford with martyn and mary  their daughter jane seems to be a most valuable helper to both but she too has a worn anxious countenance and i fear she may be getting less rest than her parents as they have brought only one young nursemaid with them and seem to depend on her and meg for keeping the middlesized children in order  she seems to have all the cares of the world on her young brow and is much exercised about one of the boxes which has gone astray on the railway  what do you think she did this morning  she started off with avice at eight oclock for the s clements station to see if the telegram was answered and they went on to the convalescent home and saw the oxford dressmaker  it seems that avice had taken uchtred with her on sunday evening made out the place and gone to church at s clements close bya very long walk but it seems that those foolish girls thought me too fine a lady to like to be seen with her in her round hat on a sunday  i wish they could understand what it is that i dislike  if i objected to appearances i am afraid the poor druces would fare ill margarets girls cannot help being essentially ladies but they have not much beauty to begin withand their dress  it was chiefly made by their own sewing machine with the assistance of the bourne parva mantuamaker superintended by jane to prevent her from making it foolish and the effect i grieve to say is illfitting dowdiness which becomes grotesque from their selfcomplacent belief that it displays the only graceful and sensible fashion in the place  it was laughable to hear them criticising every hat or costume they have seen quite unaware that they were stared at themselves till charley told them people thought they had come fresh out of lady bountifuls goodybox which piece of impertinence they took as a great compliment to their wisdom and excellence  to be sure the fashions are distressing enough but metelill shows that they can be treated gracefully and becomingly and even avice makes her serge and hat look fresh and ladylike  spite of contrast avice and jane seem to be much devoted to each other  pica and charley are another pair and isa and metelillthough metelill is the universal favourite and there is always competition for her  in early morning i see the brown heads and blue bathingdresses a mermaiding as they call it in the cove below and they come in all glowing with the floating tresses that make metelill look so charming and full of merry adventures at breakfast  we all meet in the great room at the hotel for a substantial meal at halfpast one and again most of us at least at eight but it is a moot point which of these meals we call dinner  very merry both of them are martyn and horace druce are like boys together and the girls scream with laughter rather too much so sometimes  charley is very noisy and so is meg druce when not overpowered by shyness  she will not exchange a sentence with any of the elders but in the general laugh she chuckles and shrieks like a young cochinchinese chicken learning to crow and i hear her squealing like a maniac while she is shrimping with the younger ones and charley  i must except those two young ladies from the unconscious competition for one has no manners at all and the other affects those of a man but as to the rest they are all as nice as possible and i can only say how happy could i be with either  isa poor girl seems to need our care most and would be the most obliging and attentive  metelill would be the prettiest and sweetest ornament of our drawingroom and would amuse you the most pica with her scholarly tastes would be the best and most appreciative fellowtraveller and jane if she could or would go would perhaps benefit the most by being freed from a heavy strain and having her views enlarged  10a worthy girl is jane druce but i fear the vicarage is no school of manners  her mother is sitting with us and has been discoursing to grandmamma on her janes wonderful helpfulness and activity in house and parish and how everything hinged on her last winter when they had whoopingcough everywhere in and out of doors indeed she doubts whether the girl has ever quite thrown off the effects of all her exertions then  suddenly comes a trampling a bounce and a rush and in dashes miss jane fiercely demanding whether the children had leave to go to the cove  poor margaret meekly responds that she had consented  and didnt you know exclaims the damsel that all their everyday boots are in that unlucky trunk  there is a humble murmur that chattie had promised to be very careful but it produces a hotter reply  as if chatties promises of that kind could be trusted  and i had told them that they were to keep with baby on the cliff  then came a real apology for interfering with janes plans to which we listened aghast and margaret was actually getting up to go and look after her amphibious offspring herself when her daughter cut her off short with nonsense mamma you know you are not to do any such thing  i must go thats all or they wont have a decent boot or stocking left among them  off she went with another bang while her mother began blaming herself for having yielded in haste to the persuasions of the little ones oblivious of the boots thus sacrificing janes happy morning with avice  my mother showed herself shocked by the tone in which margaret had let herself be hectored and this brought a torrent of almost tearful apologies from the poor dear thing knowing she did not keep up her authority or make herself respected as would be good for her girl but if we only knew how devoted jane was and how much there was to grind and try her temper we should not wonder that it gave way sometimes indeed it was needful to turn away the subject as margaret was the last person we wished to distress  jane could have shown no temper to the children for at dinner a rolypoly person of five years old who seems to absorb all the fat in the family made known that he had had a very jolly day and he loved cousin avice very much indeed and sister janie very much indeeder and he could with difficulty be restrained from an expedition to kiss them both then and there  the lost box was announced while we were at dinner and jane is gone with her faithful avice to unpack it  her mother would have done it and sent her boating with the rest but submitted as usual when commanded to adhere to the former plan of driving with grandmamma these druce children must be excellent according to their mother but they are terribly brusque and bearish  they are either seen and not heard or not seen and heard a great deal too much  even jane and meg who ought to know better keep up a perpetual undercurrent of chatter and giggle whatever is going on with any one who will share it with them  10i am more and more puzzled about the new reading of the fifth commandment  none seem to understand it as we used to do  the parents are content to be used as equals and to be called by all sorts of absurd names and though grandmamma is always kindly and attentively treated there is no reverence for the relationship  i heard charley call her a jolly old party and metelill respond that she was a sweet old thing  why we should have thought such expressions about our grandmother a sort of sacrilege but when i ventured to hint as much charley flippantly answered gracious me we are not going back to buckram and metelill with her caressing way declared that she loved dear granny too much to be so stiff and formal  i quoted  if i be a father where is my honour  and one of them taking it i am sorry to say for a line of secular poetry exclaimed at the stiffness and coldness  pica then put in her oar and began to argue that honour must be earned and that it was absurd and illogical to claim it for the mere accident of seniority or relationship  jane not at all conscious of being an offender howled at her that this was her horrible liberalism and neology while metelill asked what was become of loyalty  that depends on what you mean by it returned our girl graduate  loi aute steadfastness to principle is noble but personal loyalty to some mere puppet or the bush the crown hangs on is a pernicious figment  charley shouted that this was the no 1 letter a point in pies prize essay and there the discussion ended isa only sighing to herself ah if i had any one to be loyal to  how you would jockey them cried charley turning upon her so roughly that the tears came into her eyes and i must have put on what you call my governmenthouse look for charley subsided instantly  11here was a test as to this same obedience  the pupils who are by this time familiars of the party had devised a boating and fishing expedition for all the enterprising which was satisfactory to the elders because it was to include both the fathers unluckily however this mornings post brought a summons to martyn and mary to fulfil an engagement they have long made to meet an american professor at  and they had to start off at eleven oclock and at the same time the hollyford clergyman an old fellowcurate of horace druce sent a note imploring him to take a funeral  so the voice of the seniors was for putting off the expedition but the voice of the juniors was quite the other way the three families took different lines  the druces show obedience though not respect they growled and grumbled horribly but submitted though with ill grace to the explicit prohibition  non interference is professedly marys principle but even she said with entreaty veiled beneath the playfulness when it was pleaded that two of the youths had oars at cambridge freshwater fish my dears  i wish you would wait for us  i dont want you to attend the submarine wedding of our old friends tame and isis  to which pica rejoined likewise talking out of spenser that proteus would provide a nice ancient nymph to tend on them  her father then chimed in saying you will spare our nerves by keeping to dry land unless you can secure the ancient mariner who was with us yesterday  come come most illustrious said pica goodhumouredly im not going to encourage you to set up for nerves  you are much better without them and i must get some medusae  it ended with i beg you will not go without that old man the most authoritative speech i have heard either martyn or mary make to their daughters but it was so much breath wasted on pica who maintains her right to judge for herself  the ancient mariner had been voted an encumbrance and exchanged for a jolly young waterman  our other mother edith implored and was laughed down by charley who declared she could swim and that she did not think uncle martyn would have been so oldwomanish  metelill was so tender and caressing with her frightened mother that i thought here at last was submission and with a good grace  but after a turn on the esplanade among the pupils back came metelill in a hurry to say dear mother will you very much mind if i go  they will be so disappointed and there will be such a fuss if i dont and charley really ought to have some one with her besides pie who will heed nothing but magnifying medusae  i am afraid it is true as isa says that it was all owing to the walk with that young mr horne  poor edith fell into such a state of nervous anxiety that i could not leave her and she confided to me how charley had caught her foolish masculine affectations in the family of this very bertie elwood and told me of the danger of an attachment between metelill and a young government clerk who is always on the lookout for her and dear metelill is so gentle and gracious that she cannot bear to repel any one says the mother who would i see be thankful to part with either daughter to our keeping in hopes of breaking off perilous habits  i was saved however from committing myself by the coming in of isabel  that child follows me about like a tame cat and seems so to need mothering that i cannot bear to snub her  she came to propound to me a notion that has risen among these oxford girls namely that i should take out their convalescent dressmaker as my maid instead of poor amelie  she is quite well now and going back next week but a few years in a warm climate might be the saving of her health  so i agreed to go with isa to look at her and judge whether the charming account i heard was all youthful enthusiasm  edith went out driving with my mother and we began our teteatete walk in which i heard a great deal of the difficulties of that freeandeasy house at oxford and how often isa wishes for some one who would be a real guide and helper instead of only giving a playful slapdash answer like good natured mockery  the treatment may suit marys own daughters but just as you please my dear is not good for sensitive anxious spirits  we passed jane and avice reading together under a rock i was much inclined to ask them to join us but isa was sure they were much happier undisturbed and she was so unwilling to share me with any one that i let them alone  i was much pleased with the dressmaker maude harris who is a nice modest refined girl and if the accounts i get from her employers bear out what i hear of her i shall engage her i shall be glad for the nieces sake to have that sort of young woman about the place  she speaks most warmly of what the misses fulford have done for her  jane will be disappointed if i cannot have her rival candidatea pet schoolgirl who works under the bourne parva dressmaker  what a recommendation cries pica and there is a burst of mirth at which jane looks round and says what is there to laugh at  miss dadworthy is a real good woman and a real old bourne parva person so that you may be quite sure martha will have learnt no nonsense to begin with  no says pica from all such pomps and vanities as style she will be quite clear  while avices friendship goes as far as to say that if aunt charlotte cannot have maude perhaps martha could get a little more training  whereupon jane runs off by the yard explanations of the admirable trainingreligious moral and intellectualof bourne parva illustrated by the best answers of her favourite scholars anecdotes of them and the reports of the inspectors religious and secular and avice listens with patience nay with respectful sympathy  12we miss mary and martyn more than i expected  careless and easygoing as they seem they made a difference in the ways of the young people they were always about with them not as dragons but for their own pleasure  the presence of a professor must needs impose upon young men and mary with her brilliant wit and charming manners was a check without knowing it  the boating party came back gay and triumphant and the young men joined in our late meal and oh what a noise there was though i must confess that it was not they who made the most  metelill was not guilty of the noise but she wasi fear i must say itflirting with all her might with a youth on each side of her and teasing a third i am afraid she is one of those girls who are charming to all and doubly charming to your sex and that it will never do to have her among the staff  i dont think it is oldmaidish in us to be scandalised at her walking up and down the esplanade with young horne till ten oclock last night charley was behind with bertie elwood and i grieve to say was smoking  it lasted till horace druce went out to tell them that metelill must come in at once as it was time to shut up the house  the oxford girls were safe indoors isa working chess problems with another of the lads avice keeping jane company over the putting the little ones to sleepin mount lebanon as they call the druce lodgingand pica preserving microscopic objects  isnt she awful said one of those pupils  shes worse than all the dons in cambridge  she wants to be at it all day long and all through the vacation  they perfectly flee from her  they say she is always whipping out a microscope and lecturing upon protoplasmsand there is some truth in the accusation  she is almost as bad on the emancipation of women on which there is a standing battle in earnest with janein joke with metelill but it has by special orders to be hushed at dinner because it almost terrifies grandmamma  i fear pica tries to despise her  this morning the girls are all out on the beach in pairs and threes the pupils being all happily shut up with their tutor  i see the invalid lady creep out with her beachrest from the intermediate house and come down to her usual morning station in the shade of a rock unaware poor thing that it has been monopolised by isa and metelill  oh girls why dont you get up and make room for her no she moves on to the next shady place but there pica has a perfect fortification of books spread on her rug and charley is sketching on the outskirts and the foxterrier barks loudly  will she go on to the third seat where i can see though she cannot jane and avice sitting together and freddy shovelling sand at their feet  ah at last she is made welcome  good girls  they have seated her and her things planted a parasol to shelter her from the wind and lingered long enough not to make her feel herself turning them out before making another settlement out of my sight  three oclocki am sorry to say charleys sketch turned into a caricature of the unprotected female wandering in vain in search of a bit of shelter with a torn parasol a limp dress and dragging rug and altogether unspeakably forlorn  it was exhibited at the dinnertable and elicited peals of merriment so that we elders begged to see the cause of the young peoples amusement  my blood was up and when i saw what it was i said  i wonder you like to record your own discourtesy to call it nothing worse  but aunt charlotte said metelill in her pretty pleading way we did not know her  well what of that i said  oh you know it is only abroad that people expect that sort of things from strangers  one of the worst imputations on english manners i ever heard i said  but she was such a guy cried charley  mother said she was sure she was not a lady  and therefore you did not show yourself one i could not but return  there her mother put in a gentle entreaty that charley would not distress grandmamma with these loud arguments with her aunt and i added seeing that horace druces attention was attracted that i should like to have added another drawing called courtesy and shown that there was some hospitality even to strangers and then i asked the two girls about her  they had joined company again and carried her beachrest home for her finding out by the way that she was a poor homeless governess who had come down to stay in cheap lodgings with an old nurse to try to recruit herself till she could go out again  my mother became immediately interested and has sent emily to call on her and to try and find out whether she is properly taken care of  isa was very much upset at my displeasure  she came to me afterwards and said she was greatly grieved but metelill would not move and she had always supposed it wrong to make acquaintance with strangers in that chance way  i represented that making room was not picking up acquaintance and she owned it and was really grateful for the reproof but as i told her no doubt such a rule must be necessary in a place like oxford  how curiously christian courtesy and polished manners sometimes separate themselves and how conceit interferes with both  i acquit metelill and isa of all but thoughtless habit and pica was absorbed  she can be well mannered enough when she is not defending the rights of woman or hotly dogmatical on the crude theories she has caughtand suppose she has thought out poor child  and jane though highprincipled kind and selfsacrificing is too narrow andnot exactly conceitedbut exclusive and bourne parvaish not to be as bad in her way though it is the sound one  the wars of the druces and maronites as martyn calls them sometimes rage beyond the bounds of good humour  ten pmi am vexed too on another score  i must tell you that this hotel does not shine in puddings and sweets and charley has not been ashamed to grumble beyond the bounds of good manners  i heard some laughing and joking going on between the girls and the pupils metelill with her oh no  you wont  nonsense in just that tone which means i wish i would but i cannot bid youthe tone i do not like to hear in a maiden of any degree  and behold three of those foolish lads have brought her gilt and painted boxes of bonbons over which there was a prodigious giggling and semirefusing and bantering among the young folks worrying emily and me excessively though we knew it would not do to interfere  there is a seafog this evening unfavourable to the usual promenades and we elders including the tutor were sitting with my mother when in her whirlwind fashion in burst jane dragging her little sister chattie with her and breathlessly exclaiming father father come and help  they are gambling and i cant get meg away  when the nervous ones had been convinced that no one had been caught by the tide or fallen off the rocks jane explained that metelill had given one box of bonbons to the children who were to be served with one apiece all round every day  and the others were put up by metelill to serve as prizes in the racing game which some one had routed out left behind in the lodging and which was now spread on the diningtable with all the young people playing in high glee and with immense noise  betting too said jane in horror  mr elwood betted three chocolate creams upon charley and pica took it  father  come and call meg away  she spoke exactly as if she were summoning him to snatch her sister from rouge et noir at monaco and her face was indescribable when her aunt edith set us all off laughing by saying fearful depravity my dear  wont you come father continued jane mr methuen wont you come and stop those young men  mr methuen smiled a little and looked at horace who said  hush janie these are not things in which to interfere  then quoth jane sententiously i am not astonished at the dissipation of the university  and away she flounced in tears of wrath  her mother went after her and we laughed a little it was impossible to help it at the bathos of the chocolate creams but as mr methuen said she was really right the amusement was undesirable as savouring of evil  edith to my vexation saw no harm in it but horace said very decidedly he hoped it would not happen again and margaret presently returned saying she hoped that she had pacified jane and shown her that to descend as if there were an uproar in the school would only do much more harm than was likely to happen in that one evening and she said to me afterwards i see what has been wanting in our training we have let childrens loyalty run into intolerance and rudeness but meg was quite innocent of there being any harm in it and only needed reproof for being too much charmed by the pleasure for once to obey her dictatorial sister  13 ten amhorace has had it out with sundry of the young ladies so as to prevent any more betting  several had regretted it  only they did so want to get rid of the bonbons  and jane did make such an uproar  after all nobody did really bet but charley and the young elwood and pica only that once  jane candidly owns that a little gentleness would have made a difference  again i see this obtuseness to courtesy towards strangers  our despised church has become popular and so many of the young folks choose to accompany us that they overflowed into the free seats in the aisle where i had a full view of them from above  these benches are long and i was sorry to see the girls planting themselves fast at the outer end and making themselves square so as to hinder any one else from getting in till the verger came and spoke to them when charley giggled offensively and even then they did not make room but forced the people to squeeze past  isa could not help herself not being the outermost but she was much distressed and does not shelter herself under charleys plea that it was so hot that the verger should have been indicted for cruelty to animals  certainly they all did come home very hot from walking back with the pupils  pica and avice were not among them having joined the druces in going to hollyford where horace preached this morning  their gray serges and sailor hats were as they said not adapted to the town congregation  it is the congregation you dress for said their uncle dryly whereupon pica upbraided him with inconsistency in telling his poor people not to use the excuse of no clothes and that the heart not the dress is regarded  he said it was true but that he should still advocate the poor mans coming in his cleanest and best there are manners towards god as well as towards man he said  i was too much tired by the heat to go to church again this evening and am sitting with my mother who is dozing  where the young people are i do not know exactly but i am afraid i hear charleys shrill laugh on the beach  14who do you think has found us out  our dear old governor general in all his laurels as enthusiastic little avice was heard saying which made freddy stare hard and vainly in search of them  he is staying at hollybridge park and seeing our name in the s clements list of visitors he made lady hollybridge drive him over to call and was much disappointed to find that you could not be here during his visit  he was as kind and warmhearted as ever and paid our dear mother such compliments on her son that we tell her the bows on her cap are starting upright with pride  lady hollybridge already knew edith  she made herself very pleasant and insisted on our coming en masse to a great garden party which they are giving tomorrow  hollybridge is the s clements lion with splendid grounds and gardens and some fine old pictures so it is a fine chance for the young people and we are going to hire one of the large excursion waggonettes which will hold all who have age dress and will for gaieties  the pupils as mr methuen is a friend of the hollybridge people will attend us as outriders on their bicycles  i am rather delighted at thus catching out the young ladies who did not think it worth while to bring a sunday bonnet  they have all rushed into s clements to furbish themselves for the occasion and we are left to the company of the small druces  neither margaret nor emily chooses to go and will keep my mother company  i ventured on administering a sovereign apiece to isa and jane druce  the first blushed and owned that it was very welcome as her wardrobe had never recovered a great thunderstorm at oxford  janes awkwardness made her seem as if it were an offence on my part but her mother tells me it made her very happy  her father says that she tells him he was hard on avice a great favourite of his and that i must ask jane to explain for it is beyond him  it is all right about the oxford girl  i have engaged her and she goes home tomorrow to prepare herself  this afternoon she is delighted to assist her young ladies in their preparations  i liked her much in the private interview  i was rather surprised to find that it was miss avice of whom she spoke with the greatest fervour as having first made friends with her and then having constantly lent her books and read to her in her illness  15s  swithun is evidently going to be merciful to us today and the damsels have been indefatigableall that is to say but the two londoners who have lawn tennis dresses and their mothers maid to turn them out complete  isa brought home some tulle and white jessamine with which she is deftly freshening the pretty compromise between a bonnet and a hat which she wears on sunday also a charming parasol with a china knob and a wreath of roses at the side  she hopes i shall not think her extravagant but she had a little money of her own  jane druce displays two pairs of gloves and two neckties for herself and her sister and after all meg will not go she is so uncouth that her mother does not like her to go without her own supervision and she with true bourne parva selfappreciation and exclusiveness says  im sure i dont want to go among a lot of stupid people who care for nothing but fine clothes and lawn tennis  there was a light till one oclock last night in the room where avice sleeps with charley and the dog and i scarcely saw either of the oxford sisters or jane all this morning till dinnertime when pica appeared very appropriately to her name turned out in an old black silk dress left behind by her mother and adorned with white tulle in all sorts of folds also a pretty white bonnet made up by avices clever fingers and adorned with some soft gray seabirds feathers and white down  isa and metelill were very well got up and nice  metelill looks charming but i am afraid her bouquet is from one of those foolish pupils  she as usual has shared it with isa who has taken half to prevent her cousin being remarkable  and after all poor avice is to be left behind  there was no time to make up things for two and being in mourning she could not borrow though metelill would have been too happy to lend  she says she shall be very happy with the children but i cant help thinking there was a tear in her eye when she ran to fetch her dress cloak for jane whom by the bye avice has made wonderfully more like other people  here is the waggonette and i must finish tomorrow  16we have had a successful day  the drive each way was a treat in itself and the moon rising over the sea on our way home was a sight never to be forgotten  hollybridge is charming in itself those grounds with their seaboard are unique and i never saw such spanish chestnuts in england  then the gardens and the turf  one must have lived as long in foreign parts as we have to appreciate the perfect finish and welltended look of such places  your dear old chief does not quite agree  he says he wants space and is oppressed with the sense of hedges and fences except when he looks to the sea and even there the rocks look polished off and treated by landscape gardeners  he walked me about to see the show places and look at the pictures saying he had been so well lionised that he wanted some one to discharge his information upon  it was great fun to hear him criticising the impossibilities of a battlepiece blenheim i thinkthe anachronisms of the firearms and uniforms and the want of discipline around marlborough who would never have won a battle at that rate  you know how his hawks eye takes note of everything  he looked at metelill and said uncommonly pretty girl that and knows it but when i asked what he thought of isabels looks he said pretty yes but are you sure she is quite aboveboard  theres something i dont like about her eyes  i wish he had not said so  i know there is a kind of unfriendly feeling towards her among some of the girls especially the druces and charley  i have heard charley openly call her a humbug but i have thought much of this was dislike to the softer manners and perhaps jealousy of my notice and the expression that the old lord noticed is often the consequence of living in an uncongenial home  of course my monopoly of the hero soon ended and as i had no acquaintances there and the young ones had been absorbed into games or had fraternised with some one i betook myself to explorations in company with jane who had likewise been left out after we had wandered along a dazzling stand of calceolarias she said aunt charlotte papa says i ought to tell you something i mean why avice could not come today and why she has nothing to wear but her round hat  it is because she and pica spent all they had in paying for that maude harris at the convalescent home  they had some kind of flimsy gauzy bonnets that were faded and utterly done for after commemoration week and as uncle martyn is always growling about ladies luggage they thought it would be a capital plan to go without all the time they are down here till another quarter is due  avice never thought of its not being right to go to church such a figure and now she finds that papa thinks the command to have power on her head really may apply to that sort of fashion we are going to contrive something for sunday but it could not be done in time for today  besides she had no dress but a serge  she preferred dressing her sister to dressing herself i answered and jane began assuring me that no one knew how unselfish that dear old bird is  the little money she had she added to picas small remnant and thus enough had been provided to fit the elder sister out  i suppose i said that isa manages better for she does not seem to be reduced to the same extremities though i suppose she has less allowance than her cousins  she has exactly the same  i know it  and jane caught herself up evidently checking something i might have thought illnatured which made me respond something intended to be moralising but which was perhaps foolish about good habits of economy and how this disappointment taken so goodhumouredly would be a lesson to avice  a lesson  i should think so said jane bluntly  a lesson not to lend her money to isa and then when i asked what she meant she blurted out that all isas socalled share of the subscription for maude harris had been advanced by avicepica had told her so with comments on her sisters folly in lending what she well knew would never be repaid and alice could not deny it only defending herself by saying she could not sacrifice the girl  it was a very uncomfortable revelation considering that isa might have given her cousin my sovereign but no doubt she did not think that proper as i had meant it to be spent for this outing  i will at least give her the benefit of the doubt and i would not encourage jane to say any more about her  indeed the girl herself did not seem so desirous of dwelling on isa as of doing justice to avice whom she told me very truly i did not know  she is always the one to give way and be put aside for pie and isa said jane and now i think over the time we have had together i believe it has often been so  you are very fond of her i said and jane answered i should think so  why she spent eight months with us once at bourne parva just after the great row with miss hurlstone oh didnt you know  they had a bad governess who used to meet a lovera german musician i think he waswhen they were out walking and bullied avice because she was honest  when it all came to light pica came out and isa was sent to school but avice had got into a low state of health and they said oxford was not good for her so she came to us  and papa prepared her for confirmation and she did everything with us and she really is just like one of ourselves said jane as the highest praise imaginable though any one who contrasted poor janes stiff pique miss dadsworths turn out with the grace even of the gray serge might not think it a compliment  jane was just beginning to tell me that avice always wrote to her to lay before her father the difficulties about right and wrong faith and practice that their way of life and habits of society bring before the poor child when isa descended upon us with oh aunt charlotte i could not think what had become of you when i saw the great man without you  i begin to wonder whether she is really so very fond of me or whether she does not like to see me with one of the others  however i shall be able to take janes hint and cultivate avice for as my mother did not come yesterday lady hollybridge has most kindly insisted on her going over today  the carriage is taking some one to the station and is to call for her and me to bring us to luncheon the kind people promising likewise to send us back  so i asked whether i might bring a niece who had not been able to come yesterday and as the young people had as usual become enamoured of metelill they begged for her likewise  avice looks very well in the dress she made up for pica and being sisters and in mourning the identity will only be natural  she is very much pleased and very grateful and declares that she shall see everything she cares about much more pleasantly than in the larger party and perhaps really hear the hero talk  and uncle horace says true you bird you are not like some young folk who had rather hear themselves talk than socrates and s ambrose both at once  oh said saucy pica now we know what uncle horace thinks of his own conversations with father  by the bye martyn and mary come home tomorrow and i am very glad of it for those evening diversions on the beach go on in full force and though there is nothing tangible except charleys smoke to object to and it is the present way of young people there is something unsatisfactory in it  edith does not seem to mind what her daughters do  margaret has no occasion to be uneasy about jane who always stays with the little ones while the maids are at supper and generally takes with her the devoted avice who has some delicacy of throat forbidding these evening excursions  meg gets more boisterous and noisy every day uchtred being her chief companion but as she is merely a tomboy i believe her parents think it inexpedient to give her hints that might only put fancies in her head  so they have only prohibited learning to smoke staying out later than nine oclock and shrieking louder than a steam whistle  17yesterday was a great success  avice was silent at first but metelill drew her out and she had become quite at her ease before we arrived  you would have been enchanted to see how much was made of our dear mother  lord hollybridge came out himself to give her his arm up the stone steps and across the slippery hall  the good old chief talked to her by the hour about you and avices eyes shone all the time  after luncheon our kind hostess arranged that dear mother should have half an hours perfect rest in a charming little room fitted like a tent and then had a low chair with two little fairy ponies in it to drive her about the gardens while i walked with the two gentlemen and saw things much better than in the former hurlyburly though that was a beautiful spectacle in its way  avice who has seen scores of fetes in college grounds much preferred the scenery etc in their natural state to a crowd of strangers  the young people took possession of the two girls and when we all met for the five oclock tea before going home lady georgina eagerly told her father that miss fulford had made out the subject of that picture  it was a very beautiful preraffaelite of a lady gathering flowers in a meadow and another in contemplation while a mysterious shape was at the back the ladies stifflimbed but lovely faced and the flowersirises anemones violets and even the grassblossom done with botanical accuracy a friend of lord hollybridge had picked it up for him in some obscure place in northern italy and had not yet submitted it to an expert  avice it appeared had recognised it as representing leah and rachel as action and contemplation in the last books of dantes purgatorio with the mystic griffin car in the distance  our hosts were very much delighted we all repaired to the picture where she very quietly and modestly pointed out the details  a dante was hunted up but lady hollybridge and i were the only elders who knew any italian and when the catalogue was brought avice knew all the names of the translators but as none were to be found lord hollybridge asked if she would make him understand the passage which she did blushing a little but rendering it in very good fluent english so that he thanked her and complimented her so much that she was obliged to answer that she had got it up when they were hearing some lectures on dante and besides it was mentioned by ruskin whereupon she was also made to find the reference and mark both it and dante  i like that girl said the old governorgeneral she is intelligent and modest both  there is something fine about the shape of her head  when we went home metelill was as proud and delighted as possible at what she called the birds triumph but avice did not seem at all elated but to take her knowledge as a mere outcome of her ordinary oxford life where allusions especially ruskinese and dantesque came naturally  and then as grandmamma went to sleep in her corner the two girls and i fell into a conversation on that whole question of action and contemplation  at least metelill asked the explanation but i doubt whether she listened much while avice and i talked out the matter and i felt myself a girl again holding the old interminable talks with the first dear avice before you made her my sister for those two happy years andwell it is no use paining you and myself with going back to those days though there was something in the earnest thoughtfulness and depth of her young namesake and godchild that carried me back to the choicest day of companionship before you came on the scene  and to think what a jewel i have missed all this time  18i am deeply grieved and am almost ashamed to write what i have to tell you  i had been out to see my mother with margaret and emily settle in their favourite resort on the beach and was coming in to write my letters when in the sittingroom which has open french windows down to the ground i heard an angry voice  i tell you it was no joke  its no use saying so and i beheld charley and isa in the midst of a violent quarrel  ive looked on at plenty of your dodges sucking up to aunt charlotte to get taken out with her but when it comes to playing spiteful tricks on my sister i will speak out  by this time i was on the windowstep checking charleys very improper tone and asking what was the matter  isa sprang to me declaring that it was all charleys absurd suspicion and misconstruction  at last amid hot words on both sides i found that charley had just found shut into a small album which metelill keeps upon the drawingroom table a newly taken photograph of young horne one of the pupils with a foolish devoted inscription upon the envelope directed to miss fulford  isa protested that she had only popped it in to keep it safe until she could return it  charley broke out  as if i did not know better than that  didnt you make him give you that parasol and promise him your photo  ay and give it him in return  you thought he would keep your secret i suppose but he tells everything like a donkey as he is to bertie elwood and bertie and i have such fun over him  and now because you are jealous of poor metelill and think aunt charlotte may take a fancy to you instead of her you are sticking his photo into her book just to do her harm with the aunts im not straitlaced  i wouldnt mind having the photos of a hundred and fifty young men only they would be horrid guys and all just alike but aunt charlotte isiswella regular old maid about it and you knew she would mind it and so you did it on purpose to upset metelills chances  isa clung to me in floods of tears desiring me not to believe anything so cruel and false  every one always was so hard upon her she said and she had only put the thing inadvertently there to get it out of sight into the first book she saw but unfortunately she did not know i had heard her trying to pass it off to charley as a jest  however as there was no proof there i asked about the parasol  while the shopping was going on she and young horne had been in another street and this was the consequence  i was perfectly confounded  receive presents from young men  it seemed to me quite impossible  oh isa thinks nothing of that said charley  ask her where she got those bangles and that bouquet which she told you was half metelills  you think me awful i know aunt charlotte but i do draw a line though i would never have said one word about it if she had not played this nasty trick on metelill  isa would have begun some imploring excuse but our two gentlemen were seen coming up towards the window and she fled gasping out an entreaty that i would not tell uncle martyn  nor did i then and there for i needed to understand the matter and look into it so i told martyn and horace not to wait for me and heard charleys story more coolly  i had thought that mr horne was metelills friend  so he was at first charley said but he is an uncommon goose and isa is no end of a hand at doing the pathetic povertystricken orphan  thats the way she gets so many presents then she explained in her select slang that young hornes love affairs were the great amusement of his fellowpupils and that she being sure that the parasol was no present from me as isa had given the cousins to understand had set bertie elwood to extract the truth by teasing his friend  but i never meant to have told said charley if you had not come in upon us when i was in the midst of such a wax that i did not know what i was saying and on my demanding what she meant by the elegant expression she had used about isa and me she explained that it was the schoolboys word for currying favour  every one but we stupid elders perceived the game nay even the druces living in full confidence with their children knew what was going on  i have never spoken but somehow people must read through ones brains for there was a general conviction that i was going to choose a niece to accompany us  i wonder if you my wise brother let out anything to edith  it is what men always do they bind women to silence and then disclose the secret themselves and say nothing is safe with these women  any way these girls have been generous or else true to their esprit de corps i do not know which to call it for though they looked on at isas manoeuvres and my blindness with indignant contempt they never attempted to interfere  jane druce was seized with a fit of passionate wrath and pity for me but her father withheld her from disclosures assuring her that i should probably find out the girls true disposition and that it would be wrong to deprive isa of a chance of coming under a fresh influence  poor girl she must be very clever for she kept up her constant wooing of me while she also coquetted with mr horne being really as her contemporaries declare a much worse flirt than metelill but the temptation of the parasol threw her off her guard and she was very jealous of my taking out metelill and avice  i see now that it has been her effort to keep the others away from me  this spiteful trick if it be true that she meant it seems to have been done on metelill as being supposed to be her only real rival  avice always yields to her and besides is too inoffensive to afford her any such opportunity  when i talked to mary she said oh yes i always knew she was a horrid little treacherous puss  nature began it and that governess worked on a ready soil  we sent her to school and hoped she was cured but i have long seen that it has only shown her how to be more plausible  but what can one do  one could not turn out an orphan and i did not see that she was doing our own girls any harm im sure i gave her every chance of marrying for there was nothing i wished for so much and i never told martyn of her little manoeuvres knowing he would not stand them and now what he will do i cant think unless you and edward will take her off our hands  i believe you might do her good  she is an unfathomable mixture of sham and earnest and she really likes you and thinks much of you as having a certain prestige and being a woman of the world fancy that  besides she is really religious in a sort of a way much good youll say it does her but as you know theres a certain sort of devotion which makes no difference to peoples conduct  it seems to be the general desire of the family that we should take this unfortunate isabel off their hands  shall we  cruelly as i have been disappointed in the girl i cant help liking her she is obliging pleasant ladylike in manners very affectionate and i cant help thinking that with the respect and fear for you she would feel she might be restrained and that we could be the saving of her though at the same time i know that my having been so egregiously deceived may be a sign that i am not fit to deal with her  i leave it to your decision altogether and will say no more till i hear  metelill is a charming girl and i fancy you prefer her and that her mother knows it and would send her for at least a winter but she gets so entirely off her balance whenever a young man of any sort comes near that i should not like to take charge of her  it might be good for the worthy jane but as she would take a great deal of toning down and licking into shape and as she would despise it all refer everything to the bourne parva standard and pine for home and village school i dont think she need be considered especially as i am sure she would not go and could not be spared  pica would absorb herself in languages and antiquities and maintain the rights of women by insisting on having full time to study her protoplasms snubbing and deriding all the officers who did not talk like oxford dons  probably the e e would be the only people she would think fit to speak to  avice is the one to whom i feel the most drawn  she is thoroughly thoughtful and her religion is not of the uninfluential kind mary describes  those distresses and perplexities which poor isa affected were chiefly borrowed from her genuine ones but she has obtained the high cultivation and intelligence that her oxford life can give in full measure and without conceit or pretension and it is her unselfish yielding spirit that has prevented me from knowing her sooner though when not suppressed she can be thoroughly agreeable and take her part in society with something of her mothers brilliancy  i think too that she would be spared as oxford does not agree with her and a southern winter or two would be very good for her  besides the others might come and see her in vacation time  could we not take both her and isabel at least for the first winter  19a stormy wet day the first we have had  poor isa has made an attempt at explanation and apology but lost herself in a mist of words and tears  i suppose i was severe for she shrinks from me and clings to avice who has stood her friend in many a storm before and as jane indignantly tells me persists in believing that she is really sorry and wishes to be good  she is very attentive and obliging and my dear mother who is in happy ignorance of all this uproar really likes her the best of all the girls  21we have had a great alarm  last evening we went to the parish church horace druce had been asked to preach and the rain which had fallen all the morning cleared off just in time for the walk emily margaret two of her children and i sat in the gallery and avice and isa in the free seats below  avice had been kept at home by the rain in the morning but had begged leave to go later darkness came on just as the first hymn was given out and the verger went round with his long wand lighting the gas  in the gallery we saw plainly how at the east end something went wrong with his match one which he thought had failed and threw aside it fell on a strip of straw matting in the aisle which being very dry caught fire and blazed up for a few seconds before it was trampled out  some foolish person however set the cry of fire going and you know what that is in a crowded church  the vicar in his high oldfashioned desk with a back to it could not see horace in a chair in the narrow shallow sanctuary did see that it was nothing but between the cries of fire and the dying peal of the organ could not make his voice heard  all he could do was to get to the rear of the crowd together with the other few who had seen the real state of things and turn back all those whom they could getting them out through the vestry  but the main body were quite out of their reach and everybody tried to rush scrambling into the narrow centre aisle choking up the door which was a complicated trap meant to keep out draughts  we in the gallery tried vainly to assure them that the only danger was in the crowd and the clergyman in his desk sure that was the chief peril at any rate went on waving and calling to them to wait but the cries and shrieks drowned everything and there was a most terrible time as some 600 people jammed themselves in that narrow space fighting struggling fainting  you may suppose how we watched our girls  they had let themselves be thrust up to the end of the seat by later comers  avice the innermost  we saw them look up to us with white faces  to our joy avice seemed to understand our signs and to try to withhold isa but she was too wild with fright not to try to push on to the end of the pew  avice held her dress and kept her back  then as the crowd swayed the two girls stood on the seat and presently i saw avice bend down and take from some ones arms a little child which she seated on the edge of the pew holding it in her arms and soothing it  i dont know how long it all lasted horace says it was not ten minutes before he had got men and tools to break down the obstruction at the door and pull out the crowded crushed people but to us it seemed hours  they were getting calmer too in the rear for many had followed the lead through the vestry door and others had found out that there was no fire at all  wonderful to tell no one was killed  there were some broken arms three i think and some bad bruises  many people were fainting and much hurt by the horrible heat and crush but when at last the way was free we saw horace come into the church looking about in great anxiety for the two girls whom he had failed to find in the trampled multitude  then avice came up to him with the child in her arms and isa followed quite safe  how thankful we all were avice says she remembered at once that she had been told of the american firemans orders to his little girl always to keep still in such an alarm for the crowd was a worse peril than the fire  by the time we had come down the stairs and joined them the childs father had come for it in great anxiety for its sister had been trampled down fainting and had just only revived enough to miss it i shall never forget what it was to see people sucked down in that surging mass and the thankful thrill of seeing our girls standing there quietly with the child between them its little fair head on avices breast  we went home quietly and thankfully  horace took avice to the hotel that he might explain all to her parents and let them know how well she had behaved isabel was shaken and tearful and her voice sounded weak and nervous as she bade her cousin good night and embraced her with much agitation  so i went to her room to see whether she needed any doctoring but i found metelill soothing her nicely so i only kissed her as i had not done these two nights  ah dear aunt you forgive me she said  the tone threw me back as if she were making capital of her adventure and i said you have not offended me  ah you are still angry and yet you do love me still a little she said not letting me go the more love the more grief for your having done wrong i said and she returned ah if i always had you  that chilled me and i went away  she does not know the difference between pardon and remission of consequences  one must have something of the spirit of the fiftyfirst psalm before that perception comes  poor dear child how one longs for power to breathe into her some such penitence  avice is quite knocked up today and her mother has kept her in bed where she is very happy with her jane  i have been to see her and she has been thanking me for having suggested the making way for fresh comers in a pew  otherwise she says she could not have withstood the rush   sir edward fulford to miss fulford 22d july  my dear charlottei decidedly object to the company of a young lady with such a genius for intrigue as isabel fulford seems to possess  if we had only ourselves to consider no doubt it would be well for you to take her in hand but in the sort of house ours will be there must be no one we cannot depend upon in our own family  i suppose i am guilty of having betrayed my thoughts to edith  i had certainly wished for metelill  she is an engaging creature and i am sorry you take so adverse a view of her demeanour but i promised to abide by your judgment and i will not question it  we will ask arthur and edith to bring her to visit us and then perhaps you may be better satisfied with her  the learned young lady is out of the question and as avice is my dear wifes godchild as well as mine i am very glad she has deserved that your choice should fall upon her  it seems as if you would find in her just the companionship you wish and if her health needs the southern climate it is well to give her the opportunity you had better propose the scheme at once and provide what she will need for an outfit  the last touches might be given at paris  i hope to get time to run down to new cove next week and if you and the niece can be ready to start by the middle of august we will take switzerland by the way and arrive at malta by the end of september  i shall be curious to hear the result of your throwing the handkerchiefyour affectionate brother  e f   miss fulford to sir edward fulford  july 24i threw the handkerchief by asking martyn and mary to spare their daughter  tears came into marys eyes the first i ever saw there and she tried in vain to say something ridiculous martyn walked to the window and said huskily dr a said it would confirm her health to spend a few winters in the south  thank you charlotte  they did not doubt a moment but martyn feels the parting more than i ever thought he would and pica and uchtred go about howling and bewailing and declaring that they never shall know where to find anything again  avice herself is much more sorrowful than glad though she is too courteous and grateful not to show herself gracious to me  she did entreat me to take isa instead so earnestly that i was obliged to read her your decided objections  it was a blow to her at first but she is rapidly consoling herself over the wonderful commissions she accepts  she is to observe mediterranean zoophytes and send them home on glass slides for the family benefit  she is to send her father photographs and drawings to illustrate his lectures and jane has begged for a pebble or rock from s pauls bay to show to her class at school  indeed i believe avice is to write a special journal to be published in the bourne parva parish magazine charley begs for a seahorse and freddy has been instructed by one of the pupils to bargain for nothing less than the colossus of rhodes metelill is quite as cordial in her rejoicing and edith owns that now it has come to the point she is very glad to keep her daughter  and isa  well she is mortified poor child  i think she must have cried bitterly over the disappointment for she looked very wretched when we met at dinner  meanwhile martyn had a walk with emily who found that he was very sorry not to be relieved from isabel though he knew you were quite right not to take her  he thought oxford not a good place for such a girl and the absence of the trustworthy avice would make things worse  then emily proposed to take isabel back to the birchwood with her  grandmamma really likes the girl who is kind and attentive  there are no young people to whom she could do harm emily can look after her and will be glad of help and companionship  the whole family council agreed that it will be a really charitable work and that if any one can do her good it will be the mother and aunt emily  isa has acquiesced with an overflow of gratitude and affection to them for taking pity on her  it sounds a little fulsome but i believe some of it is genuine  she is really glad that some one wishes for her and i can quite believe that she will lose in avice all that made life congenial to her under marys brisk uncompromising rule  if she can only learn to be truetrue to herself and to othersshe will yet be a woman to love and esteem and at birchwood they will do their best to show that religious sentiment must be connected with truth  and so ends my study of the manners of my nieces convincing me the more that as the manners are so is the man or woman  the heart or rather the soul forms the manners and they are the man  c f    come to her kingdom    take care  oh take care  whisk swish click click through the little crowd at stokesley on a fine april afternoon of jocund children just let loose from school and mothers emerging from their meeting collecting their progeny after the fashion of old ewes with their lambs susan merrifield in a huge carefully preserved brown mushroom hat with a big basket under one arm and a roll of calico under the other her sister elizabeth with a book in one hand and a packet of ambulance illustrations the vicar mr doyle and his sister likewise loaded talking to them about the farmers wedding of the morning for which the bells had been ringing fitfully all day and had just burst out again  such was the scene through which like a flash spun a tricycle from which a tiny curlyhaired being in knickerbockers was barely saved by his mothers seizing him by one arm  a tricycle exclaimed the vicar  a woman  oh cried susan in horror and shes stoppingat the gap  oh  my dear susie you must have seen ladies on tricycles before whispered her sister  no indeed i am thankful to say i have not  if it should be miss arthuret said susan with inexpressible tones in her voice  she was bowing right and left said the vicar a little maliciously depend upon it she thought this was a welcome from the rural population  hark heres something coming  the bonchamp fly came rattling up loaded with luggage and with a quiet lady in black seated in it which stopped at the same gate  the obedient mother no doubt said elizabeth  she looks like a lady  there had been a good deal of excitement at stokesley about the property known by the pleasing name of the gap  an old gentleman had lived there for many years always in a secluded state and latterly imbecile and on his death in the previous year no one had for some time appeared as heir but it became known that the inheritrix was a young lady a greatniece living with a widowed mother in one of the large manufacturing towns in the north of england  her father had been a clergyman and had died when she was an infant  that was all that was known and as the house had become almost uninhabitable the necessary repairs had prevented the heiress from taking possession all this time  it was not a very large inheritance only comprising a small farm the substantial village shop four or five cottages and a moderatesized house and grounds where the neglected trees had grown to strange irregular proportions equally with the income which owing to the outgoings being small had increased to about 800 or 900 pounds a year and of course it was a subject of much anxiety with admiral merrifields family to know what sort of people the newcomers would prove  of the large family only the two eldest daughters were at home susan now nearly forty had never left it but had been the daughterofallwork at home and ladyofallwork to the parish ever since she had emerged from the schoolroom her apricot complexion showing hardly any change and such as there was never perceived by her parents  the admiral still a light wiry hale man as active as ever with his hands full of county parish and farming business an invalid for many years but getting into that health which is la jeunesse de la vieillesse  elizabeth had from twentyfive to thirtytwo been spared from home by her father to take care of his stepmother in london where she had beguiled her time with a certain amount of authorship under a nom de plume and had been introduced to some choice society both through her literary abilities and her family connections  four years previous the old lady had died leaving her a legacy which together with her gains would have enabled her to keep such a home in town as to remain in touch with the world to which she had been introduced but she had never lost her stokesley heart enough for the temptation to outweigh the disappointment she would have caused at home and the satisfaction and rest of being among her own people  so she only went up for an occasional visit and had become the brightness of the house and susans beloved partner in all her works  her father who understood better than did her mother and sister what she had given up had insisted on her having a sittingroom to herself which she embellished with the personal possessions she had accumulated and where she pursued her own avocations in the forenoon often indeed interrupted but never showing and not often feeling that it was to her hindrance and indeed the family looked on her work sufficiently as a profession not only to acquiesce but to have a certain complacency in it though it was a kind of transparent fiction that mesa was an anagram of her initials and that of stokesley  her mother at any rate believed that none of the neighbours guessed at any such thing  stokesley was a good deal out of the world five miles from the station at bonchamp over hilly stony roads so that the cyclist movement had barely reached it the neighbourhood was sparse and mrs merrifields health had not been conducive to visiting any more than was her inclination so that there was a little agitation about first calls  the newcomers appeared at church on sunday at all the services  a brightfaced girl of oneandtwenty with little black eyes like coals of fire a tight ulster like a riding habit and a small billycock hat rather dismayed those who still held that bonnets ought to be the sunday gear of all beyond childhood but the mother in rich black silk was unexceptionable  refusing to be marshalled up the aisle to the seat which persistent tradition assigned to the gap in the aristocratic quarter daughter and mother it was impossible not thus to call them sat themselves down on the first vacant place close to a surviving white smock frock and blind to the bewildered glances of his muchbent friend in velveteen who hobbling in next after found himself displaced and separated alike from his wellthumbed prayer and hymn book and the companion who found the places for him  it aint fitty like said the old man confidentially to susan nor the ladies wouldnt like it when we comes in with our old coats all of a muck with wet  the principle is right said bessie when this was repeated to her but practice ought to wait till native manners and customs are learnt  the two sisters offered to save their mother the first visitleave her card or make her excuses but mrs merrifield held that a card thus left savoured of deceit and that the deed must be womanfully done in person  but she would not wait till the horses could be spared saying that for near village neighbours it was more friendly to go down in her donkeychair and so she did bessie driving her and the admiral walking with them  the gap had ever since bessie could remember been absolutely shrouded in trees its encircling wall hidden in ivy bushes over which laburnums lilacs pink thorns and horse chestnuts towered and the drive from the seldomopened gate was almost obstructed by the sweeping arms of laurels and larches  it was obstructed now but by these same limbs lying amputated and chop chop was heard in the distance  oh the arbutus sighed bessie  clearing was much needed said her father with a mans propensity for the axe  the donkey however thought it uncanny upon the pivot of his skull turned round his long left ear and planted his feet firmly mrs merrifield deprecating the struggle by which her husband would on such occasions enforce discipline begged to get out and while this was going on the ulstered young lady with a small axe in hand came as it were to the rescue and while the donkey was committed to a small boy explained hastily so overgrown there is nothing to be done but to let in light and air  my mother is at home she added she will be happy to see you and conducting them in with complete selfpossessionrather as it occurred to bessie as the queen might have led the way to the duchess of kent though there was a perfect simplicity and evident enjoyment about her that was very prepossessing and took off the edge of the sense of conceit  besides the palace was to london eyes at least so little to boast of with the narrow little box of a wooden porch the odd onesided vestibule and the tiny anteroom with the worn carpet but the drawingroom in spite of george iv furniture was really pretty with french windows opening on a wellmown lawn and fresh importations of knickknacks and vases of wild flowers which made it look inhabited and pleasant  there was no one there and the young lady proceeded to fetch her mother and the unguarded voice was caught by bessies quick ears from the window  here are admiral and mrs merrifield and one daughter  come along little mammy  worthy homely old folksjust in your line  to bessies relief she perceived that this was wholly unheard by her father and mother  and there was no withstanding the eager happy shy looks of the mother whose whole face betrayed that after many storms she had come into a haven of peace and that she was proud to owe it to her daughter  a few words showed that mother and daughter were absolutely enchanted with stokesley their own situation and one anotherthe young lady evidently all the more because she perceived so much to be done  everything wants improving  it is so choked up she said one wants to let in the light  there are a good many trees said the admiral while bessie suspected that she meant figuratively as well as literally and as the damsel was evidently burning to be out at her clearing operations again and had never parted with her axe the admiral offered to go with her and tell her about the trees for as he observed she could hardly judge of those not yet out in leaf  she accepted him though bessie shrewdly suspected that the advice would be little heeded and not fancying the wet grass and branches nor the demolition of old friends she did not follow the pair but effaced herself and listened with much interest to the two mothers who sat on the sofa with their heads together  either mrs merrifield was wonderful in inspiring confidence or it was only too delightful to mrs arthuret to find a listener of her own standing to whom to pour forth her full heart of thankfulness and delight in her daughter  oh it is too much occurred so often in her talk that if it had not been said with liquid eyes choking voice and hands clasped in devout gratitude it would have been tedious but mrs merrifield thoroughly went along with it and was deeply touched  the whole story as it became known partly in these confidences partly afterwards was this  the good lady who had struck the family at first as a somewhat elderly mother for so young a daughter had been for many years a governess engaged all the time to a curate who only obtained a small district incumbency in a town after wear and tear waiting and anxiety had so exhausted him that the second winter brought on bronchitis and he scarcely lived to see his little daughter arthurine  the mother had struggled on upon a pittance eked out with such music teaching as she could procure with her little girl for her sole care joy and pridea child who as she declared had never given her one moments pang or uneasiness  poor mamma could she say that of any one of her nine thought bessie and mrs merrifield made no such attempt  arthurine had brought home all prizes all distinctions at the high school buthere was the only disappointment of her lifea low fever had prevented her trying for a scholarship at girton  in consideration however of her great abilities and high qualities as well as out of the great kindness of the committee she had been made an assistant to one of the class mistresses and had worked on with her own studies till the wonderful tidings came of the inheritance that had fallen to her quite unexpectedly for since her husbands death mrs arthuret had known nothing of his family and while he was alive there were too many between him and the succession for the chance to occur to him as possible  the relief and blessing were more than the good lady could utter  all things are comparative and to one whose assured income had been 70 pounds a year 800 pounds was unbounded wealth to one who had spent her life in schoolrooms and lodgings the gap was a lordly demesne  and what do you think was the first thing my sweet child said added mrs arthuret with her eyes glittering through tears mammy you shall never hear the scales again and you shall have the best mocha coffee every day of your life  bessie felt that after this she must like the sweet child though sweetness did not seem to her the predominant feature in arthurine  after the pathos to which she had listened there was somewhat of a comedy to come for the ladies had spent the autumn abroad and had seen and enjoyed much  it was a perfect feast to see how arthurine entered into it all said the mother  she was never at a loss and explained it all to me  besides perhaps you have seen her article  i beg your pardon  her article in the kensington  it attracted a great deal of attention and she has had many compliments  oh the kensington magazine said mrs merrifield rather uneasily for she was as anxious that bessie should not be suspected of writing in the said periodical as the other mother was that arthurine should have the fame of her contributions  do you take it asked mrs arthuret for we should be very glad to lend it to you  a whole pile was on the table and mrs merrifield looked at them with feeble thanks and an odd sort of conscious dread though she could with perfect truth have denied either taking it or reading it  bessie came to her relief  thank you she said we do some of us have it  is your daughters article signed a a and doesnt it describe a boardinghouse on the italian lakes  i thought it very clever and amusing  mrs arthurets face lighted up  oh yes my dear slipped out in her delight  and do you know it all came of her letter to one of the high school ladies who is sister to the subeditor such a clever superior girl  she read it to the headmistress and all and they agreed that it was too good to be lost and arthurine copied it out and added to it and hemr jarrettsaid it was just what he wantedso full of information and livelinessand she is writing some more for him  mrs merrifield was rather shocked but she felt that she herself was in a glass house was in fact keeping a literary daughter so she only committed herself to she is very young  only oneandtwenty returned mrs arthuret triumphantly but then she has had such advantages and made such use of them everything seems to come at once though perhaps it is unthankful to say so  of course it is no object now but i could not help thinking what it would have been to us to have discovered this talent of hers at the time when we could hardly make both ends meet  she will find plenty of use for it said mrs merrifield who as the wife of a country squire and the mother of nine children did not find it too easy to make her ends meet upon a larger income  oh yes indeed she will the generous child  she is full of plans for the regeneration of the village  poor mrs merrifield this was quite too much for her  she thought it irreverent to apply the word in any save an ecclesiastical sense nor did she at all desire to have the parish which was considered to be admirably worked by the constituted authorities regenerated whatever that might mean by a young lady of oneand twenty  she rose up and observed to her daughter that she saw papa out upon the lawn and she thought it was time to go home  mrs arthuret came out with them and found what bessie could only regard as a scene of desolation  though gentlemen as a rule have no mercy on trees and ladies are equally inclined to cry woodman spare that tree the rule was reversed for miss arthuret was cutting and ordering cutting all round her ruthlessly with something of the pleasure of a child in breaking a new toy to prove that it is his own scarcely listening when the admiral told her what the trees were and how beautiful in their season while even as to the evergreens she did not know a yew from a cedar and declared that she must get rid of this horrid old laurustinus while she lopped away at a portugal laurel  her one idea seemed to be that it was very unwholesome to live in a house surrounded with trees and the united influence of the merrifields working on her mother by representing what would be the absence of shade in a few months time barely availed to save the life of the big cedar while the great rhododendron wont to present a mountain of shining leaves and pale purple blossoms every summer was hewn down without remorse as an awful old laurel and left a desolate brown patch in its stead  is it an emblem thought bessie of what she would like to do to all of us poor old obstructions  after all mrs merrifield could not help liking the gentle mother by force of sympathy and the admiral was somewhat fascinated by the freshness and impetuosity of the damsel as elderly men are wont to be with young girls who amuse them with what they are apt to view as an original form of the silliness common to the whole female world except their own wives and perhaps their daughters and bessie was extremely amused and held her peace as she had been used to do in london  susan was perhaps the most annoyed and indignant  she was presiding over seams and buttonholes the next afternoon at school when the mother and daughter walked in and the whole troop started to their feet and curtsied  dont make them stand  i hate adulation  sit down please wheres the master  in the boys school maam said the mistress uncomfortably indicating the presence of miss merrifield who felt herself obliged to come forward and shake hands  oh so you have separate schools  is not that a needless expense  it has always been so returned susan quietly  board  no  well no doubt you are right but i suppose it is at a sacrifice of efficiency  have you cookery classes  we have not apparatus and the girls go out too early for it to be of much use  ah thats a mistake  drawing  the boys draw  i shall go and see them  not the girls  they look orderly enough but are they intelligent  well i shall look in and examine them on their special subjects if they have any  i suppose not  only class  grammar and needlework  i see the old routine  quite the village school  it is very nice work put in mrs arthuret who had been looking at it  oh yes it always is when everything is sacrificed to it  good morning i shall see more of you mrsahem  please maam should i tell her that she is not a school manager inquired the mistress somewhat indignantly when the two ladies had departed  you had better ask the vicar what to do responded susan  the schoolmaster on his side seemed to have had so much advice and offers of assistance in lessons on history geography and physical science that he had been obliged to refer her to the managers and explain that till the next inspection he was bound to abide by the timetable  ah well i will be one of the managers another year  so she told the vicar who smiled and said we must elect you  i am sure much ought to be done  it is mere waste to have two separate schools when a master can bring the children on so much better in the higher subjects  mrs merrifield and the rest of us are inclined to think that what stands highest of all with us is endangered by mixed schools said mr doyle  oh arthurine opened her eyes but education does all that  education does but knowledge is not wisdom  susan merrifields influence has done more for our young women than the best class teaching could do  oh but the merrifields are all so bornes and homely they stand in the way of all culture  indeed said the vicar who had in his pocket a very favourable review of mesas new historical essay  surely an oldfashioned squire and lady bountiful and their very narrow daughters should not be allowed to prevent improvement pauperise the place and keep it in its old grooves  well we shall see what you think by the time you have lived here long enough to be eligible forwhat  school manager guardian of the poor cried arthurine  we shall see repeated the vicar  goodmorning  he asked bessies leave to disclose who mesa was  oh dont she cried it would spoil the fun  besides mamma would not like it which is a better reason  there were plenty of books old and new in bessies room magazines and reviews but they did not come about the house much unless any of the rockstone cousins or the younger generation were staying there or her brother david had come for a rest of mind and body between housekeeping gardening parish work and pottering mrs merrifield and susan never had time for reading except that susan thought it her duty to keep something improving in hand which generally lasted her six weeks on a moderate average  the admiral found quite reading enough in the newspapers pamphlets and business publications and their neighbours the greville family were chiefly devoted to hunting and lawn tennis so that there was some reason in mrs arthurets lamentation to the vicar that dear arthurine did so miss intellectual society such as she had been used to with the high school mistressestwo of whom had actually been at girton  does she not get on with bessie merrifield he asked  miss bessie has a very sweet face arthurine did say she seemed well informed and more intelligent than her sister  perhaps arthurine might take her up  it would be such an advantage to the poor girl  which was on mr doyles tongue but he restrained it and only observed that bessie had lived for a good many years in london  so i understood said arthurine but with an old grandmother and that is quite as bad as if it was in the country but i will see about it  i might get up a debating society or one for studying german  in the meantime arthurine decided on improving and embellishing the parish with a drinking fountain and meeting bessie one afternoon in the village she started the idea  but said bessie there is a very good supply  papa saw that good water was accessible to all the houses in the village street ten years ago and the outlying ones have wells and theres the brook for the cattle  i am sure every village should have a fountain and a trough and i shall have it here instead of this dirty corner  can you get the ground  oh any one would give ground for such a purpose  whose is it  mr grices at butter end  the next time susan and bessie encountered arthurine she began  can you or admiral merrifield do nothing with that horrid old grice  never was any one so pigheaded and stupid  what  he wont part with the land you want  no i wrote to him and got no answer  then i wrote again and i got a peakedhand sort of note that his wife wrote i should think mr grice presented his compliments compliments indeed and had no intention of parting with any part of spraggs portion well then i called to represent what a benefit it would be to the parish and his own cattle and what do you think the old brute saidthat there was a great deal too much done for the parish already and he wouldnt have no hand in setting up the labourers who were quite impudent enough already  well i saw it was of no use to talk to an old wretch like that about social movements and equal rights so i only put the question whether having pure water easily accessible would not tend to make them better behaved and less impudent as he called it upon which he broke out into a tirade  he didnt hold with cold water and teetotal not he  why it had come to thatthat there was no such thing as getting a fair days work out of a labouring man with their temperance and their lectures and their schools and their county councils and what not  really i had read of such people but i hardly believed they still existed  grice is very old and the regular old sort of farmer said bessie  but could not the admiral persuade him or mr doyle  oh no said susan it would be of no use  he was just as bad about a playground for the boys though it would have prevented their being troublesome elsewhere  besides added bessie i am sure papa would say that there is no necessity  he had the water analysed and it is quite good and plenty of it  well i shall see what can be done  she thinks us as bad as old grice said susan as they saw her walking away in a determined manner  the next thing that was heard was the admiral coming in from the servants hall whither he had been summoned by please sir james hodd wishes to speak to you  what is this friend of yours about bessie  what friend papa  why this miss arthurwhat dye call her said the admiral who on the whole was much more attracted by her than were his daughters  heres a deputation from her tenant james hodd with please sir i wants to know if tis allowed to turn folks out of their houses as theyve paid rent for reglar with a weeks notice when they pays by the year  you dont mean it exclaimed mrs merrifield and susan together  poor old mrs west said the mother  and all the tibbinses exclaimed susan  she cant do it can she papa  certainly not without the proper notice and so i told james and that the notice she had sent down to him was so much wastepaper  so at least she has created a village hampden said bessie though depend upon it she little supposes herself to be the petty tyrant  i must go and explain to her i suppose tomorrow morning said the admiral  however he had scarcely reached his own gate before the ulstered form was seen rushing up to him  oh  admiral merrifield goodmorning i was coming to ask you  and i was coming to you  oh  admiral is it really soas that impudent man told methat those horrid people cant be got out of those awful tumbledown unhealthy places for all that immense time  surely he was not impudent to you  he was only asserting his right  the cottages were taken by the year and you have no choice but to give six months notice  i hope he was not disrespectful  well noi cant say that he was though i dont care for those capinhand ways of your people here  but at any rate he says he wont gono not any of them though i offered to pay them up to the end of the time and now i must put off my beautiful plans  i was drawing them all yesterday morningtwo model cottages on each side and the drinking fountain in the middle  i brought them up to show you  could you get the people to move out  i would promise them to return after the rebuilding  very nice drawings  yesyesvery kind intentions  then cant you persuade them  but my dear young lady have you thought what is to become of them in the meantime  why live somewhere else  people in smokeland were always shifting about  yesthose poor little town tenements are generally let on short terms and are numerous enough  but herewhere are the vacant cottages for your four families  hodd with his five children tibbins with eight or nine mrs west and her widow daughter and three children and the porters with a bedridden father  they are dreadfully overcrowded  is there really no place  probably not nearer than those trumpery new tenements at bonchamp that would be eight miles to be tramped to the mens work and the wests would lose the washing and charing that maintains them  then do you think it can never be done  see how nice my plans are  oh yes very pretty drawings but you dont allow much outlet  i thought you had allotments and that they would do and i mean to get rid of the pigsties  a most unpopular proceeding i warn you  theres nothing more unsanitary than a pigsty  that depends on how it is kept  and may i ask do you mean also to dispense with staircases  oh  i forgot  but do you really mean to say that i can never carry out my improvements and that these people must live all herded together till everybody is dead  not quite that said the admiral laughing but most improvements require patience and a little experience of the temper and habits of the people  there are cottages worse than these  i think two of them have four rooms and the wests and porters do not require so much  if you built one or two elsewhere and moved the people into them or waited for a vacant one you might carry out some of your plansgradually  and my fountain  i am not quite sure but i am afraid your cottages are on that stratum where you could not bring the water without great expense  arthurine controlled herself enough for a civil goodmorning but she shed tears as she walked home and told her pitying mother that she was thwarted on every side and that nobody could comprehend her  the meetings for german reading were however contrived chiefly little as arthurine guessed itby the influence of bessie merrifield  the two greville girls and mr doyles sister together with the doctors young wife two damsels from the next parish and a friend or two that the arthurets had made at bonchamp formed an imposing circleto begin  oh not on wilhelm tell cried arthurine  it might as well be the alphabet at once  however the difficulties in the way of books and consideration for general incompetency reduced her to wilhelm tell and she began with a lecture first on schiller and then upon switzerland and on the legend but when bessie merrifield put in a word of such history and criticisms as were not in the high school manual she was sure everything else must be wrongfraulein blumenbach never said so and she was an admirable german scholar  miss doyle went so far as to declare she should not go again to see bessie merrifield so silenced sitting by after the first saying nothing but only with a little laugh in her eyes  but said bessie it is such fun to see any person having it so entirely her own waylike macaulay so cocksure of everythingand to see those bonchamp girlsmytton is their nameso entirely adoring her  i am sorry she has taken up with those myttons said miss doyle  so am i answered susan  you too susie exclaimed bessieyou who never have a word to say against any one  i daresay they are very good girls said susan but they are  underbred put in miss doyle in the pause  and how they flatter  i think the raptures are genuine gush said bessie but that is so much the worse for arthurine  is there any positive harm in the family beyond the secondrate tone  it was while you were away said susan but their father somehow behaved very ill about old colonel myttons willat least papa thought so and never wished us to visit them  he was thought to have used unfair influence on the old gentleman said miss doyle but the daughters are so young that probably they had no part in it  only it gives a general distrust of the family and the sons are certainly very undesirable young men  it is unlucky said bessie that we can do nothing but inflict a course of snubbing in contrast with a course of admiration  i am sure i dont want to snub her said goodnatured susan only when she does want to do such queer things how can it be helped  it was quite true mrs and miss arthuret had been duly called upon and invited about by the neighbourhood but it was a scanty one and they had not wealth and position enough to compensate for the girls selfassertion and literary pretensions  it was not a superior or intellectual society and as the rockstone merrifields laughingly declared it was fifty years behindhand and where bessie merrifield for the sake of the old stock and her meek bearing of her successnay her total ignoring of her literary honourswould be accepted  arthurine half her age and a newcomer was disliked for the pretensions which her mother innocently pressed on the world  simplicity and complacency were taken for arrogance and the mother and daughter were kept upon formal terms of civility by all but the merrifields who were driven into discussion and opposition by the young ladys attempts at reformations in the parish  it was the less wonder that they made friends where their intimacy was sought and appreciated  there was nothing underbred about themselves both were ladies ingrain though arthurine was abrupt and sometimes obtrusive but they had not lived a life such as to render them sensitive to the lack of fine edges in others and were quite ready to be courted by those who gave the meed of appreciation that both regarded as arthurines just portion  mr mytton had been in india and had come back to look after an old relation to whom he and his wife had paid assiduous attention and had been so rewarded as to excite the suspicion and displeasure of the rest of the family  the prize had not been a great one and the prosperity of the family was further diminished by the continual failures of the neerdowell sons so that they had to make the best of the dull respectable old house they had inherited in the dull respectable old street of the dull respectable old town daisy and pansy mytton were however bright girls and to them arthurine arthuret was a sort of realised dream of romance raised suddenly to the pinnacle of all to which they had ever durst aspire  after meeting her at a great omnium gatherum garden party the acquaintance flourished  arthurine was delighted to give the intense pleasure that the freedom of a country visit afforded to the sisters and found in them the contemporaries her girl nature had missed  they were not stupid though they had been poorly educated and were quite willing to be instructed by her and to read all she told them in fact she was their idol and a very gracious one  deeply did they sympathise in all her sufferings from the impediments cast in her way at stokesley  indeed the ladies there did not meet her so often on their own ground for some time and were principally disturbed by reports of her doings at bonchamp where she played at cricket and at hockey gave a course of lectures on physiology presided at a fancydress bazaar for the schools as lady jane grey and was on two or three committees  she travelled by preference on her tricycle though she had a carriage chiefly for the sake of her mother who was still in a state of fervent admiration even though perhaps a little worried at times by being hurried past her sober paces  the next shock that descended on stokesley was that in great indignation a cousin sent the merrifields one of those american magazines which are read and contributed to by a large proportion of english  it contained an article called the bideaswebes and parish of stickstodgecumcadgerley and written with the same sort of clever flippant irony as the description of the mixed company in the boardinghouse on the lago maggiore  there was the parish embowered or rather choked in trees the orderly mechanical routine the perfect selfsatisfaction of all parties and their imperviousness to progressthe two squires one a foxhunter the other a general reposing on his laurelsthe school where everything was subordinated to learning to behave oneself lowly and reverently to all ones betters and to do ones duty in that state of life to which it has pleased heaven to call onethe horror at her tricycle the impossibility of improvement the predilection for farmyard odours the adherence to tumbledown dwellings the contempt of drinking fountainsall had their meed of exaggeration not without drollery  the two ancient spinsters daughters to the general with their puddingbaskets buttonholes and catechisms had their full share dragooning the parish into disciplinethe younger having so far marched with the century as to have indited a few little tracts of the goody twoshoes order and therefore being mentioned by her friends with bated breath as something formidable who writes although when brought to the test her cultivation was of the vaguest most discursive order  finally there was a sketch of the heavy dinner party which had welcomed the strangers and of the ponderous county magnates and their wives who had been invited and the awe that their broad and expansive ladies expected to impress and how one set talked of their babies and the other of gfs girls and the gentlemen seemed to be chiefly occupied in abusing their mp and his politics  altogether it was given as a lesson to americans of the still feudal and stationary state of country districts in poor old england  what do you think of this bessie exclaimed admiral merrifield we seem to have got a young firebrand in the midst of us  oh papa have you got that thing  what a pity  you dont mean that you have seen it before  yes one of my acquaintances in london sent it to me  and you kept it to yourself  i thought it would only vex you and mamma  who sent it to you  anne did with all the passages marked  what a horrid little treacherous baggage  i daresay we are very tempting  for once we see ourselves as others see us  and you see tis american  all the worse holding us who have done our best to welcome her hospitably up to the derision of the yankees  but you wont take any notice  certainly not ridiculous little puss except to steer as clear of her as possible for fear she should be taking her observations bide as we be why tis the best we can do  she cant pick a hole in your mother though bess  it would have been hard to have forgiven her that  youre not such an aged spinster  it is very funny though said bessie just enough exaggeration to give it point  here is her interview with james hodd  whereat the admiral could not help laughing heartily and then he picked himself out as the general laughed again and said naughty girl  bess im glad that is not your line  little tractsgoody twoshoes  why what did that paper say of your essay miss bess  that it might stand a comparison with helps wasnt it  and i wish i was likely to enjoy such lasting fame as goody two shoes laughed bessie in a state of secret exultation at this bit of testimony from her father  mrs merrifield though unscathed was much more hurt and annoyed than either her husband or her daughter especially at susan and bessie being termed old maids  she did think it very ungrateful and wondered how mrs arthuret could have suffered such a thing to be done  only the poor woman was quite foolish about her daughter could have had no more authority than a cat  so much for modern education  but it was not pleasant to see the numbers of the magazine on the counters at bonchamp and to know there were extracts in the local papers and still less to be indignantly condoled with by neighbours who expressed their intention of cutting the impertinent girl they were exactly the old fogies arthurine cared for the least yet whose acquaintance was the most creditable and the home party at stokesley were unanimous in entreating others to ignore the whole and treat the newcomers as if nothing had happened  they themselves shook hands and exchanged casual remarks as if nothing were amiss nor was the subject mentioned except that mrs arthuret contrived to get a private interview with mrs merrifield  oh dear mrs merrifield i am so grieved and so is arthurine  we were told that the admiral was so excessively angry and he is so kind  i could not bear for him to think arthurine meant anything personal  indeed said mrs merrifield rather astonished  but is he so very angryfor it is all a mistake  he laughs and so does bessie said the mother  laughs  does he  but i do assure you arthurine never meant any place in particular she only intended to describe the way things go on in country districts dont you understand  she was talking one day at the myttons and they were all so much amused that they wanted her to write it down  she read it one evening when they were with us and they declared it was too good not to be publishedand almost before she knew it fred myttons literary friend got hold of it and took it to the agency of this paper  but indeed indeed she never thought of its being considered personal and is as vexed as possible at the way in which it has been taken up  she has every feeling about your kindness to us and she was so shocked when pansy mytton told us that the admiral was furious  whoever told miss mytton so made a great mistake  the admiral only isisamusedas you know gentlemen will be at young girls littlelittle scrapes returned mrs merrifield longing to say impertinences but refraining and scarcely believing what nevertheless was true that arthurine did not know how personal she had been although her mother said it all over again twice  bessie however did believe it from experience of resemblances where she had never intended direct portraiture and when there was a somewhat earnest invitation to a garden party at the gap the merrifields not only accepted for themselves but persuaded as many of their neighbours as they could to countenance the poor girl  there is something solid at the bottom in spite of all the effervescence said bessie  it was late in the year for a garden party being on the 2d of october but weather and other matters had caused delays and the indian summer had begun with warm sun and exquisite tints  what would not the maple and the liquid amber have been by this time thought the sisters if they had been spared  some of the petite noblesse however repented of their condescension when they saw how little it was appreciated  mrs arthuret indeed was making herself the best hostess that a lady who had served no apprenticeship could be to all alike but arthurine or atty as daisy and pansy were heard shouting to herall in white flannels a man all but the petticoatsseemed to be absorbed in a little court of the secondrate people of bonchamp some whom as mrs greville and lady smithson agreed they had never expected to meet  she was laughing and talking eagerly and by and by ran up to bessie exclaiming in a patronising tone  oh my dear miss bessie let me introduce you to mr foxholmsuch a clever literary man  he knows everybodyall about everybody and everything  it would be such an advantage  and he has actually made me give him my autograph  only think of that  bessie thought of her own good luck in being anonymous but did not express it only saying autographhunters are a great nuisance  i know several people who find them so  yes he said it was one of the penalties of fame that one must submit to returned miss arthuret with a delighted laugh of consciousness  bessie rejoiced that none of her own people were near to see the patronising manner in which arthurine introduced her to mr foxholm a heavilybearded man whose eyes she did not at all like and who began by telling her that he felt as if he had crossed the rubicon and entering an arcadia had found a parnassus  bessie looked to see whether the highlyeducated young lady detected the malaprop for the helicon but arthurine was either too wellbred or too much exalted to notice either small slips or even bad taste and she stood smiling and blushing complacently  however just then susan hurried up  bessie you are wanted  heres a card  the gentleman sent it in and papa asked me to find you  bessie opened her eyes  the card belonged to the editor of one of the most noted magazines of the day but one whose principles she did not entirely approve  what could be coming  her father was waiting for her  well miss bessie he said laughing jane said the gentleman was very urgent in wanting to know when you would be in  an offer eh  perhaps it is an offer but not of that sort said bessie and she explained what the unliterary admiral had not understood  he answered with a whistle  shall you do it bessie  i think not she said quietly  the editor was found waiting for her with many apologies for bringing her home and the admiral was so delighted with his agreeableness as hardly to be able to tear himself away to bring home his wife  the offer was as bessie expected of excellent terms for a serial storyterms that proved to her what was her own value and in which she saw education for her sister annes eldest boy  of course there would be a certain adaptation to our readers  she knew what that meant and there was that in her face which drew forth the assurance  of course nothing you would not wish to say would be required but it would be better not to press certain subjects  i understand said bessie  i doubt  perhaps you will think it over  bessies first thought was if i forget thee o jerusalem then let my right hand forget her cunning  that had been the inward motto of her life  her second was little sam  davids mission room there was no necessity to answer at once and she knew the periodical rather by report than by reading so she accepted the two numbers that were left with her and promised to reply in a week it was a question on which to take counsel with her father and with her own higher conscience and heavenly guide  the admiral though not much given to reading for its own sake and perhaps inclined to think ephemeral literature the more trifling because his little daughter was a great light there was anything but a dull man and had an excellent judgment  so bessie with all the comfort of a woman still with a wise fathers head over her decided to commit the matter to him  he was somewhat disappointed at finding her agreeable guest gone and wished that dinner and bed had been offered  mrs merrifield and susan were still a good deal excited about arthurines complimentary friend who they said seemed to belong to fred mytton of whom some of the ladies had been telling most unpleasant reports and there was much lamentation over the set into which their young neighbour had thrown herself  such a dress too sighed mrs merrifield  and her headmistress has just arrived said susan to make her worse than ever  how comes a headmistress to be running about the country at this time of year asked bessie  she has been very ill said mrs merrifield and they wrote to her to come down as soon as she could move  there was a telegram this morning and she drove up in the midst of the party and was taken to her room at once to rest  that was the reason miss arthuret was away so long  i thought it nice in her  perhaps she will do good said bessie  dinner was just over and the admiral had settled down with his shaded lamp to read and judge of the article that bessie had given him as a specimen when in came the message mrs rudden wishes to speak to you sir  mrs rudden was the prosperous widow who continued the business in the village shop conjointly with the little farm belonging to the gap property  she was a shrewd woman had been able to do very well by her family and was much esteemed paying a rent which was a considerable item in the gap means  the ladies wondered together at the summons  susan hoped that girl did not want to evict her and bessie suggested that a cooperative store was a more probable peril  presently the admiral came back  do any of you know miss arthurets writing he said  bessie knows it best said susan  he showed a letter that is hersthe signature said bessie i are not sure about the rest  whywhat does it mean  for she read   the gap 2d oct  mrs ruddenyou are requested to pay over to the bearer mr foxholm fifty pounds of the rent you were about to bring me to morrowi remain etc  arthurine arthuret   what does it mean asked bessie again  thats just what mrs rudden has come up to me to ask said the admiral  this fellow presented it in her shop about a quarter of an hour ago  the good woman smelt a rat  what do you think she did  she looked at it and him asked him to wait a bit whipped out at her back door luckily met the policeman starting on his rounds bade him have an eye to the customer in her shop and came off to show it to me  that young woman is demented enough for anything and is quite capable of doing itfor some absurd scheme  but do you think it is hers or a swindle  didnt she say she had given her autograph exclaimed susan  and see here said bessie her signature is at the top of the sheet of notepapersmall paper  and as she always writes very large it would be easy to fill up the rest changing the first side over  i must take it up to her at once said the admiral  even if it be genuine she may just as well see that it is a queer thing to have done and not exactly the way to treat her tenants  it is strange too that this man should have known anything about mrs rudden said mrs merrifield  mrs rudden says she had a message this morning when she had come up with her rent and accounts to say that miss arthuret was very much engaged and would be glad if she would come tomorrow  could this fellow have been about then  no one knew but bessie breathed the word was not that young mytton there  it was not taken up for no one liked to pronounce the obvious inference  besides the admiral was in haste not thinking it well that mr foxholm should be longer kept under surveillance in the shop among the bread bacon cheeses shoes and tins of potted meat  he was then called for and on his loudly exclaiming that he had been very strangely treated the admiral quietly told him that mrs rudden had been disturbed at so unusual a way of demanding her rent and had come for advice on the subject and to satisfy their minds that all was right mr foxholm would no doubt consent to wait till the young lady could be referred to  mr foxholm did very decidedly object he said no one had any right to detain him when the ladys signature was plain and admiral merrifield had seen him in her society and he began an account of the philanthropical purpose for which he said the money had been intended but he was cut short  you must be aware said the admiral that this is not an ordinary way of acting and whatever be your purpose mrs rudden must ascertain your authority more fully before paying over so large a sum  i give you your choice therefore either of accompanying us to the gap or of remaining in mrs ruddens parlour till we return  the furtive eye glanced about and the parlour was chosen  did he know that the policeman stationed himself in the shop outside  the dinner at the gap was over and miss elmore the headmistress was established in an armchair listening to the outpouring of her former pupil and the happy mother about all the felicities and glories of their present life the only drawback being the dullness and obstructiveness of the immediate neighbours  i thought miss merrifield was your neighbourmesa  oh noquite impossible  these are merrifields but the daughters are two regular old goodies wrapped up in sunday schools and penny clubs  well that is odd  the editor of the  came down in the train with me and said he was going to see mesamiss elizabeth merrifield  i do think it is very unfair began arthurine but at that moment the doorbell rang  how strange at this time  oh perhaps the editor is coming here cried arthurine  did you tell him i lived here miss elmore  admiral merrifield announced the parlourmaid  he had resolved not to summon the young lady in private as he thought there was more chance of commonsense in the mother  you are surprised to see me at this time he said but mrs rudden is perplexed by a communication from you  mrs rudden exclaimed arthurine  why i only sent her word that i was too busy to go through her accounts today and asked her to come tomorrow  that isnt against the laws of the medes and persians is it  then did you send her this letter  i said arthurine staring at it with her eyes at their fullest extent  i fifty pounds  mr foxholm  what does it mean  then you never wrote that order  no no  how should i  that is not your writing  no not that  look at the signature  oh oh ohand she dropped into a chair  the horrible man thats the autograph i gave him this afternoon  you are sure  quite for my pen spluttered in the slope of the a  has she gone and given it to him  no  she brought it to me and set the policeman to watch him  what a dear good woman  shall you send him to prison admiral merrifield  what can be done to him said arthurine not looking at all as if she would like to abrogate capital punishment  well i had been thinking said the admiral  you see he did not get it and though i could commit him for endeavouring to obtain money on false pretences i very much doubt whether the prosecution would not be worse for you than for him  that is very kind of you admiral exclaimed the mother  it would be terribly awkward for dear arthurine to stand up and say he cajoled her into giving her autograph  it might always be remembered against her  exactly so said the admiral and perhaps there may be another reason for not pushing the matter to extremity  the man is a stranger here i believe  he has been staying at bonchamp said mrs arthuret  it was young mr mytton who brought him over this afternoon  just so  and how did he come to be aware that mrs rudden owed you any money  there was a pause then arthurine broke out  oh daisy and pansy cant have done anything but they were all three there helping me mark the tenniscourts when the message came  including the brother  yes  he is a bad fellow and i would not wish to shield him in any way but that such a plot should be proved against him would be a grievous disgrace to the family  i cant ever feel about them as i have done said arthurine in tears  daisy and pansy said so much about poor dear fred and every one being hard on him and his feeling my good influenceand all the time he was plotting this against me with my chalk in his hand marking my grass and she broke down in childlike sobs  the mortification was terrible of finding her pinnacle of fame the mere delusion of a sharper and the shock of shame seemed to overwhelm the poor girl  oh admiral cried her mother she cannot bear it  i know you will be good and manage it so as to distress her as little as possible and not have any publicity  1 will do my best said the admiral  i will try and get a confession out of him and send him off though it is a pity that such a fellow should get off scotfree  oh never mind so that my poor arthurines name is not brought forward  we can never be grateful enough for your kindness  it was so late that the admiral did not come back that night and the ladies were at breakfast when he appeared again  foxholm had on finding there was no escape confessed the fraud but threw most of the blame on fred mytton who was in debt not only to him but to others  foxholm himself seemed to have been an adventurer who preyed on young men at the billiardtable and had there been in some collusion with fred though the admiral had little doubt as to which was the greater villain  he had been introduced to the mytton family who were not particular indeed mr mytton had no objection to increasing his pocketmoney by a little wary profitable betting and gambling on his own account  however the associates had no doubt brought bonchamp to the point of being too hot to hold them and fred overhearing the arrangement with mrs rudden had communicated it to himwhence the autograph trick  foxholm was gone and in the course of the day it was known that young mytton was also gone  the admiral promised that none of his family should mention the matter and that he would do his best to silence mrs rudden who for that matter probably believed the whole letter to have been forged and would not enter into the enthusiasm of autographs  oh thank you  it is so kind said the mother and arthurine who looked as if she had not slept all night and was ready to burst into tears on the least provocation murmured something to the same effect which the admiral answered half hearing  never mind my dear you will be wiser another time young people will be inexperienced  is that the cruellest cut of all thought miss elmore as she beheld her former pupil scarcely restraining herself enough for the farewell civilities and then breaking down into a flood of tears  her mother hovered over her with what is it  oh my dear child you need not be afraid he is so kind  i hate people to be kind that is the very thing said arthurine oh  miss elmore dont gowhile he is meaning all the time that i have made such a fool of myself  and he is glad i know he is he and his hateful stupid stolid daughters  my dear my dear exclaimed her mother  well havent they done nothing but thwart me whatever i wanted to do and arent they triumphing now in this abominable mans treachery and my being taken in  i shall go away and sell the place and never come back again  i should think that was the most decided way of confessing a failure said miss elmore and as mrs arthuret was called away by the imperative summons to the butcher she spoke more freely  your mother looks terrified at being so routed up again  oh mother will be happy anywhere and how can i stay with these stickinthemud people just like what i have read about  and have gibbeted  really arthurine i should call them very generous  it is their thick skins muttered she at least so the myttons said but indeed i did not mean to be so personal as it was thought  but tell me  why did you not get on with mesa  that was a regular takein  not to tell one  when i began my german class she put me out with useless explanations  what kind of explanations  oh about the swiss being under the empire or something and she would go into parallels of saxon words and english poetry such as our fraulein never troubled us with  but i showed her it would not do  so instead of learning what you had not sense to appreciate you wanted to teach your old routine  but indeed she could not pronounce at all well and she looked ever so long at difficult bits and then she even tried to correct me  did she go on coming after you silenced her  yes and never tried to interfere again  i am afraid she drew her own conclusions about high schools  oh miss elmore you used to like us to be thorough and not discursive and how could anybody brought up in this stultifying place ages ago know what will tell in an exam  oh arthurine  how often have i told you that examinations are not education  i never saw so plainly that i have not educated you  i wanted to prepare daisy and pansy and they didnt care about her prosing when we wanted to get on with the book  which would have been the best education for them poor girls an example of courtesy patience and humility or getting on as you call it  oh miss elmore you are very hard on me when i have just been so cruelly disappointed  my dear child it is only because i want you to discover why you have been so cruelly disappointed  it would be wearisome to relate all that arthurine finally told of those thwartings by the merrifields which had thrown her into the arms of the mytton family nor how miss elmore brought her to confess that each scheme was either impracticable or might have been injurious and that a little grain of humility might have made her see things very differently  yet it must be owned that the good lady felt rather like bending a bow that would spring back again  bessie merrifield had like her family been inclined to conclude that all was the fault of high schools  she did not see miss elmore at first thinking the arthurets not likely to wish to be intruded upon and having besides a good deal to think over  for she and her father had talked over the proposal which pecuniarily was so tempting and he without prejudice but on principle had concurred with her in deciding that it was her duty not to add one touch of attractiveness to aught which supported a cause contrary to their strongest convictions  her fathers approbation was the crowning pleasure though she felt the external testimony to her abilities quite enough to sympathise with such intoxication of success as to make any compliment seem possible  miss elmore had one long talk with her beginning by saying  i wish to consult you about my poor foolish child  ah  i am afraid we have not helped her enough said bessie  if we had been more sympathetic she might have trusted us more  then you are good enough to believe that it was not all folly and presumption  i am sure it was not said bessie  none of us ever thought it more than inexperience and a little exaltation with immense good intention at the bottom  of course our dear old habits did look dull coming from life and activity and we rather resented her contempt for them but i am quite sure that after a little while every one will forget all about this or only recollect it as one does a girlish scrape  yes  to suppose all the neighbourhood occupied in laughing at her is only another phase of selfimportance  you see the poor child necessarily lived in a very narrow world where examinations came whatever i could do to seem everything and she only knew things beyond by books  she had success enough there to turn her head and not going to cambridge never had fair measure of her abilities then came prosperity  quite enough to upset any ones balance said bessie  in fact only a very sober not to say stolid nature would have stood it  poor things  they were so happyso openhearted  i did long to caution them  pull cup steady hand  it will all come right now said bessie  mrs arthuret spoke of their going away for the winter i do not think it will be a bad plan for then we can start quite fresh with them and the intimacy with the myttons will be broken though i am sorry for the poor girls  they have no harm in them and arthurine was doing them good  a whisper to you miss merrifieldthey are going back with me to be prepared for governesses at arthurines expense  it is the only thing for them in the crash that young man has brought on the family  dear good arthurine  she only needed to learn how to carry her cup    mrs batseyes    i  father and daughter   scenethe drawingroom of darkglade vicarage  mr aveland an elderly clergyman  mrs moldwarp widow on the verge of middle age  mr a

if any one could it would be you  and at least you will let nothing drop in the parish work  you and cicely together will be able to take that up when euphrasia is gone too  mrs m  it will be delightful to me to come back to it  you know i was to the manner born  nothing seems to be so natural  mr a  i am only afraid you are giving up a great deal  i dont know that i could accept itexcept for the parish and these poor children  mrs m  now dear father you are not to talk so  is not this my home my first home and though it has lost its very dearest centre what can be so dear to me when my own has long been broken  mr a  but the young folksyoung londoners are apt to feel such a change a great sacrifice  mrs m  lucius always longs to be here whenever he is on shore and cicely  oh it will be so good for cicely to be with you dear father  i know some day you will be able to enjoy her  and i do look forward to having her to myself as i have never had before since she was a little creature in the nursery  it is so fortunate that i had not closed the treaty for the house at brompton so that i can come whenever phrasie decides on leaving you  mr a  and she must not be long delayed  she and holland have waited for each other quite long enough  your dear mother begged that there should be no delay and neither you nor i mary could bear to shorten the time of happiness together that may be granted them  she will have no scruple about leaving georges children now you and cicely will see to thempoor little things  mrs m  cicely has always longed for a sphere and

we knew nothing of rational intercourse but when all the most intellectual houses are open to me it is intolerable to be buried alive here with nothing to talk of but clerical shop and nothing to do

letters  three little children eating bread and milk  e  there  mary has got the house at brompton off her hands and can come for good on the 11th  that is the greatest possible comfort she wants to bring her piano it has a better tone than ours  mr a  certainly  little miss hilda there will soon be strumming her scales on the old one and mary and cis will send me to sleep in the evening with hers  e  oh  mr a  why phrasie whats the matter  e  this is a blow  cicely is only coming to be bridesmaid and then going back to board at kensington and go on with her studies  mr a  to board  all alone  e  oh thats the way with young ladies  mr a  mary cannot have consented  e  have you done little folks  then say grace hilda and run out till the lesson bell rings  yes poor mary i am afraid she thinks all that cecilia decrees is right or if she does not naturally believe so she is made to  mr a  come come phrasie i always thought mary a model mother  e  so did i and so she was while the children were small except that they were more free and easy with her than was the way in our time  and i think she is all that is to be desired to her son but when last i was in london i cannot say i was satisfied i thought cissy had got beyond her  mr a  for want of a father  e  not entirely  you know i could not think charles moldwarp quite worthy of mary though she never saw it  mr a  latterly we saw so little of him  he liked to spend his holiday in mountain climbing and mary made her visits here alone  e  exactly so  sympathy faded out between them though she poor dear never betrayed it if she realised it which i doubt  and as cissy took after her father this may have weakened her allegiance to her mother  at any rate as soon as she was thought to have outgrown her mothers teaching those greater things mothers influence and culture were not thought of and she went to school and had her companions and interests apart while mary good soul filled up the vacancy with good works and if once you get into the swing of that sort of thing in town theres no end to the demands upon your time  i dont think she ever let them bore her husband he was out all day and didnt want her but i am afraid they do bore her daughter and absorb attention and time so as to hinder full companionship till cissy has grown up an extraneous creature not formed by her  mary thinks in her humility dear old thing that it is a much superior creature but i dont like it as well as the old sort  mr a  the old barndoor hen hatched her eggs and bred up her chicks better than the fine prize fowl  eh  e  so that incubatorhatched chicks with a hotbed instead of a hovering wing and tender cluckcluck are the fashion  i was in hopes that coming down to the old coop with no professors to run after and you to lead them both all would right itself but it seems my young lady wants more improving  mr a  well my dear it must be mortifying to a clever girl to have her studies cut short  e  certainly but in my time we held that studies were subordinate to duties and that there were other kinds of improvement than in modeldrawing and all the rest of it  mr a  it will not be for long and cissy will find the people or has found them and mary will accept them  e  if her native instinct objects she will be cajoled or bullied into seeing with cissys eyes  mr a  well euphrasia my dear let us trust that people are the best judges of their own affairs and remember that the world has got beyond us  mary was always a sensible rightminded girl and i cannot believe her as blind as you would make out  e  at any rate dear papa you never have to say to her as to me judge not that ye be not judged   iv  mother and daughter   scenedarkglade vicarage drawingroom  mrs m  so my dear you think it impossible to be happy here  c  little mamsey why will you never understand  it is not a question of happiness but of duty to myself  mrs m  and that is  c  not to throw away all my chances of selfimprovement by burrowing into this hole  mrs m  oh my dear i dont like to hear you call it so  c  yes i know you care for it  you were bred up here and know nothing better poor old mamsey and pottering suits you exactly but it is too much to ask me to sacrifice my wider fields of culture and usefulness  mrs m  grandpapa would enjoy nothing so much as reading with you he said so  c  oxford half a century old and wearing off ever since  no i thank you  besides it is not only physical science but art  mrs m  theres the school of art at holbrook  c  my dear mother i am far past country schools of art  mrs m  it is not as if you intended to take up art as a profession  c  mother will nothing ever make you understand  nothing ought to be halfstudied merely to pass away the time as an accomplishment uttered with infinite scorn accentuated on the second syllable just to do things to sell at bazaars  no  art with me means work worthy of exhibition with a marketprice and founded on a thorough knowledge of the secrets of the human frame  mrs m  those classes  i dont like all i hear of them or their attendants  c  if you will listen to all the gossip of all the old women of both sexes i cant help it  cant you trust to innocence and earnestness  mrs m  i wish it was the art college at wimbledon  then i should be quite comfortable about you  c  have not we gone into all that already  you know i must go to the fountainhead and not be put off with mere feminine ladylike studies  pah  besides in lodgings i can be useful  i shall give two evenings in the week to the east end to the society for the diversion and civilisation of the poor  mrs m  surely there is room for usefulness here  think of the children  and for diversion and civilisation how glad we should be of your fresh life and brightness among poor people  c  such poor  why even if grandpapa would let me give a lecture on geology or a reading from dickens old prudence blake would go about saying it hadnt done nothing for her poor soul  mrs m  grandpapa wanted last winter to have penny readings only there was nobody to do it  he would give you full scope for that or for lectures  c  yes about vaccination and fresh air or a reading of john gilpin or the pied piper  mamsey you know a model parish stifles me  i cant stand your prim schoolchildren drilled in the catechism and your old women who get out the bible and the clean apron when they see you a quarter of a mile off  free air and open minds for me  no i wont have you sighing mother  you have returned to your native element and you must let me return to mine  mrs m  very well my dear  perhaps a year or two of study in town may be due to you though this is a great disappointment to grandpapa and me  i know mrs payne will make a pleasant and safe home for you if you must be boarded  c  too late for that  i always meant to be with betty thurston at mrs kayes  in fact i have written to engage my room  so theres an end of it  come come dont look vexed

know that you were acquainted with my grandfather  prof d  i was one of his pupils  i may say that i owe everything to him  it is long since i have been at darkglade but it always seemed to me an ideal place  c  rather out of the world  prof d  of one sort of world perhaps but what a beautiful combination is to be seen there of the highest powers with the lowliest work  so entirely has he dedicated himself that he really feels the guidance of a ploughmans soul a higher task than the grandest achievement in science or literature  by the bye i hope he will take up his pen again  it is

i suppose  prof d  no doubt he is a great authority there as a man of his ability must be but i was thinking of a course of scientific papers he put forth ten years ago taking up the arguments against materialism as no one could do who is not as thoroughly at home as he is in the latest discoveries and hypotheses  he ought to answer that paper in the critical world  c  i was so much interested in that paper  prof d  it has just the speciousness that runs away with young people  i should like to talk it over with him  do you think i should be in the way if i ran down  c  i should think a visit

hoped she would do so after the last competition but there is always another stage to be mounted  i wish she would come back for her mother ought not to be left singlehanded but young people seem to

be a good deal fresher and purer  mr a  do you know anything of her present surroundings  prof d  i confess that i was surprised to meet her with mrs eyeless a lady who is active in disseminating positivism and all tending that way  she rather startled me by some of her remarks but probably it was only jargon and desire to show off  have you seen her lately  mr a  at christmas but only for a short time when it struck me that she treated us with the patronage of precocious youth and i thought she made the most of a cold when church or parish was concerned  i hinted as much but her mother seemed quite satisfied poor girl  have i been blind  i did not like her going to live at one of those boardinghouses for lady students  do you know anything of them  prof d  of course all depends on the individual lady at the head and the responsibility she undertakes as well as on the tone of the inmates  with some it would be only staying in a safe and guarded home  in others there is a great

your mother  c  poor old darling  they have been worrying her till she has got hipped and nervous about herself  mrs h  do you know what spasms she has been having  c  oh mother has had spasms as long as i can remember and the more she thinks of them the worse they are  i have often heard her say so  mrs h  yes she has gone on much too long overworking herself and not letting your grandfather suspect anything amiss  c  nerves  that is what it always is  mrs h  dr brownlow says there is failure of heart not dangerous or advanced at present but that there is an overstrain of all the powers and that unless she keeps fairly quiet and free from hurry and worry there may be very serious if not fatal attacks  c  i never did think much of dr brownlow  he told me my palpitations were nothing but indigestion and i am sure they were not  mrs h  well cissy something must be done to relieve your mother of some of her burthens  c  i see what you are driving at aunt phrasie but i cannot go back till i have finished these courses  theres my picture theres the cookery school the ambulance lectures and our sketching tour in august  ever so many engagements  i shall be free in the autumn and then i will go down and see about it  i told mother so  mrs h  all the hot trying months of summer without help  c  i never can understand why they dont have a governess  mrs h  cant you  is there not a considerable outgoing on your behalf  c  that is my own  i am not bound to educate my uncles children at my expense  mrs h  no but if you contributed your share to the housekeeping you would make a difference and surely you cannot leave your mother to break down her health by overworking herself in this manner  c  why does grandpapa let her do so  mrs h  partly he does not see partly he cannot help it  he has been so entirely accustomed to have all those family and parish details taken off his hands and borne easily as they were when your dear grandmamma and i were both there at home that he cannot understand that they can be over muchespecially as they are so small in themselves  besides he is not so young as he was and your dear mother cannot bear to trouble him  c  well i shall go there in september and see about it  it is impossible before  mrs h  in the hopping holidays when the stress of work is over cannot you see with your own eyes how fagged and ill your mother looks and

truth yesterday my poor childs faith has gone  oh how could i let her go and let her mingle among all those people all unguarded  mrs h  do you mean that this is the real reason that she will not come home  mrs m  yes she told me plainly at last that she could not stand our round of services  they seem empty and obsolete to her and she could not feign to attend them or vex us and cause remarks by staying away and of course she neither could nor would teach anything but secular matters  my coming would be nothing but pain to everybody she said  mrs h  you did not tell me this before my drive with her  mrs m  no i never saw you alone besides i thought you would speak more freely without the knowledge  and to tell the truth i did think it possible that consideration for me might bring my poor cissy down to us and that when once under my fathers influence all these mists might clear away  but i do not deserve it  i have been an unfaithful parent shutting my eyes in feeble indulgence

much absorbed to perceive how your dear mother was overtasked  l  you did all you could aunt you took home one child and caused the other to be sent to school  mrs h  yes too late to be of any use  l  and after all i dont think it was overwork that broke the poor dear one down so much as grief at that wretched sister of mine  mrs h  dont speak of her in that way lucius  l  how can i help it  i could say worse  mrs h  she is brokenhearted poor thing  l  well she may be  mrs h  ah the special point of sorrow to your dear mother was that she blamed herself for  l  how could she  how can you say so aunt  mrs h  wait a moment lucius  what grieved her was the giving in to cissys determination seeing with her eyes and not allowing herself to perceive that what she wished might not be good for her  l  cissy always did domineer over mother  mrs h  yes and your mother was so used to thinking cissys judgment right that she never could or would see when it was time to make a stand and prevent her own first impressions from being talked down as oldfashionedletting her eyes be bandaged in fact  l  so she vexed herself over cissys fault but did not you try to make cissy see what she was about  mrs h  true but if love had blinded my dear sister cissy was doubly blinded  l  by conceit and selfwill  mrs h  poor girl i am too sorry for her now to use those hard words but i am afraid it is true  first she could or would not see either that her companions might be undesirable guides or that her duty lay here and then nothing would show her that her mothers health was failing  indeed by that time the sort of blindness had come upon her which really broke your mothers heart  l  you mean her unbelief agnosticism or whatever she chooses to call it  i thought at least women were safe from that style of thing  it is all fashion and bad company i suppose  mrs h  i hope and pray that it may be so but i am afraid that it goes deeper than you imagine  still i see hope in her extreme unhappiness and in the remembrance of your dear mothers last words and prayers   xi  grandfather and granddaughter   a month later  mr aveland and cecilia  mr a  my dear child i wish i could do anything for you  c  you had better let me go back to london grandpapa  mr a  do you really wish it  c  i dont know  i hate it all but if i were in the midst of everything again it might stifle the pain a little  mr a  i am afraid that is not the right way of curing it  c  oh i suppose it will wear down in time  mr a  is that well  c  i dont know  it is only unbearable as it is and yet when i think of my life in town the din and the chatter and the bustle and the nobody caring seem doubly intolerable but i shall work off that  you had better let me go grandpapa  the sight of me can be nothing but a grief and pain to you  mr a  no it gives me hope  c  hope of what  mr a  that away from the whirl you will find your way to peace  c  i dont see how  quiet only makes me more miserable  mr a  my poor child if you can speak out and tell me exactly how it is with you i think it might be comfortable to you  if it is the missing your mother and blaming yourself for having allowed her to overdo herself i may well share with you in that  i feel most grievously that i never perceived how much she was undertaking nor how she flagged under it  unselfish people want others to think for them and i did not  c  dear grandpapa it would not have been too much if i had come and helped  i know that but it is not the worst  you cant feel as i dothat if my desertion led to her overworking herself aunt phrasie and lucius say that what really broke her down was the opinions i cannot help having  say it was not grandpapa  mr a  i wish i could my dear but i cannot conceal that unhappiness about you and regret for having let you expose yourself to those unfortunate arguments broke her spirits so that her energies were unequal to the strain that i allowed to be laid on her  c  poor dear mother  and you and she can feel in that way about the importance of what to me seemspardon me grandpapautterly unproved  mr a  you hold everything unproved that you cannot work out like a mathematical demonstration  c  i cant help it grandpapa  i read and read till all the premises become lost in the cloud of myths that belong to all nations  i dont want to think such things  i saw dear mother rest on her belief and grow peaceful  they were perfect realities to her but i cannot unthink  i would give anything to think that she is in perfect happiness now and that we shall meet again but nothing seems certain to me  all is extinguished  mr a  how do you mean  c  theybetty and her set i meanlaughed at and argued one thing after another till they showed me that there were no positive grounds to go on  mr a  no material grounds  c  and what else is certain  mr a  do you think your mother was not certain  c  i saw she was i see you are certain  but what am i to do  i cannot unthink  mr a  poor child they have loosed you from the shore because you could not see it and left you to flounder in the waves  c  well so i feel it sometimes but if i could only feel that there was a shore i would try to get my foothold  oh with all my heart  mr a  will you take my word dear childthe word of one who can dare humbly to say he has proved it so as to be as sure as of the floor we are standing on that that rock exists and god grant that you may in prayer and patience be brought to rest on it once more  c  once more  i dont think i ever did so really  i only did not think and kept away from what was dull and tiresome  didnt you read something about if thou hadst known  mr a  if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes  but oh my dear girl it is my hope and prayer not for ever  if you will endure to walk in darkness for a while till the light be again revealed to you  c  at any rate dear grandfather i will do what mother entreated and not leave you alone   xii   two years later  st thomass day  c  grandpapa may i come with you on christmas morning  mr a  you make me a truly happy christmas dear child  c  i think i feel somewhat as st thomas did in todays gospel it went home to my heart  mr a  ah child to us that blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed must mean those who are ready to know by faith instead of material tangible proof    chops    you ask me why i call that old greatgrandmother black cat chops well thereby hangs a tale  i dont mean the black tail which is standing upright and quivering at your caresses but a story that there will be time to tell you before charlie gets home from market  seven years ago charlie had just finished his training both at an agricultural college and under a farmer and was thinking of going out to texas or to canada and sending for me when he should have been able to make a new home for me when his godfather mr newton offered to let him come down and look after the draining and otherwise reclaiming of this great piece of waste land  it had come to mr newton through some mortgages i believe and he thought something might be made of it by an active agent  it was the first time mr newton had shown the least interest in us though he was a cousin of our poor mothers and charlie was very much gratified more especially as when he had 150 pounds a year and a house he thought i might leave the school where i was working as a teacher and make a home with him  yes this is the house but it has grown a good deal since we settled down and will grow more before you come to it for good then it was only meant for a superior sort of gamekeeper and had only six rooms in itparlour kitchen and back kitchen and three bedrooms above them but this we agreed would be ample for ourselves and betsey an old servant of our mothers who could turn her hand to anything and on the breakup of our home had begged to join us again whenever or wherever we should have a house of our own once more  we have half a dozen cottages near us now but then it seemed to us like a lodge in a vast wildernessthree miles away from everything shop house or church  betsey fairly sat down and cried when she heard how far away was the butcher and it really seemed as if we were to have the inconveniences of colonisation without the honour of it  however contrivances made us merry we made our rooms pretty and pleasant and as a pony and trap were essential to charlie in his work we were able to fetch and carry easily moreover we had already a fair kitchen garden laid out and there were outhouses for pigs and poultry so that even while draining and fencing were going on we raised a good proportion of our own provisions and very proud of them we were our own mustard and cress which we sowed in our initials tasted doubly sweet when we reaped them as our earliest crop  mr newton had always said that some day he should drop down and see how charles was getting on but as he hardly ever stirred from his office in london and only answered letters in the briefest and most businesslike way we had pretty well left off expecting him  we had been here about six months and had killed our first piga pretty little porker as ever was seen as betsey said  it was hard to understand after all the petting admiration and back scratching betsey had bestowed on him how ready she was to sentence him and triumph in his death while i feebleminded creature delayed rising in the morning that i might cower under the bedclothes and stop my ears against his dying squeals  however when he was no more the housekeeping spirit triumphed in our independence of the butcher while his fry and other delicacies lasted and betsey was supremely happy over the saltings of the legs etc with a view to the more distant future  it was a cold day of early spring  i had been down the lanes and brought in five tiny starved primroses with short stems for which betsey scolded me soundly telling me that the first brood of chickens was always the same in number as the first primroses brought into the house  i eked them out with moss in a saucer and then how well i remember the foolish weary feeling that i wished something would happen to break the quiet  we were out of the reach of new books and the two magazines we took in would not be due for ten long days  i did not feel sensible or energetic enough to turn to one of the standard wellbound volumes that had been charlies school prizes and at the moment i hated my needlework both steady sewing and fancy work  it was the same with my piano  i had no new fashionable music and i was in a mood to disdain what was good and classical  so as the twilight came on i sat drearily by the fire fondling the catyes this same black catand thinking that my life at the ladies college had been a good deal livelier and that if i had given it up for the sake of my brothers society i had very little of that  the hunt had gone by last weekwhat a treat it would be if some one would meet with a little accident and be carried in here  behold i heard a step at the back door and the loud call of kitty  kitty  there stood charlie as usual covered with clay nearly up to the top of his gaitersclay either pale yellow or horrid light blue according to the direction of his walk  he was beginning frantically to unbutton them and as he beheld me he cried out kitty hes coming and before i could say who he went on old newton  his fly is working through the mud in draggletail lane  the driver hailed me to ask the way and when i saw who it was i cut across to give you notice  hell stay the night to a dead certainty  what was to be done  a wild hope seized me that at sight of the place he would retain his fly and go off elsewhere for better accommodation  only where would he find it  the nearest town where the only railway station then was was eight miles off and he was not likely to plod back thither again and the village inn five miles away was little more than a pothouse  no we must rise to the occasion betsey and i while charlie was making himself respectable to receive the guest  where was he to sleep  what was he to eat  a daintily fed rather hypochrondriacal old bachelor who seldom stirred out of his comfortable house in london  what a guest for us  the council was held while the gaiters were being unbuttoned  he must have my room and i would sleep with betsey  as to food it was impossible to send to the butcher and even if i could have sacrificed my precious dorking fowls there would have been scant time to prepare them  there was nothing for it but to give him the pork chops intended for our tomorrows dinner and if he did not like them he might fall back upon poached eggs and rashers  mind called charlie as i dashed into my room to remove my properties and light the fire so that it might get over its first smoking fitmind you lock up the cat  he hates them like poison  it was so long before the carriage appeared that i began half to hope half to fear it was a false alarm but at last just as it was perfectly dark we heard it stop at the garden gate and charlie dashed out to open the fly door and bring in the guest who was panting nervousalmost terrified at a wild drive so contrary to all his experiences  when the flymans demands had been appeased and we had got the poor old gentleman out of his wraps he turned out to be a neat little primlooking london lawyer cleanshaved and with an indoor complexion  i daresay charlie with his big frame sunburnt face curly beard and loud hearty voice seemed to him like a kind of savage and he thought he had got among the aborigines  after all he had written to announce his coming  but he had not calculated on our never getting our letters unless we sent for them he was the very pink of politeness to me and mourned so much over putting me to inconvenience that we could only profess our delight and desire to make him comfortable  on the whole it went off very well  i gave him a cup of tea to warm and occupy him while the upstairs chimney was coming to its senses and then charles took him upstairs  he reappeared in precise evening dress putting us to shame for charles had not a dresscoat big enough for him to get into and i had forgotten to secure my black silk before abandoning my room  we could not ask him to eat in the best kitchen as was our practice and he showed himself rather dismayed at our having only one sittingroom saying he had not thought the cottage such a doghole or known that it would be inhabited by a lady and then he paid some pretty compliment on the feminine hand evident in the room  we had laid the table before he came down but the waiting was managed by ourselves or rather by charles for mr newtons politeness made him jump up whenever i moved so that i had to sit still and do the lady hostess while my brother changed plates and brought in relays of the chops from the kitchen  they were a great success  mr newton eyed them for a moment distrustfully but betsey had turned them out beautifullyall fair and delicate with transparent fat and a brown stripe telling of the gridiron  he refused the egg alternative and greatly enjoyed them and our brussels sprouts speaking highly of the pleasure of country fare and apologising about the good appetising effects of a journey when charlie tempted him with a third chop the hottest and most perfect of all  i think we also produced a rhubarb tart and i know he commended our prudence in having no wine and though he refused my brothers ale seemed highly satisfied with a tumbler of brandy and water when i quitted the gentlemen to see to the coffee while they talked over the scheme for farmbuildings which charlie had sent up to him  when i bade him goodnight a couple of hours later he was evidently in a serene state of mind regarding us as very superior young people  in the middle of the night betsey and i were appalled by a tremendous knocking on the wall  i threw on a dressinggown and made for the door while betsey felt for the matches  as i opened a crack of the door charlies voice was to be heard yes yes ill get you some sir  youll be better presently interspersed with heavy groans then seeing me wide awake he begged that betsey would go down and get some hot waterand mustard called out a suffering voice  oh those chops  poor mr newton had it appeared wakened with a horrible oppression on his chest and at once attributing it to his unwonted meal of pork chops he had begun in the dark knocking and calling with great energy  charlie had stumbled in in the dark not waiting to light a candle and indeed ours were chiefly lamps which took time to light  betsey had hers however and had bustled into some clothes tumbling downstairs to see whether any water were still hot in the copper charlie running down to help her while i fumbled about for a lamp and listened with awe to the groans from within wondering which of us would have to go for the doctor  up came charlie in his shirt sleeves with a steaming jug in one hand and a lamp in the other  up came betsey in a scarlet petticoat and plaid shawl her gray locks in curlpapers and a tallowcandle in hand  the door was thrown open charlie observing  now sir then breaking out into thunder and turf his favourite hibernian ejaculation ssssssss and therewith her green eyes all one glare out burst this cat  she was the nightmare  she had been sitting on the unfortunate mans chest and all her weight had been laid to the score of the chops  no doubt she had been attracted by the fire stolen up in the confusion of the house remained hidden whilst mr newton was going to bed and when the fire went out settled herself on his chest as it seems he slept on his back and it was a warm position  probably his knockings on the wall dislodged her but if so imagination carried on the sense of oppression and with feline pertinacity she had returned as soon as he was still again  poor old gentleman  i am afraid he heard some irrepressible laughter and it was very sore to him to be ridiculous  his grave dignity and politeness when he came down very late the next morning were something awful and it must have been very dreadful to him that he could not get away till half the day was over  so dry and short was he over matters of business that charles actually thought we might begin to pack up and make our arrangements for emigrating  grave dry and civil as ever he departed and i never saw him more nor do i think he ever entirely forgave me there did not however come any dismissal and when charlie had occasion to go up to his office and see him he was just the same as ever and acceded to the various arrangements which have made this a civilised though still rather remote place  and when he died a year ago to our surprise we found that this same reclaimed property was left to my brother  the consequence whereof you well know my dear little sister that is to be  poor old chops you had nearly marred our fortunes and now will you go with me to my home at the rectory or do you prefer your old abode to your old mistress    footnotes  127  in the book this genealogy is a diagram  it is rendered as text heredp  john fulford  sons  john fulford 127a married margaret
