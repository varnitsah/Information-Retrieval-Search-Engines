mr john harston keeps an appointment  the approach to the offices of girdlestone and co was not a very dignified one nor would the uninitiated who traversed it form any conception of the commercial prosperity of the firm in question close to the corner of a broad and busy street within a couple of hundred yards of fenchurch street station a narrow doorway opens into a long whitewashed passage  on one side of this is a brass plate with the inscription girdlestone and co african merchants and above it a curious hieroglyphic supposed to represent a human hand in the act of pointing  following the guidance of this somewhat ghostly emblem the wayfarer finds himself in a small square yard surrounded by doors upon one of which the name of the firm reappears in large white letters with the word push printed beneath it  if he follows this laconic invitation he will make his way into a long low apartment which is the countinghouse of the african traders  on the afternoon of which we speak things were quiet at the offices the line of pigeonholes in the wire curtain was deserted by the public though the linoleumcovered floor bore abundant traces of a busy morning  misty london light shone hazily through the glazed windows and cast dark shadows in the corners  on a high perch in the background a wearyfaced elderly man with muttering lips and tapping fingers cast up endless lines of figures  beneath him in front of two long shining mahogany desks half a score of young men with bent heads and stooping shoulders appeared to be riding furiously neck and neck in the race of life  any habitue of a london office might have deduced from their relentless energy and incorruptible diligence that they were under the eyes of some member of the firm  the member in question was a broadshouldered bullnecked young man who leaned against the marble mantelpiece turning over the pages of an almanac and taking from time to time a stealthy peep over the top of it at the toilers around him  command was imprinted in every line of his strong squareset face and erect powerful frame  above the medium size with a vast spread of shoulder a broad aggressive jaw and bright bold glance his whole pose and expression spoke of resolution pushed to the verge of obstinacy  there was something classical in the regular olivetinted features and black crisp curling hair fitting tightly to the wellrounded head  yet though classical there was an absence of spirituality  it was rather the profile of one of those roman emperors splendid in its animal strength but lacking those subtle softnesses of eye and mouth which speak of an inner life  the heavy gold chain across the waistcoat and the bright stone which blazed upon the finger were the natural complement of the sensuous lip and curving chin  such was ezra only child of john girdlestone and heir to the whole of his vast business  little wonder that those who had an eye to the future bent over their ledgers and worked with a vigour calculated to attract the attention of the junior partner and to impress him with a due sense of their enthusiastic regard for the interests of the  firm  it was speedily apparent however that the young  gentlemans estimate of their services was not entirely based upon their present performance with his eyes still fixed upon the almanac and a sardonic smile upon his dark face he uttered a single word  parker  a flaxenhaired clerk perched at the further end of the high glistening desk gave a violent start and looked up  with a scared face  well parker who won asked the junior partner  won sir the youth stammered  yes who won repeated his employer  i hardly understand you sir the clerk said growing  very red and confused  oh yes you do parker young girdlestone remarked tapping his almanac sharply with the paperknife  you were playing odd man out with robson and perkins when i came in from lunch  as i presume you were at it all the time i was away i have a natural curiosity to know who won  the three unhappy clerks fixed their eyes upon their ledgers to avoid the sarcastic gaze of their employer  he went on in the same quiet tones  you gentlemen draw about thirty shillings a week from the firm i believe i am right in my figures mr gilray addressing the senior clerk seated at the high solitary desk apart from the others  yes i thought so  now odd man out is no doubt a very harmless and fascinating game but you can hardly expect us to encourage it so far as to pay so much an hour for the privilege of having it played in our countinghouse  i shall therefore recommend my father to deduct five shillings from the sum which each of you will receive upon saturday that will cover the time which you have devoted to your own amusements during the week  he paused and the three culprits were beginning to cool down and congratulate themselves when he began again  you will see mr gilray that this deduction is made he said and at the same time i beg that you will deduct ten shillings from your own salary since as senior clerk the responsibility of keeping order in this room in the absence of your employers rests with you and you appear to have neglected it  i trust you will look to this mr gilray  yes sir the senior clerk answered meekly  he was an elderly man with a large family and the lost ten shillings would make a difference to the sunday dinner  there was nothing for it but to bow to the inevitable and his little pinched face assumed an expression of gentle resignation  how to keep his ten young subordinates in order however was a problem which vexed him sorely  the junior partner was silent and the remaining clerks  were working uneasily not exactly knowing whether they might not presently be included in the indictment  their fears were terminated however by the sharp sound of a tablegong and the appearance of a boy with the announcement that mr girdlestone would like a moments conversation with mr ezra  the latter gave a keen glance at his subjects and withdrew into the back office a disappearance which was hailed by ten pens being thrown into the air and deftly caught again while as many derisive and triumphant young men mocked at the imploring efforts of old gilray in the interests of law and order  the sanctum of mr john girdlestone was approached by two doors one of oak with groundglass panels and the other covered with green baize the room itself was small but lofty and the walls were ornamented by numerous sections of ships stuck upon long flat boards very much as the remains of fossil fish are exhibited in museums together with maps charts photographs and lists of sailings innumerable  above the fireplace was a large watercolour painting of the barque belinda as she appeared when on a reef to the north of cape palmas  an inscription beneath this work of art announced that it had been painted by the second officer and presented by him to the head of the firm  it was generally rumoured that the merchants had lost heavily over this disaster and there were some who quoted it as an instance of girdlestones habitual strength of mind that he should decorate his wall with so melancholy a souvenir  this view of the matter did not appear to commend itself to a flippant member of lloyds agency who contrived to intimate by a dexterous use of his left eyelid and right forefinger that the vessel may not have been so much underinsured nor the loss to the firm so enormous as was commonly reported  john girdlestone as he sat at his square officetable waiting for his son was undeniably a remarkablelooking man  for good or for evil no weak character lay beneath that hard angular face with the strongly marked features and deepset eyes  he was clean shaven save for an irongrey fringe of ragged whisker under each ear which blended with the grizzled hair above  so selfcontained hardset and immutable was his expression that it was impossible to read anything from it except sternness and resolution qualities which are as likely to be associated with the highest natures as with the most dangerous  it may have been on account of this ambiguity of expression that the worlds estimate of the old merchant was a very varying one  he was known to be a fanatic in religion a purist in morals and a man of the strictest commercial integrity  yet there were some few who looked askance at him and none save one who could apply the word friend to him  he rose and stood with his back to the fireplace as his son entered he was so tall that he towered above the younger man but the latters square and compact frame made him apart from the difference of age the stronger man  the young man had dropped the air of sarcasm which he found was most effective with the clerks and had resumed his natural manner which was harsh and brusque  whats up he asked dropping back into a chair and jingling the loose coins in his trouser pockets  i have had news of the black eagle his father answered  she is reported from madeira  ah cried the junior partner eagerly  what luck  she is full or nearly so according to captain hamilton miggs report  i wonder miggs was able to send a report at all and i wonder still more that you should put any faith in it his son said impatiently the fellow is never sober  miggs is a good seaman and popular on the coast  he may indulge at times but we all have our failings  here is the list as vouched for by our agent  six hundred barrels of palm oil  oil is down today the other interrupted  it will rise before the black eagle arrives the merchant rejoined confidently  then he has palm nuts in bulk gum ebony skins cochineal and ivory  the young man gave a whistle of satisfaction  not bad for old miggs he said  ivory is at a fancy figure  we are sorely in need of a few good voyages girdlestone remarked for things have been very slack of late  there is one very sad piece of intelligence here which takes away the satisfaction which we might otherwise feel  three of the crew have died of fever  he does not mention the names  the devil said ezra  we know very well what that means three women each with an armful of brats besieging the office and clamouring for a pension  why are seamen such improvident dogs  his father held up his white hand deprecatingly  i wish he said that you would treat these subjects with more reverence  what could be sadder than that the breadwinner of a family should be cut off  it has grieved me more than i can tell  then you intend to pension the wives ezra said with a sly smile  by no means his father returned with decision  girdlestone and co are not an insurance office  the labourer is worthy of his hire but when his work in this world is over his family must fall back upon what has been saved by his industry and thrift  it would be a dangerous precedent for us to allow pensions to the wives of these sailors for it would deprive the others of all motive for laying their money by and would indirectly encourage vice and dissipation  ezra laughed and continued to rattle his silver and keys  it is not upon this matter that i desired to speak to you girdlestone continued  it has however always been my practice to prefer matters of business to private affairs however pressing  john harston is said to be dying and he has sent a message to me saying that he wishes to see me  it is inconvenient for me to leave the office but i feel that it is my christian duty to obey such a summons  i wish you therefore to look after things until i return  i can hardly believe that the news is true ezra said in astonishment  there must be some mistake  why i spoke to him on change last monday  it is very sudden his father answered taking his broadbrimmed hat from a peg  there is no doubt about the fact however  the doctor says that there is very little hope that he will survive until evening it is a case of malignant typhoid  you are very old friends ezra remarked looking thoughtfully at his father  i have known him since we were boys together the other replied with a slight dry cough which was the highest note of his limited emotional gamut  your mother ezra died upon the very day that harstons wife gave birth to this daughter of his seventeen years ago  mrs harston only survived a few days  i have heard him say that perhaps we should also go together  we are in the hands of a higher power however and it seems that one shall be taken and another left  how will the money go if the doctors are right ezra asked keenly  every penny to the girl  she will be an heiress  there are no other relations that i know of except the dimsdales and they have a fair fortune of their own  but i must go  by the way malignant typhoid is very catching is it not  so they say the merchant said quietly and strode off through the countinghouse  ezra girdlestone remained behind stretching his legs in front of the empty grate  the governor is a hard nail he soliloquized as he stared down at the shining steel bars  depend upon it though he feels this more than he shows  why its the only friend he ever had in the worldor ever will have in all probability  however its no business of mine with which comforting reflection he began to whistle as he turned over the pages of the private daybook of the firm  it is possible that his sons surmise was right and that the gaunt unemotional african merchant felt an unwonted heartache as he hailed a hansom and drove out to his friends house at fulham  he and harston had been charity schoolboys together had roughed it together risen together and prospered together  when john girdlestone was a rawboned lad and harston a chubbyfaced urchin the latter had come to look upon the other as his champion and guide  there are some minds which are parasitic in their nature  alone they have little vitality but they love to settle upon some stronger intellect from which they may borrow their emotions and conclusions at secondhand  a strong vigorous brain collects around it in time many others whose mental processes are a feeble imitation of its own  thus it came to pass that as the years rolled on harston learned to lean more and more upon his old schoolfellow grafting many of his stern peculiarities upon his own simple vacuous nature until he became a strange parody of the original to him girdlestone was the ideal man girdlestones ways the correct ways and girdlestones opinions the weightiest of all opinions forty years of this undeviating fidelity must however he might conceal it have made an impression upon the feelings of the elder man  harston by incessant attention to business and extreme parsimony had succeeded in founding an export trading concern  in this he had followed the example of his friend  there was no fear of their interests ever coming into collision as his operations were confined to the mediterranean  the firm grew and prospered until harston began to be looked upon as a warm man in the city circles  his only child was kate a girl of seventeen  there were no other near relatives save dr dimsdale a prosperous westend physician  no wonder that ezra girdlestones active business mind and perhaps that of his father too should speculate as to the disposal of the fortune of the dying man  girdlestone pushed open the iron gate and strode down the gravel walk which led to his friends house  a bright autumn sun shining out of a cloudless heaven bathed the green lawn and the manycoloured flowerbeds in its golden light  the air the leaves the birds all spoke of life it was hard to think that death was closing its grip upon him who owned them all  a plump little gentleman in black was just descending the steps  well doctor the merchant asked how is your patient  youve not come with the intention of seeing him have you the doctor asked glancing up with some curiosity at the grey face and overhanging eyebrows of the merchant  yes i am going up to him now  it is a most virulent case of typhoid  he may die in an hour or he may live until nightfall but nothing can save him  he will hardly recognize you i fear and you can do him no good  it is most infectious and you are incurring a needless danger  i should strongly recommend you not to go  why youve only just come down from him yourself doctor  ah im there in the way of duty  so am i said the visitor decisively and passing up the stone steps of the entrance strode into the hall  there was a large sittingroom upon the ground floor through the open door of which the visitor saw a sight which arrested him for a moment  a young girl was sitting in a recess near the window with her lithe supple figure bent forward and her hands clasped at the back of her head while her elbows rested upon a small table in front of her  her superb brown hair fell in a thick wave on either side over her white round arms and the graceful curve of her beautiful neck might have furnished a sculptor with a study for a mourning madonna  the doctor had just broken his sad tidings to her and she was still in the first paroxysm of her griefa grief too acute as was evident even to the unsentimental mind of the merchant to allow of any attempt at consolation  a greyhound appeared to think differently for he had placed his forepaws upon his young mistresss lap and was attempting to thrust his lean muzzle between her arms and to lick her face in token of canine sympathy  the merchant paused irresolutely for a moment and then ascending the broad staircase he pushed open the door of harstons room and entered  the blinds were drawn down and the chamber was very dark  a pungent whiff of disinfectants issued from it mingled with the dank heavy smell of disease  the bed was in a far corner  without seeing him girdlestone could hear the fast laboured breathing of the invalid a trimly dressed nurse who had been sitting by the bedside rose and recognizing the visitor whispered a few words to him and left the room he pulled the cord of the venetian blind so as to admit a few rays of daylight  the great chamber looked dreary and bare as carpet and hangings had been removed to lessen the chance of future infection john girdlestone stepped softly across to the bedside and sat down by his dying friend  the sufferer was lying on his back apparently unconscious of all around him  his glazed eyes were turned upwards towards the ceiling and his parched lips were parted while the breath came in quick spasmodic gasps  even the unskilled eye of the merchant could tell that the angel of death was hovering very near him  with an ungainly attempt at tenderness which had something pathetic in it he moistened a sponge and passed it over the sick mans feverish brow  the latter turned his restless head round and a gleam of recognition and gratitude came into his eyes  i knew that you would come he said  yes  i came the moment that i got your message  i am glad that you are here the sufferer continued with a sigh of relief  from the brightened expression upon his pinched face it seemed as if even now in the jaws of death he leaned upon his old schoolfellow and looked to him for assistance  he put a wasted hand above the counterpane and laid it upon girdlestones  i wish to speak to you john he said  i am very weak  can you hear what i say  yes i hear you  give me a spoonful from that bottle  it clears my mind for a time i have been making my will john  yes said the merchant replacing the medicine bottle  the lawyer made it this morning  stoop your head and you will hear me better  i have less than fifty thousand  i should have done better had i retired years ago  i told you so the other broke in gruffly  you didyou did  but i acted for the best  forty thousand i leave to my dear daughter kate  a look of interest came over girdlestones face  and the balance he asked  i leave that to be equally divided among the various london institutions for educating the poor  we were both poor boys ourselves john and we know the value of such schools  girdlestone looked perhaps a trifle disappointed  the sick man went on very slowly and painfully  my daughter will have forty thousand pounds  but it is so tied up that she can neither touch it herself nor enable any one else to do so until she is of age  she has no friends john and no relations save only my cousin dr george dimsdale  never was a girl left more lonely and unprotected  take her i beg of you and bring her up under your own eye  treat her as though she were your child  guard her above all from those who would wreck her young life in order to share her fortune do this old friend and make me happy on my deathbed  the merchant made no answer  his heavy eyebrows were drawn down and his forehead all puckered with thought  you are the one man continued the sufferer whom i know to be just and upright  give me the water for my mouth is dry  should which god forbid my dear girl perish before she marries then his breath failed him for a moment and he paused to recover it  well what then  then old friend her fortune reverts to you for there is none who will use it so well  those are the terms of the will  but you will guard her and care for her as i would myself  she is a tender plant john too weak to grow alone  promise me that you will do right by herpromise it  i do promise it john girdlestone answered in a deep voice  he was standing up now and leaning over to catch the words of the dying man  harston was sinking rapidly  with a feeble motion he pointed to a brownbacked volume upon the table  take up the book he said  the merchant picked it up  now repeat after me i swear and solemnly pledge myself  i swear and solemnly pledge myself  to treasure and guard as if she were my own came the tremulous voice from the bed  to treasure and guard as if she were my own in the deep bass of the merchant  kate harston the daughter of my deceased friend  kate harston the daughter of my deceased friend  and as i treat her so may my own flesh and blood treat me  and as i treat her so may my own flesh and blood treat me  the sick mans head fell back exhausted upon his pillow  thank god he muttered now i can die in peace  turn your mind away from the vanities and dross of this world john girdlestone said sternly and fix it upon that which is eternal and can never die  are you going the invalid asked sadly for he had taken up his hat and stick  yes i must go i have an appointment in the city at six which i must not miss  and i have an appointment which i must not miss the dying man said with a feeble smile  i shall send up the nurse as i go down  girdlestone said goodbye  goodbye  god bless you john  the firm strong hand of the hale man enclosed for a moment the feeble burning one of the sufferer  then john girdlestone plodded heavily down the stair and these friends of forty years standing had said their last adieu  the african merchant kept his appointment in the  city but long before he reached it john harston had gone also to keep that last terrible appointment of which the messenger is death    chapter ii   charity a la mode  it was a dull october morning in fenchurch street some weeks after the events with which our story opened  the murky city air looked murkier still through the glazed office windows  girdlestone grim and grey as though he were the very embodiment of the weather stooped over his mahogany table  he had a long list in front of him on which he was checking off as a prelude to the days work the position in the market of the various speculations in which the capital of the firm was embarked  his son ezra lounged in an easy chair opposite him looking dishevelled and dark under the eyes for he had been up half the night and the nemesis of reaction was  upon him  faugh his father ejaculated glancing round at him with disgust you have been drinking already this morning  i took a brandy and seltzer on the way to the office he answered carelessly  i needed one to steady me  a young fellow of your age should not want steadying  you have a strong constitution but you must not play tricks with it  you must have been very late last night  it was nearly one before i went to bed  i was playing cards with major clutterbuck and one or two others we kept it up rather late  with major clutterbuck  yes  i dont care about your consorting so much with that man  he drinks and gambles and does you no good  what good has he ever done himself take care that he does not fleece you  the merchant felt instinctively as he glanced at the shrewd dark face of his son that the warning was a superfluous one  no fear father ezra answered sulkily i am old enough to choose my own friends  why such a friend as that  i like to know men of that class  you are a successful man father but youwell you cant be much help to me socially  you need some one to show you the ropes and the major is my man  when i can stand alone ill soon let him know it  well go your own way said girdlestone shortly  hard to all the world he was soft only in this one direction  from childhood every discussion between father and son had ended with the same words  it is business time he resumed  let us confine ourselves to business  i see that illinois were at 112 yesterday  they are at 113 this morning  what have you been on change already  yes i dropped in there on my way to the office  i would hold on to those  they will go up for some days yet  the senior partner made a pencil note on the margin of the list  well hold on to the cotton we have he said  no sell out at once ezra answered with decision i saw young featherstone of liverpool last night or rather this morning  it was hard to make head or tail of what the fool said but he let fall enough to show that there was likely to be a drop  girdlestone made another mark upon the paper  he never questioned his sons decisions now for long experience had shown him that they were never formed without solid grounds  take this list ezra he said handing him the paper and run your eye over it  if you see anything that wants changing mark it  ill do it in the countinghouse his son answered  i can keep my eye on those lazy scamps of clerks  gilray has no idea of keeping them in order  as he went out he cannoned against an elderly gentleman in a white waistcoat who was being shown in and who ricochetted off him into the office where he shook hands heartily with the elder girdlestone it was evident from the laboured cordiality of the latters greeting that the newcomer was a man of some importance  he was indeed none other than the wellknown philanthropist mr jefferson edwards mp for middlehurst whose name upon a bill was hardly second to that of rothschild  how do girdlestone how do he exclaimed mopping his face with his handkerchief  he was a fussy little man with a brusque nervous manner  hard at it as usual eh  always pegging away  wonderful man ha ha  wonderful  you look warm the merchant answered rubbing his hands  let me offer you some claret  i have some in the cupboard  no thank you the visitor answered staring across at the head of the firm as though he were some botanical curiosity  extraordinary fellow iron girdlestone they call you in the city  a good name too ha haan excellent name  irongrey you know and hard to look at but soft here my dear sir soft here  the little man tapped him with his walkingstick over the cardiac region and laughed boisterously while his grim companion smiled slightly and bowed to the compliment  ive come here begging said mr jefferson edwards producing a portentouslooking roll of paper from an inner pocket  know ive come to the right place for charity  the aboriginal evolution society my dear boy  all it wants are a few hundreds to float it off  noble aim girdlestoneglorious object  what is the object the merchant asked  well the evolution of the aborigines edwards answered in some confusion  sort of practical darwinism  evolve em into higher types and turn em all white in time  professor wilder gave us a lecture about it  ill send you round a times with the account  spoke about their thumbs  they cant cross them over their palms and they have rudimentary tails or had until they were educated off them  they wore all the hair off their backs by leaning against trees  marvellous things  all they want is a little money  it seems to be a praiseworthy object the merchant said gravely  i knew that you would think so cried the little philanthropist enthusiastically  of course bartering as you do with aboriginal races their development and evolution is a matter of the deepest importance to you  if a man came down to barter with you who had a rudimentary tail and couldnt bend his thumbwell it wouldnt be pleasant you know  our idea is to elevate them in the scale of humanity and to refine their tastes  hewett of the royal society went to report on the matter a year or so back and some rather painful incident occurred  i believe hewett met with some mishapin fact they go the length of saying that he was eaten  so you see weve had our martyrs my dear friend and the least that we can do who stay at home at ease is to support a good cause to the best of our ability  whose names have you got asked the merchant  lets see jefferson edwards said unfolding his list  spriggs ten morton ten wigglesworth five hawkins ten indermann fifteen jones five and a good many smaller amounts  what is the highest as yet  indermann the tobacco importer has given fifteen  it is a good cause mr girdlestone said dipping his pen into the inkbottle  he that givethyou know what the good old book says of course a list of the donations will be printed and circulated  most certainly  here is my cheque for twentyfive pounds  i am proud to have had this opportunity of contributing towards the regeneration of those poor souls whom providence has placed in a lower sphere than myself  girdlestone said the member of parliament with emotion as he pocketed the cheque you are a good man  i shall not forget this my friend i shall never forget it  wealth has its duties and charity is among them  girdlestone answered with unction shaking the philanthropists extended hand goodbye my dear sir  pray let me know if our efforts are attended with any success  should more money be needed you know one  who may be relied on  there was a sardonic smile upon the hard face of the senior partner as he closed the door behind his visitor  its a legitimate investment he muttered to himself as he resumed his seat  what with his parliamentary interest and his financial power its a very legitimate investment  it looks well on the list too and inspires confidence i think the money is well spent  ezra had bowed politely as the great man passed through the office and gilray the wizened senior clerk opened the outer door  jefferson edwards turned as he passed him and clapped him on the shoulder  lucky fellow he said in his jerky way  good employermodel to followgreat man  watch him mark him imitate himthats the way to get on  cant go wrong and he trotted down the street in search of fresh contributions towards his latest fad    chapter iii   thomas gilray makes an investment  the shambling little clerk was still standing at the door watching the retreating figure of the millionaire and mentally splicing together his fragmentary remarks into a symmetrical piece of advice which might be carried home and digested at leisure when his attention was attracted to a palefaced woman with a child in her arms who was hanging about the entrance  she looked up at the clerk in a wistful way as if anxious to address him and yet afraid to do so  then noting perhaps some gleam of kindness in his yellow wrinkled face she came across to him  dye think i could see muster girdlestone sir she asked with a curtsey or maybe youre mr girdlestone yourself  the woman was wretchedly dressed and her eyelids were swollen and red as from long crying  mr girdlestone is in his room said the head clerk kindly  i have no doubt that he will see you if you will wait for a moment  had he been speaking to the grandest of the besilked and befeathered dames who occasionally frequented the office he could not have spoken with greater courtesy  verily in these days the spirit of true chivalry has filtered down from the surface and has found a lodgment in strange places  the merchant looked with a surprised and suspicious eye at his visitor when she was ushered in  take a seat my good woman he said what can i do for you  please mr girdlestone im mrs hudson she answered seating herself in a timid way upon the extreme edge of a chair  she was weary and footsore for she had carried the baby up from stepney that morning  hudsonhudsoncant remember the name said girdlestone shaking his head reflectively  jim hudson as was sir he was my husband the bosun for many a year o your ship the black eagle  he went out to try and earn a bit for me and the child sir but hes dead o fever poor dear and lying in bonny river wi a cannon ball at his feet as the carpenter himself told me who sewed him up and i wish i was dead and with him so i do she began sobbing in her shawl and moaning while the child suddenly awakened by the sound rubbed its eyes with its wrinkled mottled hands and then proceeded to take stock of mr girdlestone and his office with the critical philosophy of infancy  calm yourself my good woman calm yourself said the senior partner he perceived that the evil prophesied by his son had come upon him and he made a mental note of this fresh instance of ezras powers of foresight  it was hard so it was said mrs hudson drying her eyes but still giving vent to an occasional tempestuous sob  i heard as the black eagle was comin up the river so i spent all i had in my pocket in makin jim a nice little supperham an eggs which was always his favourite an a pint o bitter an a quartern o whiskey that he could take hot after bein naturally o a cold turn and him comin from a warm country too  then out i goes and down the river until i sees the black eagle acomin up wi a tug in front of her  well i knowed the two streaks o white paint let alone the screechin o the parrots which i could hear from the bank  i could see the heads o some of the men peepin over the side so i waves my handkercher and one o them he waves back  trust jim for knowin his little wife says i proud like to myself and i runs round to where i knew as theyd dock her what with me being that excited that i couldnt rightly see where i was going and what with the crowd for the men was comin from work i didnt get there till the ship was alongside  then i jumps aboard and the first man i seed was sandy mcpherson who i knowed when we lived in binnacle lane  wheres jim i cried running forward eager like to the forecastle but he caught me by the arm as i passed him steady lass steady  then i looked up at him and his face was very grave and my knees got kind o weak  wheres jim says i dont ask says he  where is he sandy i screeches and then dont say the word sandy dont you say it but lor bless ye sir it didnt much matter what he said nor what he didnt for i knowed all an down i flops on the deck in a dead faint  the mate he took me home in a cab and when i come to there was the supper lying sir and the beer and the things ashinin and all so cosy an the child askin where her father was for i told her hed bring her some things from africa  then to think of him alyin dead in bonny river why sir it nigh broke my heart  a sore affliction the merchant said shaking his grizzled head a sad visitation  but these things are sent to try us mrs hudson they are warnings to us not to fix our thoughts too much upon the dross of this world but to have higher aims and more durable aspirations we are poor shortsighted creatures the best of us and often mistake evil for good  what seems so sad today may if taken in a proper spirit be looked back upon as a startingpoint from which all the good of your life has come  bless you sir said the widow still furtively rubbing her eyes with the corner of her little shawl  youre a real kind gentleman  it does me good to hear you talk  we have all our burdens and misfortunes continued the senior partner some have more some have less  today is your turn tomorrow it may be mine  but let us struggle on to the great goal and the weight of our burden need never cause us to sink by the wayside  and now i must wish you a very good morning mrs hudson  believe me you have my hearty sympathy  the woman rose and then stood irresolute for a moment as though there was something which she still wished to mention  when will i be able to draw jims back pay sir she asked nervously i have pawned nigh everything in the house and the child and me is weak from want of food  your husbands back pay the merchant said taking down a ledger from the shelf and turning rapidly over the leaves  i think that you are under a delusion mrs hudson  let me seedawson duffield everard francis gregory gunter hardy  ah here it ishudson boatswain of the black eagle  the wages which he received amounted i see to five pounds a month  the voyage lasted eight months but the ship had only been out two months and a half when your husband died  thats true sir the widow said with an anxious look at the long line of figures in the ledger  of course the contract ended at his death so the firm owed him twelve pounds ten at that date  but i perceive from my books that you have been drawing halfpay during the whole eight months  you have accordingly had twenty pounds from the firm and are therefore in its debt to the amount of seven pounds ten shillings  well say nothing of that at present the senior partner concluded with a magnificent air when you are a little better off you can make good the balance but really you can hardly expect us to assist you any further at present  but sir we have nothing mrs hudson sobbed  it is deplorable most deplorable  but we are not the people to apply to  your own good sense will tell you that now that i have explained it to you  good morning  i wish you good fortune and hope you will let us know from time to time how you go on  we always take a keen interest in the families of those who serve us  mr girdlestone opened the door and the heartsick little woman staggered away across the office still bearing her heavy child  when she got into the open air she stared around her like one dazed the senior clerk looked anxiously at her as he stood at the open door then he glanced back into the office  ezra girdlestone was deep in some accounts and his brother clerks were all absorbed in their work  he stole up to the woman with an apologetic smile slipped something into her hand and then hurried back into the office with an austere look upon his face as if his whole mind were absorbed in the affairs of the firm  there are speculations above the ken of business men  perhaps thomas gilray that illspared halfcrown of yours may bring in better interest than the fiveandtwenty pounds of your employer    chapter iv   captain hamilton miggs of the black eagle  the head of the firm had hardly recovered his mental serenity after the painful duty of explaining her financial position to the widow hudson when his quick ear caught the sound of a heavy footstep in the countinghouse  a gruff voice was audible at the same time which demanded in rather more energetic language than was usually employed in that orderly establishment whether the principal was to be seen or not the answer was evidently in the affirmative for the lumbering tread came rapidly nearer and a powerful double knock announced that the visitor was at the other side of the door  come in cried mr girdlestone laying down his pen  this invitation was so far complied with that the handle turned and the door revolved slowly upon its hinges  nothing more substantial than a strong smell of spirituous liquors however entered the apartment  come in the merchant repeated impatiently  at this second mandate a great tangled mass of black hair was slowly protruded round the angle of the door  then a coppercoloured forehead appeared with a couple of very shaggy eyebrows and eventually a pair of eyes which protruded from their sockets and looked yellow and unhealthy  these took a long look first at the senior partner and then at his surroundings after which as if reassured by the inspection the remainder of the face appeareda flat nose a large mouth with a lower lip which hung down and exposed a line of tobaccostained teeth and finally a thick black beard which bristled straight out from the chin and bore abundant traces of an egg having formed part of its owners morning meal  the head having appeared the body soon followed it though all in the same anacondalike style of progression until the individual stood revealed  he was a stoutlybuilt seafaring man dressed in a pea jacket and blue trousers and holding his tarpaulin hat in his hand  with a rough scrape and a most unpleasant leer he advanced towards the merchant a tattoed and hairy hand outstretched in sign of greeting  why captain said the head of the firm rising and grasping the others hand with effusion i am glad to see you back safe and well  glad to see ye sirglad to see ye  his voice was thick and husky and there was an indecision about his gait as though he had been drinking heavily  i came in sort o cautious he continued cause i didnt know who might be about when you and me speaks together we likes to speak alone you bet  the merchant raised his bushy eyebrows a little as though he did not relish the idea of mutual confidences suggested by his companions remark  hadnt you better take a seat he said  the other took a canebottomed chair and carried it into the extreme corner of the office  then having looked steadily at the wall behind him and rapped it with his knuckles he sat down still throwing an occasional apprehensive glance over his shoulder  ive got a touch of the jumps he remarked apologetically to his employer  i likes to know as there aint no one behind me  you should give up this shocking habit of drinking mr girdlestone said seriously  it is a waste of the best gifts with which providence has endowed us  you are the worse for it both in this world and in the next  captain hamilton miggs did not seem to be at all impressed by this very sensible piece of advice  on the contrary he chuckled boisterously to himself and slapping his thigh expressed his opinion that his employer was a rum una conviction which he repeated to himself several times with various symptoms of admiration  well well girdlestone said after a short pause boys will be boys and sailors i suppose will be sailors  after eight months of anxiety and toil ending in success captaini am proud to be able to say the wordssome little licence must be allowed  i do not judge others by the same hard and fast lines by which i regulate my own conduct  this admirable sentiment also failed to elicit any response from the obdurate miggs except the same manifestations of mirth and the same audible aside as to the peculiarities of his masters character  i must congratulate you on your cargo and wish you the same luck for your next voyage the merchant continued  ivory an gold dust an skins an resin an cochineal an gums an ebony an rice an tobacco an fruits an nuts in bulk if theres a better cargo about id like to see it the sailor said defiantly  an excellent cargo captain very good indeed  three of your men died i believe  ay three of the lubbers went under  two o fever and one o snakebite  it licks me what sailors are comin to in these days when i was afore the mast wed ha been ashamed to die o a trifle like that  look at me  ive been down wi coast fever sixteen times and ive had yellow jack an dysentery an ive been bit by the black cobra in the andamans  ive had cholera too  it broke out in a brig when i was in the sandwich island trade and i was shipmates wi seven dead out o a crew o ten  but i aint none the worse for itno nor never will be  but i say govnor haint you got a drop of something about the office  the senior partner rose and taking a bottle from the cupboard filled out a stiff glass of rum  the sailor drank it off eagerly and laid down the empty tumbler with a sigh of satisfaction  say now he said with an unpleasant confidential leer werent you surprised to see us come backeh  straight now between man and man  the old ship hangs together well and has lots of work in her yet the merchant answered  lots of work  gods truth i thought she was gone in the bay  wed a dirty night with a gale from the westsouwest an had been goin by dead reckonin for three days so we werent over and above sure o ourselves  she wasnt much of a seagoing craft when we left england but the sun had fried all the pitch out o her seams and you might ha put your finger through some of them  two days an a night we were at the pumps for she leaked like a sieve  we lost the fore topsail blown clean out o the ringbolts  i never thought to see lunnon again  if she could weather a gale like that she could make another voyage  she could start on another the sailor said gloomily but as like as not shed never see the end ot  come come youre not quite yourself this morning miggs  we value you as a dashing fearless fellowlet me fill your glass againwho doesnt fear a little risk where theres something to be gained youll lose your good name if you go on like that  shes in a terrible bad way the captain insisted  youll have to do something before she can go  what shall we have to do  dry dock her and give her a thorough overhaul  she might sink before she got out o the channel if she went as she is just now  very well the merchant said coldly  if you insist on it it must be done  but of course it would make a great difference in your salary  eh  you are at present getting fifteen pounds a month and five per cent commission  these are exceptional terms in consideration of any risk that you may run  we shall dry dock the black eagle and your salary is now ten pounds a month and two and a half commission  belay there belay the sailor shouted  his coppery face was a shade darker than usual and his bilious eyes had a venomous gleam in them dont you beat me down curse you he hissed advancing to the table and leaning his hands upon it while he pushed his angry face forward until it was within a foot of that of the merchant  dont you try that game on mate for i am a freeborn british seaman and i am under the thumb of no man  youre drunk said the senior partner  sit down  youd reduce my screw would ye roared captain hamilton miggs working himself into a fury  me that has worked for ye and slaved for ye and risked my life for ye  you try it on guvnor just you try it on  suppose i let out that little story o the painting out o the markswhere would the firm of girdlestone be then  i guess youd rather double my wage than have that yarn goin about  what do you mean  what do i mean  you dont know what i mean do you  of course not it wasnt you as set us on to go at night and paint out the government plimsoll marks and then paint em in again higher up so as to be able to overload  that wasnt you was it  do you mean to assert that it was  in course i do thundered the angry seaman  the senior partner struck the gong which stood upon the table gilray he said quietly go out and bring in a policeman  captain hamilton miggs seemed to be somewhat startled by this sudden move of his antagonist  steady your helm governor he said what are ye up to now  im going to give you in charge  what for  for intimidation and using threatening language and endeavouring to extort money under false pretences  theres no witnesses the sailor said in a halfcringing halfdefiant manner  oh yes there are ezra girdlestone remarked coming into the room he had been standing between the two doors which led to the countinghouse and had overheard the latter portion of the conversation  dont let me interrupt you  you were saying that you would blacken my fathers character unless he increased your salary  i didnt mean no harm said captain hamilton miggs glancing nervously from the one to the other  he had been fairly well known to the law in his younger days and had no desire to renew the acquaintance  who painted out those plimsoll marks asked the merchant  it was me  did any one suggest it to you  no  shall i send in the policeman sir asked gilray opening the door  ask him to wait for a moment girdlestone answered  and now captain to return to the original point shall we dry dock the black eagle and reduce the salary or do you see your way to going back in her on the same terms  ill go back and be damned to it said the captain recklessly plunging his hands into the pockets of his pea jacket and plumping back into his chair  thats right his grim employer remarked approvingly  but swearing is a most sinful practice  send the policeman away ezra  the young man went out with an amused smile and the two were left together again  youll not be able to pass the government inspector unless you do something to her the seaman said after a long pause during which he brooded over his wrongs  of course we shall do something  the firm is not mean though it avoids unnecessary expense  well put a coat of paint on her and some pitch and do up the rigging  shes a stout old craft and with one of the smartest sailors afloat in command of herfor we always give you credit for being thatshell run many a voyage yet  im paid for the risk guvnor as you said just now the sailor remarked  but dont it seem kind o hard on them as isnton the mates an the hands  there is always a risk my dear captain  there is nothing in the world without risk  you remember what is said about those who go down to the sea in ships  they see the wonders of the deep and in return they incur some little danger  my house in eccleston square might be shaken down by an earthquake or a gale might blow in the walls but im not always brooding over the chance of it  theres no use your taking it for granted that some misfortune will happen to the black eagle  the sailor was silenced but not convinced by his employers logic well well he said sulkily i am going so theres an end of it and theres no good in having any more palaver about it  you have your object in running rotten ships and you make it worth my while to take my chances in them  im suited and youre suited so theres no more to be said  thats right  have some more rum  no not a spot  why not  because i likes to keep my head pretty clear when im atalkin to you muster girdlestone  out o your office ill drink to further orders but i wont do business and muddle myself at the same time  when dye want me to start  when shes unloaded and loaded up again  three weeks or a month yet i expect that spender will have come in with the maid of athens by that time  unless some accident happens on the way said captain hamilton miggs with his old leer  he was at sierra leone when we came up the coast i couldnt put in there for the swabs have got a warrant out agin me for putting a charge o shot into a nigger  that was a wicked actionvery wrong indeed the merchant said gravely  you must consider the interests of the firm miggs  we cant afford to have a good port blocked against our ships in this fashion did they serve this writ on you  another nigger brought it aboard  did you read it  no i threw it overboard  and what became of the negro  well said miggs with a grin when i threw the writ overboard he happened to be aholdin on to it  so ye see he went over too then i up anchor and scooted  there are sharks about there  a few  really miggs the merchant said you must restrain your sinful passions  you have broken the fifth commandment and closed the trade of freetown to the black eagle  it never was worth a rap the sailor answered  i wouldnt give a cuss for any of the british settlements  give me real niggers chaps as knows nothing of law or civilizing or any rot of the sort  i can pull along with them  i have often wondered how you managed it girdlestone said curiously you succeed in picking up a cargo where the steadiest and best men cant get as much as a bag of nuts  how do you work it  theres many would like to know that miggs answered with an expressive wink  it is a secret then  well it aint a secret to you cause you aint a skipper and it dont matter if you knows it or not  i dont want to have em all at the same game  how is it then  ill tell ye said miggs  he seemed to have recovered his serenity by this time and his eyes twinkled as he spoke of his own exploits i gets drunk with them  thats how i does it  oh indeed  yes thats how its worked  lord love ye when these fustclass certificated secondcousintoanearl merchant skippers comes out they move about among the chiefs and talks down to them as if they was tin methuselahs on wheels  the almightys great coat wouldnt make a waistcoat for some o these blokes  now when i gets among em i has em all into the cabin though theyre black an naked an the smell aint over an above pleasant  then i out with the rum and its help yourself an pass the bottle  pretty soon dye see their tongues get loosened and as i lie low an keep dark i gets a pretty good idea o whats in the market  then when i knows whats to be got its queer if i dont manage to get it  besides they like a little notice just as christians does and they remembers me because i treat them well  an excellent plan miggsa capital plan said the senior partner you are an invaluable servant  well the captain said rising from his chair im getting a great deal too dry with all this palaver  i dont mind gettin drunk with nigger chiefs but im darned if ill he paused but the grim smile on his companions face showed that he appreciated the compliment  i say he continued giving his employer a confidential nudge with his elbow suppose wed gone down in the bay this last time youd ha been a bit out in your reckoningeh what  why so  well we were overinsured on our outward passage  an accident then might ha put thousands in your pocket i know  coming back though the cargo was worth more than the insurance i reckon  youd ha been out o pocket if wed foundered  it would ha been a case o the engineer hoisted on his own peter as shakspere says  we take our chance of these things the merchant said with dignity  well good morning guvnor captain hamilton miggs said brusquely when you wants me you can lay your hands on me at the old crib the cock and cowslip rotherhithe  as he passed out through the office ezra rejoined his father  hes a curious chap he remarked jerking his head in the direction which miggs had taken  i heard him bellowing like a bull so i thought i had best listen to what he had to say  hes a useful servant though  the fellows half a savage himself his father said  hes in his element among them  thats why he gets on so well with them  he doesnt seem much the worse for the climate either  his body does not but his soul ezra his soul  however to return to business  i wish you to see the underwriters and pay the premium of the black eagle  if you see your way to it increase the policy but do it carefully ezra and with tact  she will start about the time of the equinoctial gales  if anything should happen to her it would be as well that the firm should have a margin on the right side    chapter v   modern athenians  edinburgh university may call herself with grim jocoseness the alma mater of her students but if she be a mother at all she is one of a very heroic and spartan cast who conceals her maternal affection with remarkable success  the only signs of interest which she ever designs to evince towards her alumni are upon those not infrequent occasions when guineas are to be demanded from them  then one is surprised to find how carefully the old hen has counted her chickens and how promptly the demand is conveyed to each one of the thousands throughout the empire who in spite of neglect cherish a sneaking kindness for their old college  there is symbolism in the very look of her square and massive grim and grey with never a pillar or carving to break the dead monotony of the great stone walls  she is learned she is practical and she is useful  there is little sentiment or romance in her composition however and in this she does but conform to the instincts of the nation of which she is the youngest but the most flourishing teacher  a lad coming up to an english university finds himself in an enlarged and enlightened public school  if he has passed through harrow and eton there is no very abrupt transition between the life which he has led in the sixth form and that which he finds awaiting him on the banks of the cam and the isis  certain rooms are found for him which have been inhabited by generations of students in the past and will be by as many in the future  his religion is cared for and he is expected to put in an appearance at hall and at chapel  he must be within bounds at a fixed time  if he behave indecorously he is liable to be pounced upon and reported by special officials and a code of punishments is hung perpetually over his head  in return for all this his university takes a keen interest in him  she pats him on the back if he succeeds prizes and scholarships and fine fat fellowships are thrown plentifully in his way if he will gird up his loins and aspire to them  there is nothing of this in a scotch university  the young aspirant pays his pound and finds himself a student  after that he may do absolutely what he will  there are certain classes going on at certain hours which he may attend if he choose  if not he may stay away without the slightest remonstrance from the college  as to religion he may worship the sun or have a private fetish of his own upon the mantelpiece of his lodgings for all that the university cares  he may live where he likes he may keep what hours he chooses and he is at liberty to break every commandment in the decalogue as long as he behaves himself with some approach to decency within the academical precincts  in every way he is absolutely his own master  examinations are periodically held at which he may appear or not as he chooses the university is a great unsympathetic machine taking in a stream of rawboned cartilaginous youths at one end and turning them out at the other as learned divines astute lawyers and skilful medical men of every thousand of the raw material about six hundred emerge at the other side  the remainder are broken in the process  the merits and faults of this scotch system are alike evident left entirely to his own devices in a far from moral city many a lad falls at the very startingpoint of his lifes race never to rise again  many become idlers or take to drink while others after wasting time and money which they could ill afford leave the college with nothing learned save vice  on the other hand those whose manliness and good sense keep them straight have gone through a training which lasts them for life  they have been tried and have not been found wanting they have learned selfreliance confidence and in a word have become men of the world while their confreres in england are still magnified schoolboys  high up in a third flat in howe street one thomas dimsdale was going through his period of probation in a little bedroom and a large sittingroom which latter more studentium served the purpose of diningroom parlour and study  a dingy sideboard with four still more dingy chairs and an archaeological sofa made up the whole of the furniture with the exception of a circular mahogany centretable littered with notebooks and papers  above the mantelpiece was a flyblown mirror with innumerable cards and notices projecting in a fringe all around and a pair of pipe racks flanking it on either side along the centre of the sideboard arranged with suspicious neatness as though seldom disturbed stood a line of solemn books holdens osteology quains anatomy kirkes physiology and huxleys invertebrata together with a disarticulated human skull  on one side of the fireplace two thigh bones were stacked on the other a pair of foils two baskethilted singlesticks and a set of boxinggloves on a shelf in a convenient niche was a small stock of general literature which appeared to have been considerably more thumbed than the works upon medicine  thackerays esmond and merediths richard feveret rubbed covers with irvings conquest of granada and a tattered line of papercovered novels  over the sideboard was a framed photograph of the edinburgh university football fifteen and opposite it a smaller one of dimsdale himself clad in the scantiest of garb as he appeared after winning the halfmile at the interuniversity handicap a large silver goblet the trophy of that occasion stood underneath upon a bracket  such was the students chamber upon the morning in question save that in a roomy armchair in the corner the young gentleman himself was languidly reclining with a short wooden pipe in his mouth and his feet perched up upon the side of the table  greyeyed yellowhaired broad in the chest and narrow in the loins with the strength of a bullock and the graceful activity of a stag it would be hard to find a finer specimen of young british manhood the long fine curves of the limbs and the easy pose of the round strong head upon the thick muscular neck might have served as a model to an athenian sculptor  there was nothing in the face however to recall the regular beauty of the east  it was anglosaxon to the last feature with its honest breadth between the eyes and its nascent moustache a shade lighter in colour than the sunburned skin  shy and yet strong plain and yet pleasing it was the face of a type of man who has little to say for himself in this world and says that little badly but who has done more than all the talkers and the writers to ring this planet round with a crimson girdle of british possessions  wonder whether jack garraway is ready he murmured throwing down the scotsman and staring up at the roof  its nearly eleven oclock  he rose with a yawn picked up the poker stood upon the chair and banged three times upon the ceiling  three muffled taps responded from the room above  dimsdale stepped down and began slowly to discard his coat and his waistcoat  as he did so there was a quick active step upon the stair and a lean wirylooking middlesized young fellow stepped into the room  with a nod of greeting he pushed the table over to one side threw off his two upper garments and pulled on a pair of the boxinggloves from the corner  dimsdale had already done the same and was standing a model of manly grace and strength in the centre of the room  practice your lead jack  about here  he tapped the centre of his forehead with his swollen gauntlet  his companion poised himself for a moment and then lashing out with his left hand came home with a heavy thud on the place indicated dimsdale smiled gently and shook his head  it wont do he said  i hit my hardest the other answered apologetically  it wont do  try again  the visitor repeated the blow with all the force that he could command  dimsdale shook his head again despondently  you dont seem to catch it he said  its like this he leaned forward there was the sound of a sharp clip and the novice shot across the room with a force that nearly sent his skull through the panel of the door  thats it said dimsdale mildly  oh it is is it the other responded rubbing his head its deucedly interesting but i think i would understand it better if i saw you do it to some one else  it is something between the explosion of a powder magazine and a natural convulsion  his instructor smiled grimly  thats the only way to learn he said now we shall have three minutes of giveandtake and so ends the morning lesson  while this little scene was being enacted in the lodgings of the student a very stout little elderly man was walking slowly down howe street glancing up at the numbers upon the doors  he was square and deep and broad like a bottle of geneva with a large ruddy face and a pair of bright black eyes which were shrewd and critical and yet had a merry twinkle of eternal boyishness in their depths  bushy side whiskers shot with grey flanked his rubicund visage and he threw out his feet as he walked with the air of a man who is on good terms with himself and with every one around him  at no13 he stopped and rapped loudly upon the door with the head of his metalheaded stick  mrs mctavish he asked as a hardlined angular woman responded to his summons  thats me sir  mr dimsdale lives with you i believe  third floor front sir  is he in  suspicion shone in the womans eyes  was it aboot a bill she asked  a bill my good woman  no no nothing of the kind  dr dimsdale is my name  i am the lads fatherjust come up from london to see him i hope he has not been overworking himself  a ghost of a smile played about the womans face  i think not sir she answered  i almost wish i had come round in the afternoon said the visitor standing with his thick legs astride upon the doormat  it seems a pity to break his chain of thought  the morning is his time for study  houts  i wouldna fash aboot that  well well  the third floor you say  he did not expect me so early i shall surprise the dear boy at his work  the landlady stood listening expectantly in the passage  the sturdy little man plodded heavily up the first flight of stairs  he paused on the landing  dear me he murmured  some one is beating carpets  how can they expect poor tom to read  at the second landing the noise was much louder it must be a dancing school conjectured the doctor  when he reached his sons door however there could no longer be any doubt as to whence the sounds proceeded  there was the stamp and shuffle of feet the hissing of indrawn breath and an occasional soft thud as if some one were butting his head against a bale of wool its epilepsy gasped the doctor and turning the handle he rushed into the room  one hurried glance showed him the struggle which was going on there was no time to note details  some maniac was assaulting his tom he sprang at the man seized him round the waist dragged him to the ground and seated himself upon him  now tie his hands he said complacently as he balanced himself upon the writhing figure    chapter vi   a rectorial election  it took some little time before his son who was halfchoked with laughter could explain to the energetic doctor that the gentleman upon whom he was perched was not a dangerous lunatic but on the contrary a very harmless and innocent member of society  when at last it was made clear to him the doctor released his prisoner and was profuse in his apologies  this is my father garraway said dimsdale  i hardly expected him so early  i must offer you a thousand apologies sir  the fact is that i am rather shortsighted and had no time to put my glasses on  it seemed to me to be a most dangerous scuffle  dont mention it sir said garraway with great good humour  and you tom you rogue is this the way you spend your mornings i expected to find you deep in your books  i told your landlady that i hardly liked to come up for fear of disturbing you at your work  you go up for your first professional in a few weeks i understand  that will be all right dad said his son demurely  garraway and i usually take a little exercise of this sort as a preliminary to the labours of the day  try this armchair and have a cigarette  the doctors eye fell upon the medical works and the disarticulated skull and his illhumour departed  you have your tools close at hand i see he remarked  yes dad all ready  those bones bring back old memories to me  i am rusty in my anatomy but i dare say i could stump you yet  let me see now  what are the different foramina of the sphenoid bone and what structures pass through them  eh  coming yelled his son  coming and dashed out of the room  i didnt hear any one call observed the doctor  didnt you sir said garraway pulling on his coat  i thought i heard a noise  you read with my son i believe  yes sir  then perhaps you can tell me what the structures are which pass through the foramina of the sphenoid  oh yes sir  there is theall right tom all right  excuse me sir he is calling me and garraway vanished as precipitately as his friend had done  the doctor sat alone puffing at his cigarette and brooding over his own dullness of hearing  presently the two students returned looking just a little shamefaced and plunged instantly into wild talk about the weather the town and the universityanything and everything except the sphenoid bone  you have come in good time to see something of university life said young dimsdale  today we elect our new lord rector  garraway and i will take you down and show you the sights  i have often wished to see something of it his father answered i was apprenticed to my profession mr garraway in the oldfashioned way and had few opportunities of attending college  indeed sir  but i can imagine it all  what can be more charming than the sight of a community of young men all striving after knowledge and emulating each other in the ardour of their studies  not that i would grudge them recreation  i can fancy them strolling in bands round the classic precincts of their venerable university and amusing themselves by discussing the rival theories of physiologists or the latest additions to the pharmacopoeia  garraway had listened with becoming gravity to the commencement of this speech but at the last sentence he choked and vanished for the second time out of the room  your friend seems amused remarked dr dimsdale mildly  yes  he gets taken like that sometimes said his son  his brothers are just the same  i have hardly had a chance yet to say how glad i am to see you dad  and i to see you my dear boy  your mother and kate come up by the night train  i have private rooms at the hotel  kate harston  i can only remember her as a little quiet girl with long brown hair  that was six years ago  she promised to be pretty  then she has fulfilled her promise  but you shall judge that for yourself  she is the ward of john girdlestone the african merchant but we are the only relations she has upon earth  her father was my second cousin  she spends a good deal of her time now with us at phillimore gardensas much as her guardian will allow  he prefers to have her under his own roof and i dont blame him for she is like a ray of sunshine in the house  it was like drawing his teeth to get him to consent to this little holiday but i stuck at it until i wearied him outfairly wearied him out  the little doctor chuckled at the thought of his victory and stretched out his thick legs towards the fire  this examination will prevent me from being with you as much as i wish  thats right my boy let nothing interfere with your work  still i think i am pretty safe  i am glad they have come now for next wednesday is the international football match  garraway and i are the two scotch halfbacks  you must all come down and see it  ill tell you what dimsdale said garraway reappearing in the doorway if we dont hurry up we shall see nothing of the election it is close on twelve  i am all ready cried dr dimsdale jumping to his feet and buttoning his coat  let us be off then said his son and picking up hats and sticks they clattered off down the lodginghouse stairs  a rectorial election is a peculiarly scotch institution and however it may strike the impartial observer it is regarded by the students themselves as a rite of extreme solemnity and importance from which grave issues may depend  to hear the speeches and addresses of rival orators one would suppose that the integrity of the constitution and the very existence of the empire hung upon the return of their special nominee  two candidates are chosen from the most eminent of either party and a day is fixed for the polling  every undergraduate has a vote but the professors have no voice in the matter  as the duties are nominal and the position honourable there is never any lack of distinguished aspirants for a vacancy  occasionally some wellknown literary or scientific man is invited to become a candidate but as a rule the election is fought upon strictly political lines with all the oldfashioned accompaniments of a parliamentary contest  for months before the great day there is bustle and stir  secret committees meet rules are formulated and insidious agents prowl about with an eye to the political training of those who have not yet nailed their colours to any particular mast  then comes a grand meeting of the liberal students association which is trumped by a dinner of the undergraduates conservative society   the campaign is then in full swing  great boards appear at the university gates on which pithy satires against one or other candidate parodies on songs quotations from their speeches and gaudily painted cartoons are posted  those who are supposed to be able to feel the pulse of the university move about with the weight of much knowledge upon their brows throwing out hints as to the probable majority one way or the other  some profess to know it to a nicety  others shake their heads and remark vaguely that there is not much to choose either way  so week after week goes by until the excitement reaches a climax when the date of the election comes round  there was no need upon that day for dr dimsdale or any other stranger in the town to ask his way to the university for the whooping and yelling which proceeded from that usually decorous building might have been heard from princes street to newington  in front of the gates was a dense crowd of townspeople peering through into the quadrangle and deriving much entertainment from the movements of the lively young gentlemen within  large numbers of the more peaceable undergraduates stood about under the arches and these quickly made a way for the newcomers for both garraway and dimsdale as noted athletes commanded a respect among their fellowstudents which medallists and honours men might look for in vain  the broad open quadrangle and all the numerous balconies and terraces which surround it were crowded with an excited mob of students  the whole three thousand odd electors who stand upon the college rolls appeared to be present and the noise which they were making would have reflected credit on treble their number  the dense crowd surged and seethed without pause or rest  now and again some orator would be hoisted up on the shoulders of his fellows when an oscillation of the crowd would remove his supporters and down he would come only to be succeeded by another at some other part of the assembly  the name of either candidate would produce roars of applause and equally vigorous howls of execration  those who were lucky enough to be in the balconies above hurled down missiles on the crowd beneathpeas eggs potatoes and bags of flour or of sulphur while those below wherever they found room to swing an arm returned the fusillade with interest the doctors views of academical serenity and the high converse of pallid students vanished into thin air as he gazed upon the mad tumultuous scene  yet in spite of his fifty years he laughed as heartily as any boy at the wild pranks of the young politicians and the ruin which was wrought upon broadcloth coat and shooting jacket by the hail of unsavoury projectiles  the crowd was most dense and most noisy in front of the classroom in which the counting of the votes was going forward  at one the result was to be announced and as the long hand of the great clock crept towards the hour a hush of expectation fell upon the assembly the brazen clang broke harshly out and at the same moment the folding doors were flung open and a knot of men rushed out into the crowd who swirled and eddied round them  the centre of the throng was violently agitated and the whole mass of people swayed outwards and inwards for a minute or two the excited combatants seethed and struggled without a clue as to the cause of the commotion  then the corner of a large placard was elevated above the heads of the rioters on which was visible the word liberal in great letters but before it could be raised further it was torn down and the struggle became fiercer than ever  up came the placard againthe other corner this timewith the word majority upon it and then immediately vanished as before enough had been seen however to show which way the victory had gone and shouts of triumph arose everywhere with waving of hats and clatter of sticks  meanwhile in the centre the two parties fought round the placard and the commotion began to cover a wider area as either side was reinforced by fresh supporters  one gigantic liberal seized the board and held it aloft for a moment so that it could be seen in its entirety by the whole multitude                              liberal majority                                    241  but his triumph was shortlived  a stick descended upon his head his heels were tripped up and he and his placard rolled upon the ground together  the victors succeeded however in forcing their way to the extreme end of the quadrangle where as every edinburgh man knows the fulllength statue of sir david brewster looks down upon the classic ground which he loved so well  an audacious radical swarmed up upon the pedestal and balanced the obnoxious notice on the marble arms of the professor  thus converted into a political partisan the revered inventor of the kaleidoscope became the centre of a furious struggle the vanquished politicians making the most desperate efforts to destroy the symbol of their opponents victory while the others offered an equally vigorous resistance to their attacks  the struggle was still proceeding when dimsdale removed his father for it was impossible to say what form the riot might assume  what goths what barbarians cried the little doctor as they walked down the bridges  and this is my dream of refined quiet and studious repose  they are not always like that sir said his son apologetically they were certainly a little jolly today  a little jolly cried the doctor  you rogue tom  i believe if i had not been there you would have been their ringleader  he glanced from one to the other and it was so evident from the expression of their faces that he had just hit the mark that he burst into a great guffaw of laughter in which after a moments hesitation his two young companions heartily joined    chapter vii   england versus scotland  the rectorial election had come and had gone but another great event had taken its place  it was the day of the england and scotland rugby match  better weather could not have been desired  the morning had been hazy but as the sun shone out the fog had gradually risen until now there remained but a suspicion of it floating like a plume above the frowning walls of edinburgh castle and twining a fairy wreath round the unfinished columns of the national monument upon the calton hill the broad stretch of the princes street gardens which occupy the valley between the old town and the new looked green and springlike and their fountains sparkled merrily in the sunshine  their wide expanse welltrimmed and bepathed formed a strange contrast to the rugged piles of grim old houses which bounded them upon the other side and the massive grandeur of the great hill beyond which lies like a crouching lion keeping watch and ward day and night over the ancient capital of the scottish kings  travellers who have searched the whole world round have found no fairer view  so thought three of the genus who were ensconced that forenoon in the bow windows of the royal hotel and gazed across the bright green valley at the dull historical background beyond  one we already know a stoutish gentleman ruddyfaced and blackeyed with check trousers light waistcoat and heavy chain legs widely parted his hands in his pockets and on his face that expression of irreverent and critical approval with which the travelled briton usually regards the works of nature  by his side was a young lady in a tightfitting travelling dress with trim leather belt and snowwhite collar and cuffs there was no criticism in her sweet face now flushed with excitement nothing but unqualified wonder and admiration at the beautiful scene before her  an elderly placidfaced woman sat in a basket chair in the recess and looked up with quiet loving eyes at the swift play of emotions which swept over the girls eager features  oh uncle george she cried it is really too heavenly  i cannot realize that we are free  i cant help fearing that it is all a dream and that i shall wake up to find myself pouring out ezra girdlestones coffee or listening to mr girdlestone as he reads the morning quotations  the elder woman stroked the girls hand caressingly with her soft motherly palm  dont think about it she murmured  no dont think about it echoed the doctor  my wife is quite right dont think about it  but dear me what a job i had to persuade your guardian to let you go  i should have given it up in despairi really shouldif i had not known that you had set your heart upon it  oh how good you both are to me cried the girl in a pretty little gush of gratitude  pooh pooh kate  but as to girdlestone he is perfectly right  if i had you i should keep you fast to myself i promise you  eh matilda  that we would george  perfect tyrants both of us  eh matilda  yes george  i am afraid that i am not very useful in a household said the girl i was too young to look after things for poor papa  mr girdlestone of course has a housekeeper of his own  i read the financial news to him after dinner every day and i know all about stock and consols and those american railways which are perpetually rising and falling  one of them went wrong last week and ezra swore and mr girdlestone said that the lord chastens those whom he loves  he did not seem to like being chastened a bit though  but how delightful this is  it is like living in another world  the girl was a pretty figure as she stood in the window tall lithe and graceful with the long soft curves of budding womanhood  her face was sweet rather than beautiful but an artist would have revelled in the delicate strength of the softly rounded chin and the quick bright play of her expression  her hair of a deep rich brown with a bronze shimmer where a sunbeam lay athwart it swept back in those thick luxuriant coils which are the unfailing index of a strong womanly nature  her deep blue eyes danced with life and light while her slightly retrousse nose and her sensitive smiling mouth all spoke of gentle good humour   from her sunny face to the dainty little shoe which peeped from under the trim black skirt she was an eminently pleasant object to look upon  so thought the passersby as they glanced up at the great bow window and so too thought a young gentleman who had driven up to the hotel door and who now bounded up the steps and into the room  he was enveloped in a long shaggy ulster which stretched down to his ankles and he wore a velvet cap trimmed with silver stuck carelessly on the back of his powerful yellow curled head  here is the boy cried his mother gaily  how are you mam dear he cried stooping over her to kiss her how are you dad  good morning cousin kate  you must come down and wish us luck  what a blessing that it is pretty warm  it is miserable for the spectators when there is an east wind  what do you think of it dad  i think you are an unnatural young renegade to play against your mother country said the sturdy doctor  oh come dad  i was born in scotland and i belong to a scotch club surely that is good enough  i hope you lose then  we are very likely to  atkinson of the west of scotland has strained his leg and we shall have to play blair of the institution at full backnot so good a man by a long way  the odds are five to four on the english this morning  they are said to be the very strongest lot that ever played in an international match  i have brought a cab with me so the moment you are ready we can start  there were others besides the students who were excited about the coming struggle  all edinburgh was in a ferment  football is and always has been the national game of scotland among those who affect violent exercise while golf takes its place with the more sedately inclined there is no game so fitted to appeal to a hardy and active people as that composite exercise prescribed by the rugby union in which fifteen men pit strength speed endurance and every manly attribute they possess in a prolonged struggle against fifteen antagonists  there is no room for mere knack or trickery  it is a fierce personal contest in which the ball is the central rallying point  that ball may be kicked pushed or carried it may be forced onwards in any conceivable manner towards the enemys goal  the fleet of foot may seize it and by superior speed thread their way through the ranks of their opponents the heavy of frame may crush down all opposition by dead weight  the hardiest and most enduring must win  even matches between prominent local clubs excite much interest in edinburgh and attract crowds of spectators  how much more then when the pick of the manhood of scotland were to try their strength against the very cream of the players from the south of the tweed  the roads which converged on the raeburn place grounds on which the match was to be played were dark with thousands all wending their way in one direction so thick was the moving mass that the carriage of the dimsdale party had to go at a walk for the latter half of the journey in spite of the objurgations of the driver who as a patriot felt the responsibility which rested upon him in having one of the team in his charge and the necessity there was for delivering him up by the appointed time many in the crowd recognized the young fellow and waved their hands to him or called out a few words of encouragement  miss kate harston and even the doctor began to reflect some of the interest and excitement which showed itself on every face around them  the youth alone seemed to be unaffected by the general enthusiasm and spent the time in endeavouring to explain the principles of the game to his fair companion whose ignorance of it was comprehensive and astounding  you understand he said that there are fifteen players on each side but it would not do for the whole of these fifteen men to play in a crowd for in that case if the other side forced the ball past them they would have nothing to fall back uponno reserves as it were therefore as we play the game in scotland ten men are told off to play in a knot  they are picked for their weight strength and endurance they are called the forwards and are supposed to be always on the ball following it everywhere never stopping or tiring  they are opposed of course by the forwards of the other side  now immediately behind the forwards are the two quarterbacks  they should be very active fellows good dodgers and fast runners  they never join in the very rough work but they always follow on the outskirts of the forwards and if the ball is forced past it is their duty to pick it up and make away with it like lightning  if they are very fast they may succeed in carrying it a long way before they are caughttackled as we call it  it is their duty also to keep their eye on the quarterbacks of the enemy and to tackle them if they get away  behind them again are the two halfbacksor threequarters as they call them in england  i am one of them they are supposed to be fast runners too and a good deal of the tackling comes to their lot for a good runner of the other side can often get past the quarters and then the halves have got to bring him down  behind the halfbacks is a single manthe back  he is the last resource when all others are past  he should be a sure and long kicker so as to get the ball away from the goal by that meansbut you are not listening  oh yes i am said kate  as a matter of fact the great throng and the novel sights were distracting her so much that she found it hard to attend to her companions disquisition  youll understand it quickly enough when you see it the student remarked cheerily  here we are at the grounds  as he spoke the carriage rattled through a broad gateway into a large open grassy space with a great pavilion at one side of it and a staked enclosure about two hundred yards long and a hundred broad with a goalpost at each end  this space was marked out by gaily coloured flags and on every side of it pressing against the barrier the whole way round was an enormous crowd twenty and thirty deep with others occupying every piece of rising ground or coign of vantage behind them the most moderate computation would place the number of spectators at fifteen thousand  at one side there was a line of cabs in the background and thither the carriage of the dimsdales drove while tom rushed off with his bag to the pavilion to change  it was high time to do so for just as the carriage took up its position a hoarse roar burst from the great multitude and was taken up again and again  it was a welcome to the english team which had just appeared upon the ground  there they were clad in white knickerbockers and jerseys with a single red rose embroidered upon their breasts as gallantlooking a set of young fellows as the whole world could produce tall squareshouldered straightlimbed as active as kittens and as powerful as young bullocks it was clear that they would take a lot of beating  they were the pick of the university and london clubs with a few players from the northern counties not a man among them whose name was not known wherever football was played  that tall longlegged youth is evans the great halfback who is said to be able to send a dropkick further than any of his predecessors in the annals of the game  there is buller the famous cambridge quarter only ten stone in weight but as lithe and slippery as an eel and jackson the other quarter is just such anotherhard to tackle himself but as tenacious as a bulldog in holding an adversary  that one with the strawcoloured hair is coles the great forward and there are nine lads of metal who will stand by him today through thick and thin  they were a formidablelooking lot and betting which had been five on four to them in the morning showed symptoms of coming to five to three  in the meantime by no means abashed at finding themselves the cynosure of so many eyes the englishmen proceeded to keep up their circulation by leapfrog and horseplay for their jerseys were thin and the wind bleak  but where were their adversaries  a few impatient moments slowly passed and then from one corner of the ground there rose a second cheer which rippled down the long line of onlookers and swelled into a mighty shout as the scotchmen vaulted over the barrier into the arena it was a nice question for connoisseurs in physical beauty as to which team had the best of it in physique  the northerners in their blue jerseys with a thistle upon their breasts were a sturdy hardbitten lot averaging a couple of pounds more in weight than their opponents the latter were perhaps more regularly and symmetrically built and were pronounced by experts to be the faster team but there was a massive gaunt look about the scotch forwards which promised well for their endurance  indeed it was on their forwards that they principally relied  the presence of three such players as buller evans and jackson made the english exceptionally strong behind but they had no men in front who were individually so strong and fast as miller watts or grey  dimsdale and garraway the scotch halfbacks and tookey the quarter whose blazing red head was a very oriflamme wherever the struggle waxed hottest were the best men that the northerners could boast of behind  the english had won the choice of goals and elected to play with what slight wind there was at their backs  a small thing may turn the scale between two evenly balanced teams  evans the captain placed the ball in front of him upon the ground with his men lined all along on either side as eager as hounds in leash  some fifty yards in front of him about the place where the ball would drop the bluevested scots gathered in a sullen crowd  there was a sharp ring from a bell a murmur of excitement from the crowd  evans took two quick steps forward and the yellow ball flew swift and straight as if it had been shot from a cannon right into the expectant group in front of him  for a moment there was grasping and turmoil among the scotchmen then from the crowd emerged grey the great glasgow forward the ball tucked well under his arm his head down running like the wind with his nine forwards in a dense clump behind him ready to bear down all opposition while the other five followed more slowly covering a wider stretch of ground  he met the englishmen who had started full cry after the ball the moment that their captain had kicked it  the first hurled himself upon him  grey without slackening his pace swerved slightly and he missed him  the second he passed in the same way but the third caught quickly at his legs and the scot flew head over heels and was promptly collared  not much use collaring him now  in the very act of falling he had thrown the ball behind him  gordon of paisley caught it and bore it on a dozen yards when he was seized and knocked down but not before he had bequeathed his trust to another who struggled manfully for some paces before he too was brought to the ground this pretty piece of passing had recovered for the scotch all the advantage lost by the english kickoff and was greeted by roars of applause from the crowd  and now there is a maul or scrimmage was there ever another race which did such things and called it play  twenty young men so blended and inextricably mixed that no one could assign the various arms and legs to their respective owners are straining every muscle and fibre of their bodies against each other and yet are so well balanced that the dense clump of humanity stands absolutely motionless  in the centre is an inextricable chaos where shoulders heave and heads rise and fall  at the edges are a fringe of legslegs in an extreme state of tension ever pawing for a firmer foothold and apparently completely independent of the rest of their owners whose heads and bodies have bored their way into the melee  the pressure in there is tremendous yet neither side gives an inch  just on the skirts of the throng with bent bodies and hands on knees stand the cool little quarterbacks watching the gasping giants and also keeping a keen eye upon each other  let the ball emerge near one of these and he will whip it up and be ten paces off before those in the maul even know that it is gone  behind them again are the halves alert and watchful while the back with his hands in his pockets has an easy consciousness that he will have plenty of warning before the ball can pass the four good men who stand between the maul and himself  now the dense throng sways a little backwards and forwards  an inch is lost and an inch is gained  the crowd roar with delight  mauled scotland  mauled england  england  scotland  the shouting would stir the blood of the mildest mortal that ever breathed kate harston stands in the carriage rosy with excitement and enjoyment her heart is all with the wearers of the rose in spite of the presence of her old playmate in the opposite ranks  the doctor is as much delighted as the youngest man on the ground and the cabman waves his arms and shouts in a highly indecorous fashion  the two pounds difference in weight is beginning to tell  the english sway back a yard or two  a blue coat emerges among the white ones  he has fought his way through but has left the ball behind him so he dashes round and puts his weight behind it once more  there is a last upheaval the maul is split in two and through the rent come the redoubtable scotch forwards with the ball amongst them  their solid phalanx has scattered the english like spray to right and left  there is no one in front of them no one but a single little man almost a boy in size and weight surely he cannot hope to stop the tremendous rush  the ball is a few yards in advance of the leading scot when he springs forward at it he seizes it an instant before his adversary and with the same motion writhes himself free from the mans grasp  now is the time for the crack cambridge quarterback to show what he is made of  the crowd yell with excitement  to right and left run the great scotch forwards grasping slipping pursuing and right in the midst of them as quick and as erratic as a trout in a pool runs the calmfaced little man dodging one avoiding another slipping between the fingers of two others  surely he is caught now  no he has passed all the forwards and emerges from the ruck of men pelting along at a tremendous pace he has dodged one of the scotch quarters and outstripped the other well played england shout the crowd  well run buller now tookey  now dimsdale  well collared dimsdale well collared indeed  the little quarterback had come to an end of his career for tom had been as quick as he and had caught him round the waist as he attempted to pass and brought him to the ground the cheers were hearty for the two halfbacks were the only university men in the team and there were hundreds of students among the spectators  the good doctor coloured up with pleasure to hear his boys name bellowed forth approvingly by a thousand excited lungs  the play is as all good judges said it would be very equal  for the first forty minutes every advantage gained by either side had been promptly neutralized by a desperate effort on the part of the other the mass of struggling players has swayed backwards and forwards but never more than twenty or thirty yards from the centre of the ground neither goal had been seriously threatened as yet  the spectators fail to see how the odds laid on england are justified but the fancy abide by their choice  in the second forty it is thought that the superior speed and staying power of the southerners will tell over the heavier scots  there seems little the matter with the latter as yet as they stand in a group wiping their grimy faces and discussing the state of the game for at the end of forty minutes the goals are changed and there is a slight interval  and now the last hour is to prove whether there are good men bred in the hungry north as any who live on more fruitful ground and beneath warmer skies  if the play was desperate before it became even more so now each member of either team played as if upon him alone depended the issue of the match  again and again grey anderson gordon and their redoubtable phalanx of dishevelled hardbreathing scots broke away with the ball but as often the english quarter and halfbacks by their superior speed more than made up for the weakness of their forwards and carried the struggle back into the enemys ground  two or three time evans the longkicker who was credited with the power of reaching the goal from almost any part of the ground got hold of the ball but each time before he could kick he was charged by some one of his adversaries  at last however his chance came  the ball trickled out of a maul into the hands of buller who at once turned and threw it to the halfback behind him  there was no time to reach him  he took a quick glance at the distant goal a short run forward and his long limb swung through the air with tremendous force  there was a dead silence of suspense among the crowd as the ball described a lofty parabola down it came down down as straight and true as an arrow just grazing the crossbar and pitching on the grass beyond and the groans of a few afflicted patriots were drowned in the hearty cheers which hailed the english goal  but the victory was not won yet  there were ten minutes left for the scotchmen to recover this blow or for the englishmen to improve upon it the northerners played so furiously that the ball was kept down near the english goal which was only saved by the splendid defensive play of their backs  five minutes passed and the scots in turn were being pressed back  a series of brilliant runs by buller jackson and evans took the fight into the enemys country and kept it there  it seemed as if the visitors meant scoring again when a sudden change occurred in the state of affairs  it was but three minutes off the calling of time when tookey one of the scotch quarterbacks got hold of the ball and made a magnificent run passing right through the opposing forwards and quarters  he was collared by evans but immediately threw the ball behind him  dimsdale had followed up the quarterback and caught the ball when it was thrown backwards  now or never  the lad felt that he would sacrifice anything to pass the three men who stood between him and the english goal  he passed evans like the wind before the halfback could disentangle himself from tookey  there were but two now to oppose him  the first was the other english halfback a broadshouldered powerful fellow who rushed at him but tom without attempting to avoid him lowered his head and drove at him full tilt with such violence that both men reeled back from the collision  dimsdale recovered himself first however and got past before the other had time to seize him the goal was now not more than twenty yards off with only one between tom and it though half a dozen more were in close pursuit  the english back caught him round the waist while another from behind seized the collar of his jersey and the three came heavily to the ground together but the deed was done  in the very act of falling he had managed to kick the ball which flickered feebly up into the air and just cleared the english bar  it had scarcely touched the ground upon the other side when the ringing of the great bell announced the termination of the match though its sound was entirely drowned by the tumultuous shouting of the crowd  a thousand hats were thrown into the air ten thousand voices joined in the roar and meanwhile the cause of all this outcry was still sitting on the ground smiling it is true but very pale and with one of his arms dangling uselessly from his shoulder  well the breaking of a collarbone is a small price to pay for the saving of such a match as that  so thought tom dimsdale as he made for the pavilion with his father keeping off the exultant crowd upon one side and jack garraway upon the other  the doctor butted a path through the dense halfcrazy mob with a vigour which showed that his sons talents in that direction were hereditary  within half an hour tom was safely ensconced in the corner of the carriage with his shoulder braced back secundum artem and his arm supported by a sling  how quietly and deftly the two women slipped a shawl here and a rug there to save him from the jarring of the carriage  it is part of the angel nature of woman that when youth and strength are maimed and helpless they appeal to her more than they can ever do in the pride and flush of their power here lies the compensation of the unfortunate  kates dark blue eyes filled with ineffable compassion as she bent over him and he catching sight of that expression felt a sudden new unaccountable spring of joy bubble up in his heart which made all previous hopes and pleasures seem vapid and meaningless  the little god shoots hard and straight when his mark is still in the golden dawn of life  all the way back he lay with his head among the cushions dreaming of ministering angels his whole soul steeped in quiet contentment as it dwelt upon the sweet earnest eyes which had looked so tenderly into his  it had been an eventful day with the student  he had saved his side he had broken his collarbone and now most serious of all he had realized that he was hopelessly in love    chapter viii   a first professional  within a few weeks of his recovery from his accident tom dimsdale was to go up for his first professional examination and his father who had now retired from practice with a fair fortune remained in edinburgh until that event should come off  there had been some difficulty in persuading girdlestone to give his consent to this prolongation of his wards leave but the old merchant was very much engrossed with his own affairs about that time which made him more amenable than he might otherwise have been  the two travellers continued therefore to reside in their princes street hotel but the student held on to his lodgings in howe street where he used to read during the morning and afternoon every evening however he managed to dine at the royal and would stay there until his father packed him off to his books once more it was in vain for him to protest and to plead for another halfhour the physician was inexorable  when the fated hour came round the unhappy youth slowly gathered together his hat his gloves and his stick spreading out that operation over the greatest possible extent of time which it could by any means be made to occupy  he would then ruefully bid his kinsfolk adieu and retire rebelliously to his books  very soon however he made a discovery  from a certain seat in the princes street gardens it was possible to see the interior of the sittingroom in which the visitors remained after dinner  from the time when this fact dawned upon him his rooms in the evening knew him no more  the gardens were locked at night but that was a mere trifle he used to scramble over the railings like a cat and then planting himself upon the particular seat he would keep a watch upon the hotel window until the occupants of the room retired to rest  it might happen that his cousin remained invisible  then he would return to his rooms in a highly dissatisfied state and sit up half the night protesting against fate and smoking strong black tobacco  on the other hand if he had the good luck to see the graceful figure of his old playfellow he felt that that was the next best thing to being actually in her company and departed eventually in a more contented frame of mind  thus when dr dimsdale fondly imagined his son to be a mile away grappling with the mysteries of science that undutiful lad was in reality perched within sixty yards of him with his thoughts engrossed by very different matters  kate could not fail to understand what was going on  however young and innocent a girl may be there is always some subtle feminine instinct which warns her that she is loved  then first she realizes that she has passed the shadowy frontier line which divides the childlife from that of the woman  kate felt uneasy and perplexed and half involuntarily she changed her manner towards him  it had been frank and sisterly now it became more distant and constrained  he was quick to observe the change and in private raved and raged at it  he even made the mistake of showing his pique to her upon which she became still more retiring and conventional  then be bemoaned himself in the sleepless watches of the night and confided to his bedpost that in his belief such a case had never occurred before in the history of the world and never by any chance could or would happen again  he also broke out into an eruption of bad verses which were found by his landlady during her daily examination of his private papers and were read aloud to a select audience of neighbours who were all much impressed and cackled sympathetically among themselves  by degrees tom developed other symptoms of the distemper which had come upon him so suddenly  he had always been remarkable for a certain towsiness of appearance and carelessness of dress which harmonized with his bohemian habits  all this he suddenly abjured  one fine morning he paid successive visits to his tailor his bootmaker his hatter and his hosier which left all those worthy tradesmen rubbing their hands with satisfaction  about a week afterwards he emerged from his rooms in a state of gorgeousness which impressed his landlady and amazed his friends  his old college companions hardly recognized toms honest phiz as it looked out above the most fashionable of coats and under the glossiest of hats  his father was anything but edified by the change  i dont know whats coming over the lad kate he remarked after one of his visits  if i thought he was going to turn to a fop by the lord harry id disown him  dont you notice a change in him yourself  kate managed to evade the question but her bright blush might have opened the old mans eyes had he observed it  he hardly realized yet that his son really was a man and still less did he think of john harstons little girl as a woman  it is generally some comparative stranger who first makes that discovery and brings it home to friends and relatives  love has an awkward way of intruding itself at inconvenient times but it never came more inopportunely than when it smote one who was reading for his first professional examination  during these weeks when tom was stumping about in boots which were two sizes too small for him in the hope of making his muscular wellformed foot a trifle more elegant and was splitting gloves in a way which surprised his glover all his energies ought by rights to have been concentrated upon the mysteries of botany chemistry and zoology  during the precious hours that should have been devoted to the mastering of the subdivisions of the celenterata or the natural orders of endogenous plants he was expending his energies in endeavouring to recall the words of the song which his cousin had sung the evening before or to recollect the exact intonation with which she remarked to him that it had been a fine day or some other equally momentous observation  it follows that as the day of the examination came round the student in his lucid intervals began to feel anxious for the result  he had known his work fairly well however at one time and with luck he might pull through  he made an energetic attempt to compress a months reading into a week and when the day for the written examination came round he had recovered some of his lost ground  the papers suited him fairly well and he felt as he left the hall that he had had better fortune than he deserved  the viva voce ordeal was the one however which he knew would be most dangerous to him and he dreaded it accordingly  it was a raw spring morning when his turn came to go up  his father and kate drove round with him to the university gates  keep up your pluck tom the old gentleman said  be cool and have all your wits about you  dont lose your head whatever you do  i seem to have forgotten the little i ever knew tom said dolefully as he trudged up the steps  as he looked back he saw kate wave her hand to him cheerily and it gave him fresh heart  we shall hope to see you at lunch time his father shouted after him mind you bring us good news as he spoke the carriage rattled away down the bridges and tom joined the knot of expectant students who were waiting at the door of the great hall  a melancholy group they were sallowfaced longvisaged and dolorous partly from the effects of a long course of study and partly from their present trepidation  it was painful to observe their attempts to appear confident and unconcerned as they glanced round the heavens as if to observe the state of the weather or examined with wellfeigned archaeological fervour the inscriptions upon the old university walls most painful of all was it when some one plucking up courage would venture upon a tiny joke at which the whole company would gibber in an ostentatious way as though to show that even in this dire pass the appreciation of humour still remained with them  at times when any of their number alluded to the examination or detailed the questions which had been propounded to brown or baker the day before the mask of unconcern would be dropped and the whole assembly would glare eagerly and silently at the speaker  generally on such occasions matters are made infinitely worse by some jobs comforter who creeps about suggesting abstruse questions and hinting that they represent some examiners particular hobby  such a one came to dimsdales elbow and quenched the last ray of hope which lingered in the young mans bosom  what do you know about cacodyl was his impressive question  cacodyl tom cried aghast  its some sort of antediluvian reptile isnt it  the questioner broke into a sickly smile  no he said  its an organic explosive chemical compound  youre sure to be asked about cacodyl  testers dead on it  he asks every one how it is prepared  tom much perturbed at these tidings was feverishly endeavouring to extract some little information from his companion concerning the compound when a bell rang abruptly inside the room and a janitor with a red face and a blue slip of paper appeared at the door  dillon dimsdale douglas this functionary shouted in a very pompous voice and three unhappy young men filed through the halfopened door into the solemn hall beyond  the scene inside was not calculated to put them at their ease  three tables half a dozen yards from each other were littered with various specimens and scientific instruments and behind each sat two elderly gentlemen sternfaced and critical  at one side were stuffed specimens of various small beasts numerous skeletons and skulls large jars containing fish and reptiles preserved in spirits of wine jawbones with great teeth which grinned savagely at the unfortunate candidate and numerous other zoological relics  the second table was heaped over with a blaze of gorgeous orchids and tropical plants which looked strangely out of place in the great bleak room  a row of microscopes bristled along the edge  the third was the most appalling of all for it was bare with the exception of several sheets of paper and a pencil chemistry was the most dangerous of the many traps set to ensnare the unwary student  dillonbotany  dimsdalezoology douglaschemistry the janitor shouted once more and the candidates moved in front of the respective tables  tom found himself facing a great spider crab which appeared to be regarding him with a most malignant expression upon its crustacean features  behind the crab sat a little professor whose projecting eyes and crooked arms gave him such a resemblance to the creature in front that the student could not help smiling  sir said a tall cleanshaven man at the other end of the table be serious  this is no time for levity  toms expression after that would have made the fortune of a mute  what is this asked the little professor handing a small round object to the candidate  it is an echinusa seaurchin tom said triumphantly  have they any circulation asked the other examiner  a water vascular system  describe it  tom started off fluently but it was no part of the policy of the examiners to allow him to waste the fifteen minutes allotted them in expatiating upon what he knew well  they interrupted him after a few sentences  how does this creature walk asked the crablike one  by means of long tubes which it projects at pleasure  how do the tubes enable the creature to walk  they have suckers on them  what are the suckers like  they are round hollow discs  are you sure they are round asked the other sharply  yes said tom stoutly though his ideas on the subject were rather vague  and how does this sucker act asked the taller examiner  tom began to feel that these two men were exhibiting a very unseemly curiosity  there seemed to be no satiating their desire for information  it creates a vacuum he cried desperately  how does it create a vacuum  by the contraction of a muscular pimple in the centre said tom in a moment of inspiration  and what makes this pimple contract  tom lost his head and was about to say electricity when he happily checked himself and substituted muscular action  very good said the examiners and the student breathed again  the taller one returned to the charge however with and this muscleis it composed of striped fibres or nonstriped  nonstriped shrieked tom at a venture and both examiners rubbed their hands and murmured very good indeed at which toms hair began to lie a little flatter and he ceased to feel as if he were in a turkish bath  how many teeth has a rabbit the tall man asked suddenly  i dont know the student answered with candour  the two looked triumphantly at one another  he doesnt know cried the goggleeyed one decisively  i should recommend you to count them the next time you have one for dinner the other remarked  as this was evidently meant for a joke tom had the tact to laugh and a very gruesome and aweinspiring laugh it was too  then the candidate was badgered about the pterodactyl and concerning the difference in anatomy between a bat and a bird and about the lamprey and the cartilaginous fishes and the amphioxus  all these questions he answered more or less to the satisfaction of the examinersgenerally less  when at last the little bell tinkled which was the sign for candidates to move on to other tables the taller man leaned over a list in front of him and marked down upon it the following hieroglyphic                     s b  this toms sharp eye at once detected and he departed well pleased for he knew that the s b meant satis bene and as to the minus sign after it it mattered little to him whether he had done rather more than well or rather less  he had passed in zoology and that was all which concerned him at present    chapter ix   a nasty cropper  but there were pitfalls ahead  as he moved to the botany table a greybearded examiner waved his hand in the direction of the row of microscopes as an intimation that the student was to look through them and pronounce upon what he saw  tom seemed to compress his whole soul into his one eye as he glared hopelessly through the tube at what appeared to him to resemble nothing so much as a sheet of ice with the marks of skates upon it  come along come along the examiner growled impatiently  courtesy is conspicuous by its absence in most of the edinburgh examinations you must pass on to the next one unless you can offer an opinion  this venerable teacher of botany though naturally a kindhearted man was well known as one of the most malignant species of examiners one of the school which considers such an ordeal in the light of a trial of strength between their pupils and themselves  in his eyes the candidate was endeavouring to pass and his duty was to endeavour to prevent him a result which in a large proportion of cases he successfully accomplished  hurry on hurry on he reiterated fussily  its a section of a leaf said the student  its nothing of the sort the examiner shouted exultantly youve made a bad mistake sir a very bad one indeed  its the spirilloe of a water plant  move on to the next  tom in much perturbation of mind shuffled down the line and looked through the next brazen tube  this is a preparation of stomata he said recognizing it from a print in his book on botany  the professor shook his head despondingly  you are right he said pass on to the next  the third preparation was as puzzling to the student as the first had been and he was steeling himself to meet the inevitable when an unexpected circumstance turned the scale in his favour  it chanced that the other examiner being somewhat less of a fossil than his confreres and having still vitality enough to take an interest in things which were foreign to his subject had recognized the student as being the young hero who had damaged himself in upholding the honour of his country  being an ardent patriot himself his heart warmed towards tom and perceiving the imminent peril in which he stood he interfered in his behalf and by a few leading questions got him on safer ground and managed to keep him there until the little bell tinkled once more the younger examiner showed remarkable tact in feeling his way and keeping within the very limited area of the students knowledge  he succeeded so well however that although his colleague shook his hoary head and intimated in other ways his poor opinion of the candidates acquirements he was forced to put down another s b upon the paper in front of him  the student drew a long breath when he saw it and marched across to the other table with a mixture of trepidation and confidence like a jockey riding at the last and highest hurdle in a steeplechase  alas it is the last hurdle which often floors the rider and thomas too was doomed to find the final ordeal an insurmountable one  as he crossed the room some evil chance made him think of the gossip outside and of his allusion to the abstruse substance known as cacodyl once let a candidates mind hit upon such an idea as this and nothing will ever get it out of his thoughts  tom felt his head buzz round and he passed his hand over his forehead and through his curly yellow hair to steady himself  he felt a frenzied impulse as he sat down to inform the examiners that he knew very well what they were going to ask him and that it was hopeless for him to attempt to answer it  the leading professor was a ruddyfaced benevolent old gentleman with spectacles and a kindly manner  he made a few commonplace remarks to his colleagues with the goodnatured intention of giving the confusedlooking student before him time to compose himself then turning blandly towards him he said in the mildest of tones  have you ever rowed in a pond  tom acknowledged that he had  perhaps on those occasions the examiner continued you may have chanced to touch the mud at the bottom with your oar  tom agreed that it was possible  in that case you may have observed that a large bubble or a succession of them has risen from the bottom to the surface  now of what gas was that bubble composed  the unhappy student with the one idea always fermenting on his brain felt that the worst had come upon him  without a moments hesitation or thought he expressed his conviction that the compound was cacodyl  never did two men look more surprised and never did two generally grave savants laugh more heartily than did the two examiners when they realized what the candidate had answered  their mirth speedily brought him back to his senses  he saw with a feeling of despair that it was marsh gas which they had expectedone of the simplest and commonest of chemical combinations  alas it was too late now  he knew full well that nothing could save him  with poor marks in botany and zoology such an error in chemistry was irreparable  he did what was perhaps the best thing under the circumstances  rising from his chair he made a respectful bow to the examiners and walked straight out of the roomto the great astonishment of the janitor who had never before witnessed such a breach of decorum  as the student closed the door behind him he looked back and saw that the other professors had left their respective tables and were listening to an account of the incident from one of the chemistsand a roar of laughter the moment afterwards showed that they appreciated the humour of it  his fellowstudents gathered round tom outside in the hope of sharing in the joke but he pushed them angrily aside and strode through the midst of them and down the university steps  he knew that the story would spread fast enough without his assistance  his mind was busy too in shaping a certain resolution which he had often thought over during the last few months  the two old people and miss kate harston waited long and anxiously in their sittingroom at the hotel for some news of the absentee  the doctor had at first attempted a lofty cynicism and general assumption of indifference which rapidly broke down as the time went by until at last he was wandering round the room drumming upon the furniture with his fingers and showing every other sign of acute impatience the window was on the first floor and kate had been stationed there as a sentinel to watch the passing crowd and signal the first sign of tidings  cant you see him yet the doctor asked for the twentieth time  no dear i dont she answered glancing up and down the street  he must be out now  he should have come straight to us  come away from the window my dear  we must not let the young monkey see how anxious we are about him  kate sat down by the old man and stroked his broad brown hand with her tender white one  dont be uneasy dear she said its sure to be all right  yes he is sure to pass the doctor answered butbless my soul whos this  the individual who caused this exclamation was a very broadfaced and rosycheeked little girl coarsely clad with a pile of books and a slate under her arm who had suddenly entered the apartment  please sir said this apparition with a bob im sarah jane  are you indeed said the doctor with mild irony  and what dye want here sarah jane  please sir my mithar mrs mctavish asked me if i wudna gie ye this letter frae the gentleman whats lodgin wi her  with these words the little mite delivered her missive and having given another bob departed upon her ways  why the doctor cried in astonishment its directed to me and in toms writing  what can be the meaning of this  oh dear oh dear mrs dimsdale cried with the quick perception of womanhood it means that he has failed  impossible said the doctor fumbling with nervous fingers at the envelope  by jove though he continued as he glanced over the contents youre right  he has  poor lad hes more cut up about it than we can be so we must not blame him  the good physician read the letter over several times before he finally put it away in his notebook and he did so with a thoughtful face which showed that it was of importance  as it has an influence upon the future course of our story we cannot end the chapter better than by exercising our literary privilege and peeping over the doctors shoulder before he has folded it up  this is the epistle in extenso       my dear father       you will be sorry to hear that i have failed in my exam       i am very cut up about it because i fear that it will       cause you grief and disappointment and you deserve       neither the one nor the other at my hands       it is not an unmixed misfortune to me because it helps       me to make a request which i have long had in my mind       i wish you to allow me to give up the study of medicine       and to go in for commerce  you have never made a secret       of our money affairs to me and i know that if i took my       degree there would never be any necessity for me to practise       i should therefore have spent five years of my life in       acquiring knowledge which would not be of any immediate       use to me  i have no personal inclination towards medicine       while i have a very strong objection to simply living in the       world upon money which other men have earned  i must therefore       turn to some fresh pursuit for my future career and surely it       would be best that i should do so at once  what that fresh       pursuit is to be i leave to your judgment  personally i think       that if i embarked my capital in some commercial undertaking       i might by sticking to my work do well  i feel too much cast       down at my own failure to see you tonight but tomorrow i hope       to hear what you think from your own lips                                                   tom  perhaps this failure will do no harm after all the doctor muttered thoughtfully as he folded up the letter and gazed out at the cold glare of the northern sunset    chapter x   dwellers in bohemia  the residence of major tobias clutterbuck late of the 119th light infantry was not known to any of his friends  it is true that at times he alluded in a modest way to his little place and even went to the length of remarking airily to new acquaintances that he hoped they would look him up any time they happened to be in his direction  as he carefully refrained however from ever giving the slightest indication of which direction that might be his invitations never led to any practical results  still they had the effect of filling the recipient with a vague sense of proffered hospitality and occasionally led to more substantial kindness in return  the gallant majors figure was a familiar one in the cardroom of the rag and bobtail at the bowwindow of the jeunesse doree  tall and pompous with a portly frame and a puffy cleanshaven face which peered over an abnormally high collar and oldfashioned linen cravat he stood as a very type and emblem of staid middleaged respectability the majors hat was always of the glossiest the majors coat was without a wrinkle and in short from the summit of the majors bald head to his bulbous fingertips and his gouty toes there was not a flaw which the most severe critic of deportmenteven the illustrious turveydrop himselfcould have detected  let us add that the conversation of the major was as irreproachable as his personthat he was a distinguished soldier and an accomplished traveller with a retentive memory and a mind stuffed with the good things of a lifetime  combine all these qualities and one would naturally regard the major as a most desirable acquaintance  it is painful to have to remark however that selfevident as this proposition might appear it was vehemently contradicted by some of the initiated  there were rumours concerning the major which seriously compromised his private character  indeed such a pitch had they reached that when that gallant officer put himself forward as a candidate for a certain select club he had although proposed by a lord and seconded by a baronet been most ignominiously pilled  in public the major affected to laugh over this social failure and to regard it as somewhat in the nature of a practical joke but privately he was deeply incensed  one day he momentarily dropped his veil of unconcern while playing billiards with the honourable fungus brown who was generally credited with having had some hand in the majors exclusion be ged sir the veteran suddenly exclaimed inflating his chest and turning his apoplectic face upon his companion in the old days i would have called the lot of you out sir every demned one beginning with the committee and working down i would be george  at which savage attack the honourable funguss face grew as white as the majors was red and he began to wish that he had been more reserved in his confidences to some of his acquaintances respecting the exclusiveness of the club in question or at least refrained from holding up the majors pilling as a proof thereof  the cause of this vague feeling of distrust which had gone abroad concerning the old soldier was no very easy matter to define  it is true that he was known to have a book on every race and to have secret means of information from studgrooms and jockeys which occasionally stood him in good stead but this was no uncommon thing among the men with whom he consorted  again it is true that major clutterbuck was much addicted to whist with guinea points and to billiard matches for substantial sums but these stimulating recreations are also habitual to many men who have led eventful lives and require a strong seasoning to make ordinary existence endurable  perhaps one reason may have been that the majors billiard play in public varied to an extraordinary degree so that on different occasions he had appeared to be aiming at the process termed by the initiated getting on the money  the warm friendships too which the old soldier had contracted with sundry vacuous and sappy youths who were kindly piloted by him into quasifashionable life and shown how and when to spend their money had been most uncharitably commented upon  perhaps the vagueness about the majors private residence and the mystery which hung over him outside his clubs may also have excited prejudice against him  still however his detractors might malign him they could not attempt to deny the fact that tobias clutterbuck was the third son of the honourable charles clutterbuck who again was the second son of the earl of dunross one of the most ancient of hibernian families  this pedigree the old soldier took care to explain to every one about him more particularly to the sappy youths aforementioned  it chanced that on the afternoon of which we speak the major was engrossed by this very subject  standing at the head of the broad stone steps which lead up to the palatial edifice which its occupiers irreverently term the rag and bobtail he was explaining to a bullnecked olivecomplexioned young man the series of marriages and intermarriages which had culminated in the production of his own portly stiffbacked figure  his companion who was none other than ezra girdlestone of the great african firm of that name leaned against one of the pillars of the portico and listened gloomily to the majors family reminiscences giving an occasional yawn which he made no attempt to conceal  its as plain as the fingers of me hand the old soldier said in a wheezy muffled brogue as if he were speaking from under a featherbed see here now girdlestonethis is miss letitia snackles of snackleton a cousin of old sir joseph  the major tapped his thumb with the silver head of his walkingstick to represent the maiden snackles  she marries crawford of the bluesone o the warwickshire crawfords thats himhere he elevated his stubby forefinger and heres their three children jemima harold and john  up went three other fingers jemima crawford grows up and then charley clutterbuck runs away with her  this other thumb o mine will stand for that young divil charley and then me fingers  oh hang your fingers girdlestone exclaimed with emphasis its very interesting major but it would be more intelligible if you wrote it out  and so i shall me boy the major cried enthusiastically by no means abashed at the sudden interruption  ill draw it up on a bit o foolscap paper  lets see fenchurch street eh  address to the offices of course  though for that matter girdlestone london would foind you  i was spakin of ye to sir musgrave moore of the rifles the other day and he knew you at once  girdlestone says he the same says i  a merchant prince says he  the same says i id be proud to meet him says he  and you shall says i  hes the best blood of county waterford  more blood than money i suppose the young man said smoothing out his crisp black moustache  bedad youve about hit it there  he went to california and came back with five and twinty thousand pounds  i met him in liverpool the day he arrived  this is no good to me toby says he  why not i asks not enough says he just enough to unsettle me  what then says i  put it on the favourite for the st leger says he  and he did too every pinny of it and the horse was beat on the post by a short head  he dropped the lot in one day  a fact sir pon me honour came to me next day  nothing left says he  nothing says i only one thing says he  suicide says i  marriage says he within a month he was married to the second miss shuttleworth who had five thou in her own right and five more when lord dungeness turns up his toes  indeed said his companion languidly  fact pon me honour by the wayah here comes lord henry richardson how dye do richardson how dye do  ged i remember richardson when he was a towheaded boy at clongowes and i used to lam him with a bootjack for his cheek  ah yes i was going to sayit seems a demned awkward incidentha haridiculous but annoying you know  the fact is me boy coming away in a hurry from me little place i left me purse on the drawers in the bedroom and heres jorrocks up in the billiardroom afther challenging me to play for a tennerbut i wont without having the money in me pocket  tobias clutterbuck may be poor me dear friend butand here he puffed out his chest and tapped on it with his round spongelike fisthes honest and pays debts of honour on the nail  no sir theres no one can say a word against tobias except that hes a halfpay old fool with more heart than brains  however he added suddenly dropping the sentimental and coming back to the practical if you me dear boy can obloige me with the money until tomorrow morning ill play jorrocks with pleasure theres not many men that id ask such a favour of and even from you id never accept anything more than a mere timporary convanience  you may stake your life on that ezra girdlestone said with a sneer looking sullenly down and tracing figures with the end of his stick on the stone steps  youll never get the chance  i make it a rule never to lend any one money either for short or long periods  and you wont let me have this throifling accommodation  no the young man said decisively  for a moment the majors brickcoloured weatherbeaten face assumed an even darker tint and his small dark eyes looked out angrily from under his shaggy brows at his youthful companion  he managed to suppress the threatened explosion however and burst into a loud roar of laughter  pon me sowl he wheezed poking the young man in the ribs with his stick an implement which he had grasped a moment before as though he meditated putting it to a less pacific use you young divils of businessmen are too much for poor old tobias  ged sir to think of being stuck in the mud for the want of a paltry tenner  tommy heathcote will laugh when he hears of it  you know tommy of the 81st  he gave me good advice always sew a fiftypound note into the lining of each waistcoat youve got  then you cant go short  tried it once and be george if me demned manservant didnt stale that very waistcoat and sell it for six and sixpence  youre not going are you  yes im due in the city  the governor leaves at four  goodbye shall i see you tonight  cardroom as per usual quoth the cleanshaven warrior  he looked after the retreating figure of his late companion with anything but a pleasant expression upon his face  the young man happened to glance round as he was halfway down the street on which the major smiled after him paternally and gave a merry flourish with his stick  as the old soldier stood on the top of the club steps pompous pigeonchested and respectable posing himself as though he had been placed there for the inspection of passersby as a sample of the aristocracy within he made several attempts to air his grievances to passing members touching the question of the expectant jorrocks and the missing purse  beyond however eliciting many sallies of wit from the younger spirits for it was part of the majors policy to lay himself open to be a butt his laudable perseverance was entirely thrown away at last he gave it up in disgust and raising his stick hailed a passing bus into which he sprang taking a searching glance round to see that no one was following him  after a drive which brought him to the other side of the city he got out in a broad busy thoroughfare lined with large shops  a narrow turning from the main artery led into a long dingy street consisting of very high smokecoloured houses which ran parallel to the other and presented as great a contrast to it as the back of a painting does to the front  down this sombre avenue the major strutted with all his wonted pomposity until about halfway down he reached a tall grimlooking house with many notices of apartments glaring from the windows  the line of railings which separated this house from the street was rusty and broken and the whole place had a flavour of mildew the major walked briskly up the stone steps hollowed out by the feet of generations of lodgers and pushing open the great splotchy door which bore upon it a brass plate indicating that the establishment was kept by a mrs robins he walked into the hall with the air of one who treads familiar ground  up one flight of stairs up two flights of stairs and up three flights of stairs did he climb until on the fourth landing he pushed open a door and found himself in a small room which formed for the nonce the little place about which he was wont at the club to make depreciatory allusions so skilfully introduced that the listener was left in doubt as to whether the major was the happy possessor of a country house and grounds or whether he merely owned a large suburban villa  even this modest sanctum was not entirely the majors own as was shown by the presence of a ruddyfaced man with a long tawny beard who sat on one side of the empty fireplace puffing at a great chinabowled pipe and comporting himself with an ease which showed that he was no casual visitor  as the other entered the man in the chair gave vent to a guttural grunt without removing the mouthpiece of his pipe from between his lips and major clutterbuck returned the greeting with an offhanded nod his next proceeding was to take off his glossy hat and pack it away in a hatbox  he then removed his coat his collar his tie and his gaiters with equal solicitude and put them in a place of safety after which he donned a long purple dressinggown and a smokingcap in which garb he performed the first steps of a mazurka as a sign of the additional ease which he experienced  not much to dance about either me boy the old soldier said seating himself in a campchair and putting his feet upon another one bedad were all on the verge  unless luck takes a turn theres no saying what may become of us  we have been badder than this before now many a time said the yellowbearded man in an accent which proclaimed him to be a german my money vill come or you vill vin or something vill arrive to set all things right  lets hope so the major said fervently  its a mercy to get out of these stiff and starched clothes  but i have to be careful of them for me tailorbad cess to himwill give no credit and theres little of the riddy knocking about  without good clothes on me back id be like a sweeper without a broom  the german nodded his intense appreciation of the fact and puffed a great blue cloud to the ceiling  sigismond von baumser was a political refugee from the fatherland who had managed to become foreign clerk in a small london firm an occupation which just enabled him to keep body and soul together  he and the major had lodged in different rooms in another establishment until some common leaven of bohemianism had brought them together  when circumstances had driven them out of their former abode it had occurred to the major that by sharing his rooms with von baumser he would diminish his own expenses and at the same time secure an agreeable companion for the veteran was a sociable soul in his unofficial hours and had all the hibernian dislike to solitude the arrangement commended itself to the german for he had a profound admiration for the others versatile talents and varied experiences so he grunted an acquiescence and the thing was done  when the majors luck was good there were brave times in the little fourth floor back on the other hand if any slice of good fortune came in the germans way the major had a fair share of the prosperity  during the hard times which intervened between these gleams of opulence the pair roughed it uncomplainingly as best they might  the major would sometimes create a fictitious splendour by dilating upon the beauties of castle dunross in county mayo which is the headquarters of all the clutterbucks  well go and live there some day me boy he would say slapping his comrade on the back  it will be mine from the dungeons forty foot below the ground right up bedad to the flagstaff from which the imblem of loyalty flaunts the breeze  at these speeches the simpleminded german used to rub his great red hands together with satisfaction and feel as pleased as though he had actually been presented with the fee simple of the castle in question  have you had your letter the major asked with  interest rolling a cigarette between his fingers  the german was expecting his quarterly remittance from his friends at home and they were both anxiously awaiting it  von baumser shook his head  bad luck to them they should have sent a wake ago  you should do what jimmy towler did  you didnt know towler of the sappers  when he and i were souldiering in canada he was vexed at the allowance which he had from ould sir oliver his uncle not turning up at the right time ged toby he says to me ill warm the old rascal up  so he sits down and writes a letter to his uncle in which he told him his unbusinesslike ways would be the ruin of them and more to the same effect  when sir oliver got the letter he was in such a divils own rage that while he was dictating a codicil to his will he tumbled off the chair in a fit and jimmy came in for a clean siven thousand a year  dat was more dan he deserved the german remarked  but youhow do you stand for money  major clutterbuck took ten sovereigns out of his trouser pocket and placed them upon the table  you know me law he said i never on any consideration break into these  you cant sit down to play cards for high stakes with less in your purse and if i was to change one be george theyd all go like a whiff o smoke  the lord knows when id get a start again then  bar this money ive hardly a pinny  nor me said von baumser despondently slapping his pockets  niver mind me boy  whats in the common purse i wonder  he looked up at a little leather bag which hung from a brass nail on the wall  in flush times they were wont to deposit small sums in this on which they might fall back in their hours of need  not much i fear the other said shaking his head  well now we want something to pull us together on a dull day like this  suppose we send out for a bottle of sparkling eh  not enough money the other objected  well well lets have something cheaper  beaune now beaunes a good comforting sort of drink  what dye say to splitting a bottle of beaune and paying for it from the common purse  not enough money the other persisted doggedly  well claret be it sighed the major  maybe its better in this sort of weather  let us send susan out for a bottle of claret  the german took down the little leather bag and turned it upside down a threepennypiece and a penny rolled out  dats all he said not enough for claret  but there is for beer cried the major radiantly  bedad its just the time for a quart of fourpinny  i remimber ould gilder when he was our chief in india used to say that a man who got beyond enjoying beer and a clay pipe at a pinch was either an ass or a coxcomb  he smoked a clay at the mess table himself  draper who commanded the division told him it was unsoldierlike  unsoldierlike be demned he said ged they nearly courtmartialled the ould man for it  he got the vc at the quarries and was killed at the redan  a slatternly slipshod girl answered the bell and having received her orders and the united available funds of the two comrades speedily returned with a brace of frothing pint pots  the major ruminated silently over his cigarette for some time on some unpleasant subject apparently for his face was stem and his brows knitted  at last he broke out with an oath  be george baumser i cant stand that young fellow girdlestone ill have to chuck him up  hes such a coldblooded flintyhearted calculating sort of a chap that  the remainder of the majors sentence was lost in the beer flagon  what for did you make him your friend then  well the old soldier confessed it seemed to me that if he wanted to fool his money away at cards or any other divilment tobias clutterbuck might as well have the handling of it as any one else bedad hes as cunning as a basketful of monkeys  he plays a safe game for low stakes and never throws away a chance  demned if i dont think ive been a loser in pocket by knowing him while as to me character im very sure im the worse there  vats de matter mit him  whats not the matter with him   if hes agrayable hes not natural and if hes natural hes not agrayable  i dont pretind to be a saint ive seen some fun in me day and hope to see some more before i die but there are some things that i wouldnt do  if i live be cards its all fair and aboveboard  i never play anything but games o skill and i reckon on me skill bringing me out on the right side taking one night with another through the year  again at billiards i may not always play me best but thats gineralship  you dont want a whole room to know to a point what your game is  im the last man to preach but bedad i dont like that chap and i dont like that handsome brazen face of his  ive spint the greater part of my life reading folks faces and never very far out either  von baumser made no remark and the two continued to smoke silently with an occasional pull at their flagons  besides its no good to me socially the major continued the fellow cant keep quiet else he might pass in a crowd but that demned commercial instinct will show itself  if he went to heaven hed start an agency for harps and crowns  did i tell you what the honourable jack gibbs said to me at the club  ged he let me have it straight  buck he said i dont mind you  youre one o the right sort when alls said and done but if you ever inthroduce such a chap as that to me again ill cut you as well as him for the future id inthroduced them to put the young spalpeen in a good humour for being short as ye know i thought it might be necessary to negotiate a loan from him  vat did you say his name vas von baumser asked suddenly  girdlestone  is his father a kauffmann  what the divil is a kauffmann the major asked impatiently  is it a merchant you mean  ah a merchant  one who trades with the afrikaner  the same  von baumser took a bulky pocketbook from his inside pocket and scanned a long list of names therein  ah it is the same he cried at last triumphantly shutting up the book and replacing it  girdlestone  co african kaufdat is merchantsfenchurch street city  those are they  and you say dey are rich  yes  very rich  yes  the major began to think that his companion had been imbibing in his absence for there was an unfathomable smile upon his face and his red beard and towsy hair seemed to bristle from some internal excitement  very rich ho ho  very rich he laughed  i know dem not as friends gott bewahre but i know dem and their affairs  what are you driving at  lets have it  out with it man  i tell you said the german suddenly becoming supernaturally solemn and sawing his hand up and down in the air to emphasize his remarks in tree or four months or a year at the most there vill be no firm of girdlestone  they are rotten uselesswhoo  he blew an imaginary feather up into the air to demonstrate the extreme fragility of the house in question  youre raving baumser said major clutterbuck excitedly  why man their names are above suspicion  they are looked upon as the soundest concern in the city  dat may be dat may be the german answered stolidly  vat i know i know and vat i say i say  and how dye know it  dye tell me that you know lore about it than the men on change and the firms that do business with them  i know vat i know and i say vat i say the other repeated dat tobaccoman burger is a rogue  dere is fiveandthirty in the hundred of water in this canaster tobacco and one must be for ever relighting  and you wont tell me where you heard this of the girdlestones  it vould be no good to you  it is enough dat vat i say is certain let it suffice that dere are people vat are bound to tell other people all dat dey know about anything whatever  you dont make it over clear now the old soldier grumbled  you mane that these secret societies and socialists let each other know all that comes in their way and have their own means of getting information  dat may be and dat may not be the german answered in the same oracular voice  i thought in any case my good friend clutterbuck dat i vould give you vat you call in english the straight tap  it is always vell to have the straight tap  thank ye me boy the major said heartily  if the firms in a bad way either the youngster doesnt know of it or else hes the most natural actor that ever lived  be george theres the taybell lets get down before the bread and butther is all finished  mrs robbins was in the habit of furnishing her lodgers with an evening meal at a small sum per head  there was only a certain amount of bread and butter supplied for this however and those who came late were likely to find an empty platter  the two bohemians felt that the subject was too grave a one to trifle with so they suspended their judgment upon the girdlestones while they clattered down to the diningroom    chapter xi   senior and junior  although not a whisper had been heard of it in ordinary commercial circles there was some foundation for the forecast which von baumser had made as to the fate of the great house of girdlestone  for some time back matters had been going badly with the african traders  if the shrewd eyes of major tobias clutterbuck were unable to detect any indications of this state of affairs in the manner or conversation of the junior partner the reason simply was that that gentleman was entirely ignorant of the imminent danger which hung over his head  as far as he knew the concern was as prosperous and as flourishing as it had been at the time of the death of john harston  the momentous secret was locked in the breast of his grim old father who bore it about with him as the spartan lad did the foxwithout a quiver or groan to indicate the care which was gnawing at his heart  placed face to face with ruin girdlestone fought against it desperately and withal coolly and warily throwing away no chance and leaving no stone unturned  above all he exerted himselfand exerted himself successfullyto prevent any rumour of the critical position of the firm from leaking out in the city  he knew well that should that once occur nothing could save him  as the wounded buffalo is gored to death by the herd so the crippled man of business may give up all hope when once his position is known by his fellows   at present although von baumser and a few other such ishmaelites might have an inkling from sources of their own as to how matters stood the name of girdlestone was still regarded by business men as the very synonym for commercial integrity and stability  if anything there seemed to be more business in fenchurch street and more luxury at the residence at eccleston square than in former days  only the sternfaced and silent senior partner knew how thin the veneer was which shone so deceptively upon the surface  many things had contributed towards this state of affairs  the firm had been involved in a succession of misfortunes some known to the world and others known to no one save the elder girdlestone  the former had been accepted with such perfect stoicism and cheerfulness that they rather increased than diminished the reputation of the concern the latter were the more crushing and also the more difficult to bear  lines of fine vessels from liverpool and from hamburg were running to the west coast of africa and competition had cut down freightage to the lowest possible point  where the girdlestones had once held almost a monopoly there were now many in the field  again the negroes of the coast were becoming educated and had a keen eye to business so that the old profits were no longer obtainable  the days had gone by when flintlock guns and manchester prints could be weighed in the balance against ivory and gold dust  while these general causes were at work a special misfortune had befallen the house of girdlestone  finding that their fleet of old sailing vessels was too slow and clumsy to compete with more modern ships they had bought in two firstrate steamers  one was the providence a fine screw vessel of twelve hundred tons and the other was the evening star somewhat smaller in size but both classed a1 at lloyds  the former cost twentytwo thousand pounds and the latter seventeen thousand  now mr girdlestone had always had a weakness for petty savings and in this instance he determined not to insure his new vessels  if the crazy old tubs for which he had paid fancy premiums for so many years with an eye to an ultimate profit met with no disaster surely those new powerful clippers were safe  with their tonnage and horsepower they appeared to him to be superior to all the dangers of the deep  it chanced however by that strange luck which would almost make one believe that matters nautical were at the mercy of some particularly malignant demon that as the evening star was steaming up channel in a dense fog on her return from her second voyage she ran right into the providence which had started that very morning from liverpool upon her third outward trip  the providence was almost cut in two and sank within five minutes taking down the captain and six of the crew while the evening star was so much damaged about the bows that she put into falmouth in a sinking condition  that days work cost the african firm more than five and thirty thousand pounds  other mishaps had occurred to weaken the firm apart from their trade with the coast  the senior partner had engaged in speculation without the knowledge of his son and the result had been disastrous  one of the cornish tin mines in which he had sunk a large amount of money and which had hitherto yielded him a handsome return became suddenly exhausted and the shares went down to zero  no firm could stand against such a run of bad luck and the african trading company reeled before it   john girdlestone had not said a word yet of all this to his son as claims arose he settled them in the best manner he could and postponed the inevitable day when he should have to give a true account of their financial position  he hoped against hope that the chapter of accidents or the arrival of some brilliant cargoes from the coast might set the concern on its legs again  from day to day he had been expecting news of one of his vessels at last one morning he found a telegram awaiting him at the office he tore it eagerly open for it bore the madeira mark  it was from his agent jose alveciras and announced that the voyage from which he had hoped so much had been a total failure  the cargo was hardly sufficient to defray the working expenses  as the merchant read it his head dropped over the table and he groaned aloud  another of the props which upheld him from ruin had snapped beneath him  there were three letters lying beside the telegram  he glanced through them but there was no consolation in any of them  one was from a bank manager informing him that his account was somewhat overdrawn another from lloyds insurance agency pointing out that the policies on two of his vessels would lapse unless paid within a certain date the clouds were gathering very darkly over the african firm yet the old man bore up against misfortune with dauntless courage  he sat alone in his little room with his head sunk upon his breast and his thatched eyebrows drawn down over his keen grey eyes  it was clear to him that the time had come when he must enlighten his son as to the true state of their affairs  with his cooperation he might carry out a plan which had been maturing some months in his brain  it was a hard task for the proud and austere merchant to be compelled to confess to his son that he had speculated without his knowledge in the capital of the company and that a large part of that capital had disappeared  these speculations in many instances had promised large returns and john girdlestone had withdrawn money from safer concerns and reinvested it in the hope of getting a higher rate of interest he had done this with his eyes open to the risk and knowing that his son was of too practical and cautious a nature to embark in such commercial gambling he had never consulted him upon the point nor had he made any entry of the money so invested in the accounts of the firm hence ezra was entirely ignorant of the danger which hung over them and his father saw that in order to secure his energetic assistance in the stroke which he was contemplating it was absolutely necessary that he should know how critical their position was  the old man had hardly come to this conclusion when he heard the sharp footfall of his son in the outer office and the harsh tones of his voice as he addressed the clerks  a moment or two later the green baize door flew open and the young man came in throwing his hat and coat down on one of the chairs  it was evident that something had ruffled his temper  goodmorning he said brusquely nodding his head to his father  goodmorning ezra the merchant answered meekly  whats the matter with you father his son asked looking at him keenly  you dont look yourself and havent for some time back  business worries my boy business worries john girdlestone answered wearily  its the infernal atmosphere of this place ezra said impatiently i feel it myself sometimes  i wonder you dont start a little country seat with some grounds  just enough to ask a fellow to shoot over and with a good billiard board and every convenience of that sort it would do for us to spend the time from saturday to monday and allow us to get some fresh air into our lungs  there are plenty of men who cant afford it half as well and yet have something of the sort whats the use of having a good balance at your bankers if you dont live better than your neighbours  there is only one objection to it the merchant said huskily and with a forced laugh i have not got a good balance at the bankers  pretty fair pretty fair his son said knowingly picking up the long thin volume in which the finance of the firm was recorded and tapping it against the table  but the figures there are not quite correct ezra his father said still more huskily  we have not got nearly so much as that  what roared the junior partner  hush  for gods sake dont let the clerks hear you  we have not so much as that  we have very little  in fact ezra we have next to nothing in the bank  it is all gone  for a moment the young man stood motionless glaring at his father the expression of incredulity which had appeared on his features faded away before the earnestness of the other and was replaced by a look of such malignant passion that it contorted his whole face  you fool he shrieked springing forward with the book upraised as though he would have struck the old merchant  i see it now  you have been speculating on your own hook you cursed ass  what have you done with it  he seized his father by the collar and shook him furiously in his wrath  keep your hands off me the senior partner cried wrenching himself free from his sons grasp  i did my best with the money  how dare you address me so  did your best hissed ezra hurling the ledger down on the table with a crash  what did you mean by speculating without my knowledge and telling me at the same time that i knew all that was done  hadnt i warned you a thousand times of the danger of it  you are not to be trusted with money  remember ezra his father said with dignity reseating himself in the chair from which he had risen in order to free himself from his sons clutches if i lost the money i also made it  this was a flourishing concern before you were born  if the worst comes to the worst you are only where i started  but we are far from being absolutely ruined as yet  to think of it ezra cried flinging himself upon the office sofa and burying his face in his hands  to think of all i have said of our money and our resources  what will clutterbuck and the fellows at the club say  how can i alter the ways of life that i have learned then suddenly clenching his hands and turning upon his father he broke out we must have it back father we must by fair means or foul you must do it for it was you who lost it  what can we do  how long have we to do it in  is this known in the city  oh i shall be ashamed to show my face on change  so he rambled on halfmaddened by the pictures of the future which rose up in his mind  be calm ezra be calm his father said imploringly  we have many chances yet if we only make the best of them  there is no use lamenting the past  i freely confess that i was wrong in using this money without your knowledge but i did it from the best of motives  we must put our heads together now to retrieve our losses and there are many ways in which that may be done  i want your clear common sense to help me in the matter  pity you didnt apply to that before ezra said sulkily  i have suffered for not doing so the older man answered meekly in considering how to rally under this grievous affliction which has come upon us we must remember that our credit is a great resource and one upon which we have never drawn  that gives us a broad margin to help us while we are carrying out our plans for the future  what will our credit be worth when this matter leaks out  but it cant leak out  no one suspects it for a moment  they might imagine that we are suffering from some temporary depression of trade but no one could possibly know the sad truth  for heavens sake dont you let it out  his son broke into an impatient oath  a flush came into girdlestones sallow cheeks and his eyes sparkled angrily  be careful how you speak ezra  there are limits to what i will endure from you though i make every allowance for your feelings at this sudden catastrophe for which i acknowledge myself responsible  the young man shrugged his shoulders and drummed his heel against the ground impatiently  i have more than one plan in my head the merchant said by which our affairs may be reestablished on their old footing  if we can once get sufficient money to satisfy our present creditors and so tide over this run of bad luck the current will set in the other way and all will go well  and first of all there is one question my boy which i should like to ask you  what do you think of john harstons daughter  shes right enough the young man answered brusquely  shes a good girl ezraa thoroughly good girl and a rich girl too though her money is a small thing in my eyes compared to her virtue  young girdlestone sneered  of course he said impatiently  well go onwhat about her  just this ezra that there is no girl in the world whom i should like better to receive as my daughterinlaw  ah you rogue you could come round her you know you could  the old man poked his long bony finger in the direction of his sons ribs with grim playfulness  oh thats the idea is it remarked the junior partner with a very unpleasant smile  yes that is one way out of our difficulties  she has forty thousand pounds which would be more than enough to save the firm  at the same time you would gain a charming wife  yes there are a good many girls about who might make charming wives his son remarked dubiously  no matrimony for me yet awhile  but it is absolutely necessary his father urged  a very fine necessity ezra broke in savagely  i am to tie myself up for life and you are to use all the money in rectifying your blunders its a very pretty division of labour is that  the business is yours as well as mine  it is your interest to invest the money in it for if it fails you are as completely ruined as i should be  you think you could win her if you tried  ezra stroked his dark moustache complacently and took a momentary glance at his own bold handsome features in the mirror above the fireplace  if we are reduced to such an expedient i think i can answer for the result he said  the girls not a badlooking one but you said you had several plans  let us hear some of the other ones if the worst comes to the worst i might consent to thaton condition of course that i should have the whole management of the money  quite soquite so his father said hurriedly  thats a dear good lad  as you say when all other things fail we can always fall back upon that  at present i intend to raise as much money as i can upon our credit and invest it in such a manner as to bring in a large and immediate profit  and how do you intend to do this his son asked doubtfully  i intend said john girdlestone solemnly rising up and leaning his elbow against the mantelpiecei intend to make a corner in diamonds    chapter xii   a corner in diamonds  john girdlestone propounded his intention with such dignity and emphasis that he evidently expected the announcement to come as a surprise upon his son  if so he was not disappointed for the young man stared openeyed  a corner in diamonds he repeated  how will you do that  you know what a corner is his father explained  if you buy up all the cotton say or sugar in the market so as to have the whole of it in your own hands and to be able to put your own price on it in selling it againthat is called making a corner in sugar or cotton  i intend to make a corner in diamonds  of course i know what a corner is ezra said impatiently  but how on earth are you going to buy all the diamonds in  you would want the capital of a rothschild  not so much as you think my boy for there are not any great amount of diamonds in the market at any one time  the yield of the south african fields regulates the price  i have had this idea in my head for some time and have studied the details  of course i should not attempt to buy in all the diamonds that are in the market  a small portion of them would yield profit enough to float the firm off again  but if you have only a part of the supply in your hands how are you to regulate the market value  you must come down to the prices at which other holders are selling  ha ha  very good very good the old merchant said shaking his head goodhumouredly  but you dont quite see my plan yet  you have not altogether grasped it  allow me to explain it to you  his son lay back upon the sofa with a look of resignation upon his face girdlestone continued to stand upon the hearthrug and spoke very slowly and deliberately as though giving vent to thoughts which had been long and carefully considered  you see ezra he said diamonds being a commodity of great value of which there is never very much in the market at one time are extremely sensitive to all sorts of influences  the value of them varies greatly from time to time  a very little thing serves to depreciate their price and an equally small thing will send it up again  ezra girdlestone grunted to show that he followed his fathers remarks  i did some business in diamonds myself when i was a younger man and so i had an opportunity of observing their fluctuations in the market now there is one thing which invariably depreciates the price of diamonds  that is the rumour of fresh discoveries of mines in other parts of the world  the instant such a thing gets wind the value of the stones goes down wonderfully  the discovery of diamonds in central india not long ago had that effect very markedly and they have never recovered their value since  do you follow me  an expression of interest had come over ezras face and he nodded to show that he was listening  now supposing continued the senior partner with a smile on his thin lips that such a report got about  suppose too that we were at this time when the market was in a depressed condition to invest a considerable capital in them  if these rumours of an alleged discovery turned out to be entirely unfounded of course the value of the stones which we held would go up once more and we might very well sell out for double or treble the sum that we invested  dont you see the sequence of events  there seems to me to be rather too much of the suppose in it remarked ezra  how do we know that such rumours will get about and if they do how do we know that they will prove to be unfounded  how are we to know the merchant cried wriggling his long lank body with amusement  why my lad if we spread the rumours ourselves we shall have pretty good reason to believe that they are unfounded eh ezra  ha ha  you see there are some brains in the old man yet  ezra looked at his father in considerable surprise and some admiration why damn it he exclaimed its dishonest  im not sure that its not actionable  dishonest  pooh the merchant snapped his fingers  its finesse my boy commercial finesse  whos to trace it i should like to know i havent worked out all the detailsi want your cooperation over thatbut heres a rough sketch of my plan  we send a man we can depend upon to some distant part of the worldchimborazo for example or the ural mountains  it doesnt matter where as long as it is out of the way  on arriving at this place our agent starts a report that he has discovered a diamond mine  we should even go the length if he considers it necessary of hiding a few rough stones in the earth which he can dig up to give colour to his story  of course the local press would be full of this  he might present one of the diamonds to the editor of the nearest paper  in course of time a pretty coloured description of the new diamond fields would find its way to london and thence to the cape  ill answer for it that the immediate effect is a great drop in the price of stones  we should have a second agent at the cape diamond fields and he would lay our money out by buying in all that he could while the panic lasted  then the original scare having proved to be all a mistake the prices naturally go up once more and we get a long figure for all that we hold  thats what i mean by making a corner in diamonds  there is no room in it for any miscalculation  it is as certain as a proposition of euclid and as easily worked out  it sounds very nice his son remarked thoughtfully  im not so sure about its working though  it must work well  as far as human calculation can go there is no possibility of failure  besides my boy never lose sight of the fact that we shall be speculating with other peoples money  we ourselves have nothing to lose absolutely nothing  i am not likely to lose sight of it said ezra angrily his mind coming back to his grievance  i reckon that we can raise from forty to fifty thousand pounds without much difficulty  my name is as you know as good as that of any firm in the city  for nearly forty years it has been above stain or suspicion  if we carry on our plans at once and lay this money out judiciously all may come right  its hobsons choice the young man remarked  we must try some bold stroke of the sort  have you chosen the right sort of men for agents you should have men of some standing to set such reports going they would have more weight then  john girdlestone shook his head despondingly  how am i to get a man of any standing to do such a piece of business he said  nothing easier answered ezra with a cynical laugh  i could pick out a score of impecunious fellows from the clubs who would be only too glad to earn a hundred or two in any way you can mention  all their talk about honour and so forth is very pretty and edifying but its not meant for every day use  of course we should have to pay him  them you mean  no we should only want one man  how about our purchaser at the diamond fields  you dont mean to say ezra said roughly that you would be so absurd as to trust any man with our money  why i wouldnt let the archbishop of canterbury out of my sight with forty thousand pounds of mine  no i shall go myself to the diamond fieldsthat is if i can trust you here alone  that is unkind ezra said his father  your idea is an excellent one  i should have proposed it myself but for the discomforts and hardships of such a journey  theres no use doing things by halves the young man remarked  as to our other agent i have the very manmajor tobias clutterbuck  he is a shrewd clever fellow and hes always hard up  last week he wanted to borrow a tenner from me  the job would be a godsend to him and his social rank would be a great help to our plan  ill answer for his jumping at the idea  sound him on the subject then  i will  i am glad said the old merchant that you and i have had this conversation ezra  the fact of my having speculated without your knowledge and deceived you by a false ledger has often weighed heavily upon my conscience i assure you  it is a relief to me to have told you all  drop the subject then ezra said curtly  i must put up with it for i have no redress  the thing is done and nothing can undo it but i consider that you have willfully wasted the money  believe me i have tried to act for the best  the good name of our firm is everything to me  i have spent my whole life in building it up and if the day should come when it must go i trust that i may have gone myself  there is nothing which i would not do to preserve it  i see they want our premiums ezra said glancing at the open letter upon the table  how is it that none of those ships go down that would give us help  hush hush john girdlestone cried imploringly  speak in a whisper when you talk of such things  i cant understand you said ezra petulantly  you persistently overinsure your ships year after year  look at the leopard it is put at more than twice what she was worth as new  and the black eagle i dare say is about the same  yet you never have an accident with them while your two new uninsured clippers run each other down  well what more can i do replied the merchant they are thoroughly rotten  i have done nothing for them for years  sooner or later they must go  i cannot do any more  id make em go down quick enough muttered ezra with an oath why dont you make old miggs bore a hole in them or put a light to a barrel of paraffin  bless your soul the things done every day whats the use of being milkandwatery about it  no no ezra cried his father  not thatnot that  its one thing letting matters take their course and it is another thing giving positive orders to scuttle a ship  besides it would put us in miggs power  it would be too dangerous  please yourself said ezra with a sneer  youve got us into the mess and you must take us out again  if the worst comes to the worst ill tell you what ill do  ill marry kate harston wash my hands of the firm leave you to settle matters with the creditors and retire with the forty thousand pounds with which threat the junior partner took up his hat and swaggered out of the office  after his departure john girdlestone spent an hour in anxious thought arranging the details of the scheme which he had just submitted to his son  as he sat his eye chanced to fall upon the two letters lying on his desk and it struck him that they had better be attended to  it did not suit his plans to fall back upon his credit just yet  it has been already shown that he was a man of ready resource  he rang the bell and summoned his senior clerk  good morning john he said affably  good morning mr girdlestone good morning sir said wizened little john gilray rubbing his thin yellow hands together as a sign of his gratification  i hear john that you have come into a legacy lately mr girdlestone said  yes sir  fifteen hundred pounds sir  less legacy duty and incidental expenses fourteen hundred and twentyeight six and fourpence  my wifes brother andrew left it sir and a very handsome legacy too  john girdlestone smiled with the indulgent smile of one to whom such a sum was absolutely nothing  what have you done with the money then john he asked carelessly  banked it sir in the united metropolitan  in the united metropolitan john  let me see  their present rate of interest is three and a half  three sir said john  three  dear me john that is poor interest very poor indeed  it is most fortunate that i made these inquiries  i was on the point of drawing fourteen hundred pounds from one of my correspondents as a temporary convenience  for this i should pay him five per cent  i have no objection john as you are an old servant of the firm to giving you the preference in this matter  i cannot take more than fourteen hundredbut i shall be happy to accommodate you up to that sum at the rate named  john gilray was overwhelmed by this thoughtful and considerate act  it is really too generous and kind sir he said  i dont know how to thank you  dont mention it john the senior partner said grandly  the firm is always glad to advance the interests of its employees in any reasonable manner  have you your chequebook with you  fill it up for fourteen hundred  no more john i cannot oblige you by taking any more  the head clerk having made out his cheque for the amount and having signed his name to it in a cramped little quaint handwriting which reminded one of his person was duly presented with a receipt and dismissed to his countinghouse  there he entertained the other clerks by a glowing description of the magnanimity of his employer  john girdlestone took some sheets of blue official paper from a drawer and his quill pen travelled furiously over them with many a screech and splutter  sir he said to the bank manager i enclose fourteen hundred pounds which represents the loose cash about the office  i shall make a heavy deposit presently  in the meantime you will of course honour anything that may be presentedyours truly john girdlestone  to lloyds insurance agency he wrotesirenclosed you will find cheque for 241 pounds seven shillings and sixpence being amount due as premium on the leopard black eagle and maid of athens  should have forwarded cheque before but with so many things of importance to look after these trifles are liable to be overlooked  these two epistles having been sealed addressed and despatched the elder girdlestone began to feel somewhat more easy in his mind and to devote himself once more to the innocent amusement of planning how a corner might best be created in diamonds    chapter xiii   shadow and light  john girdlestones private residence in eccleston square was a large and substantial house in a district which the wave of fashion had passed over in its westward course  it might still however be said to be covered by a deposit of eminent respectability  the building was stern and hard and massive in its external appearance but the interior was luxury itself for the old merchant in spite of his ascetic appearance was inclined to be a sybarite at heart and had a due appreciation of the good things of this world  indeed there was an oriental and almost barbarous splendour about the great rooms where the richest of furniture was interspersed with skins from the gaboon handworked ivory from old calabar and the thousand other strange valuables which were presented by his agents to the african trader  after the death of his friend girdlestone had been as good as his word he had taken kate harston away from the desolate house at fulham and brought her to live with him  from the garrets of that palatial edifice to the cellars she was at liberty to roam where she would and do what she chose  the square garden too with its smokedried trees and faded lawn was at her disposal in which she might walk or work or read no cares or responsibilities were imposed upon her  the domestic affairs were superintended by a stern housekeeper who bore a quaint resemblance to girdlestone himself in petticoats and who arranged every detail of housekeeping  the young girl had apparently only to exist and to be happy  yet the latter item was not so easy as it might seem  it was not a congenial atmosphere  her whole society consisted of the stern unemotional merchant and his vulgar occasionally brutal son at first while the memory of her father was still fresh she felt her new surroundings acutely contrasting as they did with her happy fulham home  gradually however as time deadened the sting she came to accommodate herself to circumstances  the two men left her very much to her own devices  girdlestone was so engrossed in his business that he had little time to inquire into her pursuits and ezra being addicted to late hours was seldom seen except at breakfasttime when she listened with awe to his sporting slang and cynical comments upon men and manners  john girdlestone had been by no means overjoyed upon the return of the dimsdales from edinburgh to learn that his ward had been thrown into the company of her young cousin  he received her coldly and forbade her to visit phillimore gardens for some time to come  he took occasion also to speak of tom and to assure her that he had received very serious accounts as to his spiritual state  he is addicted to all manner of debasing pursuits he remarked and it is my particular wish that you should avoid him  learning that young dimsdale was in london he even took the precaution of telling off a confidential footman to walk behind her on all occasions and to act either as an escort or as a sentry  it chanced however that one day a few weeks after her return kate found an opportunity of recovering her freedom  the footman had been despatched upon some other duty so she bethought herself that a book was to be bought and some lace to be matched and several other important feminine duties to be fulfilled  it happened however that as she walked sedately down warwick street her eyes fell upon a very tall and squareshouldered young man who was lounging in her direction tapping his stick listlessly against the railings as is the habit of idle men  at this kate forgot incontinently all about the book and the lace while the tall youth ceased to tap the railings and came striding towards her with long springy footsteps and a smiling face  why cousin tom who would have thought of meeting you here she exclaimed when the first greetings had been exchanged  it is a most surprising thing  it is possible that the incident would not have struck her as so very astonishing after all had she known that tom had spent six hours a day for the last fortnight in blockading the entrances to eccleston square  most remarkable said the young hypocrite  you see i havent anything to do yet so i walk about london a good deal  it was a lucky chance that sent me in this direction  and how is the doctor kate asked eagerly  and mrs dimsdale how is she  you must give my love to them both  how is it that you have never been to see us tom asked reproachfully  mr girdlestone thinks that i have been too idle lately and that i should stay at home  i am afraid it will be some little time before i can steal away to kensington  tom consigned her guardian under his breath to a region warmer even than the scene of that gentlemans commercial speculations  which way are you going he asked  i was going to victoria street to change my book and then to ford street  what a strange thing the young man exclaimed i was going in that direction too  it seemed the more strange as he was walking in the opposite direction when she met him  neither seemed inclined to make any comment upon the fact so they walked on together  and you have not forgotten the days in edinburgh yet tom asked after a long pause  no indeed his companion answered with enthusiasm  i shall never forget them as long as i live  nor i said tom earnestly  you remember the day we had at the pentlands  and the drive round arthurs seat  and the time that we all went to roslin and saw the chapel  and the day at edinburgh castle when we saw the jewels and the armoury but you must have seen all these things many times before  you could not have enjoyed it as much as we did for the first time  oh yes i did tom said stoutly wondering to himself how it was that the easy grace with which he could turn compliments to maidens for whom he cared nothing had so entirely deserted him  you see katewellyou were not there when i saw them before  ah said kate demurely what a beautiful day it is  i fancied in the morning that it was going to rain  tom was not to be diverted from his subject by any meteorological observations  perhaps some time your guardian will allow the dad to take you on another little holiday he said hopefully  im afraid he wont answered kate  why not  because he seemed so cross when i came back this last time  why was he cross asked tom  because she was about to say that it was because she had been brought in contact with him but she recollected herself in time  because what  because he happened to be in a bad temper she answered  it is too bad that you should have to submit to any ones whims and tempers the young man said switching his stick angrily backwards and forwards  why not she asked laughing  everybody has some one over them if you hadnt you would never know right from wrong  but he is unkind to you  no indeed said kate with decision  he is really very kind to me he may appear a little stern at times but i know that he means it for my own good and i should be a very foolish girl if i resented it besides he is so pious and good that what may seem a little fault to us would appear a great thing in his eyes  oh he is very pious and good then tom remarked in a doubtful voice  his shrewd old father had formed his own views as to john girdlestones character and his son had in due course imbibed them from him  yes of course he is answered kate looking up with great wondering eyes  dont you know that he is the chief supporter of the purbrook street branch of the primitive trinitarians and sits in the front pew three times every sunday  ah said tom  yes and subscribes to all the charitable funds and is a friend of mr jefferson edwards the great philanthropist  besides look how good he has been to me  he has taken the place of my father  hum tom said dubiously and then with a little pang at his heart do you like ezra girdlestone too  no indeed cried his companion with energy  i dont like him in the least  he is a cruel badhearted man  cruel you dont mean cruel to you of course  no not to me  i avoid him as much as i can and sometimes for weeks we hardly exchange a word  do you know what he did the other day it makes me shudder even to think of it  i heard a cat crying pitifully in the garden so i went out to see what was the matter  when i got outside i saw ezra girdlestone leaning out of a window with a gun in his handsone of those airguns which dont make any noise when they go off  and there in the middle of the garden was a poor cat that he had tied to a bush and he had been practising at it for ever so long the poor creature was still alive but oh so dreadfully injured  the brute what did you do  i untied it and brought it inside but it died during the night  and what did he say  he put up his gun while i was untying it as if he had half a mind to take a shot at me  when i met him afterwards he said that he would teach me to mind my own business  i didnt mind what he said though as long as i had the cat  spoke like that did he said tom savagely flushing up to his eyes i wish i saw him now  id teach him manners or  youll certainly get run over if you go on like that interrupted kate  indeed the young man in his indignation was striding over a crossing without the slightest heed of the imminent danger which he ran from the stream of traffic  dont be so excitable cousin tom she said laying her gloved hand upon his arm there is nothing to be cross about  isnt there he answered furiously  its a pretty state of things that you should have to submit to insults from a brutal puppy like that fellow ezra girdlestone  the pair had managed by this time to get halfway across the broad road and were halting upon the little island of safety formed by the great stone base of a lamppost  an interminable stream of busesyellow purple and brownwith vans hansoms and growlers blocked the way in front of them  a single policeman with his back turned to them and his two arms going like an animated semaphore was the only human being in their immediate vicinity  amid all the roar and rattle of the huge city they were as thoroughly left to themselves as though they were in the centre of salisbury plain  you must have a protector tom said with decision  oh cousin tom dont be foolish i can protect myself very well  you must have some one who has a right to look after you the young mans voice was husky for the back part of his throat had become unaccountably dry of a sudden  you can pass now sir roared the constable for there was a momentary break in the traffic  dont go for a moment tom cried desperately detaining his companion by the sleeve of her jacket  we are alone here and can talk  dont you thinkdont you think you could like me a little bit if you were to try  i love you so kate that i cannot help hoping that my love is not all lost  all clear now sir shouted the constable once more  dont mind him said tom still detaining her on the littleisland since i met you in edinburgh kate i have seemed to be walking in a dream  do what i will go where i will i still have you before my eyes and hear your sweet voice in my ears  i dont believe any girl was ever loved more dearly than i love you but i find it so hard to put into words the thoughts that i have in my mind  for heavens sake give me some little gleam of hope to carry away with me  you dont dislike me kate do you  you know that i dont cousin tom said the young lady with downcast eyes  he had cornered her so skilfully against the great lamp that she could move neither to the right nor to the left  do you like me then kate he asked eagerly with a loving light in his earnest grey eyes  of course i do  do you think you could love me continued this persistent young man i dont mean all at once and in a moment because i know very well that i am not worthy of it  but in time dont you think you could come to love me  perhaps murmured kate with averted face  it was such a very little murmur that it was wonderful that it should be audible at all yet it pealed in the young mans ears above the rattle and the clatter of the busy street  his head was very near to hers at the time  nows your time sir roared the semaphoric policeman  had tom been in a less exposed position it is possible that he might have acted upon that welltimed remark from the cunning constable the centre of a london crossing is not however a very advantageous spot for the performance of love passages  as they walked on threading their way among the vehicles tom took his companions hand in his and they exchanged one firm grip which each felt to be of the nature of a pledge  how sunny and bright the dull bricklined streets appeared to those two young people that afternoon  they were both looking into a future which seemed to be one long vista of happiness and love  of all the gifts of providence surely our want of knowledge of the things which are to come upon us is the most merciful and the one we could least dispense with  so happy and so lighthearted were these two lovers that it was not until they found themselves in warwick street once more that they came down from the clouds and realized that there were some commonplace details which must be dealt with in one way or another  of course i may tell my own people dearest about our engagement tom said  i wonder what your mother will say answered kate laughing merrily she will be awfully astonished  how about girdlestone asked tom  the thought of the guardian had never occurred to either of them before they stared at each other and kates face assumed such an expression of dismay that her companion burst out laughing  dont be frightened darling he said  if you like ill go in and beard the lion in his den  there is no time like the present  no no dear tom she cried eagerly  you must not do that it was impossible for her to tell him how especially girdlestone had cautioned her against him but she felt that it would never do to allow the two to meet  we must conceal our engagement from mr girdlestone  conceal our engagement  yes tom  he has warned me so often against anything of the sort that really i dont know what he would do if he knew about it  he would certainly make it very uncomfortable for me to live with him  remember i am nearly twenty now so in a little more than a year i shall be entirely free  that is not very long  i dont know about that tom said doubtfully  however if you will be more comfortable of course that settles the question  it seems rather hard though that we should have to conceal it simply in order to pacify this old bear  its only for a time tom and you may tell them at home by all means now goodbye dear they will see you from the windows if you come nearer  goodbye my darling  they shook hands and parted he hurrying away with the glad tidings to phillimore gardens she tripping back to her captivity with the lightest heart that she had felt for a weary time  passersby glanced back at the bright little face under the bright little bonnet and ezra girdlestone looking down at her from the drawingroom window bethought him that if the diamond speculation should fail it would be no hardship to turn to his fathers word    chapter xiv   a slight misunderstanding  the revelation of the real state of the firms finances was a terrible blow to ezra girdlestone  to a man of his overbearing tempestuous disposition failure and poverty were bitter things to face  he had been wont to tread down before him all such little difficulties and obstacles as came across him in his former life  now he encountered a great barrier which could not be passed so easily and he raged and chafed before it  it made him still more wroth to think that the fault was none of his  all his life he had reckoned as a matter of course that when his father passed away he would be left almost a millionaire  a single halfhours conversation had shattered this delusion and left him face to face with ruin  he lost his sleep and became restless and holloweyed  once or twice he was seen the worse for drink in the daytime  he was a man of strong character however and though somewhat demoralized by the sudden shock he threw away no point in the game which he and his father were playing  he saw clearly that only a bold stroke could save them  he therefore threw himself heart and soul into the diamond scheme and worked out the details in a masterly manner the more he looked into it the more convinced he became not only of its feasibility but of its absolute safety  it seemed as though it were hardly possible that it should fail  among other things he proceeded to qualify himself as a dealer in diamonds  it happened that he was acquainted with one of the partners of the firm of fugger  stoltz who did the largest import trade in precious stones  through his kindness he received practical instructions in the variety and value of diamonds and learned to detect all those little flaws and peculiarities which are only visible to the eye of an expert and yet are of the highest importance in determinating the price of a stone  with such opportunities ezra made rapid progress and within a few weeks there were not many dealers in the trade who had a better grasp of the subject  both the girdlestones recognized that the success of their plan depended very largely upon their choice of an agent and both were of the opinion that in major tobias clutterbuck they had just the man that they were in want of  the younger merchant had long felt vaguely that the majors social position combined with his impecuniosity and the looseness of his morality as inferred from his mode of life might some day make him a valuable agent under delicate circumstances  as to the old soldiers own inclinations ezra flattered himself that he knew the mans nature to a nicety  it was simply a question of the price to be paid  no doubt the figure would be substantial but he recognized with a traders instinct that the article was a superior one and he was content to allow for the quality in estimating the value  early one april afternoon the major was strutting down st jamess street frockcoated and kidgloved with protuberant chest and glittering shoes which peeped out from beneath the daintiest of gaiters young girdlestone who had been on the lookout from a club window ran across and intercepted him  how are you my dear major he cried advancing upon him with outstretched hand and as much show of geniality as his nature permitted  how dye do  how dye do said the other somewhat pompously  he had made up his mind that nothing was to be done with the young man and yet he was reluctant to break entirely with one whose purse was well lined and who had sporting proclivities  ive been wishing to speak with you for some days major said ezra when could i see you  youll niver see me any plainer than you do at this very moment the old soldier answered taking a sidelong glance of suspicion at his companion  ah but i wish to speak to you quietly on a matter of business the young merchant persisted  its a delicate matter which may need some talking over and above all it is a private matter  ged said the major with a wheezy laugh youd have thought i wanted to borrow money if i had said as much  look here now well go into whites private billiardroom and ill let you have two hunthred out of five for a tinnerthough its as good as handing you the money to offer you such odds  you can talk this over while we play  no no major urged the junior partner  i tell you it is a matter of the greatest importance to both of us  can you meet me at nelsons cafe at four oclock  i know the manager and hell let us have a private room  id ask you round to me own little place the major said but its rather too far  nelsons at four  right you are  punctuality is next to godliness as ould willoughby of the buffs used to say  you didnt know willoughby eh  gad he was second to a man at gib in 47 he brought his man on the ground but the opponents didnt turn up two minutes after time willoughby wanted his man to leave  teach em punctuality he said  cant be done said his man  must be done said willoughby  out of the question said the man and wouldnt budge  willoughby persisted there were high words and a quarrel  the docther put em up at fifteen paces and the man shot willoughby through the calf of the leg  he was a martyr to punctuality four oclockbye bye the major nodded pleasantly and swaggered away flourishing his little cane jauntily in the air  in spite of his admiration of punctuality as exemplified in the person of willoughby of the buffs the major took good care to arrive at the trystingplace somewhat behind the appointed time  it was clear to him that some service or other was expected of him and it was obviously his game therefore to hang back and not appear to be too eager to enter into young girdlestones views  when he presented himself at the entrance of nelsons cafe the young merchant had been fuming and chafing in the sittingroom for five and twenty minutes  it was a dingy apartment with a single large horsehair chair and half a dozen small wooden dittoes placed with mathematical precision along the walls  a square table in the centre and a shabby mirror over the mantelpiece completed the furniture  with the instinct of an old campaigner the major immediately dropped into the armchair and leaning luxuriously back took a cigar from his case and proceeded to light it  ezra girdlestone seated himself near the table and twisted his dark moustache as was his habit when collecting himself  what will you drink he asked  anything thats going  fetch in a decanter of brandy and some seltzer water said ezra to the waiter then shut the door and leave us entirely to ourselves  when the liquor was placed upon the table he drank off his first glass at a gulp and then refilled it  the major placed his upon the mantelpiece beside him without tasting it  both were endeavouring to be at their best and clearest in the coming interview and each set about it in his own manner  ill tell you why i wanted to have a chat with you major ezra said having first opened the door suddenly and glanced out as a precaution against eavesdroppers  i have to be cautious because what i have to say affects the interest of the firm  i wouldnt for the world have any one know about it except yourself  what is it me boy the major asked with languid curiosity puffing at his weed and staring up at the smokeblackened ceiling  you understand that in commercial speculations the least breath of information beforehand may mean a loss of thousands on thousands  the major nodded his head as a sign that he appreciated this fact  we have a difficult enterprise on which we are about to embark ezra said leaning forward and sinking his voice almost to a whisper it is one which will need great skill and tact though it may be made to pay well if properly managed  you follow me  his companion nodded once more  for this enterprise we require an agent to perform one of the principal parts  this agent must possess great ability and at the same time be a man on whom we can thoroughly rely  of course we do not expect to find such qualities without paying for them  the major grunted a hearty acquiescence  my father continued ezra wanted to employ one of our own men we have numbers who are capable in every way of managing the business i interfered however  i said that i had a good friend named major tobias clutterbuck who was well qualified for the position i mentioned that you were of the blood of the old silesian kings  was i not right  begad you were not  milesian sir milesian   ah milesian  its all the same  its nothing of the sort said the major indignantly  i mean it was all the same to my father  he wouldnt know the difference  well i told him of your high descent and that you were a traveller a soldier and a man of steady and trustworthy habits  eh ejaculated the major involuntarily  well all right  go on  i told him all this said ezra slowly and i pointed out to him that the sum of money which he was prepared to lay out would be better expended on such a man than on one who had no virtues beyond those of business  i didnt give you credit for so much sinse his companion exclaimed with enthusiasm  i said to him that if the matter were left entirely in your hands we could rely upon its being done thoroughly  at the same time we should have the satisfaction of knowing that the substantial sum which we are prepared to pay our agent had come into worthy hands  you hit it there again murmured the veteran  you are prepared then said ezra glancing keenly at him to put yourself at our orders on condition that you are well paid for it  not so fast me young friend not so fast said the major taking his cigar from between his lips and letting the blue smoke curl round his head  lets hear what it is that you want me to do and then im riddy to say what ill agree to and what i wont  i remimber jimmy baxter in texas  hang jimmy baxter ezra cried impatiently  thats been done already observed the major calmly  lynched for horsestealing in 66  however go on and ill promise not to stop you until you have finished  thus encouraged ezra proceeded to unfold the plan upon which the fortunes of the house of girdlestone depended  not a word did he say of ruin or danger or the reasons which had induced this speculation on the contrary he depicted the affairs of the firm as being in a most nourishing condition and this venture as simply a small insignificant offshoot from their business undertaken as much for amusement as for any serious purpose  still he laid stress upon the fact that though the sum in question was a small one to the firm yet it was a very large one in other mens eyes  as to the morality of the scheme that was a point which ezra omitted entirely to touch upon  any comment upon that would he felt be superfluous when dealing with such a man as his companion  and now major he concluded provided you lend us your name and your talents to help us in our speculation the firm are prepared to meet you in a most liberal spirit in the matter of remuneration  of course your voyage and your expenses will be handsomely paid  you will have to travel by steamer to st petersburg provided that we choose the ural mountains as the scene of our imaginary find  i hear that there is high play going on aboard these boats and with your wellknown skill you will no doubt be able to make the voyage a remunerative one  we calculate that at the most you will be in russia about three months now the firm thought that it would be very fair if they were to guarantee you two hundred and fifty pounds which they would increase to five hundred in case of success of course by that we mean complete success such as would be likely to attend your exertions  now had there been any third person in the room during this long statement of the young merchants and had that third person been a man of observation he might have remarked several peculiarities in the majors demeanour  at the commencement of the address he might have posed as the very model and type of respectable composure  as the plan was gradually unfolded however the old soldier began to puff harder at his cigar until a continuous thick grey cloud rose up from him through which the lurid tip of the havannah shone like a murky meteor from time to time he passed his hand down his puffy cheeks as was his custom when excited  then he moved uneasily in his chair cleared his throat huskily and showed other signs of restlessness all of which were hailed by ezra girdlestone as unmistakable proofs of the correctness of his judgment and of the not unnatural eagerness of the veteran on hearing of the windfall which chance had placed in his way  when the young man had finished the major stood up with his face to the empty fireplace his legs apart his chest inflated and his body rocking ponderously backwards and forwards  let me be quite sure that i understand you he said  you wish me to go to russia  quite so ezra remarked rubbing his hands pleasantly  you have the goodness to suggist that on me way i should rook me fellowpassengers in the boat  that is to say if you think it worth your while  quite so if i think it worth me while  i am then to procade across the counthry to some mountains  the urals  and there i am to pretind to discover certain diamond mines and am to give weight to me story by the fact that i am known to be a man of good birth and also by exhibiting some rough stones which you wish me to take out with me from england  quite right major ezra said encouragingly  i am then to tilegraph or write this lie to england and git it inserted in the papers  thats an ugly word ezra remonstrated  this report we will say a report may be either true or false you know  and by this report thin the major continued you reckon that the market will be so affected that your father and you will be able to buy and sell in a manner that will be profitable to you but by which you will do other people out of their money  you have an unpleasant way of putting it said ezra with a forced laugh but you have the idea right  i have another idea as well roared the old soldier flushing purple with passion  ive an idea that if i was twinty years younger id see whether youd fit through that window master girdlestone  ged  id have taught you to propose such a schame to a man with blue blood in his veins you scounthrel  ezra fell back in his chair  he was outwardly composed but there was a dangerous glitter in his eye and his face had turned from a healthy olive to a dull yellow tint  you wont do it he gasped  do it  dye think that a man whos worn her majestys scarlet jacket for twinty years would dirty his hands with such a trick  i tell ye i wouldnt do it for all the money that iver was coined  look here girdlestone i know you but by the lord you dont know me  the young merchant sat silently in his chair with the same livid colour upon his face and savage expression in his eyes  major tobias clutterbuck stood at the end of the table stooping forward so as to lean his hands upon it with his eyes protuberant and his scanty grey fringe in a bristle with indignation  what right had you to come to me with such a proposal  i dont set up for being a saint lord knows but be george ive some morals such as they are and i mean to stick to them  one of me rules of life has been niver to know a blackgaird and so me young friend from this day forth you and i go on our own roads  ged  im not particular but you must draw the line somewhere as me frind charlie monteith of the indian horse used to say i when he cut his fatherinlaw  i draw it at you  while the major was solemnly delivering himself of these sentiments ezra continued to sit watching him in a particularly venomous manner his straight cruel lips were blanched with passion and the veins stood out upon his forehead  the young man was a famous amateur bruiser and could fight a round with any professional in london  the old soldier would be a child in his hands  as the latter picked up his hat preparatory to leaving the room ezra rose and bolted the door upon the inside  its worth five pounds in a police court he muttered to himself and knotting up his great hands which glittered with rings he approached his companion with his head sunk upon his breast his eyes flashing from under his dark brows and the slow stealthy step of a beast of prey  there was a characteristic refinement of cruelty about his attack as though he wished to gloat over the helplessness of his victim and give him time to realize his position before he set upon him  if such were his intention he failed signally in producing the desired effect  the instant the major perceived his manoeuvre he pulled himself up to his full height as he might have done on parade and slipping his hand beneath the tails of his frockcoat produced a small glittering implement which he levelled straight at the young merchants head  a revolver ezra gasped staggering back  no a derringer said the veteran blandly  i got into the thrick of carrying one when i was in colorado and i have stuck to it ever since you niver know when it may be useful  as he spoke he continued to hold the black muzzle of his pistol in a dead line with the centre of the young mans forehead and to follow the latters movements with a hand which was as steady as a rock  ezra was no coward but he ceased his advance and stood irresolute  now thin cried the major in sharp military accents undo that door  the young merchant took one look at the threatening apoplectic face of his antagonist and another at the ugly black spot which covered him he stooped and pushed back the bolt  now open it  ged if you dont look alive ill have to blow a hole in you afther all  you wouldnt be the first man ive killed nor the last maybe  ezra opened the door precipitately  now walk before me into the strate  it struck the waiters at nelsons wellknown restaurant as a somewhat curious thing that their two customers should walk out with such very grave faces and in so unsociable a manner  cest la froideur anglaise remarked little alphonse lefanue to a fellow exile as they paused in the laying of tables to observe the phenomenon  neither of them noticed that the stout gentleman behind with his hand placed jauntily in the breast of his coat was still clutching the brown handle of a pistol  there was a hansom standing at the door and major clutterbuck stepped into it  look ye here girdlestone he said as the latter stood looking sulkily up and down the street  you should learn a lesson from this never attack a man unless youre sure that hes unarmed  you may git shot if you do  ezra continued to stare gloomily into vacancy and took no notice of his late companions remark  another thing said the major  you must niver take it for granted that every man you mate is as great a blackgaird as yourself  the young merchant gave him a malignant glance from his dark eyes and was turning to go but the gentleman in the cab stretched out his hand to detain him  one more lesson he said  never funk a pistol unless you are sure theres a carthridge inside  mine hadnt  drive on cabby with which parting shot the gallant major rattled away down piccadilly with a fixed determination never again to leave his rooms without a few of eleys no 4 central fires in his pocket    chapter xv   an addition to the house  there were rejoicings in phillimore gardens over toms engagement for the two old people were both heartily fond of kateour kate as they were wont proudly to call her  the physician chafed at first over the idea of keeping the matter a secret from girdlestone  a little reflection served to show him however that there was nothing to be gained by informing him while kates life during the time that she was forced to remain under his roof would be more tolerable as long as he was kept in ignorance of it  in the meanwhile the lovers saw little of each other and tom was only consoled by the thought that every day which passed brought him nearer to the time when he could claim his prize without concealment or fear  he went about as happy and as lighthearted a man as any in all london  his mother was delighted at his high spirits but his bluff old father was not so well satisfied confound the lad he said to himself  he is settling down to a life of idleness  it suits him too well  we must get him to choose one way or the other  accordingly after breakfast one morning the doctor asked his son to step with him into the library where he lit his long cherrywood pipe as was his custom after every meal and smoked for some time in silence  you must do something to keep you from mischief my boy he said at last brusquely  im ready for anything dad replied tom but i dont quite see what im fitted for  first of all what do you think of this the doctor asked abruptly handing a letter over to his son who opened it and read as follows      dear sir      it has come to my knowledge through my son that your boy has      abandoned the study of medicine and that you are still      uncertain as to his future career i have long had the      intention of seeking a young man who might join in our      business and relieve my old shoulders of some of the      burden  ezra urges me to write and propose that your      son should become one of us if he has any taste for      business we shall be happy to advance his interest in      every way  he would of course have to purchase a share      in the concern which would amount to seven thousand pounds      on which he would be paid interest at the rate of five      per cent  by allowing this interest to accumulate and      investing also his share of the profits he might in time      absorb a large portion of the business in case he joined      us upon this footing we should have no objection to his      name appearing as one of the firm should the idea commend      itself to you i should be most happy to talk over details      and to explain to you the advantages which the firm can offer      at my office in fenchurch street any day between ten and four      with kind regards to your family and hoping that they enjoy      the great blessing of health i remain sincerely yours                                         john girdlestone  what dye think of that the doctor asked when his son had finished reading it  i hardly know said tom i should like a little time to think it over  seven thousand pounds is a good round sum  it is more than half the total capital which i have invested for you  on the other hand i have heard those who ought to know say there is not a sounder or better managed concern in london  theres no time like the present tom get your hat and well go down to fenchurch street together and look into it  while father and son were rattling along in a cab from kensington to the city the young man had time to turn the matter over in his mind he wanted to be at work and why not take this up as well as anything else  it is true that he disliked what he had seen of both the girdlestones but on the other hand by becoming a member of the firm he would probably be thrown in the way of meeting the old merchants ward  this last consideration decided the matter and long before the cab had pulled up at the long and dirty passage which led to the offices of the great african firm the party principally interested had fully made up his mind as to the course he should adopt  they were duly ushered into the small sanctum adorned with the dissected ships the maps the charts the lists of sailing and the watercolour picture of the barque belinda where they were received by the head of the firm  with a charming personal modesty tempered by a becoming pride in the great business which he had himself created he discoursed upon its transactions and its importance  he took down ledgers and flashed great rows of figures before the eyes of the good doctor explaining at the same time how month after month their receipts increased and their capital grew  then he spoke touchingly of his own ripe years and of the quiet and seclusion which he looked forward to after his busy lifetime  with my young friend here he said patting tom affectionately on the shoulder and my own boy ezra both working together there will be young blood and life in the concern  theyll bring the energy and when they want advice they can come to the old man for it  i intend in a year or so when the new arrangement works smoothly to have a run over to palestine  it may seem a weakness to you but all my life i have hoped some day to stand upon that holy ground and to look down on those scenes which we have all imagined to ourselves  your son will start with a good position and a fair income which he will probably double before he is five years older  the money invested by him is simply to ensure that he shall have a substantial interest in promoting the affairs of the firm thus the old man ran on and when tom and his father left the office with the sound of great sums of money and huge profits and heavy balances and safe investments all jostling each other in their brains they had both made up their minds as to the future  hence in a couple of days there was a stir in the legal house of jones morgan  co with much rustling of parchment and signing of names and drinking of inferior sherry  the result of all which was that the firm of girdlestone  co were seven thousand pounds the richer and thomas dimsdale found himself a recognized member of a great commercial house with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto  a good days work tom said the old doctor as they left the lawyers office together  you have now taken an irrevocable step in life my boy  the world is before you  you belong to a firstclass firm and you have every chance  may you thrive and prosper  if i dont it wont be my fault tom answered with decision  i shall work with my whole heart and soul  a good days work ezra the african merchant was remarking at that very moment in fenchurch street  the firm is pinched again for working expenses  this will help and he threw a little slip of green paper across the table to his son  it will help us for a time ezra said gloomily glancing at the figures  it was fortunate that i was able to put you on his track it is only a drop in the ocean however  unless this diamond spec comes off nothing can save us  but it shall come off his father answered resolutely  he had succeeded in obtaining an agent who appeared to be almost as well fitted for the post as the recalcitrant major  this worthy had started off already for russia where the scene of his operations was to lie  i hope so said ezra  we have neglected no precaution  langworthy should be at tobolsk by this time  i saw that he had a bag of rough stones with him which would do well enough for his purpose  we have your money ready too  i can rely upon rather over thirty thousand pounds  our credit was good for that but i did not wish to push it too far for fear of setting tongues wagging  i am thinking of starting shortly in the mail boat cyprian said ezra  i should be at the diamond fields in little more than a month i dare say langworthy wont show any signs for some time yet but i may as well be there as here  it will give me a little while to find my way about  you see if the tidings and i were to come almost simultaneously it might arouse suspicions  in the meantime no one knows our little game  except your friend clutterbuck  a dark shadow passed over ezras handsome face and his cruel lip tightened in a way which boded little good to the old soldier should he ever lie at his mercy    chapter xvi   the first step  it was a proud day for the exmedical student when he first entered the countinghouse of the african firm and realized that he was one of the governing powers in that busy establishment  tom dimsdales mind was an intensely practical one and although he had found the study of science an irksome matter he was able to throw himself into business with uncommon energy and devotion  the clerks soon found that the sunburnt athleticlooking young man intended to be anything but a sleeping partner and both they and old gilray respected him accordingly  the latter had at first been inclined to resent the new arrangement as far as his gentle downtrodden nature could resent anything  hitherto he had been the monarch of the countinghouse in the absence of the girdlestones but now a higher desk had been erected in a more central portion of the room and this was for the accommodation of the new comer  gilray after his thirty years of service felt this usurpation of his rights very keenly but there was such a simple kindness about the invader and he was so grateful for any assistance in his new duties that the old clerks resentment soon melted away  a little incident occurred which strengthened this kindly feeling it chanced that some few days after toms first appearance in the office several of the clerks who had not yet quite gauged what manner of man this young gentleman might be took advantage of the absence of the girdlestones to take a rise out of the manager  one of them a great rawboned scotchman named mccalister after one or two minor exhibitions of wit concluded by dropping a heavy ruler over the partition of the old mans desk in such a way that it crashed down upon his head as he sat stooping over his writing  tom who had been watching the proceedings with a baleful eye sprang off his stool and made across the office at the offender  mccalister seemed inclined for a moment to brazen it out but there was a dangerous sling about toms shoulders and a flush of honest indignation upon his face  i didnt mean to hurt him said the scotchman  dont hit him sir cried the little manager  beg his pardon said tom between his teeth  mccalister stammered out some lame apology and the matter was ended  it revealed the new partner however in an entirely novel light to the inmates of the countinghouse  that under such circumstances a complaint should be carried to the senior was only natural but that the junior should actually take the matter into his own hands and execute lynch law then and there was altogether a new phenomenon  from that day tom acquired a great ascendancy in the office and gilray became his devoted slave this friendship with the old clerk proved to be very useful for by means of his shrewd hints and patient teaching the new comer gained a grasp of the business which he could not have attained by any other method  girdlestone called him into the office one day and congratulated him upon the progress which he was making  my dear young man he said to him in his patriarchal way i am delighted to hear of the way in which you identify yourself with the interests of the firm  if at first you find work allotted to you which may appear to you to be rather menial you must understand that that is simply due to our desire that you should master the whole business from its very foundations  there is nothing i desire better said tom  in addition to the routine of office work and the superintendence of the clerks i should wish you to have a thorough grasp of all the details of the shipping and of the loading and unloading of our vessels as well as of the storage of goods when landed  when any of our ships are in i should wish you to go down to the docks and to overlook everything which is done  tom bowed and congratulated himself inwardly upon these new duties which promised to be interesting  as you grow older said the senior partner you will find it of inestimable value that you have had practical experience of what your subordinates have to do  my whole life has taught me that  when you are in doubt upon any subject you can ask ezra for assistance and advice  he is a young man whom you might well take as an example for he has great business capacity  when he has gone to africa you can come to me if there is anything which you do not understand john girdlestone appeared to be so kindly and benevolent during this and other interviews that toms heart warmed towards him and he came to the conclusion that his father had judged the old merchant harshly more than once so impressed was he by his kindness that he was on the point of disclosing to him his engagement to his ward but on each occasion there arose within him a lively recollection of kates frightened face when he had suggested such a course and he felt that without her consent he had no right to divulge the secret  if the elder girdlestone improved upon acquaintance it was exactly the reverse with his son ezra  the dislike with which tom had originally regarded him deepened as he came in closer contact and appeared to be reciprocated by the other so that they held but little intercourse together  ezra had taken into his own charge all the financial part of the concern and guarded it the more jealously when he realized that the new partner was so much less simple than he had expected  thus tom had no opportunity of ascertaining for himself how the affairs of the firm stood but believed implicitly as did gilray that every outlay was bringing in a large and remunerative return  very much astonished would both of them have been had they realized that the working expenses were at present being paid entirely from their own capital until such time as the plot should ripen which was to restore the fortunes of the african company  in one respect tom dimsdale was immeasurably the gainer by his connection with the firm for without that it is difficult to say how he could have found opportunities for breaking through the barrier which separated him from kate  the surveillance of the merchant had become stricter of late and all invitations from mrs dimsdale or other friends who pitied the loneliness of the girl were repulsed by girdlestone with the curt intimation that his wards health was not such as to justify him in allowing her to incur any risk of catching a chill she was practically a prisoner in the great stone cage in eccleston square and even on her walks a warder in the shape of a footman was as we have seen told off to guard her  whatever john girdlestones reasons may have been he had evidently come to the conclusion that it was of the highest importance that she should be kept secluded  as it was tom thanks to his position as one of the firm was able occasionally in spite of every precaution to penetrate through the old mans defensive works  if a question of importance arose at fenchurch street during the absence of the senior partner what more natural than that mr dimsdale should volunteer to walk round to eccleston square in order to acquaint him with the fact  and if it happened that the gentleman was not to be found there how very natural that the young man should wait half an hour for him and that miss harston should take the opportunity of a chat with an old friend  precious precious interviews those the more so for their rarity  they brightened the dull routine of kates weary life and sent tom back to the office full of spirit and hope  the days were at hand when the memory of them was to shine out like little rifts of light in the dark cloud of existence  and now the time was coming when it was to be decided whether by a last bold stroke the credit of the house of girdlestone was to be saved or whether the attempt was to plunge them into deeper and more hopeless ruin  an unscrupulous agent named langworthy had as already indicated been despatched to russia well primed with instructions as to what to do and how to do it  he had been in the employ of an english corn merchant at odessa and had some knowledge of the russian language which would be invaluable to him in his undertaking  in the character of an english gentleman of scientific tastes he was to establish himself in some convenient village among the ural mountains  there he was to remain some little time so as to arouse confidence in the people before making his pretended discovery  he was then to carry his rough diamonds to tobolsk as the nearest large town and to exhibit them there backing up his assertion by the evidence of villagers who had seen him dig them up  the girdlestones knew that that alone would be sufficient when telegraphed to england to produce a panic in the sensitive diamond market  before any systematic inquiry could be made langworthy would have disappeared and their little speculation would have come off after that the sooner the people realized that it was a hoax the better for the conspirators  in any case there seemed to be no possibility that the origin of the rumour could be traced  meanwhile ezra girdlestone had secured his passage in the cape mail steamer cyprian on the night that he left he sat up late in the library at eccleston square talking over the matter for the last time with his father  the old man was pale and nervous  the one weak point in his character was his affection for his son an affection which he strove to hide under an austere manner but which was none the less genuine  he had never before parted with him for any length of time and he felt the wrench keenly  as to ezra he was flushed and excited at the thought of the new scenes which lay before him and the daring speculation in which he was about to embark  he flung himself into a chair and stretched his thick muscular limbs out in front of him  i know as much about stones he said exultantly as any man in london  i was pricing a bag of rough ones at van helmers today and he is reckoned a good judge  he said that no expert could have done it better  lord bless you pure or splints or cracked or off colour or spotted or twin stones im up to them all  i wasnt a pound out in the market value of any one of them  you deserve great credit for your quickness and perseverance replied his father  your knowledge will be invaluable to you when you are at the fields  be careful of yourself when you are there my son if only for my sake  there are rough fellows at such places and you must give them soft words  i know that your temper is quick but remember those wise words he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city  never fear for me dad said ezra with a sinister smile pointing to a small leather case which lay among his things  thats the best sixshooter i could get for money  ive taken a tip you see from our good friend the major and have six answers for any one that wants to argue with me  if i had had that the other day he wouldnt have bounced me so easily  nay but ezra ezra his father said in great agitation you will promise to be careful and to avoid quarrels and bloodshed  it is against the great law the new commandment  i wont get into any rows if i can help it his son answered thats not my game  but if you think that there is no mistake if your opponent is undoubtedly about to proceed to extremities shoot him down at once my dear lad before he has time to draw  i have heard those who have been out there say that in such cases everything depends upon getting the first shot  i am anxious about you and shall not be easy until i see you again  blessed if he hasnt tears in his eyes ezra exclaimed to himself much astonished at this unprecedented occurrence  when do you go his father asked  my train leaves in an hour or so  i reach the steamer at southampton about three in the morning and she starts with the full tide at six  look after your health the old man continued  dont get your feet wet and wear flannel next your skin  dont forget your religious duties either  it has a good effect upon those among whom you do business  ezra sprang from his chair with an exclamation of disgust and began to pace up and down  i wish to heaven you would drop that sort of gammon when we are alone he said irritably  my dear boy said the father with a mild look of surprise upon his face you seem to be under a misapprehension in this matter you appear to consider that we are embarking upon some unjustifiable undertaking  this is not so  what we are doing is simply a small commercial rusea finesse  it is a recognized maxim of trade to endeavour to depreciate the price of whatever you want to buy and to raise it again when the time comes for selling  its steering very close to the law his son retorted no speculating now while i am away whatever comes in must go towards getting us out of this scrape not to plunging us deeper in the mire  i shall not expend an unnecessary penny  well then goodbye said the young man rising up and holding out his hand  keep your eye on dimsdale and dont trust him  goodbye my son goodbyegod bless you  the old merchant was honestly moved and his voice quivered as he spoke he stood motionless for a minute or so until the heavy door slammed and then he threw open the window and gazed sorrowfully down the street at the disappearing cab  his whole attitude expressed such dejection that his ward who had just entered the room felt more drawn towards him than she had ever done before  slipping up to him she placed her warm tender hand upon his sympathetically  he will soon be back dear mr girdlestone she said  you must not be uneasy about him  as she stood beside him in her white dress with a single red ribbon round her neck and a band of the same colour round her waist she was as fair a specimen of english girlhood as could have been found in all london  the merchants features softened as he looked down at her fresh young face and he put out his hand as though to caress her but some unpleasant thought must have crossed his mind for he assumed suddenly a darker look and turned away from her without a word  more than once that night she recalled that strange spasmodic expression of something akin to horror which had passed over her guardians features as he gazed at her    chapter xvii   the land of diamonds  the anxious father had not very long to wait before he heard tidings of his son  upon the first of june the great vessel weighed her anchor in the southampton water and steamed past the needles into the channel on the 5th she was reported from madeira and the merchant received telegrams both from the agent of the firm and from his son  then there was a long interval of silence for the telegraph did not extend to the cape at that time but at last on the 8th of august a letter announced ezras safe arrival  he wrote again from wellington which was the railway terminus and finally there came a long epistle from kimberley the capital of the mining district in which the young man described his eight hundred miles drive up country and all the adventures which overtook him on the way  this place kimberley he said in his letter has grown into a fairsized town though a few years ago it was just a camp  now there are churches banks and a club in it  there are a sprinkling of welldressed people in the streets but the majority are grimylooking chaps from the diggings with slouched hats and coloured shirts rough fellows to look at though quiet enough as a rule  of course there are blacks everywhere of all shades from pure jet up to the lightest yellow  some of these niggers have money and are quite independent you would be surprised at their impertinence  i kicked one of them in the hotel yesterday and he asked me what the devil i was doing so i knocked the insolent scoundrel down  he says that he will sue me but i cannot believe that the law is so servile as to bolster up a black man against a white one  though kimberley is the capital of the dry diggings it is not there that all the actual mining is done  it goes on briskly in a lot of little camps which are dotted along the vaal river for fifty or sixty miles  the stones are generally bought by licensed agents immediately after they have been found and are paid for by cheques on banks in kimberley  i have therefore transferred our money to the standard bank here and have taken my licence  i start tomorrow for hebron klipdrift and other of the mining centres to see for myself how business is done and to make friends with the miners so as to get myself known  as soon as the news comes i shall buy in all that offers keep your eyes on that fellow dimsdale and let him know nothing of what is going on  he wrote again about a fortnight afterwards and his letter as it crossed the atlantic passed the outward mail which bore the news of the wonderful diamond find made by an english geologist among the ural mountains  i am now on a tour among the camps he said  i have worked right through from hebron to klipdrift pniel cawoods hope waldecks plant neukirks hope winterrush and bluejacket  tomorrow i push on to delpartes hope and larkins flat  i am well received wherever i go except by the dealers who are mostly german jews  they hear that i am a london capitalist and fear that i may send up the prices they little know  i bought stones all the way along but not very valuable ones for we must husband our resources  the process of mining is very simple  the men dig pits in loose gravel lying along the banks of the river and it is in these pits that the diamonds are found  the black men or boys as they call them do all the work and the baas or master superintends  everything that turns up belongs to the baas but the boys have a fixed rate of wages which never varies whether the work is paying or not  i was standing at hebron watching one of the gangs working when the white chap gave a shout and dived his hand into a heap of stuff he had just turned over pulling out a dirty looking little lump about the size of a marble at his shout all the other fellows from every claim within hearing gathered round until there was quite a crowd  its a fine stone said the man that turned it up  fifty carats if its one cried another weighing it in the palm of his hand  i had my scales with me so i offered to weigh it  it was sixtyfour and a half carats  then they washed it and examined it  there was a lot of whispering among them and then the one who had found it came forward  you deal dont you mr girdlestone he said  now and then i answered but im not very keen about it  i came out here more for pleasure than business  well he said you may go far before you see a finer stone than this  what will you bid for it  i looked at it  its offcoloured i said  its white said he and one or two of his chums  gentlemen i said it is not white  there are two shades of yellow in it  it is worth little or nothing  why if it is yellow it makes it all the more valuable said a big fellow with a black beard and corduroy trousers  a yellow stones as good as a white  yes i answered a pure yellow stone is  but this is neither one nor the other  its offcolour and you know that as well as i  wont you bid for it then said one of them  ill bid seventy pounds i said but not a penny more  you should have heard the howl they all set up  its worth five hundred the fellow cried  all right i said keep it and sell it for that good day and i went off  the stone was sent after me that evening with a request for my cheque and i sold it for a hundred two days afterwards1  you see old van harmers training has come in very handy  i just tell you this little anecdote to let you see that though im new in the work im not to be done  nothing in the papers here from russia  i am ready come when it may  what would you do if there should be any hitch and the affair did not come off  would you cut and run or would you stand by your colours and pay a shilling or so in the pound  the more i think of it the more i curse your insanity in getting us into such a mess goodbye  he is right  it was insanity said the old merchant leaning his head upon his hands  it seems unkind of the lad to say so when he is so far away but he was always plain and blunt  if the affair did not come offhe must have some doubts about the matter else he would not even suppose such a thing  god knows what i should do then  there are other waysother ways he passed his hand over his eyes as he spoke as though to shut out some ugly vision  such a wan strange expression played over his grim features that he was hardly to  be recognized as the revered elder of the trinitarian chapel or the esteemed man of business of fenchurch street  he was lost in thought for some little time and then rising he touched the bell upon the table  gilray trotted in upon the signal so rapidly and noiselessly that he might have been one of those convenient genii in the eastern fables only that the little clerks appearance from the tips of his inkstained fingers to the toes of his seedy boots was so hopelessly prosaic that it was impossible to picture him as anything but what he was  ah gilray the merchant began is mr dimsdale in the office  yes sir  thats all right  he seems to be very regular in his attendance  very sir  and seems to take to the business very well  uncommonly quick sir to be sure said the head clerk  what with work among the ships and work in the office hes at it late and early  that is very right said the old man playing with the letter weights application in youth gilray leads to leisure in old age  is the maid of athens unloading  mr dimsdale has been down to her this morning sir  theyre getting the things out fast  he wants to call attention to the state of the vessel mr girdlestone  he says that its making water even in dock and that some of the hands say that they wont go back in her  tut tut john girdlestone said peevishly  what are the government inspectors for  there is no use paying them if we are to inspect ourselves  if they insist upon any alterations they shall be made  they were there sir at the same time as mr dimsdale said gilray diffidently  well what then asked his employer  he says sir that the inspectors went down to the cabin and had some champagne with captain spender  they then professed themselves to be very well satisfied with the state of the vessel and came away  there you are the senior partner cried triumphantly  of course these men can see at a glance how things stand and if things had really been wrong they would have called attention to it  let us have no more of these false alarms  you must say a few words on the point to mr dimsdale as coming from yourself not from me  tell him to be more careful before he jumps to conclusions  i will sir  and bring me ledger no 33  gilray stretched up his arm and took down a fat little ledger from a high shelf which he laid respectfully before his employer then seeing that he was no longer wanted he withdrew  ledger no 33 was secured by a clasp and lockthe latter a patent one which defied all tamperers  john girdlestone took a small key from his pocket and opened it with a quick snap  a precious volume this for it was the merchants private book which alone contained a true record of the financial state of the firm all others being made merely for show without it he would have been unable to keep his son in the dark for so many months until bitter necessity at last compelled him to show his hand  he turned the pages over slowly and sadly  here was a record of the sums sunk in the lake tanganyika gold company which was to have paid 33 per cent and which fell to pieces in the second month of its existence  here was the money advanced to durer hallett  co on the strength of securities which proved to be the flimsiest of insecurities when tested  further on was the account of the dealings of the firm with the levant petroleum company the treasurer of which had levanted with the greater part of the capital  here too was a memorandum of the sums sunk upon the evening star and the providence whose unfortunate collision had wellnigh proved the death blow of the firm it was melancholy reading and perhaps the last page was the most melancholy of all  on it the old man had drawn up in a condensed form an exact account of the present condition of the firms finances here it is exactly word for word as he had written it down himself                            girdlestone  co                                                      october 1876               debit

over these figures very slowly and carefully  he leaned back in his chair and looked up at the ceiling with a much more cheerful expression upon his face  at the worst it is less than thirty thousand pounds  why many firms would think little of it  the fact is that i have so long been accustomed to big balances on the right side that it seems to be a very dreadful thing now that it lies the other way  a dozen things may happen to set all right  i must not forget however he continued with a darker look that i have dipped into my credit so freely that i could not borrow any more without exciting suspicion and having the whole swarm down on us  after all our hopes lie in the diamonds  ezra cannot fail  he must succeed who can prevent him  major tobias clutterbuck cried the sharp creaky voice of gilray as if in answer to the question and the little clerk who had knocked once or twice unnoticed opened the door and ushered in the old campaigner  1 it may be well to remark that this and succeeding incidents occurred in the old crown colony days before the diamond legislation was as strict as it has since become    chapter xviii   major tobias clutterbuck comes in for a thousand pounds  john girdlestone had frequently heard his son speak of the major in the days when they had been intimate and had always attributed some of the young mans more obvious vices to the effects of this ungodly companionship  he had also heard from ezra a mangled version of the interview and quarrel in the private room of nelsons restaurant hence as may be imagined his feelings towards his visitor were far from friendly and he greeted him as he entered with the coldest of possible bows  the major however was by no means abashed by this chilling reception but stumped forward with beaming face and his pudgy hand outstretched so that the other had no alternative but to shake it which he did very gingerly and reluctantly  and how are ye said the major stepping back a pace or two and inspecting the merchant as though he were examining his points with the intention of purchasing him  manys the time ive heard talk of ye its a real treat to see ye  how are ye  pouncing upon the others unresponsive hand he wrung it again with effusion  i am indebted to providence for fairly good health sir john girdlestone answered coldly  may i request you to take a seat  that was what me friend fagan was trying to do for twelve years and ruined himself over it in the ind  he put up at murphytown in the conservative interest and the divil a vote did he get except one and that was a blind man who signed the wrong paper be mistake ha ha the major laughed boisterously at his own anecdote and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief  the two men as they stood opposite each other were a strange contrast the one tall grave white and emotionless the other noisy and pompous with protuberant military chest and rubicund features they had one common characteristic however  from under the shaggy eyebrows of the merchant and the sparse lightcoloured lashes of the major there came the same keen restless shifting glance  both were crafty and each was keenly on his guard against the other  i have heard of you from my son the merchant said motioning his visitor to a chair  you were i believe in the habit of meeting together for the purpose of playing cards billiards and other such games which i by no means countenance myself but to which my son is unhappily somewhat addicted  you dont play yourself said the major in a sympathetic voice ged sir its never too late to begin and many a man has put in a very comfortable old age on billiards and whist  now if ye feel inclined to make a start ill give ye seventyfive points in a hundred for a commincement  thank you said the merchant drily  it is not one of my ambitions was this challenge the business upon which you came  the old soldier laughed until his merriment startled the clerks in the countinghouse  be jabers he said in a wheezy voice dye think i came five miles to do that  no sir i wanted to talk to you about your son  my son  yes your son  hes a smart ladvery smart indeedabout as quick as they make em  he may be a trifle coarse at times but thats the spirit of the age me dear sir  me friend tuffleton of the blues says that delicacy went out of fashion with hair powder and beauty patches hes a demned satirical fellow is tuffleton  dont know him eh  no sir i dont girdlestone said angrily nor have i any desire to make his acquaintance  let us proceed to business for my time is valuable  the major looked at him with an amiable smile  that quick temper runs in the family he said  ive noticed it in your son ezra  as i said before hes a smart lad but me friend hes shockingly rash and extremely indiscrate  ye musk speak to him about it  what do you mean sir asked the merchant white with anger have you come to insult him in his absence  absence said the soldier still smiling blandly over his stock thats the very point i wanted to get at  he is away in africaat the diamond fields  a wonderful interprise conducted with remarkable energy but also with remarkable rashness siryes bedad inexcusable rashness  old girdlestone took up his heavy ebony ruler and played with it nervously  he had an overpowering desire to hurl it at the head of his companion  what would ye say now the veteran continued crossing one leg over the other and arguing the matter out in a confidential undertone what would you say if a young man came to you and on the assumption that you were a dishonest blackgaird appealed to you to help him in a very shady sort of a scheme  it would argue indiscretion on his part would it not  the merchant sat still but grew whiter and whiter  and if on the top of that he gave you all the details of his schame without even waiting to see if you favoured it or not he would be more than indiscrate wouldnt he  your own good sinse me dear sir will tell you that he would be culpably foolishculpably so bedad  well sir said the old man in a hoarse voice  well continued the major i have no doubt that your son told you of the interesting little conversation that we had together  he was good enough to promise that if i went to russia and pretinded to discover a fictitious mine i should be liberally rewarded by the firm  i was under the necessity of pointing out to him that certain principles on which me familyhere the major inflated his cheston which me family are accustomed to act would prevint me from taking advantage of his offer  he then i am sorry to say lost his temper and some words passed between us the result of which was that we parted so rapidly that be jabers  i had hardly time to make him realize how great an indiscretion he had committed  the merchant still sat perfectly still tapping the table with his black ebony ruler  of course afther hearing a skitch of the plan continued the major me curiosity was so aroused that i could not help following the details with intherest  i saw the gintleman who departed for russia langworthy i believe was his name  ged  i knew a chap of that name in the marines who used to drink raw brandy and cayenne pepper before breakfast every morning  did  ye of course you couldnt  what was i talking of at all at all  girdlestone stared gloomily at his visitor  the latter took a pinch of snuff from a tortoiseshell box and flicked away a few wandering grains which settled upon the front of his coat  yes he went on i saw langworthy off to russia  then i saw your son start for africa  hes an interprising lad and sure to do well there coelum non animam mutant as we used to say at clongowes hell always come to the front wherever he is as long as he avoids little slips like this one were spaking of  about the same time i heard that girdlestone  co had raised riddy money to the extint of five and thirty thousand pounds  thats gone to africa too i presume its a lot o money to invist in such a game and it might be safe if you were the only people that knew about it but whin there are others  others  why me of course said the major  i know about it and more be token i am not in the swim with you  sure i could go this very evening to the diamond merchants about town and give them a tip about the coming fall in prices that would rather astonish em  look here major clutterbuck cried the merchant in a voice which quivered with suppressed passion you have come into possession of an important commercial secret  why beat about the bush any longer what is the object of your visit today  what is it that you want  there now the major said addressing himself and smiling more amicably than ever  thats business  bedad theres where you commercial men have the pull  you go straight to the point and stick there  ah when i look at ye i cant help thinking of your son the same intelligent eye the same cheery expression the same devilmaycare manner and dry humour  answer my question will you the merchant interrupted savagely  and the same hasty timper continued the major imperturbably ive forgotten me dear sir what it was you asked me  what is it you want  ah yes of course  what is it i want the old soldier said meditatively  some would say more some less  some would want half but that is overdoing it  how does a thousand pound stroike you yes i think we may put it at a thousand pounds  you want a thousand pounds  ged ive been wanting it all me life  the difference is that im going to git it now  and for what  sure for silencefor neutrality  were all in it now and theres a fair division of labour  you plan your son works i hold me tongue you make your tens of thousands i make my modest little thousand we all git paid for our throuble  and suppose i refuse  ah but you wouldntyou couldnt the major said suavely ged sir i havent known ye long but i have far too high an opinion of ye to suppose ye could do anything so foolish  if you refuse your speculation is thrown away  theres no help for it  bedad it would be painful for me to have to blow the gaff but you know the old saying that charity begins at home  you must sell your knowledge at the best market  girdlestone thought intently for a minute or two with his great eyebrows drawn down over his little restless eyes  you said to my son he remarked at last that you were too honourable to embark in our undertaking  do you consider it honourable to make use of knowledge gained in confidence for the purpose of extorting money  me dear sir answered the major holding up his hand deprecatingly you put me in the painful position of having to explain meself in plain words  if i saw a man about to do a murther i should think nothing of murthering him  if i saw a pickpocket at work id pick his pocket and think it good fun to do it  now this little business of yours is well well say unusual and if what i do seems a little unusual too its to be excused  ye cant throw stones at every one me boy and then be surprised when some one throws one at you  you bite the diamond holders dye see and i take a little nibble at you  its all fair enough  the merchant reflected again for some moments  suppose we agree to purchasing your silence at this price he said what guarantee have we that you will not come and extort more money or that you may not betray our secret after all  the honour of a soldier and a gintleman answered the major rising and tapping his chest with two fingers of his right hand  a slight sneer played over girdlestones pale face but he made no remark  we are in your power he said and have no resource but to submit to your terms  you said five hundred pounds  a thousand the major answered cheerfully  its a great sum of money  deuce of a lot said the veteran cordially  well you shall have it  i will communicate with you girdlestone rose as if to terminate the interview  the major made no remark but he showed his white teeth again and tapped mr girdlestones chequebook with the silver head of his walkingstick  what  now  yes now  the two looked at each other for a moment and the merchant sat down again and scribbled out a cheque which he tossed to his companion  the latter looked it over carefully took a fat little pocketbook from the depths of his breast pocket and having placed the precious slip of paper in it laboriously pushed it back into its receptacle  then he very slowly and methodically picked up his jaunty curlybrimmed hat and shining kid gloves and with a cheery nod to his companion who answered it with a scowl he swaggered off into the countinghouse  there he shook hands with tom whom he had known for some months and having made three successive offersone to stand immediately an unlimited quantity of champagne a second to play him five hundred up for anything he would name and a third to lay a tenner for him at 7 to 4 on amelia for the oaksall of which offers were declined with thankshe bowed himself out leaving a vague memory of smiles shirt collars and gaiters in the minds of the awestruck clerks  whatever an impartial judge might think of the means whereby major tobias clutterbuck had successfully screwed a thousand pounds out of the firm of girdlestone it is quite certain that that gentlemans seasoned conscience did not reproach him in the least degree  on the contrary his whole being seemed saturated and impregnated with the wildest hilarity and delight  twice in less than a hundred yards he was compelled to stop and lean upon his cane owing to the breathlessness which supervened upon his attempts to smother the delighted chuckles which came surging up from the inmost recesses of his capacious frame at the second halt he wriggled his hand inside his tightbreasted coat and after as many contortions as though he were about to shed that garment as a snake does its skin he produced once more the little fat pocketbook  from it he extracted the cheque and looked it over lovingly  then he hailed a passing hansom  drive to the capital and counties bank he said  it had struck him that since the firm was in a shaky state he had better draw the money as soon as possible  in the bank a gloomylooking cashier took the cheque and stared at it somewhat longer than the occasion seemed to demand  it was but a few minutes yet it appeared a very long time to the major  how will you have it he asked at last in a mournful voice  it tends to make a man cynical when he spends his days in handling untold riches while his wife and six children are struggling to make both ends meet at home  a hunthred in gold and the rest in notes said the major with a sigh of relief  the cashier counted and handed over a thick packet of crisp rustling paper and a little pile of shining sovereigns  the major stowed away the first in the pocketbook and the latter in his trouser pockets then he swaggered out with a great increase of pomposity and importance and ordered his cabman to drive to kennedy place  von baumser was sitting in the majors campaigning chair smoking his chinabowled pipe and gazing dreamily at the long blue wreaths times had been bad with the comrades of late as the germans seedy appearance sufficiently testified  his friends in germany had ceased to forward his small remittance and endermanns office in which he had been employed had given him notice that for a time they could dispense with his services  he had been spending the whole afternoon in perusing the long list of wanteds in the daily telegraph and his inkstained forefinger showed the perseverance with which he had been answering every advertisement that could possibly apply to him  a pile of addressed envelopes lay upon the table and it was only the uncertainty of his finances and the fact that the humble penny stamp mounts into shillings when frequently employed that prevented him from increasing the number of his applications  he looked up and uttered a word of guttural greeting as his companion came striding in  get out of this the major said abruptly  get away into the bedroom  potztausand  vot is it then cried the astonished teuton  out with you  i want this room to meself  von baumser shrugged his shoulders and lumbered off like a goodnatured plantigrade closing the door behind him  when his companion had disappeared the major proceeded to lay out all his notes upon the table overlapping each other but still so arranged that every separate one was visible  he then built in the centre ten little golden columns in a circle each consisting of ten sovereigns until the whole presented the appearance of a metallic stonehenge upon a plain of bank notes  this done he cocked his head on one side like a fat and very ruddy turkey and contemplated his little arrangement with much pride and satisfaction  solitary delight soon becomes wearisome however so the veteran summoned his companion  the teuton was so dumbfounded by this display of wealth that he was bereft for a time of all faculty of speech and could only stare openmouthed at the table  at last he extended a forefinger and thumb and rubbed a five pound note between them as though to convince himself of its reality after which he began to gyrate round the table in a sort of war dance never taking his eyes from the heap of influence in front of him  mein gott he exclaimed gnadiger vater  ach himmel  was fur eine schatze  donnerwetter und a thousand other cacophonous expressions of satisfaction and amazement  when the old soldier had sufficiently enjoyed the lively emotion which showed itself on every feature of the germans countenance he picked up the notes and locked them in his desk together with half the gold  the other fifty pounds he returned into his pocket  come on he said to his companion abruptly  come vere  vat is it  come on roared the major irascibly  what dye want to stand asking questions for  put on your hat and come  the major had retained the cab at the door and the two jumped into it drive to verdis restaurant he said to the driver  when they arrived at that aristocratic and expensive establishment the soldier ordered the best dinner for two that money could procure have it riddy in two hours sharp he said to the manager  none of your halfandhalf wines mind  we want the rale thing and be ged we can tell the difference  having left the manager much impressed the two friends set out for a readymade clothing establishment  i wont come in the major said slipping ten sovereigns into von baumsers hand  just you go in and till them ye want the best suit o clothes they can give you  theyve a good seliction there i know  gott in himmel cried the amazed german  but my dear vriend you cannot vait in the street  come in mit me  no ill wait the old soldier answered  they might think i was paying for the clothes if i came in  well but so you  eh would ye roared the major raising his cane and von baumser disappeared precipitately into the shop  when he emerged once more at the end of twenty minutes he was attired in an elegant and closefitting suit of heather tweed  the pair then made successive visits to a shoemaker a hatter and a draper with the result that von baumser developed patent leather boots a jaunty brown hat and a pair of light yellow gloves  by the end of their walk there seemed nothing left of the original von baumser except a tawny beard and an expression of hopeless and overpowering astonishment  having effected this transformation the friends retraced their steps to verdis and did full justice to the spread awaiting them after which the old soldier won the heart of the establishment by bestowing largess upon every one who came in his way  as to the further adventures of these two bohemians it would be as well perhaps to draw a veil over them  suffice it that about two in the morning the worthy mrs robins was awakened by a stentorian voice in the street below demanding to know was ist das deutsche vaterlanda somewhat vexed question which the owner of the said voice was propounding to the solitary lamppost of kennedy place  on descending the landlady discovered that the author of this disturbance was a fashionably dressed gentleman who upon closer inspection proved to her great surprise to be none other than the usually demure part proprietor of her fourth floor  as to the major he walked in quietly the next day about twelve oclock looking as trim and neat as ever but minus the balance of the fifty pounds nor did he think fit ever to make any allusion to this some what heavy deficit    chapter xix   news from the urals  major tobias clutterbuck had naturally reckoned that the longer he withheld this trump card of his the greater would be its effect when played  an obstacle appearing at the last moment produces more consternation than when a scheme is still in its infancy  it proved however that he had only just levied his blackmail in time for within a couple of days of his interview with the head of the firm news arrived of the great discovery of diamonds among the ural mountains  the first intimation was received through the central news agency in the form of the following telegram  moscow august 22it is reported from tobolsk that an important discovery of diamond fields has been made amongst the spurs of the ural mountains at a point not very far from that city  they are said to have been found by an english geologist who has exhibited many magnificent gems in proof of his assertion  these stones have been examined at tobolsk and are pronounced to be equal if not superior in quality to any found elsewhere  a company has been already formed for the purpose of purchasing the land and working the mines  some days afterwards there came a reuters telegram giving fuller details  with regard to the diamond fields near tobolsk it said there is every reason to believe that they are of great and possibly unsurpassed wealth  there is no question now as to their authenticity since their discoverer proves to be an english gentleman of high character and his story is corroborated by villagers from this district who have dug up stones for themselves  the government contemplate buying out the company and taking over the mines which might be profitably worked by the forced labour of political prisoners on a system similar to that adopted in the salt mines of siberia the discovery is universally regarded as one which has materially increased the internal resources of the country and there is some talk of the presentation of a substantial testimonial to the energetic and scientific traveller to whom it is due  within a week or ten days of the receipt of these telegrams in london there came letters from the russian correspondents of the various journals giving fuller details upon a subject of so much general interest  the times directed attention to the matter in a leader  it appears remarked the great paper that a most important addition has been made to the mineral wealth of the russian empire  the silver mines of siberia and the petroleum wells of the caucasus are to be outrivalled by the new diamond fields of the ural mountains  for untold thousands of years these precious fragments of crystallized carbon have been lying unheeded among the gloomy gorges waiting for the hand of man to pick them out  it has fallen to the lot of one of our countrymen to point out to the russian nation the great wealth which lay untouched and unsuspected in the heart of their realm  the story is a romantic one it appears that a mr langworthy a wealthy english gentleman of good extraction had in the course of his travels in russia continued his journey as far as the great mountain barrier which separates europe from asia  being fond of sport he was wandering in search of game down one of the ural valleys when his attention was attracted by the thick gravel which was piled up along the track of a driedup watercourse the appearance and situation of this gravel reminded him forcibly of the south african diamond fields and so strong was the impression that he at once laid down his gun and proceeded to rake the gravel over and to examine it  his search was rewarded by the discovery of several stones which he conveyed home with him and which proved after being cleaned to be gems of the first water  elated at this success he returned to the spot next day with a spade and succeeded in obtaining many other specimens and in convincing himself that the deposit stretched up and down for a long distance on both sides of the torrent  having satisfied himself upon this point our compatriot made his way to tobolsk where he exhibited his prizes to several of the richest merchants and proceeded to form a company for the working of the new fields  he was so successful in this that the shares are already far above par and our correspondent writes that there has been a rush of capitalists all eager to invest their money in so promising a venture  it is expected that within a few months the necessary plant will have been erected and the concern be in working order  the daily telegraph treated the matter from a jocose and historical point of view  it has long been a puzzle to antiquaries and geologists it remarked as to where those jewels which solomon brought from the east were originally obtained  there has been much speculation too regarding the source of those less apocryphal gems which sparkled in the regalia of the indian monarchs and adorned the palaces of delhi and benares as a nation we have a personal interest in the question since the largest and most magnificent of these stones is now in the possession of our most gracious queen  mr langworthy has thrown a light upon this obscure subject  according to this gentlemans researches these treasures were unearthed amidst that dark and gloomy range of mountains which providence has interposed between a nascent civilization and a continent of barbarians  nor is mr langworthys opinion founded upon theory alone  he lends point to his arguments by presenting to the greedy eyes of the merchants of tobolsk a bag filled with valuable diamonds each and every one of which he professes to have discovered in these barren inhospitable valleys  this tweedsuited english tourist descending like some good spirit among these dreamy muscovites points out to them the untold wealth which has lain for so many centuries at their feet and with the characteristic energy of his race shows them at the same time how to turn the discovery to commercial advantage  if the deposit prove to be as extensive as is supposed it is possible that our descendants may wear cut diamonds in their eyeglasses should such accessories be necessary and marvel at the ignorance of those primitive days when a metamorphosed piece of coal was regarded as the most valuable product of nature  the ordinary british paterfamilias glancing over his morning paper bestowed probably but few passing thoughts on the incident but among business men and in the city its significance was at once understood not only did it create the deepest consternation amongst all who were connected with the diamond industry but it reacted upon every other branch of south african commerce  it was the chief subject of conversation upon the stock exchange and many were the surmises as to what the effect of the news would be at the fields  fugger the father of the diamond industry was standing discussing the question when a little rosyfaced jew named goldschmidt came bustling up to him he was much excited for he speculated in stones and had just been buying in for a rise  misther fugger he cried youre shust the man i want to see my gott vot is to become of us all  vot is to become of de diamond trade ven one can pick them up like cockles on the sea shore  we must wait for details the great financier said phlegmatically his fortune was so enormous that it mattered little to him whether the report was true or false  details  it is nothing but details cried the little jew the papers is full of them  i vish to the lord that that langworthy had proke his neck in the ural mountains before he got up to any such games  vat business had he to go examining gravel and peeping about in such places as them  nobody thats any good would ever go to the ural mountains at all  it wont hurt you fugger said youll simply have to pay less for your stones and sell them cheaper after they are cut  it wont make much difference in the long run  vont it by joves  why man ive got over a hundred shtones on my hands now  vat am i going to do vid em  ah thats a bad job  you must make up your mind to lose on them  vont you buy them yourself mr fugger asked the hebrew in an insinuating voice  maybe this here story will all turn out wrong selp me bob i gave three thousand for the lot and you shall have them for two  lets have a deal my tear mr fugger do  no more for me thank you fugger said with decision  as to the story being wrong i have telegraphed to rotterdam and they have sent on a trusty man  hell be weeks however before we hear from him  heres mr girdlestone the great mr girdlestone cried goldschmidt perceiving our worthy merchant of fenchurch street among the crowd oh misther girdlestone ive got diamonds here what is worth three thousand pounds and you shall have them for twoyou shall by chingo and well go together now and get them  dont pester me said girdlestone brushing the little jew aside with his long bony arm  can i have a word with you fugger  certainly replied the diamond dealer  girdlestone was a very wellknown man upon change and one who was universally respected and looked up to  what do you think about this report he asked in a confidential voice  do you imagine that it will affect prices in africa  affect prices  my dear sir if it proves true it will ruin the african fields  the mere report coming in a circumstantial fashion will send prices down fifty per cent  as much as that said the merchant with an excellent affectation of surprise  i am anxious about it for my boy is out there  it was a hobby of his and i let him go  i trust he will not be bitten  he is much more likely to do the biting remarked fugger bluntly he had met ezra girdlestone in business more than once and had been disagreeably impressed by the young gentlemans sharpness  poor lad said his father  he is young and has had little experience as yet  i hope all is well with him  he shook his head despondently and walked slowly homewards but his heart beat triumphantly within him for he was assured now that the report would influence prices as he had foreseen and the african firm reap the benefit of their daring speculation    chapter xx   mr hector oflaherty finds something in the paper  ezra girdlestone had taken up his quarters in two private rooms at the central hotel kimberley and had already gained a considerable reputation in the town by the engaging abandon of his manners and by the munificent style in which he entertained the more prominent citizens of the little capital  his personal qualities of strength and beauty had also won him the respect which physical gifts usually command in primitive communities and the smart young londoner attracted custom to himself among the diggers in a way which excited the jealousy of the whole tribe of elderly hebrews who had hitherto enjoyed a monopoly of the trade  thus he had already gained his object in making himself known and his name was a familiar one in every camp from waldecks plant to cawoods hope  keeping his headquarters at kimberley he travelled perpetually along the line of the diggings  all the time he was chafing secretly and marvelling within himself how it was that no whisper of the expected news had arrived yet from england  one sunny day he had returned from a long ride and having dined strolled out into the streets panama hat upon head and cigar in mouth it was the 23rd of october and he had been nearly ten weeks in the colony  since his arrival he had taken to growing a beard  otherwise he was much as we have seen him in london save that a ruddier glow of health shone upon his sunburned face  the life of the diggings appeared to agree with him  as he turned down stockdale street a man passed him leading a pair of horses tired and dusty with many a strap and buckle hanging down behind them  after him came another leading a second pair and after him another with a third  they were taking them round to the stables hullo cried ezra with sudden interest whats up  the mails just in  mail from capetown  yes  ezra quickened his pace and strode down stockdale street into the main street which as the name implies is the chief thoroughfare of kimberley  he came out close to the office of the vaal river advertiser and diamond field gazette  there was a crowd in front of the door  this vaal river advertiser was a badly conducted newspaper badly printed upon bad paper but selling at sixpence a copy and charging from seven shillings and sixpence to a pound for the insertion of an advertisement  it was edited at present by a certain p hector oflaherty who having been successively a dentist a clerk a provision merchant an engineer and a sign painter and having failed at each and every one of these employments had taken to running a newspaper as an easy and profitable occupation  indeed as managed by mr oflaherty the process was simplicity itself  having secured by the mondays mail copies of the london papers of two months before he spent tuesday in cutting extracts from them with the greatest impartiality chopping away everything which might be of value to him the wednesday was occupied in cursing at three black boys who helped to put up the type and on the thursday a fresh number of the vaal river advertiser and diamond field gazette was given to the world the remaining three days were devoted by mr oflaherty to intoxication but the monday brought him back once more to soda water and literature  it was seldom indeed that the advertiser aroused interest enough to cause any one to assemble round the office  ezras heart gave a quick flutter at the sight and he gathered himself together like a runner who sees his goal in view  throwing away his cigar he hurried on ad joined the little crowd  whats the row he asked  theres news come by the mail said one or two bystanders big news  what sort of news  dont know yet  who said there was news  driver  where is he  dont know  who will know about it  oflaherty  here there was a general shout from the crowd for oflaherty and an irasciblelooking man with a red bloated face and bristling hair came to the office door  now what the divil dye want he roared shaking a quill pen at the crowd  what are ye after at all have ye nothing betther to do than to block up the door of a decent office  whats the news cried a dozen voices  the news is it roared oflaherty more angrily than ever and cant ye foind out that by paying your sixpences like men and taking the advertoiser its a paper though oi says it as shouldnt that would cut out some o these telegraphs and chronicles if it was only in london  begad instead of encouraging local talent ye spind your toime standing around in the strate and trying to suck a mans news out of him for nothing  look here boss said a roughlooking fellow in the front of the crowd you keep your hair on and dont get slinging words about too freely or it may be the worse for you and for your office too we heard as there was big news an we come down to hear it but as to gettin it without paying that aint our sort  i suppose we can call it square if we each hands in sixpence which is the price o your paper and then you can tell us whats on  oflaherty considered for a moment  its worth a shillin each he said for it plays the divil with the circulation of a paper whin its news gits out too soon  well we wont stick at that said the miner  what say you boys  there was a murmur of assent and a broadbrimmed straw hat was passed rapidly from hand to band  it was half full of silver when it reached oflaherty  the advertiser had never before had such a circulation for the crowd had rapidly increased during the preceding dialogue and now numbered some hundreds  thank ye gintlemen said the editor  well whats the news cried the impatient crowd  sure i havent opened the bag yet but i soon will  whativer it is its bound to be there  hey there billy ye divils brat wheres the mail bag  thus apostrophized a sharp little kaffir came running out with the brown bag and mr oflaherty examined it in a leisurely manner which elicited many an oath from the eager crowd  heres the standard and the times he said handing the various papers out to his subordinate  begad theres not one of ye knows the expinse of kaping a great paper loike this going forebye the brains and no profit at the ind of it  heres the post and the news  if you were men youd put in an advertisement ivery wake whether ye needed it or not just to encourage literature  heres the cape argusitll be in here whativer it is  with great deliberation mr hector oflaherty put on a pair of spectacles and folded the paper carefully round so as to bring the principal page to the front  then he cleared his throat with the pomposity which is inseparable with most men from the act of reading aloud  go it boss cried his audience encouragingly  smallpox at wellingtonthats not it is it  germany and the vaticancustom house duties at port elizabethroosian advances in cintral asia eh  is that itdiscovery of great diamond moines  thats it roared the crowd lets hear about that  there was an anxious ring in their voices and their faces were grave and serious as they looked up at the reader upon the steps of the office  diamond moines have been discovered in roosia read oflaherty which are confidently stated to exceed in riches anything which has existed before  it is ginerally anticipated that this discovery if confirmed will have a most prejudicial effect upon the african trade thats an extract from the london news of the argus  a buzz of ejaculations and comments arose from the crowd  isnt there any more about it they cried  heres a later paper boss said the little kaffir who had been diligently looking over the dates  oflaherty opened it and gave a whistle of astonishment heres enough to satisfy you he said  its in big toipe and takes up noigh the whole of the first page  i can only read ye the headings for we must get to work and have out a special edition  youll git details there an itll be out in a few hours  look here at the fuss theyve made about it  the editor turned the paper as he spoke and exhibited a series of large black headings in this style                         russian diamond fields                 extraordinary discovery by an englishman               threatened extinction of the cape industry                         great fall in prices                    opinions of the london press                             full details  what dye think of that cried oflaherty triumphantly as if he had had some hand in the matter  now i must git off to me work and youll have it all before long in your hands  ye should bliss your stars that ye have some one among ye to offer ye the convanience of the latest news  good noight to ye all and he trotted back into his office with his hat and its silver contents in his hand  the crowd broke up into a score of gesticulating chattering groups and wandered up or down the street  ezra girdlestone waited until they had cleared away and then stepped into the office of the advertiser  whats the matter now asked oflaherty angrily  he was a man who lived in a state of chronic irritation  have you a duplicate of that paper  suppose i have  what will you sell it for  what will you give  half a sovereign  a sovereign  done and so ezra girdlestone walked out of the office with full details in his hand and departed to his hotel where he read the account through very slowly and deliberately  it appeared to be satisfactory for he chuckled to himself a good deal as he perused it having finished it he folded the paper up placed it in his breast pocket and having ordered his horse set off to the neighbouring township of dutoitspan with the intention of carrying the news with him  ezra had two motives in galloping across the veldt that october night one was to judge with his own ears and eyes what effect the news would have upon practical men  the other was a desire to gratify that sinister pleasure which an illnatured man has in being the bearer of evil tidings  they had probably heard the report by this time but it was unlikely that any details had reached them  no one knew better than young girdlestone that this message from europe would bring utter ruin and extinction to many a small capitalist that it would mean the shattering of a thousand hopes and the advent of poverty and misery to the men with whom he had been associating  in spite of this knowledge his heart beat high as his fathers had done in london and as he spurred his horse onwards through the darkness he was hardly able to refrain from shouting and whooping in his exultation  the track from kimberley to dutoitspan was a rough one but the moon was up and the young merchant found no difficulty in following it  when he reached the summit of the low hill over which the road ran he saw the lights of the little town sparkling in the valley beneath him  it was ten oclock before he galloped into the main street and he saw at a glance that the news had as he expected arrived before him  in front of the griqualand saloon a great crowd of miners had assembled who were talking excitedly among themselves  the light of the torches shone down upon herculean figures glaring shirts and earnest bearded faces the whole camp appeared to have assembled there to discuss the situation and it was evident from their anxious countenances and subdued voices that they took no light view of it  the instant the young man alighted from his horse he was surrounded by a knot of eager questioners  youve just come from kimberley they cried  what is the truth of it mr girdlestone  let us know the truth of it  its a bad business my friends he answered looking around at the ring of inquiring faces  i have been reading a full account of it in the cape argus  they have made a great find in russia  there seems to be no doubt at all about the matter  dye think it will send prices down here as much as they say  im afraid it will send them very low  i hold a lot of stones myself and i should be very glad to get rid of them at any price  i fear it will hardly pay you to work your claims now  and the price of claims will go down  of course it will  eh mister whats that cried a haggard unkempt little man pushing his way to the front and catching hold of ezras sleeve to ensure his attention  did ye say it would send the price o claims down you didnt say that did you  why in course it stands to reason that what happened in roosia couldnt make no difference over here thats sense mates aint it  he looked round him appealingly and laughed a little nervous laugh  you try said ezra coldly  if you get onethird of what you gave for your claim youll be lucky  why man you dont suppose we produce diamonds for local consumption  they are for exporting to europe and if europe is already supplied by russia where are you to get your market  thats it cried several voices  if you take my advice ezra continued youll get rid of what you have at any loss for the time may be coming when youll get nothing at all  now look at that cried the little man throwing out his hands they call me unlucky jim and unlucky jim ill be to the end of the chapter  why boss me and sammy walker has sunk every damned cent weve got in that claim the fruit o nine years hard work and here you comes ridin up as cool as may be and tells me that its all gone for nothing  well there are others who will suffer as well as you said one of the crowd  i reckon were all hit pretty hard if this is true remarked another  im fair sick of it said the little man passing his grimy hand across his eyes and leaving a black smear as he did so  this aint the first timeno nor the secondthat my luck has played me this trick ive a mighty good mind to throw up my hand altogether  come in and have some whisky said a rough sympathizer and the unlucky one was hustled in through the rude door of the griqualand saloon there to find such comfort as he might from the multitudinous bottles which adorned the interior of that building  liquor had lost its efficacy that evening however and a dead depression rested over the little town  nor was it confined to dutoitspan  all along the diggings the dismal tidings spread with a rapidity which was astonishing  at eleven oclock there was consternation at klipdrift at quarterpast one hebron was up and aghast at the news  at three in the morning a mounted messenger galloped into bluejacket and before daybreak a digger committee was sitting at delportes hope discussing the situation  so during that eventful night down the whole long line of the vaal river there was ruin and heartburning and dismay while five thousand miles away an old gentleman was sleeping calmly and dreamlessly in his comfortable bed from whose busy brain had emanated all this misery and misfortune  perhaps the said old gentleman might have slumbered a little less profoundly could he have seen the sight which met his sons eyes on the following morning  ezra had passed the night at dutoitspan in the hut of a hospitable miner  having risen in the morning he was dressing himself in a leisurely methodical fashion when his host who had been inhaling the morning breeze thrust his head through the window  come out here mr girdlestone he cried  theres some fun on one of the boys is dead drunk and they are carrying him in  ezra pulled on his coat and ran out  a little group of miners were walking slowly up the main street  he and his host were waiting for the procession to pass them with several jocose remarks appropriate to the occasion ready upon their lips when their eyes fell upon a horrible splotchy red track which marked the road the party had taken  they both ran forward with exclamations and inquiries  its jim stewart said one of the bearers  him that they used to call unlucky jim  whats up with him  he has shot himself through the head  where dye think we found him slap in the middle o his own claim with his fingers dug into the gravel as dead as a herring  hes a bad plucked un to knock under like that ezras companion remarked  yes said the croupier of the saloon gambling table  if hed waited for another deal he might have held every trump  he was always a soft chap was jim and he was saying last night as how this spoiled the last chance he was ever like to have of seeing his wife and childer in england  hes blowed a fine clean hole in himself  would you like to see it mr girdlestone  the fellow was about to remove the bloodstained handkerchief which covered the dead mans face but ezra recoiled in horror  mr girdlestone looks faint like some one observed  yes said ezra who was white to his very lips  this has upset me rather  ill have a drop of brandy  as he walked back to the hut he wondered inwardly whether the incident would have discomposed his father  i suppose he would call it part of our commercial finesse he said bitterly to himself  however we have put our hands to the plough and we must not let homicide stop us  so saying he steadied his nerves with a draught of brandy and prepared for the labours of the day    chapter xxi   an unexpected blow  the crisis at the african fields was even more acute than had been anticipated by the conspirators  nothing approaching to it had ever been known in south africa before  diamonds went steadily down in value until they were selling at a price which no dealer would have believed possible and the sale of claims reached such a climax that men were glad to get rid of them for the mere price of the plant and machinery erected at them  the offices of the various dealers at kimberley were besieged night and day by an importunate crowd of miners who were willing to sell at any price in order to save something from the general ruin which they imagined was about to come upon the industry  some more longheaded or more desperate than their neighbours continued to work their claims and to keep the stones which they found until prices might be better  as fresh mails came from the cape however each confirming and amplifying the ominous news these independent workers grew fewer and more fainthearted for their boys had to be paid each week and where was the money to come from with which to pay them the dealers too began to take the alarm and the most tempting offers would hardly induce them to give hard cash in exchange for stones which might prove to be a drug in the market  everywhere there was misery and stagnation  ezra girdlestone was not slow to take advantage of this state of things but he was too cunning to do so in a manner which might call attention to himself or his movements  in his wanderings he had come across an outcast named farintosh a man who had once been a clergyman and a master of arts of trinity college dublin but who was now a brokendown gambler with a slender purse and a still more slender conscience he still retained a plausible manner and an engaging address and these qualities first recommended him to the notice of the young merchant a couple of days after the receipt of the news from europe ezra sent for this fellow and sat with him for some time on the verandah of the hotel talking over the situation  you see farintosh he remarked it might be a false alarm might it not  the exclergyman nodded  he was a man of few words  if it should be it would be an excellent thing for those who buy now  farintosh nodded once again  of course ezra continued it looks as if the thing was beyond all doubt  my experience has taught me however that there is nothing so uncertain as a certainty  thats what makes me think of speculating over this  if i lose it wont hurt me much and i might win  i came out here more for the sake of seeing a little of the world than anything else but now that this has turned up ill have a shy at it  quite so said farintosh rubbing his hands  you see ezra continued lighting a cheroot i have the name here of having a long purse and of knowing which way the wind blows  if i were to be seen buying others would follow my lead and prices would soon be as high as ever  now what i purpose is to work through you dye see you can take out a licence and buy in stones on the quiet without attracting much attention  beat them down as low as you can and give this hotel as your address  when they call here they shall be paid which is better than having you carrying the money round with you  the clergyman scowled as though he thought it was anything but better he did not make any remark however  you can get one or two fellows to help you said ezra  ill pay for their licences  i cant expect you to work all the camps yourself of course if you offer more for a stone than i care to give thats your look out but if you do your work well you shall not be the loser you shall have a percentage on business done and a weekly salary as well  how much money do you care to invest asked farintosh  im not particular ezra answered  if i do a thing i like to do it well  ill go the length of thirty thousand pounds  farintosh was so astonished at the magnitude of the sum that he sank back in his chair in bewilderment  why sir he said i think just at present you could buy the country for that  ezra laughed  well make it go as far as we can he said  of course you may buy claims as well as stones  and i have carte blanche to that amount  certainly  all right ill begin this evening said the exparson  and picking up his slouched hat which he still wore somewhat broader in the brim than his comrades in deference to old associations he departed upon his mission  farintosh was a clever man and soon chose two active subordinates these were a navvy named burt and williams a young welshman who had disappeared from home behind a cloud of forged cheques and having changed his name had made a fresh start in life to the south of the equator  these three worked day and night buying in stones from the more needy and impecunious miners to whom ready money was a matter of absolute necessity  farintosh bought in the stock too of several small dealers whose nerves had been shaken by the panic  in this way bag after bag was filled with diamonds by ezra while he himself was to all appearances doing nothing but smoking cigars and sipping brandyandwater in front of the central hotel  he was becoming somewhat uneasy in his mind as to how long the delusion would be kept up or how soon news might come from the cape that the ural find had been examined into and had proved to be a myth  in any case he thought that he would be free from suspicion  still it might be as well for him by that time to be upon his homeward journey for he knew that if by any chance the true facts leaked out there would be no hope of mercy from the furious diggers  hence he incited farintosh to greater speed and that worthy divine with his two agents worked so energetically that in less than a week there was little left of five and thirty thousand pounds  ezra girdlestone had shown his power of reading character when he chose the exclergyman as his subordinate  it is possible however that the young mans judgment had been inferior to his powers of observation a clever man as a trusty ally is a valuable article but when the said cleverness may be turned against his employer the advantage becomes a questionable one  it was perfectly evident to farintosh that though a stray capitalist might risk a thousand pounds or so on a speculation of this sort rothschild himself would hardly care to invest such a sum as had passed through his hands without having some ground on which to go  having formed this conclusion and having also turned over in his mind the remarkable coincidence that the news of this discovery in russia should follow so very rapidly upon the visit of the junior partner of the house of girdlestone the astute clergyman began to have some dim perception of the truth  hence he brooded a good deal as he went about his work and cogitated deeply in a manner which was once again distinctly undesirable in so very intelligent a subordinate  these broodings and cogitations culminated in a meeting which was held by him with his two subagents in the private parlour of the diggers retreat  it was a lowroofed smokestained room with a profusion of spittoons scattered over it which to judge by the condition of the floor the patrons of the establishment had taken some pains to avoid round a solid oldfashioned table in the centre of this apartment sat ezras staff of assistants the parson thoughtful but selfsatisfied the others sullen and inquisitive  farintosh had convened the meeting and his comrades had an idea that there was something in the wind they applied themselves steadily therefore to the bottle of hollands upon the table and waited for him to speak  well the exclergyman said at last the game is nearly over and well not be wanted any more  girdlestones off to england in a day or two  burt and williams groaned sympathetically  work was scarce in the diggings during the crisis and their agencies had been paying them well  yes hes off farintosh went on glancing keenly at his companions and he takes with him five and thirty thousand pounds worth of diamonds that we bought for him  poor devils like us burt have to do the work and then are thrown aside as you would throw your pick aside when you are done with it  when he sells out in london and makes his pile it wont much matter to him  that the three men who helped him are starving in griqualand  wont he give us somethin at partin asked burt the navvy  he was a savagelooking hairy man with a brickcoloured face and overhanging eyebrows  wont he give us nothing to remembrance him by  give you something farintosh said with a sneer  why man he says you are too well paid already  does he though cried the navvy flushing even redder than nature had made him  is that the way he speaks after we makes him  it aint on the square  i likes to see things honest an above board betwixt man an man and this pitchin of them as has helped ye over aint that  farintosh lowered his voice and bent further over the table his companions involuntarily imitated his movement until the three cunning cruel faces were looking closely into one anothers eyes  nobody knows that he holds those stones said farintosh  hes too smart to let it out to any one but ourselves  where does he keep em asked the welshman  in a safe in his room  where is the key  on his watchchain  could we get an impression  i have one  then i can make one cried williams triumphantly  its done said farintosh taking a small key from his pocket this is a duplicate and will open the safe  i took the moulding from his key while i was speaking to him  the navvy laughed hoarsely  if that dont lick creation for smartness he cried  and how are we to get to this safe  it would serve him right if we collar the lot  itll teach him that if he aint honest by nature hes got to be when he deals with the like of us i like straightness and by the lord ill have it  he brought his great fist down upon the table to emphasize this commendable sentiment  its not an easy matter farintosh said thoughtfully  when he goes out he locks his door and theres no getting in at the window  theres only one chance for us that i can see  his room is a bit cut off from the rest of the hotel  theres a gallery of twenty feet or more that leads to it  now i was thinking that if the three of us were to visit him some evening just to wish him luck on his journey as it were and if while we were in the room something sudden was to happen which would knock him silly for a minute or two we might walk off with the stones and be clean gone before he could raise an alarm  and what would knock him silly asked williams  he was an unhealthy scorbuticlooking youth and his pallid complexion had assumed a greenish tinge of fear as he listened to the clergymans words he had the makings in him of a mean and dangerous criminal but not of a violent onebelonging to the jackal tribe rather than to the tiger  what would knock him senseless farintosh asked burt with a knowing look  burt laughed again in his bushy red beard  you can leave that to me mate he said  williams glanced from one to the other and he became even more cadaverous  im not in it he stammered  it will be a hanging job you will kill him as like as not  not in it aint ye growled the navvy  why you whitelivered hound youre too deep in it ever to get out again  dye think well let you spoil a lay of this sort as we might never get a chance of again  you can do it without me said the welshman trembling in every limb  and have you turnin on us the moment a reward was offered  no no chummy you dont get out of it that way  if you wont stand by us ill take care you dont split  think of the diamonds farintosh put in  think of your own skin said the navvy  you could go back to england a rich man if you do it  youll never go back at all if you dont  thus worked upon alternately by his hopes and by his fears williams showed some signs of yielding  he took a long draught from his glass and filled it up again  i aint afraid he said  dont imagine that i am afraid  you wont hit him very hard mr burt  just enough to curl him up the navvy answered  lord love ye it aint the first man by many a one that ive laid on his back though i never had the chance before of fingering five and thirty thousand pounds worth of diamonds for my pains  but the hotelkeeper and the servants  thats all right said farintosh  you leave it to me  if we go up quietly and openly and come down quietly and openly who is to suspect anything  our horses will be outside in woodley street and well be out of their reach in no time  shall we say tomorrow evening for the job  thats very early williams cried tremulously  the sooner the better burt said with an oath  and look here young man fixing williams with his bloodshot eyes one sign of drawing back and by the living jingo ill let you have more than im keeping for him  you hear me eh  he grasped the youths white wrist and squeezed it in his iron grip until he writhed with the pain  oh im with you heart and soul he cried  im sure what you and mr farintosh advise must be for the best  meet here at eight oclock tomorrow night then said the leader we can get it over by nine and we will have the night for our escape ill have the horses ready and it will be strange if we dont get such a start as will puzzle them  so having arranged all the details of their little plan these three gentlemen departed in different directionsfarintosh to the central hotel to give ezra his evening report and the others to the miningcamps which were the scene of their labours  the meeting just described took place upon a tuesday early in november on the saturday ezra girdlestone had fully made up his mind to turn his back upon the diggings and begin his homeward journey  he was pining for the pleasures of his old london life and was weary of the monotonous expanse of the south african veldt  his task was done too and it would be well for him to be at a distance before the diggers discovered the manner in which they had been hoaxed  he began to pack his boxes therefore and to make every preparation for his departure  he was busily engaged in this employment upon the wednesday evening when there was a tap at the door and farintosh walked in accompanied by burt and williams  girdlestone glanced up at them and greeted them briefly he was not surprised at their visit for they had come together several times before to report progress or make arrangements  farintosh bowed as he entered the room burt nodded and williams rubbed his hands together and looked amiably bilious  we looked in mr girdlestone farintosh began to learn if you had any commands for us  i told you before that i had not ezra said curtly  i am going on saturday  i have made a mistake in speculating on those diamonds prices are sinking lower and lower  i am sorry to hear that said farintosh sympathetically  maybe the market will take a turn  let us hope so the merchant answered  it doesnt look like it  but you are satisfied with us guvnor burt struck in pushing his bulky form in front of farintosh  we have done our work all right havent we  i have nothing to complain of ezra said coldly  well then guvnor you surely aint going away without leaving us nothing to remembrance you with seeing that weve stood by you and never gone back on you  you have been paid every week for what you have done the young man said  you wont get another penny out of me so you set your mind at rest about that  you wont give us nothing cried the navvy angrily  no i wont and ill tell you what it is burt big as you are if you dare to raise your voice in my presence ill give you the soundest hiding that ever you had in your life  ezra had stood up and showed every indication of being as good as his word  dont let us quarrel the last time we may meet farintosh cried intervening between the two  it is not money we expect from you all we want is a drain of rum to drink success to you with  oh if thats all said the young merchantand turned round to pick up the bottle which stood on a table behind him  quick as a flash burt sprang upon him and struck him down with a lifepreserver  with a gasping cry and a heavy thud ezra fell face downwards upon the floor the bottle still clutched in his senseless hand and the escaping rum forming a horrible mixture with the blood which streamed from a great gash in his head  very neatvery pretty indeed cried the exparson in a quiet tone of critical satisfaction as a connoisseur might speak of a specimen which interested him  he was already busy at the door of the safe  well done mr burt well done cried williams in a quivering voice and going up to the body he kicked it in the side  you see i am not afraid mr burt am i  stow your gab snarled the navvy  heres the rum all gettin loose picking up the bottle he took a pull of what was left in it heres the bag parson he whispered pulling a black linen bag from his pocket  we havent made much noise over the job  here are the stones said farintosh in the same quiet voice hold the mouth open  he emptied an avalanche of diamonds into the receptacle  here are some notes and gold  we may as well have them too  now tie it up carefully  thats the way  if we meet any one on the stairs take it coolly  turn that lamp out williams so that if any one looks in hell see nothing  come along  the guilty trio stole out of the room bearing their plunder with them and walked down the passage of the hotel unmolested and unharmed  the moon as it rose over the veldt that night shone on three horsemen spurring it along the capetown road as though their very lives depended upon their speed  its calm clear rays streamed over the silent roofs of kimberley and in through a particular window of the central hotel throwing silvery patches upon the carpet and casting strange shadows from the figure which lay as it had fallen huddled in an ungainly heap upon the floor    chapter xxii   robbers and robbed  it might perhaps have been as well for the curtailing of this narrative and for the interests of the world at large if the blow dealt by the sturdy right arm of the navvy had cut short once for all the career of the junior african merchant  ezra however was endowed with a rare vitality which enabled him not only to shake off the effects of his mishap but to do so in an extraordinarily short space of time there was a groan from the prostrate figure then a feeble movement then another and a louder groan and then an oath  gradually raising himself upon his elbow he looked around him in a bewildered way with his other hand pressed to the wound at the back of his head from which a few narrow little rivulets of blood were still meandering  his glance wandered vaguely over the table and the chairs and the walls until it rested upon the safe  he could see in the moonlight that it was open and empty  in a moment the whole circumstances of the case came back to him and he staggered to the door with a hoarse cry of rage and of despair  whatever ezras faults may have been irresolution or want of courage were not among them  in a moment he grasped the situation and realized that it was absolutely essential that he should act and at once the stones must be recovered or utter and irretrievable ruin stared him in the face  at his cries the landlord and several attendants white and black came rushing into the room  ive been robbed and assaulted ezra said steadying himself against the mantelpiece for he was still weak and giddy  dont all start cackling but do what i ask you  light the lamp  the lamp was lit and there was a murmur from the little knot of employees reinforced by some late loungers at the bar as they saw the disordered room and the great crimson patch upon the carpet  the thieves called at nine said ezra talking rapidly but collectedly  their names were farintosh burt and williams we talked for some little time so they probably did not leave the house before a quarter past at the soonest  it is now halfpast ten so they have no very great start  you jamieson and you van muller run out and find if three men have been seen getting away  perhaps they took a buggy  go up and down and ask all you see  you jones go as hard as you can to inspector ainslie  tell him there has been robbery and attempted murder and say that i want half a dozen of his best mounted mennot his best men you understand but his best horses i shall see that he is no loser if he is smart  wheres my servant pete  pete you dog get my horse saddled and bring her round she ought to be able to catch anything in griqualand  as ezra gave his orders the men hurried off in different directions to carry them out  he himself commenced to arrange his dress and tied a handkerchief tightly round his head  surely you are not going sir the landlord said you are not fit  fit or not i am going ezra said resolutely  if i have to be strapped to my horse ill go  send me up some brandy  put some in a flask too  i may feel faint before i get back  a great concourse of people had assembled by this time attracted by the report of the robbery  the whole square in front of the hotel was crowded with diggers and storekeepers and innumerable kaffirs all pressing up to the portico in the hope of hearing some fresh details mr hector oflaherty over the way was already busy setting up his type in preparation for a special edition in which the vaal river advertiser should give its version of the affair  in the office the great man himself who was just convalescing from an attack of ardent spirits was busily engaged with a wet towel round his head writing a leader upon the event  this production which was very sonorous and effective was peppered all over with such phrases as protection of property outraged majesty of the law and scum of civilization expressions which had been used so continuously by mr oflaherty that he had come to think that he had a copyright in them and loudly accused the london papers of plagiarism if he happened to see them in their columns  there was a buzz of excitement among the crowd when ezra appeared on the steps of the hotel looking as white as a sheet with a handkerchief bound round his head and his collar all crusted with blood  as he mounted his horse one of his emissaries rushed to him  if you please sir he said they have taken the capetown road a dozen people saw them  their horses were not up to much for i know the man they got them from  you are sure to catch them  a smile played over ezras pale face which boded little good for the fugitives  curse those police he cried are they never going to come  here they are said the landlord and sure enough with a jingling of arms and a clatter of hoofs half a dozen of the griqualand mounted constabulary trotted through the crowd and drew up in front of the steps  they were smart active young fellows armed with revolver and sabre and their horses were tough brutes uncomely to look at but with wonderful staying power  ezra noted the fact with satisfaction as he rode up to the grizzled sergeant in command  theres not a moment to be lost sergeant he said  they have an hour and a halfs start but their cattle are not up to much  come on its the capetown road  a hundred pounds if we catch them  threes roared the sergeant  right half turntrot the crowd split asunder and the little troop with ezra at their head clove a path through them  gallop shouted the sergeant and away they clattered down the high street of kimberley striking fire out of the stone and splashing up the gravel until the sound of their hoofs died away into a dull subdued rattle and finally faded altogether from the ears of the listening crowd  for the first few miles the party galloped in silence  the moon was still shining brilliantly and they could see the white line of the road stretching out in front of them and winding away over the undulating veldt  to right and left spread a broad expanse of wiry grass stretching to the horizon with low bushes and scrub scattered over it in patches  here and there were groups of longlegged unhealthylooking sheep who crashed through the bushes in wild terror as the riders swept by them  their plaintive calls were the only sounds which broke the silence of the night save the occasional dismal hooting of the veldt owl  ezra on his powerful grey had been riding somewhat ahead of the troopers but the sergeant managed to get abreast of him  beg pardon sir he said raising his hand to his kepi but dont you think this pace is too good to last the horses will be blown  as long as we catch them ezra answered i dont care what becomes of the horses  i would sooner stand you a dozen horses apiece than let them get away  the young merchants words were firm and his seat steady in spite of the throbbing at his head  the fury in his heart supplied him with strength and he gnawed his moustache in his impatience and dug his spurs into his horses flanks until the blood trickled down its glossy coat  fortune reputation above all revenge all depended upon the issue of this headlong chase through the darkness  the sergeant and ezra galloped along leather to leather and rein to rein while the troop clattered in their rear  theres combrink about two miles further on said the sergeant we will hear news of them there  they cant get off the high road can they  not likely sir  they couldnt get along as fast anywhere else indeed its hardly safe riding across the veldt  they might be down a pit before they knew of it  as long as they are on the road we must catch them quoth ezra for if it ran straight from here to hell i would follow them there  and wed stand by you sir said the sergeant catching something of his companions enthusiasm  at this pace if the horses hold out we might catch them before morning  there are the lights of the shanty  as he spoke they were galloping round a long curve in the road at the further end of which there was a feeble yellow glimmer  as they came abreast of it they saw that the light came through an open door in the centre of which a burly afrikaner was standing with his hands in his breeches pockets and his pipe in his mouth  good evening said the sergeant as his men pulled up their reeking horses  has any one passed this way before us  many a tausand has passed this way before you said the dutchman taking his pipe out of his mouth to laugh  tonight man tonight the sergeant cried angrily  oh yes down the port elizabeth road there not one hour ago  three men riding fit to kill their horses  thatll do ezra shouted and away they went once more down the broad white road  they passed bluewaters drift at two in the morning and were at van haydens farm at halfpast  at three they left the modder river far behind them and at a quarter past four they swept down the main street of the little township of jacobsdal their horses weak and weary and all mottled with foam  there was a police patrol in the street  has any one passed cried the sergeant  three men a quarter of an hour ago  have they gone on  straight on  their horses were nearly dead beat though  come on cried ezra eagerly  come on  four of the horses are exhausted sir said the sergeant they cant move another step  come on without them then  the patrol could come the sergeant suggested  i should have to report myself at the office sir said the trooper  jump on to his horse sergeant cried ezra  he can take yours to report himself on  now then you and i at least are bound to come up with them  forward gallop and they started off once more on their wild career rousing the quiet burghers of jacobsdal by the wild turmoil of their hoofs  out once more upon the port elizabeth road it was a clear race between the pursuers and the pursued  the former knew that the fugitives were it daytime would possibly be within sight of them and the thought gave them additional ardour  the sergeant having a fresh horse rode in front his head down and his body forward getting every possible inch of pace out of the animal  at his heels came ezra on his gallant grey the bloodstained handkerchief fluttering from his head  he was sitting very straight in his saddle with a set stern smile upon his lips in his right hand he held a cocked revolver  a hundred yards or so behind them the two remaining troopers came toiling along upon their weary nags working hard with whip and spur to stimulate them to further exertions  away in the east a long rosy streak lay low upon the horizon which showed that dawn was approaching and a grey light stole over the landscape  suddenly the sergeant pulled his horse up  theres some one coming towards us he cried  ezra and the troopers halted their panting steeds  through the uncertain light they saw a solitary horseman riding down the road at first they had thought that it might possibly be one of the fugitives who had turned but as he came nearer they perceived that it was a stranger  his clothes were so dusty and his horse so foamflecked and weary that it was evident that he also had left many a long mile of road behind him  have you seen three men on horseback cried ezra as he approached  i spoke to them the traveller answered  they are about half a mile ahead  come on come on ezra shouted  i am bringing news from jagersfontein the man said  come on ezra interrupted furiously and the horses stretched their stiff limbs into a feeble lumbering gallop  ezra and the sergeant shot to the front and the others followed as best they might  suddenly in the stillness they heard far away a dull rattling sound like the clatter of distant castanets  its their horses hoofs cried ezra and the troopers behind raised a cheer to show that they too understood the significance of the sound  it was a wild lonely spot where the plain was bare even of the scanty foliage which usually covered it  here and there great granite rocks protruded from the brown soil as though natures covering had in bygone days been rent until her gaunt bones protruded through the wound as ezra and the sergeant swept round a sharp turn in the road they saw some little way ahead of them the three fugitives enveloped in a cloud of dust  almost at the same moment they heard a shout and crash behind them and looking round saw a confused heap upon the ground the horse of the leading trooper had fallen from pure fatigue and had rolled over upon its rider  the other trooper had dismounted and was endeavouring to extricate his companion  let us see if he is hurt the sergeant cried  on on shouted ezra whose passion was increased by the sight of the thieves  not a foot back  he may have broken his neck grumbled the sergeant drawing his revolver  have your pistol ready sir  we shall be up with them in a few minutes and they may show fight  they were up with them rather sooner than the policeman expected farintosh finding that speed was of no avail and that the numbers of his pursuers was now reduced to two had recourse to strategy  there was a sharp turn in the road a hundred yards ahead and on reaching it the three flung themselves off their horses and lay down behind cover as ezra and the sergeant the grey horse and the bay came thundering round the curve there was a fierce splutter of pistol shots from amongst the bushes and the grey sank down upon its knees with a sobbing moan struck mortally in the head  ezra sprang to his feet and rushed at the ambuscade while the sergeant who had been grazed on the cheek by the first volley jumped from his horse and followed him  burt and farintosh met them foot to foot with all the saxon gallantry which underlies the saxon brutality  burt stabbed at the sergeant and struck him through the muscle of the neck  farintosh fired at the policeman and was himself shot down by ezra  burt seeing his companion fall sprang past his two assailants with a vicious side blow at the merchant and throwing himself upon the sergeants horse regardless of a bullet from the latters revolver he galloped away and was speedily out of range  as to williams from the beginning of the skirmish he had lain face downwards upon the ground twisting his thin limbs about in an agony of fear and howling for mercy  hes gone ezra said ruefully gazing after the fugitive  we have nothing to go after him with  im wellnigh gone myself said the policeman mopping up the blood from his stab which was more painful than dangerous  he has given me a nasty prod  never mind my friend you shall not be the loser  get up you little viperthis to williams who was still writhing himself into the most extraordinary attitudes  oh please mr girdlestone he cried clutching at ezras boots with his long thin fingers it wasnt me that hit you  it was mr burt i had nothing to do with robbing you either  that was mr farintosh i wouldnt have gone with him only i knew that he was a clergyman so i expected no harm  i am surprised at you mr farintosh i really am im very glad that mr girdlestone has shot you  the exparson was sitting with his back against a gnarled stump which gave him some support  he had his hand to his chest and as he breathed a ghastly whistling sound came from the wound and spirts of blood rushed from his mouth  his glazed eyes were fixed upon the man who had shot him and a curious smile played about his thin lips  come here mr girdlestone he croaked come here  ezra strode over to him with a face as inexorable as fate  youve done for me said farintosh faintly  its a queer end for the best man of his year at trinitymaster of arts sir and jacksonian prizeman  not much worth now is it  whod have thought then that i should have died like a dog in this wilderness  whats the odds how a man dies though  if id kept myself straight i should have gone off a few years later in a feather bed as the dean of st patricks may be what will that matter  ive enjoyed myselfthe dying mans eyes glistened at the thought of past dissipations  if i had my time to do over again he continued id enjoy myself the same way  im not penitent sir  no deathbed snivelling about me or short cuts into heaven  thats not what i wanted to say though  i have a choking in the throat but i dare say you can hear what i am driving at  you met a man riding towards jacobsdal did you not  ezra nodded sullenly  you didnt speak to him  too busy trying to catch yours truly eh will you have your stones back for they are in the bag by my side but theyll not be very much good to you  the little spec wont come off this time  you dont know what the news was that the man was bringing  a vague feeling of impending misfortune stole over ezra  he shook his head  his news was said farintosh leaning up upon his hand that fresh diamond fields have been discovered at jagersfontein in the orange free state  so russia or no russia stones will not rise  ha ha will not rise  look at his face  its whiter than mine  ha ha ha with the laugh upon his lips a great flow of blood stopped the clergymans utterance and he rolled slowly over upon his side a dead man    chapter xxiii   a momentous resolution  during the months which ezra girdlestone had spent in africa the affairs of the firm in fenchurch street had been exceedingly prosperous trade upon the coast had been brisker than usual and three of the companys ships had come in at short intervals with excellent cargoes among these was the black eagle which to the astonishment of captain hamilton miggs and the disgust of his employer had weathered a severe gale in the channel and had arrived safe and sound once more  this run of luck supplemented by the business capacity of the old merchant and the indomitable energy of young dimsdale made the concern look so flourishing that the former felt more than ever convinced that if he could but stave off the immediate danger things would soon right themselves  hence he read with delight the letters from africa in which his son narrated the success of the conspiracy and the manner in which the miners had been hoodwinked  the old mans figure grew straighter and his step more firm as the conviction grew upon him that the company would soon return once again to its former condition of affluence  it may be imagined therefore that when the rumours of a bona fide diamond find in the orange free state came to his ears john girdlestone was much agitated and distressed  on the same day that he saw the announcement in the papers he received a letter from his son announcing the failure of their enterprise  after narrating the robbery the pursuit the death of farintosh and the announcement of the new discovery it gave an account of his subsequent movements  there was no doubt about the truth of the scoundrels words he said for when we went to the nearest farm to get some food and have the sergeants wound dressed we found that every one was talking about it there was a chap there who had just come from the state and knew all about it  after hearing the details from him i saw that there was no doubt of the genuineness of the thing  the police rode back to jacobsdal with williams and i promised to come after them but when i came to think it over it didnt seem good enough the fact of my having so many diamonds would set every tongue wagging and again the sergeant had heard what farintosh said to me so it was very possible that i might have the whole district about my ears  as it was i had the stones and all my money in the bag  i wrote back to the hotel therefore telling the landlord to send on my traps to cape town by mail and promising to settle my bill with him when i received them i then bought a horse and came straight south  i shall take the first steamer and be with you within a few days of your receiving this  as to our speculation it is of course all up  even when the russian business proves to be a hoax the price of stones will remain very low on account of these new fields  it is possible that we may sell our lot at some small profit but it wont be the royal road to a fortune that you prophesied nor will it help the firm out of the rut into which you have shoved it  my only regret in leaving africa like this is that that vermin williams will have no one to prosecute him  my head is almost well now  this letter was a rude shock to the african merchant  within a week of the receipt of it his son ezra gloomy and travelstained walked into the sanctum at fenchurch street and confirmed all the evil tidings by word of mouth  the old man was of too tough a fibre to break down completely but his bony hands closed convulsively upon the arms of the chair and a cold perspiration broke out upon his wrinkled forehead as he listened to such details as his son vouchsafed to afford him  you have your stones all safe though he stammered out at last  they are in my box at home said ezra gloomy and morose leaning against the white marble mantelpiece  the lord knows what they are worth  well be lucky if we clear as much as they cost and a margin for my expenses and langworthys  a broken head is all that i have got from your fine scheme  who could foresee such a thing the old man said plaintively he might have added major clutterbucks thousand pounds as another item to be cleared but he thought it as well to keep silent upon the point  any fool could foresee the possibility of it quoth ezra brusquely  the fall in prices is sure to be permanent then the old man asked  it will last for some years any way ezra answered the jagersfontein gravel is very rich and there seems to be plenty of it  and within a few months we must repay both capital and interest we are ruined  the old merchant spoke in a broken voice and his head sank upon his breast  when that day comes he continued the firm which has been for thirty years above reproach and a model to the whole city will be proclaimed as a bankrupt concern  worse still it will be shown to have been kept afloat for years by means which will be deemed fraudulent  i tell you my dear son that if any means could be devised which would avert thisany meansi should not hesitate to adopt them  i am a frail old man and i feel that the short balance of my life would be a small thing for me to give in return for the assurance that the work which i have built up should not be altogether thrown away  your life cannot affect the matter one way or the other unless it were more heavily insured than it is ezra said callously though somewhat moved by his fathers intensity of manner  perhaps there is some way out of the wood yet he added in a more cheerful tone  its so paying so prosperousthats what goes to my heart  if it had ruined itself it would be easier to bear it but it is sacrificed to outside speculationsmy wretched wretched speculations  that is what makes it so hard he touched the bell and gilray answered the summons listen to this ezra  what was our turn over last month gilray  fifteen thousand pounds sir said the little clerk bobbing up and down like a buoy in a gale in his delight at seeing the junior partner once again  and the expenses  nine thousand three hundred  uncommon brown you look mr ezra to be sure uncommon brown and well  i hopes as you enjoyed yourself in africa sir and was too much for them hottenpots and boars  with this profound ethnological remark mr gilray bobbed himself out of the room and went back radiantly to his inkstained desk  look at that the old man said when the click of the outer door showed that the clerk was out of earshot  over five thousand profit in a month  is it not terrible that such a business should go to ruin what a fortune it would have been for you  by heavens it must be saved cried ezra with meditative brows and hands plunged deep in his trouser pockets  there is that girls money could we not get the temporary use of it  impossible his father answered with a sigh  it is so tied up in the will that she cannot sign it away herself until she comes of age there is no way of touching it except by her marriageor by her death  then we must have it by the only means open to us  and that is  i must marry her  you will  i shall  here is my hand on it  then we are saved cried the old man throwing up his tremulous hands girdlestone  son will weather the storm yet  but girdlestone becomes a sleeping partner said ezra  its for my own sake i do it and not for yours with which frank remark he drew his hat down over his brows and set off for eccleston square    chapter xxiv   a dangerous promise  during ezra girdlestones absence in africa our heroines life had been even less eventful than of old  there was a consistency about the merchants establishment which was characteristic of the man  the house itself was austere and gloomy and every separate room in spite of profuse expenditure and gorgeous furniture had the same air of discomfort  the servants too were with one single exception from the hardvisaged housekeeper to the calvinistic footman a depressing and melancholy race  the only departure from this general rule was kates own maid rebecca taylforth a loudlydressed darkeyed coarsevoiced young woman who raised up her voice and wept when ezra departed for africa  this damsels presence was most disagreeable to kate and indeed to john girdlestone also who only retained her on account of his sons strong views upon the subject and out of fear of an explosion which might wreck all his plans  the old merchant was kates only companion during this period and their conversation was usually limited to a conventional inquiry at breakfast time as to each others health  on his return from the city in the evening girdlestone was always in a moody humour and would eat his dinner hastily and in silence  after dinner he was in the habit of reading methodically the various financial articles in the days papers which would occupy him until bedtime  occasionally his companion would read these aloud to him and such was the monotony of her uneventful life that she found herself becoming insensibly interested in the fluctuations of grand trunk scrip or ohio and delaware shares the papers once exhausted a bell was rung to summon the domestics and when all were assembled the merchant in a hard metallic voice read through the lesson for the day and the evening prayers  on grand occasions he supplemented this by a short address in the course of which he would pelt his frightened audience with hard jagged texts until he had reduced them to a fitting state of spiritual misery  no wonder that under the influence of such an existence the roses began to fade from his wards cheeks and her youthful heart to grow sad and heavy  one daily tonic there was however which never deserted her strictly as girdlestone guarded her and jealously as he fenced her off from the outer world he was unable to prevent this one little ray of light penetrating her prison  with an eye to the future he had so placed her that it seemed to him to be impossible that any sympathy could reach her from the outside world  visits and visitors were alike forbidden to her  on no consideration was she to venture out alone in spite of all his precautions however love has many arts and wiles which defy all opposition and which can outplot the deepest of plotters  eccleston square was by no means in a direct line between kensington and the city yet morning and evening as sure as the clock pointed to halfpast nine and to quarter to six tom would stride through the oldfashioned square and past the grim house whose grimness was softened to his eyes through its association with the bright dream of his life  it was but the momentary glance of a sweet face at the upper window and a single wave of a white hand but it sent him on with a fresh heart and courage and it broke the dull monotony of her dreary life  occasionally as we have seen he even managed to find his way into the interior of this ogres castle in which his fair princess was immured john girdlestone put an end to this by ordering that business messages should never under any circumstances be conveyed to his private residence  nothing daunted however the lovers soon devised another means of surmounting the barrier which divided them  the centre of the square was taken up by a garden rectangular and uninviting fenced round with high forbidding walls which shut out all intruders and gave the place a resemblance to the exercise ground of a prison  within the rails were clumps of bushes and here and there a few despondent trees drooped their heads as though mourning over the uncongenial site in which they had been planted  among these trees and bushes there were scattered seats and the whole estate was at the disposal of the inhabitants of eccleston square and was dignified by the name of the eccleston gardens  this was the only spot in which kate was trusted without the surveillance of a footman and it was therefore a favourite haunt of hers where she would read or work for hours under the shelter of the scanty foliage  hence it came about that one day as thomas dimsdale was making his way cityward at a rather earlier hour than was customary with him he missed the usual apparition at the window  looking round blankly in search of some explanation of this absence he perceived in the garden a pretty white bonnet which glinted among the leaves and on closer inspection a pair of bright eyes which surveyed him merrily from underneath it the gate was open and in less time than it takes to tell it the sacrilegious feet of the young man had invaded the sacred domains devoted to the sole use and behoof of the ecclestonians  it may be imagined that he was somewhat late at the office that morning and on many subsequent mornings until the clerks began to think that their new employer was losing the enthusiasm for business which had possessed him  tom frequently begged permission to inform mr girdlestone of his engagement but kate was inflexible upon that point  the fact is that she knew her guardians character very much better than her lover did and remembering his frequent exhortations upon the subject of the vanity and wickedness of such things she feared the effects of his anger when he learned the truth  in a year or so she would be of age and her own mistress but at present she was entirely in his power  why should she subject herself to the certainty of constant harshness and unkindness which would await her  had her guardian really fulfilled the functions of a father towards her he would have a right to be informed but as it was she felt that she owed him no such duty  she therefore made up her mind that he should know nothing of the matter but the fates unfortunately willed otherwise  it chanced that one morning the interview between the lovers had lasted rather longer than usual and had been concluded by kates returning to the house while tom remained sitting upon the garden seat lost in such a reverie as affects men in his position  while thus pleasantly employed his thoughts were suddenly recalled to earth by the appearance of a dark shadow on the gravel in front of him and looking up he saw the senior partner standing a short distance away and regarding him with anything but an amiable expression upon his face  he had himself been having a morning stroll in the garden and had overseen the whole of the recent interview without the preoccupied lovers being aware of his presence  are you coming to the office he asked sternly  if so we can go together  tom rose and followed him out of the gardens without a word  he knew from the others expression that all was known to him and in his heart he was not sorry  his only fear was that the old mans anger might fall upon his ward and this he determined to prevent  they walked side by side as far as the station in complete silence but on reaching fenchurch street girdlestone asked his young partner to step into his private sanctum  now sir he said as he closed the door behind him i think that i have a right to inquire what the meaning may be of the scene of which i was an involuntary witness this morning  it means tom answered firmly but gently that i am engaged to miss harston and have been for some time  oh indeed girdlestone answered coldly sitting down at his desk and turning over the pile of letters  at my request said tom our engagement was kept from your knowledge i had reason to believe that you objected to early engagements and i feared that ours might be disagreeable to you  i trust that the recording angel will not register a very black mark against our friend for this the one and only falsehood that ever passed his lips  during the long silent walk the merchant had been revolving in his mind what course he should pursue and he had come to the conclusion that it was more easy to guide this impetuous stream of youth than to attempt to stem it  he did not realize the strength of the tie that bound these two young people together and imagined that with judgment and patience it might yet be snapped  it was therefore with as good an imitation of geniality as his angular visage would permit of that he answered his companions confession  you can hardly wonder at my being surprised he said  such a thing never entered my mind for a moment  you would have done better to have confided in me before  i must ask your pardon for not having done so  as far as you are concerned said john girdlestone affably i believe you to be hardworking and rightprincipled  your conduct since you have joined the firm has been everything which i could desire  tom bowed his acknowledgments much pleased by this preamble  with regard to my ward continued the senior partner speaking very slowly and evidently weighing his words i could not wish her to have a better husband  in considering such a question i have however as you may imagine to consult above everything else the wishes of my dead friend mr john harston the father of the young lady to whom you say that you are engaged  a trust has been reposed in me and that trust must of course be fulfilled to the letter  certainly said tom wondering in his own mind how he could ever have brought himself for one moment to think evil of this kindly and righteous old man  it was one of mr harstons most clearly expressed wishes that no words or even thoughts of such matters should be allowed to come in his daughters way until she had attained maturity by which he meant the age of oneandtwenty  but he could not foresee the circumstances tom pleaded  i am sure that a year or so will make no difference in her sentiments in this matter  my duty is to carry out his instructions to the letter  i wont say however continued mr girdlestone that circumstances might not arise which might induce me to shorten this probationary period  if my further acquaintance with you confirms the high impression which i now have of your commercial ability that of course would have weight with me and again if i find miss harstons mind is made up upon the point that also would influence my judgment  and what are we to do in the mean time asked the junior partner anxiously  in the mean time neither you nor your people must write to her or speak to her or hold any communication with her whatever  if i find you or them doing so i shall be compelled in justice to mr harstons last request to send her to some establishment abroad where she shall be entirely out of your way  my mind is irrevocably made up upon that point  it is not a matter of personal inclination but of conscience  and how long is this to last cried tom  it will depend upon yourselves  if you prove yourself to be a man of honour in this matter i may be inclined to sanction your addresses in the mean time you must give me your word to let it rest and neither to attempt to speak to miss harston nor to see her nor to allow your parents to communicate with her  the last condition may seem to you to be hard but in my eyes it is a very important one  unless you can bring yourself to promise all this my duty will compel me to remove my ward entirely out of your reach a course which would be painful to her and inconvenient to myself  but i must let her know of this arrangement  i must tell her that you hold out hopes to us on condition that we keep apart for a time  it would be cruel not to allow you to do that girdlestone answered you may send her one letter but remember there shall be no reply to it  thank you sir thank you tom cried fervently  i have something to live for now  this separation will but make our hearts grow fonder what change can time make in either of us  quite so said john girdlestone with a smile  remember there must be no more walking through the square  you must remain absolutely apart if you wish to gain my consent  it is hard very very hard  but i will promise to do it  what would i not promise which would lead to our earlier union  that is settled then  in the mean time i should be obliged if you would go down to the docks and look after the loading of the transferable corrugated iron houses  for new calabar  all right sir and thank you for your kindness said tom bowing himself out  he hardly knew whether to be pleased or grieved over the result of his interview but on the whole satisfaction prevailed since at the worst it was but to wait for a year or so while there seemed to be some hopes of gaining the guardians consent before that on the other hand he had pledged himself to separate from kate but that would he reflected only make their reunion the sweeter  all the morning he was engaged in superintending the stowing of great slabs of iron in the capacious hold of the maid of athens  when the hour of luncheon arrived no thought of food was in the lads head but burying himself in the back parlour of a little blackwall publichouse he called for pen ink and paper and proceeded to indite a letter to his sweetheart  never was so much love and comfort and advice and hope compressed into the limits of four sheets of paper or contained in the narrow boundary of a single envelope  tom read it over after he had finished and felt that it feebly expressed his thoughts but then what lover ever yet did succeed in getting his thoughts satisfactorily represented upon paper  having posted this effusion in which he had carefully explained the conditions imposed upon him tom felt considerably more lighthearted and returned with renewed vigour to the loading of the corrugated iron  he would hardly have felt so satisfied had he seen john girdlestone receiving that same letter from the hands of the footman and reading it afterwards in the privacy of his bedroom with a sardonic smile upon his face  still less contented would he have been had he beheld the merchant tearing it into small fragments and making a bonfire of it in his capacious grate  next morning kate looked in vain out of the accustomed window and was sore at heart when no tall figure appeared in sight and no friendly hand waved a morning salutation    chapter xxv   a change of front  this episode had occurred about a fortnight before ezras return from africa and was duly retailed to him by his father  you need not be discouraged by that he said  i can always keep them apart and if he is absent and you are presentespecially as she has no idea of the cause of his absenceshe will end by feeling slighted and preferring you  i cannot understand how you ever came to let the matter go so far his son answered sullenly  what does the young puppy want to come poaching upon our preserves for  the girl belongs to us  she was given to you to look after and a nice job you seem to have made of it  never mind my boy replied the merchant  ill answer for keeping them apart if you will only push the matter on your own account  ive said that i would do so and i will ezra returned and events soon showed that he was as good as his word  before his african excursion the relations between young girdlestone and his fathers ward had never been cordial  kates nature however was so sweet and forgiving that it was impossible for her to harbour any animosity and she greeted ezra kindly on his return from his travels within a few days she became conscious that a remarkable change had come over hima change as it seemed to her very much for the better in the past weeks had frequently elapsed without his addressing her but now he went out of his way to make himself agreeable  sometimes he would sit for a whole evening describing to her all that he had seen in africa and really interesting her by his account of men and things she poor lass hailed this new departure with delight and did all in her power to encourage his better nature and to show that she appreciated the alteration in his bearing  at the same time she was rather puzzled in her mind for an occasional flash of coarseness or ferocity showed her that the real nature of the man was unaltered and that he was putting an unnatural restraint upon himself  as the days went on and no word or sign came from tom a great fear and perplexity arose within the girls mind  she had heard nothing of the interview at fenchurch street nor had she any clue at all which could explain the mystery  could it be that tom had informed her guardian of their engagement and had received such a rebuff that he had abandoned her in despair  that was surely impossible yet why was it that he had ceased to walk through the square  she knew that he was not ill because she heard her two companions talking of him in connection with business  what could be the matter then  her little heart was torn by a thousand conflicting doubts and fears  in the mean time ezra gave fresh manifestations of the improvement which travel had wrought upon him  she had remarked one day that she was fond of moss roses  on coming down to breakfast next morning she found a beautiful moss rose upon her plate and every morning afterwards a fresh flower appeared in the same place  this pretty little piece of courtesy which she knew could only come from ezra surprised and pleased her for delicacy was the last quality for which she would have given him credit  on another occasion she had expressed a desire to read thackerays works the books in the library being for the most part of last century on entering her room that same evening she found to her astonishment a handsomely bound edition of the novels in question standing on the centre of her table  for a moment a wild unreasoning hope awoke in her that perhaps this was toms doingthat he had taken this means of showing that she was still dear to him  she soon saw however that the books could only have come from the same source as the flowers and she marvelled more than ever at this fresh proof of  the good will of her companion  one day her guardian took the girl aside  your life must be rather dull he said  i have taken a box for you tonight at the opera i do not care about such spectacles myself but i have made arrangements for your escort  a change will do you good  poor kate was too sad at heart to be inclined for amusement she endeavoured however to look pleased and grateful  my good friend mrs wilkinson is coming for you the merchant said and ezra is going too  he has a  great liking for music  kate could not help smiling at this last remark as she  thought how very successfully the young man had concealed his taste during the years that she had known him  she was ready however at the appointed hour and mrs wilkinson a prim old gentlewoman who had chaperoned kate on the rare occasions when she went out having arrived the three drove off together  the opera happened to be faust and the magnificent scenery and dresses astonished kate who had hardly ever before been within the walls of a theatre  she sat as if entranced with a bright tinge of colour upon her cheeks which with her sparkling eyes made her look surpassingly beautiful  so thought ezra girdlestone as he sat in the recesses of the box and watched the varied expressions which flitted across her mobile features  she is well worth having money or no he muttered to himself and redoubled his attentions to her during the evening  an incident occurred between the acts that night which would have pleased the old merchant had he witnessed it  kate had been looking down from the box which was upon the third tier at the sea of heads beneath them  suddenly she gave a start and her face grew a trifle paler  isnt that mr dimsdale down there she said to her companion  where asked ezra craning his neck  oh yes there he is in the second row of the stalls  do you know who the young lady is that he is talking to kate asked  i dont know said ezra  i have seen him about with her a good deal lately the latter was a deliberate falsehood but ezra saw his chance of prejudicing his rival and took prompt advantage of it  she is very goodlooking he added presently keeping his eyes upon his companion  oh indeed said kate and turned with some commonplace remark to mrs wilkinson  her heart was sore nevertheless and she derived little pleasure from the remainder of the performance  as to ezra in spite of his great love for music he dozed peacefully in a corner of the box during the whole of the last act  none of them were sorry when faust was duly consigned to the nether regions and marguerite was apotheosed upon a couple of wooden clouds  ezra narrated the incident of the recognition in the stalls to his father on his return and the old gentleman rubbed his hands over it  most fortunate he exclaimed gleefully  by working on that idea we might produce great effects  who was the girl do you know  some poor relation i believe whom he trots out at times  we will find out her name and all about her  capital capital cried john girdlestone and the two worthies departed to their rooms much pleased at this new card which chance had put into their hands  during the weary weeks while tom dimsdale in accordance with his promise avoided eccleston square and everything which could remind kate of his existence ezra continued to leave no stone unturned in his endeavours to steal his way into her affections  poor toms sole comfort was the recollection of that last passionate letter which he had written in the blackwall publichouse and which had as he imagined enlightened her as to the reasons of his absence and had prevented her from feeling any uneasiness or surprise  had he known the fate that had befallen that epistle he would hardly have been able to continue his office duties so patiently or to wait with so much resignation for mr girdlestones sanction to his engagement  as the days passed and still brought no news kates face grew paler and her heart more weary and desponding  that the young man was well was beyond dispute since she had seen him with her own eyes at the opera what explanation could there be then for his conduct  was it possible that he had told mr girdlestone of their engagement and that her guardian had found some means of dissuading him from continuing his suitfound some appeal to his interest perhaps which was too strong for his love  all that she knew of toms nature contradicted such a supposition  again if girdlestone had learned anything of their engagement surely he would have reproached her with it  his manner of late had been kinder rather than harsher  on the other hand could it have chanced that tom had met this lady of the opera and that her charms had proved too much for his constancy  when she thought of the honest grey eyes which had looked down into hers at that last meeting in the garden she found it hard to imagine the possibility of such things and yet there was a fact which had to be explained  the more she thought of it the more incomprehensible it grew but still the pale face grew paler and the sad heart more heavy  soon however her doubts and fears began to resolve themselves into something more substantial than vague conjecture  the conversation of the girdlestones used to turn upon their business colleague and always in the same strain  there were stray remarks about his doings hints from the father and laughter from the son  not much work to be got out of him now the old man would say  when a mans in love hes not over fond of a ledger  a nicelooking girl too said ezra in answer to some such remark i thought something would come of it  we saw them together at the opera didnt we kate  so they would gossip together and every word a stab to the poor girl she strove to conceal her feelings and indeed her anger and her pride were stronger even than her grief for she felt that she had been cruelly used  one day she found girdlestone alone and unbosomed herself to him  is it really true she asked with a quick pant and a  catch of her breath that mr dimsdale is engaged to be married  i believe so my dear her guardian answered  it is commonly reported so  when a young lady and gentleman correspond it is usually a sign of something of the sort  oh they correspond  yes they certainly correspond  her letters are sent to him at the office  i dont know that i altogether like that arrangement  it looks as if he were deceiving his parents  all this was an unmitigated lie but girdlestone had gone too far now to stick at trifles  who is the lady asked kate with a calm set face but a quivering lip  a cousin of his  miss ossary is her name i believe  i am not sorry for it may be a sign that he has sown all his wild oats  do you know at one time kate i feared that he might take a fancy to you  he has a specious way with him and i felt my responsibility in the matter  you need not be afraid on that score kate said bitterly  i think i can gauge mr dimsdales specious manner at its proper value  with this valiant speech she marched off head in air to her room and there wept as though her very heart would break  john girdlestone told his son of this scene as they walked home from fenchurch street that same day  we must look sharp over it he said or that young fool may get impatient and upset our plans  its not such an easy matter said his son gloomily  i get along so far but no further  its a more uphill job than i expected  why you had a bad enough name among women the merchant said with something approaching to a sneer  i have been grieved times out of number by your looseness in that respect  i should have thought that you might have made your experience of some use now  there are women and women his son remarked  a girl like this takes as much managing as a skittish horse  once get her into harness and i warrant youll keep her there quiet enough  you bet said ezra with a loud laugh  but at present she has the pull  her mind is still running on that fellow  she spoke bitterly enough of him this morning  so she might but she thinks of him none the less  if i could once make her thoroughly realize that he had thrown her over i might catch her on the hop  shed marry for spite if she wouldnt for love  just so just so  wait a bit  that can be managed i think if you will leave it to me  the old man brooded over the problem all day for from week to week the necessity for the money was becoming more pressing and that money could only be hoped for through the success of ezras wooing  no wonder that every little detail which might sway the balance one way or the other was anxiously pondered over by the head of the firm and that even the fluctuations in oil and ivory became secondary to this great object  next day immediately after they had sat down to dinner some letters were handed in by the footman  forwarded on from the office sir said the flunkey  the clerk says that mr gilray was away and that he did not like to open them  just like him said girdlestone peevishly pushing back his plate of soup  i hate doing business out of hours  he tore the envelopes off the various letters as he spoke  whats this  casks returned as per invoice thats all right  note from rudder  saxethat can be answered tomorrow  memorandum on the custom duties at sierra leone hallo what have we here  my darling tomwho is this fromyours ever mary ossary why its one of young dimsdales loveletters which has got mixed up with my business papers  ha ha i must really apologize to him for having opened it but he must take his chance of that if he has his correspondence sent to the office  i take it for granted that everything there is a business communication  kates face grew very white as she listened  she ate little dinner that day poor child and took the earliest opportunity of retiring to her room  you did that uncommonly well dad said ezra approvingly after she was gone  it hit her hard i could see that  i think it touched her pride  people should not have pride  we are warned against it  now that same pride of hers will forbid her ever thinking of that young man again  and you had the letter written  i wrote it myself  i think in such a case any stratagem is justifiable  such large interests are at stake that we must adopt strong measures  i quite agree with the old churchmen that the end occasionally justifies the means  capital dad very good cried ezra chewing his  toothpick  i like to hear you argue  its quite refreshing  i act according to the lights which are vouchsafed me said john girdlestone gravely on which ezra leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily  the very next morning the merchant spoke to dimsdale on the matter for he had observed signs of impatience in the young man and feared that some sudden impulse might lead him to break his promise and so upset everything  take a seat  i should like to have a word with you he said graciously when his junior partner appeared before him to consult with him as to the duties of the day  tom sat down with hope in his heart  it is only fair to you mr dimsdale girdlestone said in a kindly voice that i should express to you my appreciation of your honourable conduct  you have kept your promise in regard to miss harston in the fullest manner  of course i kept my promise said tom bluntly  i trust however that you will soon see your way to withdrawing your prohibition  it has been a hard trial to me  i have insisted upon it because it seemed to me to be my duty every one takes his own view upon such points and it has always been my custom throughout life to take what some might think a stringent one it appears to me that i owe it to my deceased friend to prevent his daughter whom he has confided to me from making any mistake as i said before if you continue to show that you are worthy of her i may think more favourably of it  exemplary as your conduct has been since you joined us i believe that i am not wrong in stating that you were a little wild when you were at edinburgh  i never did anything that i am ashamed of said tom  very likely not girdlestone answered with an irrepressible sneer the question is did you do anything that your father was ashamed of  certainly not cried tom hotly  i was no milksop or psalm singer but there is nothing that i ever did there of which i should be ashamed of my father knowing  dont speak lightly of psalm singing  it is a good practice in its way and you would have been none the worse had you indulged in it perhaps  however that is neither here nor there  what i want you clearly to understand is that my ultimate consent to your union depends entirely upon your own conduct  above all i insist that you refrain from unsettling the girls mind at present  i have already promised  hard as the struggle may be i shall not break my word  i have the consolation of knowing that if we were separated for twenty years we should still be true to one another  thats very satisfactory said the merchant grimly  nevertheless it is a weary weary time  if i could only write a line  not a word girdlestone interrupted  it is only because i trust you that i keep her in london at all  if i thought there was a possibility of your doing such a thing i should remove her at once  i shall do nothing without your permission tom said taking up his hat to go  he paused with his hand upon the door  if ever it seems good to me he said i consider that by giving you due notice i absolve myself from my promise  you would not do anything so foolish  still i reserve myself the right of doing so said tom and went off with a heavy heart to his days work  everything is clear for you now the old man said to his son triumphantly  theres no chance of interference and the girl is in the very humour to be won  i flatter myself that it has been managed with tact  remember that all is at stake and go in and win  i shall go in said ezra and i think the chances are that i shall win too  at which reassuring speech the old man laughed and slapped his son approvingly upon the shoulder    chapter xxvi   breaking ground  in spite of john girdlestones temporary satisfaction and the stoical face which he presented to the world it is probable that in the whole of london there was no more unhappy and heartweary man  the long fight against impending misfortune had shattered his iron constitution and weakened him both in body and in mind  it was remarked upon change how much he had aged of late and moralists commented upon the vanity and inefficacy of the wealth which could not smooth the wrinkles from the great traders haggard visage  he was surprised himself when he looked in the glass at the change which had come over him  never mind he would say in his dogged heart a hundred times a day they cant beat me  do what they will they cant beat me  this was the one thought which sustained and consoled him  the preservation of his commercial credit had become the aim and object of his life to which there was nothing that he was not prepared to sacrifice  his cunningly devised speculation in diamonds had failed but this failure had been due to an accident which could neither have been foreseen nor remedied  to carry out this scheme he had as we have seen been obliged to borrow money which had now to be repaid  this he had managed to do more or less completely by the sale of the stones which ezra had brought home supplemented by the recent profits of the firm  there was still the original deficit to be faced and john girdlestone knew that though a settlement might be postponed from month to month still the day must come and come soon when his debts must be met or his inability to meet them become apparent to the whole world should ezra be successful in his wooing and his wards forty thousand pounds be thrown into the scale the firm would shake itself clear from the load which oppressed it  supposing however that kate were to refuse his son  what was to occur then  the will was so worded that there appeared to be no other way of obtaining the money  a very vulpine look would come over the old mans face as he brooded over that problem  the strangest of all the phenomena however presented by john girdlestone at this period of his life was his own entire conviction of the righteousness of his actions  when every night and morning he sank upon his knees with his household and prayed for the success of the firms undertakings no qualms of conscience ever troubled him as to their intrinsic morality  on sundays the grey head of the merchant in the first pew was as constant an object as was the pew itself yet in that head no thought ever rose of the inconsistency of his religion and of his practice  for fifty years he had been persuading himself that he was a righteous man and the conviction was now so firmly impressed upon his very soul that nothing could ever shake it  ezra was wrong when he set this down as deliberate hypocrisy  blind strength of will and selfconceit were at the bottom of his actions but he would have been astonished and indignant had he been accused of simulating piety or of using it as a tool  to him the firm of girdlestone was the very representation of religion in the commercial world and as such must be upheld by every conceivable means  to his son this state of mind was unintelligible and he simply gave his father credit for being a consummate and accomplished hypocrite who found a mantle of piety a very convenient one under which to conceal his real character  he had himself inherited the old mans dogged pertinacity and commercial instincts and was by nature unscrupulous and impatient of any obstacle placed in his way  he was now keenly alive to the fact that the existence of the firm depended upon the success of his suit and he knew also how lucrative a concern the african business would prove were it set upon its legs again  he had determined in case he succeeded to put his father aside as a sleeping partner and to take the reins of management entirely into his own hands  his practical mind had already devised countless ways in which the profits might be increased  the first step of all then was the gaining possession of the forty thousand pounds and to that he devoted himself heart and soul  when two such men work together for one end it is seldom that they fail to achieve it  it would be a mistake to suppose that ezra felt himself in any degree in love at this time  he recognized his companions sweetness and gentleness but these were not qualities which appealed to his admiration  kates amiable quiet ways seemed insipid to a man who was used to female society of a very different order  she has no go or snap about her he would complain to his father shes not like polly lucas at the pavilion or minnie walker  god forbid ejaculated the merchant  that sort of thing is bad enough out of doors but worst of all in your own house  it makes courting a good deal easier ezra answered  if a girl will answer up and give you an opening now and then it makes all the difference  you cant write poetry can you  not much ezra said with a grin  thats a pity  i believe it goes a long way with women  you might get some one to write some and let her think it is yours  or you could learn a little off and repeat it  yes i might do that  im going to buy a collar for that beast of a dog of hers  all the time that i was talking to her yesterday she was so taken up with it that i dont believe she heard half that i said my fingers itched to catch it up and chuck it through the window  dont forget yourself my boy dont forget yourself cried the merchant  a single false step might ruin every thing  never fear ezra said confidently and went off upon the dogcollar mission  while he was in the shop he bought a dogwhip as well which he locked up in his drawers to use as the occasion served  during all this time kate had been entirely unconscious of her companions intentions and designs  she had been associated with ezra for so many years and had met such undeviated want of courtesy from him that the idea of his presenting himself as a suitor never came into her head  she hailed his charge of demeanour therefore as being the result of his larger experience of the world and often wondered how it was that he had profited so much by his short stay at the cape  in the cheerless house it was pleasant to have at least one companion who seemed to have kindly feelings towards her  she was only too glad therefore to encourage his advances and to thank him with sweet smiles and eloquent eyes for what appeared to her to be his disinterested kindness  after a while however ezras attentions became so marked that it was impossible for her to misunderstand them any longer  not only did he neglect his usual work in order to hang round her from morning to night but he paid her many clumsy compliments and gave other similar indications of the state of his affections  as soon as this astounding fact had been fairly realized by the girl she at once changed her manner and became formal and distant  ezra nothing daunted redoubled his tender words and glances and once would have kissed her hand had she not rapidly withdrawn it  on this kate shut herself up in her room and rarely came out save when the other was away in the city  she was determined that there should be no possibility of any misunderstanding as to her feelings in the matter  john girdlestone had been watching these little skirmishes closely and with keen interest  when kate took to immuring herself in her room he felt that it was time for him to interfere  you must go about a little more and have more fresh air he said to her one day when they were alone after breakfast  you will lose your roses if you dont  i am sure i dont care whether i lose them or not answered his ward listlessly  you may not but there are others who do remarked the merchant i believe it would break ezras heart  kate flushed up at this sudden turn of the conversation  i dont see what reason your son has to care about it she said  care about it  are you so blind that you dont see that he loves the very ground you walk on  he has grown quite pale and ill these last few days because he has not seen you and he imagines that he may have offended you  for goodness sake cried kate earnestly persuade him to think of some one else  it will only be painful both to him and to me if he keeps on this way  it cannot possibly lead to anything  and why not  why should  oh dont let us argue about it she cried passionately  the very idea is horrible  it wont bear talking about  but why my dear why  you are really too impulsive  ezra has his faults but what man has not  he has been a little wild in his youth but he is settling down now into an excellent man of business  i assure you that young as he is there are few names more respected on change  the way in which he managed the business of the firm in africa was wonderful  he is already a rich man and will be richer before he dies  i cannot see any cause for this deeprooted objection of yours as to looks he is you must confess as fine a young fellow as there is in london  i wish you not to speak of it or think of it again said kate my mind is entirely made up when i say that i shall never marry any onehim least of all  you will think better of it i am sure her guardian said patting her chestnut hair kindly as he stood over her  since your poor father handed you over to me i have guarded you and cared for you to the best of my ability  many a sleepless night i have spent thinking of your future and endeavouring to plan it out so as to secure your happiness i should not be likely to give you bad advice now or urge you to take a step which would make you unhappy  have you anything to complain of in my treatment of you  you have been always very just kate said with a sob  and this is how you repay me  you are going to break my sons heart and through his mine  he is my only boy and if anything went wrong with him i tell you that it would bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave  you have it in your power to do this or on the other hand you may make my old age a happy one by the knowledge that the lad is mated with a good woman and has attained the object on which his whole mind and heart are set  oh i cant i cant  do let the matter drop  think it over the old man said  look at it from every point of view  remember that the love of an honest man is not to be lightly spurned  i am naturally anxious about it for my future happiness as well as his depends upon your decision  john girdlestone was fairly satisfied with this interview  it seemed to him that his ward was rather less decided in her refusal at the end of it and that his words had had some effect upon her which might possibly increase with reflection  give her a little time now was his advice to his son  i think she will come round but she needs managing  if i could get the money without taking her it would be better for me ezra said with an oath  and better for her too remarked john girdlestone grimly    chapter xxvii   mrs scully of morrisons  one day major tobias clutterbuck was sitting at the window of his little room smoking his cigarette and sipping his glass of wine as was his custom if times were reasonably good  while thus agreeably employed he chanced to look across the road and perceived a little fringe of dark hair and a still darker eye which surveyed him round the border of one of the curtains which flanked a window opposite  the gallant major was much interested in this apparition and rose to make a closer inspection of it but alas before he could focus it with his eyeglass it was gone  he bent his gaze resolutely in that direction for a long time and smoked at least half a dozen cigarettes besides finishing the bottle of wine but although he thought he saw certain flittings and whiskings of garments in the dark background of the opposite room he could not make out anything more definite  next day the soldier was on the lookout at the same hour and was rewarded by the appearance of two eyes very mischievous and dangerous ones too which were set in a buxom and by no means unprepossessing face  the lady who owned these charms looked very deliberately up the street and very deliberately down the street after which she bethought herself to look across the street and started to perceive a stout middleaged gentleman with a fiery face who was looking at her with an expression of intense admiration  so much alarmed was she that she vanished behind the curtains and the major feared that he would see her no more  fortunately however it became evident that the ladys alarm was not very overpowering for within five minutes she was back at the window where her eyes again fell upon the beaming face and jaunty figure of the major who had posed himself in a striking attitude which was somewhat marred by the fact that he was still enveloped in his purple dressinggown  this time her eyes lingered a little longer than before and the suspicion of a smile appeared upon her features  on this the major smiled and bowed and she smiled also showing a pretty little line of white teeth as she did so  what the veterans next move might have been no one can tell for the lady solved the problem by disappearing and this time permanently  he was very well satisfied however and chuckled much to himself while arraying himself in his long frock coat and immaculate collar before setting out for the club he had been a sly old dog in his day and had followed venus almost as much as he had mars during his chequered career  all day the recollection of this little episode haunted him  so much preoccupied was he at the club that he actually played out the thirteenth trump upon his partners long suit and so sacrificed the gamebeing the first and only time that he was ever known to throw away a point  he told von baumser all about it when he came back  shes a demned foinelooking woman whoever she may be he remarked at they sat together before turning in  be george shes the foinest woman ive seen for a long time  shes a window said the german  a what  a windowthe window of an engineer  is it a widow you mane  what dye know about her  whats her name and where does she come from  i have heard from the slavey that a wina widow lives over dere in those rooms  she boards mit madame morrison and that window belongs to her privacy zimmerdat is chamber  as to her name i have not heard it or else i disremember it  ged said the major shed eyes that looked right through ye and a figure like juno  shes vierzig if shes a daydat is forty von baumser remarked  well if she is me boy a woman of forty is just in the proime o loife  if youd seen her at the window she would have taken ye by storm  she stands like this and she looks up like this and then down in this way  the major pursed up his warlike features into what he imagined to be an innocent and captivating expression  then she looks across and sees me and down go the lids of her eyes like the shutting off of a bullseye lantern  then she blushed and stole just one more glance at me round the corner of the curtain  she had two peeps the divil a doubt of it  dat is very good the german said encouragingly  ah me boy twinty years ago when i was forty inches round the chest and thirtythree round the waist i was worth looking at twice bedad when a man gets ould and lonely he sees what a fool he was not to make better use of his time when hed the chance  mein gott cried von baumser  you dont mean to say that you would marry suppose you had the chance  i dont know the major answered reflectively  the vomens is not to be trusted the german said sadly  i knew a voman in my own country which was the daughter of a man dat kept a hoteland she and i was promised to be married to each others karl hagelstein he was to be vat you call my best man  a very handsome man was karl and i sent him often mit little presents of one thing or another to my girl for there were reasons why i could not go myself he was nicer than me because my hair was red and pretty soon she began to like him and he liked her too  so the day before the vedding she went down the rhine to frankfort by the boat and he went down by train and there they met and was married the one to the other  and what did you do the major asked with interest  ah dat was the most worst thing of all for i followed them mit a friend of mine and when we caught them i did not let her know but i called him out of his hotel and i told him that he must fight me dat vos a mistake  i should have done him an insult and then he vould have had to ask me to fight and i could have chosen my own veapon as it was he chose swords for he knew veil that i knew nothing of them and he had been the best fencer in the whole of his university  then we met in the morning and before i had time to do anything he ran me through the left lung  i have shown you the mark of it  after dat i vas in bed for two month and more and it still hurts me ven de veather is cold  that is vat they call satisfaction baumser added pulling his long red beard reflectively  to me it has ever seemed the most dissatisfactory thing that could be imagined  i dont wonder youre afraid of the women after that said the major laughing  there are plenty of good women in the world though if you have the luck to come across them  dye know a young fellow called dimsdale  ah you wouldnt but ive met him lately at the club hes got a girl whos the adopted daughter of that same ould girdlestone that we talk about  i saw the two of them togither one day as happy as a pair of young love birds  sure youve only got to look at her face to see that shes as good as gold  ill bet that that woman over the strate there is another of the right sort  dat voman is alvays in your head the german said with a smile you shall certainly dream about her tonight  i remember a voman in germany  and so these two bohemians rambled on into the small hours discoursing upon their past experiences and regaling each other with many reminiscences some of which perhaps are just as well omitted and allowed to sink into oblivion  when the major finally retired for the night his last thought was of the lady at the window and of the means by which he might contrive to learn something of her  these proved to be more easy than he anticipated for next morning on crossexamining the little servant girl from whom von baumser had derived his information the major found out all that he desired to know  according to this authority the lady was a widow of the name of scully the relict of a deceased engineer and had been staying some little time at morrisons which was the rival establishment to that in which the major and von baumser resided  armed with this information the major pondered for some time before deciding upon his course of action  he saw no possible means by which he could gain an introduction to his charming neighbour unless he had recourse to some daring strategem  audace et toujours audace had always been the soldiers motto  he rose from his chair discarded his purple gown and arrayed himself in his best attire  never had he paid such attention to his toilet  his face was clean shaven and shining his sparse hairs were laid out to the best advantage his collar spotless his frock coat oppressively respectable and his tout ensemble irreproachable  be george he said to himself as he surveyed himself in the small lodginghouse glass id look as young as baumser if i had some more hair on me head  bad cess to the helmets and shakoes that wore it all off  when his toilet was fully completed and rounded off by the addition of a pair of light gloves and an ebony stick with a silver head the veteran strode forth with a bold front but with considerable trepidation at his heart for when is a man so seasoned as to have no misgivings when he makes the first advances to a woman who really attracts him  whatever the majors inward feelings may have been however he successfully concealed them as he rang the bell of the rival lodginghouse and inquired of the servant whether mrs scully was at home  yes sir she is said the slavey with a frightened bob which was a tribute to the majors martial mien and gorgeous attire  would you tell her that i should like to see her said the major boldly  i shant detain her a moment  here is my cardmajor tobias clutterbuck late of the 119th light infantry  the servant disappeared with the card and presently returned with a request that he would step up  the old soldier stumped his way upstairs with the firm footfall of one who has taken a thing in hand and means to carry it through at all hazard  as he ascended it seemed to him that he heard the sound of feminine laughter in the distance  if so it could hardly have come from the lady whom he was in quest of for he was shown into a large and wellfurnished room where she sat looking demure and grave enough as did another young lady who was crocheting on the ottoman beside her  the major made his most courtly bow though he felt very much as the spaniards may be supposed to have done when they saw their ships blazing behind them  i trust you will excuse this intrusion on my part he began  i happened to hear that a lady of the name of scully was stopping here  my name is scully sir said the lady whose dark eyes had allured the major to this feat of daring  then perhaps madam the veteran said with another bow you will allow me to ask you whether you are any relation to majorgineral scully of the indian sappers  pray take a seat majormajor clutterbuck said mrs scully referring to his card which she still held in her very wellformed little hand  majorgeneral scully did you say  dear me  i know that one of my husbands relations went into the army but we never heard what became of him  a majorgeneral is he  whoever would have thought it  as dashing a souldier madam said the major warming into eloquence as ever hewed a way through the ranks of the enemy or stormed the snowclad passes of the himalayas  fancy ejaculated the young lady with the crochet needle  many a time continued the soldier he and i after some hardfought battle have slept togither upon the bloodstained ground wrapped in the same martial cloak  fancy cried both ladies in chorus and they could not have selected a more appropriate interjection  and when at last he died the major went on with emotion cut in two with a tulwar in a skirmish with hill tribes he turned to me  after being cut in two interrupted the younger lady  he turned to me said the major inflexibly and putting his hand in mine he said with his last breath tobythat was what he always called metoby he said i have a  your husband was his brother i think you said maam  no it was mr scullys uncle who went into the army  ah quite so  i have a nephew in england he said who is very dear to me  he is married to a charming woman  search out the young couple toby  guard over them  protict them  those were his last words madam  next moment his sowl had fled  when i heard your name casually mintioned i could not feel satisfied in me mind until i had come across and ascertained if you were the lady in question  now this narrative not only surprised the widow which was not unnatural seeing that it was entirely an invention of the old soldiers but it appealed to her weakest point  the father of the deceased scully had been of plebeian origin so that the discovery in the family of a real majorgeneralalbeit he was deadwas a famous windfall for the widow had social ambitions which hitherto she had never been able to gratify  hence she smiled sweetly at the veteran in a way which stimulated him to further flights of mendacity  sure he and i were like brothers he said  he was a man that any one might well be proud to know  commanderinchief said to me once clutterbuck says he i dont know what wed do if we had a european war  ive no one i can rely on says he  theres scully says i right says he scully would be our man he was terribly cut up when this occurred  heres a blow to the british army he remarked as he looked down at him where he lay with a bullet through his headhe did madam be jove  but major i understood you to say that he was cut in two  so he was  cut in two and shot and mortally wounded in a dozen places besides  ah if he could have foreseen that i should have met you he would have died happy  its strange he never let us know of his existence when he was alive the widow remarked  pride madam pride until i reach the top of the tree toby he used to say i shall niver reveal myself to me brother  nephew interpolated the widow  quite so i shall niver reveal myself to me nephew  he said those very words to me only a few minutes before the fatal shell struck him  a shell major  you mean a bullet  a shell madam a shell said the major with decision  dear me exclaimed mrs scully with a somewhat bewildered expression  how very sad it all is  we must thank you very much major bottletop  clutterbuck said the major  i beg pardon major clutterbuck  it was very kind of you to call upon us in this friendly way and to give us these details  of course when a relative dies even though you dont know much about him still it is interesting to have a clear account of how it all happened  just fancy clara continued the widow drawing her handkerchief from her reticule and mopping one of her eyes with it  just fancy the poor fellow being cut in two with a bullet far away in india and him just speaking about jack and me a few minutes before  i am sure we must thank major bottlenose  clutterbuck madam cried the major with some indignation  i really beg pardon  we must thank him clara for having told us about it and for having called  do not thank me me dear mrs scully said the major clearing his throat and waving his stubby hand deprecatingly  i have already had me reward in having the pleasure and honour of making your acquaintance and of coming nearer to those charums which i had alriddy admired from a distance  oh auntie listen to that cried clara and both ladies giggled  not forgetting yours missmiss  miss timms said mrs scully  my brothers daughter  not forgetting your charums miss timms continued the major with a bow and a flourish  to a lonely man like meself the very sight of a lady is like dew to a plant  i feel stringthened madam vitalized invigorated the major puffed out his chest and looked apoplectically tender over his high white collar  the chief object of me visit the old soldier said after a pause was to learn whether i could be of any assistance to you in any way afther your sad bereavement of which i have heard it may be that even a comparative stranger may be of service in business matters  im sure its very kind of you major the widow answered since poor jack died everything has been in disorder  if it wouldnt trouble you i should very much like your advice on some future occasion  ill ask your opinion when i have cleared up things a little myself  as to these lawyers they think of their own interests not of yours  quite so said the major sympathetically  theres the fifteen hundred of poor jacks insurance  thats not laid out yet  fifteen hundred said the major  thats seventyfive pounds a year at five per cint  i can get better interest than that said the widow gaily  ive got two thousand laid out at seven per centhavent i clara  safe too said the girl  the deuce you have thought the major  so when we are making arrangements ill ask your assistance and advice major tanglebobs  i know that we poor women are very bad at business  i shall look forward to the day said the major gallantly rising and taking up his hat  he was very well satisfied with his little ruse and his success in breaking the ice  be george he remarked to von baumser that evening shes got money as well as her looks  its a lucky man that gits her  i vill bet dat you ask her for to marry you von baumser said with a smile  ill bet that she refuses me if i do answered the major despondently in spite of which he retired that night feeling considerably more elated than on the preceding evening    chapter xxviii   back in bohemia  fortune had been smiling upon the bohemians of late  ever since the majors successful visit to fenchurch street he had been able to live in a state of luxury to which he had long been unaccustomed  his uncle the earl too had condescended to think of his humble relative and had made a small provision for him which with his other resources removed all anxiety as to the future  von baumser had his fair share in this sudden accession of prosperity  the german had resumed his situation as commercial clerk and foreign correspondent to eckermann  co so that his circumstances had also improved  the pair had even had some conversation as to the expediency of migrating into larger and more expensive lodgings but the majors increasing intimacy with his fair neighbour opposite stood in the way of a change  in any case they were loth to leave their fourth floor and to have the trouble of moving their effects  these same effects were the pride of major clutterbucks heart small as their sanctum was it was a very museum of curious objects brought from every part of the world most of them of little intrinsic value but all possessing a charm of association to their owner they were his trophies of travel battle and the chase  from the bison rug and tiger skin upon the floor to the great sumatran bat which hung head downwards as in the days of its earthly existence from the ceiling there was not an object but had its own special history in one corner was an afghan matchlock and a bundle of spears from the southern seas in another a carved indian paddle a kaffir assegai and an american blowpipe with its little sheaf of poisoned arrows here was a hookah richly mounted and with all due accessories just as it was presented to the major twenty years before by a mahommedan chieftain and there was a high mexican saddle on which he had ridden through the land of the aztecs  there was not a square foot of the walls which was not adorned by knives javelins malay kreeses chinese opium pipes and such other trifles as old travellers gather round them by the side of the fire rested the campaigners straight regulation sword in its dim sheathall the dimmer because the companions occasionally used it as a poker when that instrument happened to be missing  its not the value of thim the major remarked glancing round the apartment but bedad theres not one of the lot that has not got a story tacked on to it  look at that bears head now thats grinning at ye from over the door  thats a thibet bear not much bigger than a newfoundland dog but as fierce as a grizzly  thats the very one that clawed charley travers of the 49th  ged hed have been done for if i hadnt got me westley richards to bear on him  duck man i duck i cried for they were so mixed that i couldnt tell one from the other he put his head down and i caught the brute right between the eyes  ye can see the track of the bullet on the bone  the major paused and the pair smoked meditatively for baumser had returned from the city and the twilight was falling and everything conduced to tobacco and reverie  see that necklace of cowrie shells hanging beside it continued the veteran waving his cigarette in that direction that came from the neck of a hottentot womana black vanus be jove  we were trekking up country before the second kaffir war  made an appintmentcould not goorderly dutyso sent a trusty man to tell her  he was found next day with twenty assegais in his body  she was a decoy duck bedad and the whole thing a plant  mein gott von baumser ejaculated  what a life you have led i have lived with you now many months and heard you tell many tales but ever there are fresh ones  yes a strange life answered the major stretching out his gaitered legs and gazing up at the ceiling  i niver thought to be stranded in me ould age  if i hadnt commuted id have had a fair pinsion but i drew me money in a lump sum and went to monte carlo to break the bank instead o that the bank broke me and yet i believe me system was correct enough and i must have won if i had had more capital  there is many says dat grunted von baumser doubtfully  i believe it for all that the major continued  why man i was always the luckiest chap at cards  i depinded on me skill principally but still i had luck as well  i remimber once being becalmed for a fortnight in the bay of biscay in a small transport  skipper and i tried to kill time by playing nap and we had the stakes low enough at first but they soon grew higher for he kept trying to cover his losses  before the ind of the two weeks i cleared out of him nearly all he had in the world  look here clutterbuck he said at last looking mighty white about the gills this ship that we are in is more than half mine  i am chief owner  ill stake me share of the ship on the next game against all that i have lost  done said i and shuffled cut and dealt  he went four on three highest trumps and an ace and i held four small trumps  its a bad job for my creditors he said as he threw his hand down  ged i started on that vyage a poor captain and i came into port very fairly well off and sailing in me own ship too  what dye think of that  wunderbar ejaculated the german  and the captain  brandy and delirium tremens the major said between the puffs of his cigarette  jumped overboard off finisterre on the homeward vyage shocking thing gamblinwhen you lose  ach gott and those two knives upon the wall the straight one and the one with the crook is there a history about them  an incident the major answered languidly  curious but true  saw it meself  in the afghan war i was convoying supplies through the passes when we were set upon by afreedees hillmen and robbers  i had fifty men of the 27th native infantry under me with a sergeant among the afreedees was a thumping big chief who stood among the rocks with that very knife in his hand the long one shouting insults at our fellows  our sergeant was a smart little nigger and this cheek set his blood up  be jabers he chucked his gun down pulled out that curved daggera ghoorkha knife it isand made for the big hillman both sides stopped firing to see the two chaps fight  as our fellow came scrambling up over the rocks the chief ran at him and thrust with all his stringth  be jabers  i thought i saw the pint of the blade come out through the sergeants back  he managed to twist round though so as to dodge it  at the same time he hit up from below and the hillman sprang into the air looking for all the world like one o those open sheep you see outside a butchers shop  he was  ripped up from stomach to throat  the sight knocked all the fight out of the other spalpeens and they took to their heels as hard as they could run i took the dead mans knife away and the sergeant sold me his for a few rupees so there they are  not much to make a story of but it was intheresting to see  id have bet five to three on the chief  bad discipline very bad baumser remarked  to break the ranks and run mit knives would make my old unteroffizier kritzer very mad indeed the german had served his time in the prussian army and was still mindful of his training  your stiffbacked pickelhaubes would have had a poor chance in the passes answered the major  it was ivery man for himself there you might lie or stand or do what you liked as long as you didnt run discipline goes to pieces in a war of that sort  dat is what you call gorilla warfare said von baumser with a proud consciousness of having mastered an english idiom  for all dat discipline is a very fine thingvery good indeed  i vell remember in the great kriegthe war with austriawe had made a mine and were about to fire it  a sentry had been placed just over this and after the match was lit it was forgotten to withdraw the man  he knew well that the powder beneath him would presently him into the air lift but since he had not been dismissed in right form he remained until the ausbruch had exploded  he was never seen no more and indeed dat he had ever been dere might well have been forgotten had it not been dat his nadelgewehr was dere found  dat was a proper soldier i think to be placed in command had he lived  to be placed in a lunatic asylum if he lived said the irishman testily  hullo whats this  the this was the appearance of the boardinghouse slavey with a very neat pink envelope upon a tray addressed in the most elegant of female hands to major tobias clutterbuck late of her majestys hundred and nineteenth  ah cried von baumser laughing in his red beard it is from a woman you are what the english call a sly hog a very sly hogor i should say dog though it is much the same  its for you as well as for me  see here  mrs lavinia scully presints her compliments to major tobias clutterbuck and to his friend mr sigismund von baumser and trusts that they may be able to favour her with their company on tuesday evening at eight to meet a few frinds  its a dance said the major  that accounts for the harp and the tables and binches and wine cases i saw going in this morning  will you go  yes of course i will and so shall you  wed better answer it  so in due course an acceptance was sent across to mrs scullys hospitable invitation  never was there such a brushing and scrubbing in the bedroom of a couple of quiet bachelors as occurred some two evenings afterwards in the top story of mrs robins establishment  the majors suit had been pursued unremittingly since his first daring advance upon the widow but under many difficulties and discouragements  in the occasional chance interviews which he had with his attractive neighbour he became more and more enamoured but he had no opportunity of ascertaining whether the feeling was mutual  this invitation appeared to promise him the very chance which he desired and many were the stern resolutions which he formed as he stood in front of his toilettable and arranged his tie and his shirt front to his satisfaction  von baumser who was arrayed in a dress coat of antiquated shape and very shiny about the joints sat on the side of the bed eyeing his companions irreproachable getup with envy and admiration  it fits you beautiful he said alluding to the coat  it came from pooles answered the major carelessly  as for me said von baumser i have never used mine in england at all  truly as you know i hate all dances and dinners  i come with you however very willingly for i would not for nothing in the world give offence to the liebchen of my comrade  since i go i shall go as a gentleman should  he looked down as he spoke with much satisfaction at his withered suit of black  but me good fellow cried the major who had now completed his toilet youve got your tie under your lift ear  it looks very quaint and ornamintal there but still its not quite the place for it you look as if you were ticketed for sale  they vont see it unless i puts it out sidevays from under my beard the german said apologetically  however if you think it should be hidden it shall be so  how are my studbuttons  you have them of gold i see but mine are of motherofoysters  motherofpearl said the major laughing  they will do very well theres the divil of a lot of cabs at their door he continued peering round the corner of the blind  the rooms are all lighted up and i can hear them tuning the instruments  maybe wed better go across  vorvarts then said von baumser resolutely and the two set off the major with a fixed determination that he should know his fate before the evening was over    chapter xxix   the great dance at morrisons  never in the whole history of morrisons boarding establishment had such festive preparations been known  the landlady herself had entered heart and soul into the business and as all the boarders had received invitations for themselves and their friends they cooperated in every possible manner to make the evening a success  the large drawingroom had been cleared and the floor waxed  this process left it in a very glassy and orthodox condition as the cook discovered when on bustling in the back of her cranium came in violent contact with the boards while her body described a halfcircle with a velocity which completely eclipsed any subsequent feats of agility shown by the dancers in the evening  the saloon had been very tastefully laid out as a supperroom and numerous other little chambers were thrown open and brightened up to serve as lounging places for those who were fatigued  in the parlour there were two cardtables and every other convenience for any who preferred sedentary amusements  altogether both mrs morrison and the boarders in solemn conclave assembled agreed that the thing looked very promising and that it would be a credit to the establishment  the guests were as varied as the wines though hardly as select mrs scullys exuberant hospitality included as already intimated not only her own friends but those of her fellowboarders so that from an early hour the rooms began to fill and by nine oclock there was hardly space for the dancers  hansoms and growlers rattled up in a continuous stream and discharged their burdens  there was a carpet down from the kerb to the head of the lodginghouse steps like ryalty as the cook expressed it and the greengrocers man in the hall looked so pompous and inflated in his gorgeous attire that his own cabbages would hardly have recognized him  his main defect as a footman was that he was somewhat hard of hearing and had a marvellous faculty of misinterpreting whatever was said to him which occasionally led to remarkable results  thus when he announced the sporting captain livingstone tuck under the title of captain livesonhis luck it was felt that he was rather too near the truth to be pleasant  indeed the company had hardly recovered from the confusion produced by this small incident when the two bohemians made their appearance  mrs scully who was tastefully arrayed in black satin and lace stood near the door of the drawingroom and looked very charming and captivating as she fulfilled her duties as hostess  so thought the major as he approached her and shook her hand with some well turned compliment upon his lips  let me inthroduce me friend herr von baumser he added  mrs scully smiled upon the german in a way that won his teutonic heart you will find programmes over there she explained  i think the first is a round dance  no thank you major i shall stand out or there will be no one to receive the people  she hurried away to greet a party of new arrivals while the major and baumser wandered off in search of partners  there was no want of spirit or of variety in the dancing at morrisons from mr snodder the exciseman who danced the original oldfashioned troistemps to young bucklebury of the bank who stationed himself immediately underneath the central chandelier and spun rapidly round with his partner upon his own axis like a couple of beetles impaled upon a single pin every possible variation of the art of waltzing was to be observed  there was mr smith of the medical college rotating round with miss clara timms their faces wearing that pained and anxious expression which the british countenance naturally assumes when dancing giving the impression that the legs have suddenly burst forth in a festive mood and have dragged the rest of the body into it very much against its will  there was the major too who had succeeded in obtaining mrs scully as a partner and was dancing as old soldiers can dance threading his way through the crowded room with the ease begotten by the experience of a lifetime  meanwhile von baumser at the other end was floundering about with a broad smile upon his face and an elderly lady tucked under his right arm while he held her disengaged hand straight out at right angles as if she had been a banjo in short the fun was fast and furious and waltz followed polka and mazurka followed waltz with a rapidity which weeded out the weaker vessels among the dancers and tested the stamina of the musicians  then there was the cardroom whither the widow scully and the major and many others of the elders repaired when they found the pace too fast for them  very snug and comfortable it was with its square tables each with a fringe of chairs and the clean shining cards spread out over their green baize surfaces  the major and his hostess played against captain livingstone tuck and an old gentleman who came from lambeth with the result that the gallant captain and his partner rose up poorer and sadder men which was rather a blow to the former who reckoned upon clearing a little on such occasions and had not expected to find himself opposed by such a past master of the art as the major  then the veteran and another played the hostess and another lady and the cunning old dog managed to lose in such a natural manner and to pay up with such a good grace and with so many pretty speeches and compliments that the widows partner was visibly impressed a fact which curiously enough seemed to be anything but agreeable to the widow  after that they all filed off to supper where they found the dancers already in possession and there was much crushing and crowding which tended to do away with ceremony and to promote the harmony of the evening  if the major had contrived to win favour from mrs lavinia scully in the early part of the evening he managed now to increase any advantage he had gained  in the first place he inquired in a very loud voice of captain tuck at the other end of the table whether that gentleman had ever met the deceased majorgeneral scully and being answered in the negative he descanted fluently upon the merits of that imaginary warrior  after this unscrupulous manoeuvre the major proceeded to do justice to the wine and to indulge in sporting reminiscences and military reminiscences and travelling reminiscences and social reminiscences all of which he treated in a manner which called forth the admiration of his audience  then when supper had at last been finished and the last cork drawn and the last glass filled the dancers went back to their dance and the cardplayers to their cards and the major addressed himself more assiduously than ever to the pursuit of the widow  i am afraid that you find the rooms very hot major she remarked  they are rather hot he answered candidly  there is a room here she said where you might be cooler  you might have a cigarette too  i meant these rooms as smokingrooms  then you must come too  no no major  you must remember that i am the hostess  but there is no one to entertain  they are all entertaining each other  you are too unselfish  but really major  sure you are tired out and need a little rest  he held the door open so persuasively that she yielded  it was a snug little room somewhat retired from the bustle with two or three chintzcovered chairs scattered round it and a sofa of the same material at one side  the widow sat down at one end of this sofa and the major perched himself at the other looking even redder than usual and puffing out his chest and frowning as was his custom upon critical occasions  do light a cigarette said mrs scully  but the smell  i like it  the major extracted one from his flat silver case  his companion rolled a spill and lit it at the gas  to one who is as lonely as i am she remarked it is a pleasure to feel that one has friends near one and to serve them even in trifles  lonely said the major shuffling along the sofa i might talk with authority on that point  if i were to turn me toes up tomorrow theres not a human being would care a thraneen about the mather unless it were old von baumser  oh dont talk so cried mrs scully with emotion  it is a fact  ive kicked against me fate at times though  ive had fancies of late of something happier and cheerier  they have come on me as i sat over yonder at the window and do what i will i have not been able to git them from me heart  yit i know how rash i have been to treasure them for if they fail me i shall feel me loneliness as i niver did before  the major paused and cleared his throat huskily while the widow remained silent with her head bent and her eyes intent upon the pattern of the carpet  these hopes are said the major in a low voice leaning forward and taking his companions little ringcovered hand in his thick pudgy fingers that you will have pity upon me that you will  ach my very goot vriend cried von baumser heartily suddenly protruding his hairy head into the room and smiling benignantly  go to the divil roared the major springing furiously to his feet while the germans head disappeared like a jackinthebox forgive the warmth of me language the veteran continued apologetically but me feelings overcame me  will you be mine lavinia  i am a plain ould soldier and have little to offer you save a faithful heart and that is yours and always will be  will you make the remainder of me life happy by becoming me wife  he endeavoured to pass his arm round her waist but she sprang up from the sofa and stood upon the rug facing him with an amused and somewhat triumphant smile upon her buxom features  look here major she said i am a plainspoken woman as my poor tom thats dead was a plainspoken man  out with it straight nowhave you come after me or have you come after my money  the major was so astonished at this pointblank question that for a moment he sat speechless upon the sofa  being a man of ready resource however and one who was accustomed to sudden emergencies he soon recovered himself  yoursilf of course cried he  if you hadnt a stiver i would do the same  take care take care said the lady with a warning finger uplifted you heard of the breaking of the agra bank  what of that  every penny that i had in the world was in it  this was facer number two for the campaigner  he recovered himself more quickly from this one however and inflated his chest with even more than his usual pomposity  lavinia said he you have been straight with me and bedad ill be so with you  when i first thought of you i was down in the world and much as i admired you i own that your money was an inducement as well as yoursilf  i was so placed that it was impossible for me to think of any woman who had not enough to keep up her own end of the game since that time ive done bether  how i got it is neither here nor there but i have a little nistegg in the bank and see me way to increasing it  you tell me your moneys gone and i tell you ive enough for two so say the word acushla and its done  what without the money  damn the money exclaimed major tobias clutterbuck and put his arm for the second time around his companion  this time it remained there what happened after that is neither my business nor the readers couples who have left their youth behind them have their own little romance quite as much as their juniors and it is occasionally the more heartfelt of the two  what a naughty boy to swear exclaimed the widow at last  now i must give you a lecture since i have the chance  bless her mischievous eyes cried the major with delight in every feature of his face  you shall give me as many lectures as you plase  you must be good then toby if you are to be my husband  you must not play billiards for money any more  no billiards  why pool is worth three or four pound a wake to me  it doesnt matter  no billiards and no cards and no racing and no betting  toby must be very good and behave as a distinguished soldier should do  what are you afther at all the major cried  sure if i am to give up me pool and whist how is a distinguished soldier and above all a distinguished soldiers wife going to live  well manage dear she said looking roguishly up into his face i told you that my money was all in the agra bank that broke  you did worse luck  but i didnt tell you that i had drawn it all out before it broke toby dear  it was too bad to put you to such a trial wasnt it but really i couldnt resist the temptation  toby shall have money enough without betting and he shall settle down and tell his stories and do what he likes without anything to bother him  bless her heart cried the major fervently and the battered old bohemian as he stooped over and kissed her felt a tear spring to his eyes as he knew that he had come into harbour after lifes stormy tossings  no billiards or cards for three months then said the little woman firmly with her hands round his arm  none at all mind  i am going into hampshire on a visit to my cousins in the country and you shall not see me for that time though you may write  if you can give me your word of honour when i come back that youve given up your naughty ways why then  what then  wait till then and youll see she said with a merry laugh no really i wont stay another moment  whatever will the guests say i must toby i really must  away she tripped while the major remained standing where she had left him feeling a better man than he had done since he was a young ensign and kissed his mother for the last time at the portsmouth jetty before the great transport carried him off to india  everything in the world must have an end and mrs scullys dance was no exception to the rule  the day was breaking however before the last guests had muffled themselves up and the last hansom dashed away from the door  the major lingered behind to bid farewell and then rejoined his german friend who had been compelled to wait at the door for the latchkey  look here major the latter said when they came into their room is it well to tell a brussian gentleman to go to the devil  you have much offended me  truly i was surprised that you should have so spoken  me dear friend the old soldier answered shaking his hand i would not hurt your feelings for the world  bedad if i come into the room while you are proposing to a lady you are welcome to use the strongest german verb to me that you can lay your tongue to  you have probosed then cried the goodnatured german forgetting all about his grievance in an instant  yes  and been tookreceived by her  yes  dat is gloriful von baumser cried clapping his hands  three hochs for frau scully and another one for frau clutterbuck  we must drink a drink on it we truly must  so we shall me boy but its time we turned in now  shes a good woman and she plays a good hand at whist  ged she cleared the trumps and made her long suit tonight as well as ever i saw it done in me life  with which characteristic piece of eulogy the major bade his comrade good night and retired to his room    chapter xxx   at the cock and cowslip  tom dimsdales duties were far from light  not only was he expected to supervise the clerks accounts and to treat with the wholesale dealers but he was also supposed to spend a great part of his time in the docks overlooking the loading of the outgoing ships and checking the cargo of the incoming ones  this latter portion of his work was welcome as taking him some hours a day from the close countinghouse and allowing him to get a sniff of the sea airif indeed a sniff is to be had on the inland side of woolwich  there was a pleasing life and bustle too in the broad brown river with its neverending panorama of vessels of every size and shape which ebb and flow in the great artery of national life  so interesting was this liquid highway to toms practical mind that he would often stand at the head of the wharf when his work was done and smoke a meditative pipe  it was a quiet spot which had once been busy enough but was now superseded by new quays and more convenient landingplaces  all over it were scattered great rusty anchors colossal iron chains deserted melancholy boilers and other debris which are found in such places and which might seem to the fanciful to be the shells and skeletons of strange monsters washed up there by the tide  to whom do these things belong  who has an interest in them of what use are they  it appeared to tom sometimes as if the original owners and their heirs must have all died away and left these grim relics behind them to any one who might have the charity to remove them  from this coign of vantage a long reach of the river was visible and tom sitting there would watch the fleets of passing vessels and let his imagination wander away to the broad oceans which they had traversed and the fair lands under bluer skies and warmer suns from which they had sailed  here is a tiny steamtug panting and toiling in front of a majestic threemaster with her great black hulk towering out of the water and her masts shooting up until the topmast rigging looks like the delicate web of some titanic spider  she is from canton with tea and coffee and spices and all good things from the land of small feet and almond eyes  here too is a messagerie boat the french ensign drooping daintily over her stern and her steam whistle screeching a warning to some obstinate lighters crawling with their burden of coal to a grimy collier whose steamwinch is whizzing away like a corncrake of the deep  that floating palace is an orient boat from australia see how as the darkness falls a long row of yellow eyes glimmer out from her sides as the light streams through her countless portholes and there is the rotterdam packetboat coming slowly up very glad to get back into safe waters again for she has had a wildish time in the north sea  a coasting brig has evidently had a wilder time still for her maintopmast is cracked across and her rigging is full of the little human mites who crawl about and reef and splice and mend  an old acquaintance of ours was out in that same gale and is even now making his way into the shelter of the albert docks  this was none other than the redoubtable captain hamilton miggs whose ship will persistently keep afloat to the astonishment of the gallant captain himself and of every one else who knows anything of her seagoing qualities  again and again she had been on the point of foundering and again and again some change in the weather or the steady pumping of the crew had prevented her from fulfilling her destiny  so surprised was the skipper at these repeated interpositions of providence that he had quite made up his superstitious mind that the ship never would go down and now devoted himself with a whole heart to his old occupation of drinking himself into delirium tremens and physicking himself out of it again  the black eagle had a fair cargo aboard and miggs was proportionately jubilant  the drunken old seadog had taken a fancy to toms frank face and honest eyes and greeted him with effusion when he came aboard next morning  knock me asunder but you look rosy man he cried  its easy to see that you have not been lying off fernando po or getting the land mist into your lungs in the gaboon  you look well yourself captain said tom  tolerable tolerable  just a touch of the jumps at times  we can begin getting our cargo out i suppose  i have a list here to check it  will you have the hatches off at once  no work for me said captain hamilton miggs with decision here sandysandy mcpherson start the cargo will ye and stir your great scotch bones  ive done enough in bringing this sieve of a ship all the way from africa without working when i am in dock  mcpherson was the first mate a tall yellowbearded aberdonian ill see tit he said shortly  you can gang ashore or where you wull  the cock and cowslip said the captain i say youmaster dimsdalewhen youre done come up an have a glass o wine with me im only a plain sailor man but im damned if my heart aint in the right place  you too mcphersonyoull come up and show mr dimsdale the way  cock and cowslip corner o sextant court  the two having accepted his invitation the captain shuffled off across the gangway and on to terra firma  all day tom stood at the hatchway of the black eagle checking the cargo as it was hoisted out of her while mcpherson and his motley assistants dock labourers seamen and black kroomen from the coast worked and toiled in the depths below  the engine rattled and snorted and the great chain clanked as it was lowered into the hold  make fast there cries the mate  aye aye sir  all right  all right sir  hoist away  and clank clank went the chain again and whirrr the engine and up would come a pair of oil casks as though the crane were some giant forceps which was plucking out the great wooden teeth of the vessel it seemed to tom as he stood looking down notebook in hand that some of the actual malarious air of the coast had been carried home in the hold so foul and close were the smells evolved from it  great cockchafers crawled about over the packages and occasionally a rat would scamper over the barrels such a rat as is only to be found in ships which hail from the tropics  on one occasion too as a tusk of ivory was being hoisted out there was a sudden cry of alarm among the workers and a long yellow snake crawled out of the cavity of the trunk and writhed away into the darkness  it is no uncommon thing to find the deadly creatures hibernating in the hollow of the tusks until the cold english air arouses them from their torpor to the cost occasionally of some unhappy stevedore or labourer  all day tom stood amid grease and steam bustle and blasphemy checking off the cargo and looking to its conveyance to the warehouses  at one oclock there was a break of an hour for dinner and then the work went on until six when all hands struck and went off to their homes or to the publichouse according to inclination  tom and the mate both fairly tired by their days work prepared to accept the captains invitation and to meet him up in his quarters  the mate dived down into his cabin and soon reappeared with his face shining and his long hair combed into some sort of order  ive been performing my ablutions he said rolling out the last word with great emphasis and pomposity for like many scotchmen he had the greatest possible reverence for a sonorous polysyllable  indeed in mcpherson this national foible was pushed to excess for however inappropriate the word he never hesitated to drag it into his conversation if he thought it would aid in the general effect  the captain he continued has been far from salubrious this voyage hes aye complainin o his bodily infirmities  hypochondriacal perhaps tom remarked  the scotchman looked at his companion with a great accession of respect my certie he cried  thats the best ive heard since a word that jimmy mgee of the corisco said the voyage afore last  would you kindly arteeculate it again  hypochondriacal said tom laughing heartily  hypochondriacal the mate repeated slowly  i shouldnt think jimmy mgee kens that or hed ha communicated it to me  i shall certainly utilize it and am obleeged to you for namin it  dont mention it said tom  ill let you have as many long words as you like if you are a collector of them  but what is the matter with the captain  its aye the drink the mate said gravely  i can tak my modicum mysel and enjoy it but thats no the same as for a man to lock himself up in his cabin and drink rum steady on from four bells in the mornin watch to eight bells in the evenin  and then the cussin and prayin and swearin as he sets up is just awfu  its what might weel be described as pandemoniacal  is he often like that then tom asked  often  why hes never anything else sir  and yet hes a good seaman too and however fu he may be he keeps some form o reckoning and never vera far oot either  hes an ambeequosity to me sir for if i took a tithe o the amount id be clean daft  he must be dangerous when he is like that tom remarked  he is that  he emptied a saxshooter down the deck last bout he had and nigh perforated the carpenter  another time he scoots after the cookchased him with a handspike in his hand right up the rigging to the crosstrees  if the cook hadnt slid down the backstay of the mast hed ha been obeetuarised  tom could not refrain from laughing at the last expression  thats a new word he said  ha his companion cried with great satisfaction it is is it then we are quits now on the hypochondriacal  he was so pleased that he chuckled to himself for some minutes in the depths of his tawny beard  yes he continued at last he is dangerous to us at times and he is dangerous to you  this is atween oorsels as man to man and is said withoot prejudice but he do go on when he is in they fits aboot the firm and aboot insurances and rotten ships and ither such things which is all vera well when sequestrated amang gentlemen like oorsels but sounds awfu bad when it fas on the ignorant tympanums of common seamen  its scandalous tom said gravely that he should spread such reports about his employer  our ships are old and some of them in my opinion hardly safe but thats a very different thing from implying as you hint that mr girdlestone wishes them to go down  well no argue aboot that said the canny scot  muster girdlestone kens on which side his bread is buttered  he may wish em to sink or he may wish em to swim  thats no for us to judge  youll hear him speak ot tonight as like as not for hes aye on it when hes half over here we are sir  the corner edifice wi the red blinds in the window  during this conversation the two had been threading their way through the intricate and dirty lanes which lead up from the water side to the outskirts of stepney  it was quite dark by the time that they reached a long thoroughfare lined by numerous shops with great gas flares outside them  many of these belonged to dealers in marine stores and the numerous suits of oilskin hung up for exhibition swung to and fro in the uncertain light like rows of attenuated pirates  at every corner was a great publichouse with glittering windows and a crowd of slatternly women and jerseyclad men elbowing each other at the door at the largest and most imposing of these ginpalaces the mate and dimsdale now pulled up  come in this way said mcpherson who had evidently paid many a visit there before  pushing open a swinging door he made his way into the crowded bar where the reek of bad spirits and the smell of squalid humanity seemed to tom to be even more horrible than the effluvium of the greaseladen hold  captain miggs in asked mcpherson of a rubicund whiteaproned personage behind the bar  yes sir  hes in his room sir and expectin you  theres a gent with him sir but he told me to send you up  this way sir  they were pushing their way through the crowd to reach the door which led behind the bar when toms attention was arrested by the conversation of a very seedylooking individual who was leaning with his elbows upon the zinccovered counter  you take my tip he said to an elderly man beside him  you stick to the beer  the sperits in here is clean poison and its a sin and a shame as they should be let sell such stuff to christian men see heresee my sleeve  he showed the threadbare cuff of his coat which was corroded away in one part as by a powerful acid  i give ye my word i done that by wiping my lips wi it two or three times after drinkin at this bar  that was afore i found out that the whisky was solid vitriol  if thread and cotton cant stand it hows the linin of a poor coves stomach id like to know  i wonder thought tom to himself if one of these poor devils goes home and murders his wife who ought to be hung for it  is it he or that smugfaced villain behind the bar who for the sake of the gain of a few greasy coppers gives him the poison that maddens him  he was still pondering over this knotty point when they were ushered into the captains room  that worthy was leaning back in a rockingchair with his feet perched upon the mantelpiece and a large glass of rum arid water within reach of his great leathery hand  opposite him in a similar chair and with a similar glass was no less an individual than our old acquaintance von baumser  as a mercantile clerk in the london office of a hamburg firm the german was thrown into contact with the shippers of the african fleet and had contracted a special alliance with the bibulous miggs who was a social soul in his hours of relaxation  come in my hearties come in he cried huskily  take a seat mr dimsdale  and you sandy cant you bring yourself to your berth without being asked  you should know your moorings by this time this is my friend mr von baumser from eckermanns office  and dis i think is mr dimsdale said the german shaking hands with tom  i have heard my very goot vriend major clutterbuck speak of your name sir  ah the old major tom answered  of course i remember him well  he is not so very old either said von baumser in a somewhat surly voice  he has been took by a very charming and entirely pleasant woman and they are about to be married before three months the one to the other  let me tell you sir i who have lived with him so long dat i have met no man for whom i have greater respect than for the major however much they give him pills at a club or other such snobberies  fill your glasses miggs broke in pushing over the bottle of rum there are weeds in that boxnever paid duty either the one or the other  by the lord sandy a couple of days ago we hardly hoped ever to be yarning here  it was rather beyond our prognostication sir said the mate taking a pull at his rum  it was that  a nasty sea on mr dimsdale sir and the old ship so full o water that she could not rise to it  they were making a clean breach over us and we lost nigh everything we could lose  i suppose youll have her thoroughly repaired now tom remarked  both the skipper and the mate laughed heartily at the observation that wouldnt do sandy would it said miggs shaking his head we couldnt afford to have our screw cut down like that  cut down  you dont mean to say you are paid in proportion to the rottenness of the ships  there aint no use makin a secret of it among friends said miggs thats just how the land lies with us  a voyage or two back i spoke to mr girdlestone and i says to him says i give the ship an overhauling says i  well and good says he but it will mean so much off your wage says he and the mates wage as well  i put it to him straight and strong but he stuck at that  so sandy and me we put our heads together and we greed it was better to take fifteen pound and the risk than come down to twelve pound and safety  it is scandalous cried tom dimsdale hotly  i could not have believed it  god bless ye its done every day and will be while there is insurance money to be gained said miggs blowing a blue cloud up to the ceiling its an easy thing to turn a few thousands a year while there are old ships to be bought and offices which will insure them above their value  there was darcy campbell of the silvertownwhat a trade that man did  he was smarttarnation smart  collisions was his line and he worked em well  there warnt a skipper out of liverpool as could get run down as natral as he could  get run down  aye  hed go lolloping about in the channel if there was any fog on steering for the lights o any steamers or headin round for all the fog whistles if it was too thick to see  sooner or later as sure as fate hed get cut down to the waters edge  lor it was a fine game half a yard o print about his noble conduc in the newspapers and maybe a leader about the british tar and unexpected emergencies it once went the length o a subscription  ha ha miggs laughed until he choked  and what became of this british star asked the german  hes still about  hes in the passenger trade now  potztausand von baumser ejaculated  i would not go as a passenger with him for something  theres many a way that its done sir the mate added filling up his glass again and passing the bottle to the captain  theres loadin a cranky vessel wi grain in bulk without usin partition boards  if you get a little water in as you are bound to do with a ship o that kind the grain will swell and swell until it bursts the seams open and down ye go  then theres ignition o coal gas aboard o steamers  thats a safe game for nobody can deny it  and there are accidents to propellers  if the shaft o a propeller breaks in heavy weather its a bad lookout  ive known ships leave the docks with their propellers half sawn through all round  lor theres no end o the tricks o the trade  i cannot believe however said tom stoutly that mr girdlestone connives at such things  hes on the waitin lay the seaman answered  he doesnt send em down but he just hangs on and keeps his insurances up and trusts in providence  hes had some good hauls that way though not o late there was the belinda at cape palmas  that was five thousand clear if it was a penny  and the sockatoothat was a bad business she was never heard of nor her crew  went down at sea and left no trace  the crew too tom cried with horror  but how about yourselves if what you say is true  we are paid for the risk said both the seamen shrugging their shoulders  but there are government inspectors  ha ha i dare say youve seen the way some o them do their work said miggs  toms mind was filled with consternation at what he had heard  if the african merchant were capable of this what might he not be capable of was his word to be depended on under any circumstances  and what sort of firm must this be which turned so fair a side to the world and in which he had embarked his fortune  all these thoughts flashed through his mind as he listened to the gossip of the garrulous old sea dogs a greater shock still however was in store for him  von baumser had been listening to the conversation with an amused look upon his goodhumoured face  ah said he suddenly striking in i vill tell you something of your own firm which perhaps you do not know  have you heard dat mr ezra girdlestone is about to be married  to be married  oh yes i have heard it dis morning at eckermanns office  i think it is the talk of the city  whos the gal miggs asked with languid interest  i disremember her name von baumser answered  it is a girl the major has metthe young lady who has lived in the same house and is vat they call a warder  notnot his ward cried tom springing to his feet and turning as white as a sheet  not miss harston  you dont tell me that he is going to marry miss harston  dat is the name  miss harston it is sure enough  it is a liean infamous lie tom cried hotly  so it may be von baumser answered serenely  i do but say vat i have heard and heard more than once on good authority  if it is true there is villainy in it cried tom with wild eyes the blackest villainy that ever was done upon earth  ill goill see him tonight  by heavens i shall know the truth he rushed furiously downstairs and through the bar  there was a cab near the door drive into london he cried 69 eccleston square  i am on fire to be there  the cabman sprang on the box and they rattled away as fast as the horse would go  this sudden exit caused as may be imagined considerable surprise in the parlour of the cock and cowslip  hes a vera tumultuous young man the mate remarked  he was off like a clipper in a hurricane  i perceive said von baumser dat he has left his hat behind him i do now remember dat i have heard his name spoken with dat of dis very young lady by my good vriend the major  then hes jealous belike said hamilton miggs with a knowing shake of the head  ive felt that way myself before now  i rounded on billy barlow o the flying scud over that very thing twelve months ago come christmas  but i dont think it was the thing for this young chap to cut away and never say with your leave or by your leave or as much as good night gentlemen all  it aint what you call straight up an down  its transcendental said the mate severely that is what i call it  ah my vriends the german put in when a man is in love you must make excuses for him  i am very sure dat he did mean no offence  in spite of this assurance captain hamilton miggs continued to be very sore upon the point  it was only by dint of many replenishings of his glass and many arguments that his companions could restore him to his pristine good humour  meanwhile the truant was speeding through the night with a fixed determination in his heart that he should have before morning such an understanding one way or the other as would never again leave room for a doubt    chapter xxxi   a crisis at eccleston square  his fathers encouraging words had given ezra girdlestone fresh heart and he had renewed his importunities with greater energy than ever never surely did any man devote every moment of his time more completely to the winning of a womans heart  from morning until night the one idea was ever before his mind and every little want of kates was forestalled with a care and foresight which astonished her  the richest fruit and flowers found their way unexpectedly into her room her table was littered with the latest books from mudies and the newest pieces lay upon her musicstand  nothing which attention and thoughtfulness could do was left undone either by the father or the son  in spite of these attentions however and the frequent solicitations of her guardian kate stood firmly to her colours  if the tom of the present were false she at least would be true to the memory of the tom of other days the lad who had first whispered words of love into her ears  her ideal should remain with her whatever might befall  no other man could ever take the place of that  that tom was from some unexplained and unaccountable reason false to her appeared to be beyond all question  her trusting and innocent heart could not dream of the subtle network which was being wound round her her secluded life had left her very ignorant of the ways of the world and the possibility of an elaborate deceit being practised upon her had never occurred to her  from the day that she heard the extract of the letter read by her guardian she never doubted but that such letters were received at the office by the man who professed to love her  how could she hesitate to believe it when it was confirmed by his avoidance of eccleston square and of herself  the cause of it all was a mystery which no amount of speculation could clear up  sometimes the poor girl would blame herself as is the way of women in such cases  i have not seen enough of the world she would say to herself  i have none of the charms of these women whom i read of in the novels  no doubt i seemed dull and insipid in his eyes  and yetand yet  there always remained at the end of her cogitations the same vague sense of bewilderment and mystery  she endeavoured as far as possible to avoid ezra girdlestone and stay in her room for the most part on the days when he was at home  he had however on the advice of his father ceased pressing his suit except in the silent manner aforementioned so that she gradually took courage and ended by resuming her old habits  in her heart she pitied the young merchant very sincerely for he was looking haggard and pale poor fellow she thought as she watched him he certainly loves me ah tom tom had you only been as constant how happy we should be she was even prompted sometimes to cheer ezra up by some kind word or look  this he naturally took to be an encouragement to renew his advances  perhaps he was not far wrong for if love be wanting pity is occasionally an excellent substitute  one morning after breakfast the elder girdlestone called his son aside into the library  ive had a notice he said as to paying up dividends  our time is short ezra  you must bring matters to a head if you dont it will be too late  you mustnt pick fruit before it is ripe the other answered moodily  you can try if it is ripe though  if not you can try again  i think that your chance is a good one  she is alone in the breakfastroom and the table has been cleared  you cannot have a better opening  go my son and may heaven prosper you  very well  do you wait in here and i shall let you know how things go  the young man buttoned up his coat pulled down his cuffs and walked back into the breakfastroom with a sullen look of resolution upon his dark face  kate was sitting in a wicker chair by the window arranging flowers in a vase  the morning sunlight streaming in upon her gave a colour to her pale face and glittered in her heavy coils of chestnut hair  she wore a light pink morning dress which added to the ethereal effect of her lithe beautiful figure  as ezra entered she looked round and started at sight of his face  instinctively she knew on what errand he had come  you will be late at fenchurch street she said with a constrained smile  it is nearly eleven now  i am not going to the office today he answered gravely  i am come in here kate to know my fate  you know very well and must have known for some time back that i love you  if youll marry me youll make me a happy man and ill make you a happy woman  im not very eloquent and that sort of thing but what i say i mean  what have you to say in answer  he leaned his broad hands on the back of a chair as he spoke and drummed nervously with his fingers  kate had drooped her head over the flowers but she looked up at him now with frank pitying eyes  put this idea out of your head ezra she said in a low but firm voice  believe me i shall always be grateful to you for the kindness which you have shown me of late  i will be a sister to you if you will let me but i can never be more  and why not asked ezra still leaning over the chair with an angry light beginning to sparkle in his dark eyes  why can you never be my wife  it is so ezra  you must not think of it  i am so sorry to grieve you  you cant love me then cried the young merchant hoarsely other women before now would have given their eyes to have had me do you know that  for goodness sake then go back to the others said kate half amused and half angry  that suspicion of a smile upon her face was the one thing needed to set ezras temper in a blaze  you wont have me he cried savagely i havent got the airs and graces of that fellow i suppose you havent got him out of your head though he is off with another girl  how dare you speak to me so kate cried springing to her feet in honest anger  its the truth and you know it returned ezra with a sneer arent you too proud to be hanging on to a man who doesnt want you a man that is a smoothtongued sneak with the heart of a rabbit  if he were here you would not dare to say so kate retorted hotly  wouldnt i he snarled fiercely  no you wouldnt  i dont believe that he has ever been untrue to me i believe that you and your father have planned to make me believe it and to keep us apart  heaven knows what it was that suddenly brought this idea most clearly before kates mind   perhaps it was that ezras face distorted with passion gave her some dim perception of the wickedness of which such a nature might be capable  the dark face turned so much darker at her words that she felt a great throb of joy at her heart and knew that this strange new thought which had flashed upon her was the truth  you cant deny it she cried with shining eyes and clenched hands you know that it is true  i shall see him and hear from his own lips what he has to say  he loves me still and i love him and have never ceased to love him  oh you do do you snarled ezra taking a step forward with a devilish gleam in his eyes  your love may do him very little good we shall see which of us gets the best of it in the long run  well his passion was so furious that he stopped fairly unable to articulate another word  with a threatening motion of his hands he turned upon his heel and rushed from the room  as he passed it chanced that flo kates little skye terrier ran across his path  all the brutality of the mans soul rose up in the instant  he raised his heavy boot and sent the poor little creature howling and writhing under the sofa whence it piteously emerged upon three legs trailing the fourth one behind it  the brute kate cried as she fondled the injured animal and poured indignant tears over it  her gentle soul was so stirred by the cowardly deed that she felt that she could have flown at her late suitor were he still in the room  poor little flo  that kick was meant for me in reality my little pet  never mind dear there are bright days coming and he has not forgotten me flo  i know it  i know it  the little dog whined sympathetically and licked its mistresss hand as though it were looking into its canine future and could also discern better days ahead  ezra girdlestone fierce and lowering tramped into the library and told his father brusquely of the result of his wooing  what occurred in that interview was never known to any third person  the servants who had some idea that something was afoot have recorded that at the beginning of the conversation the bass voice of the son and the high raucous tones of the father were heard in loud recrimination and reproach  then they suddenly sunk into tones so low that there might have been complete silence in the room for all that any one could tell from the passage outside  this whispered conversation may have lasted the greater part of an hour  at the end of it the young merchant departed for the city  it has been remarked that from that time there came a change over both the father and the sona change so subtle that it could hardly be described though it left its mark upon them both it was not that the grey wolfish face of the old man looked even greyer and fiercer or that the hard arrogant expression of ezra deepened into something even more sinister  it was that a shadow hung over both their browsa vague indefinable shadowas of men who carry a thought in their minds on which it is not good to dwell  during that long hour kate had remained in the breakfastroom still nursing her injured companion and very busy with her own thoughts she was as convinced now that tom had been true to her as if she had had the assurance from his own lips  still there was much that was unaccountablemuch which she was unable to fathom  a vague sense of the wickedness around her depressed and weighed her down  what deep scheme could these men have invented to keep him away from her during these long weeks  was he too under some delusion or the victim of some conspiracy  whatever had been done was certainly connived at by her guardian  for the first time a true estimate of the character of the elder girdlestone broke upon her and she dimly realized that the pious softspoken merchant was more to be dreaded than his brutal son a shudder ran through her whole frame as looking up she saw him standing before her  his appearance was far from reassuring  his hands were clasped behind his back his head bent forward and he surveyed her with a most malignant expression upon his face  well done he said with a bitter smile  well done  this is a good mornings work miss harston  you have repaid your fathers friend for the care he has bestowed upon you  my only wish is to leave your house cried kate with an angry flash in her deep blue eyes  you are a cruel wicked hypocritical old man you have deceived me about mr dimsdale  i read it in your sons face and now i read it in your own  how could you do itoh how could you have the heart  john girdlestone was fairly staggered by this blaze of feminine anger in his demure and obedient ward  god knows he said whatever my faults may have been neglect of you has not been among them  i am not immaculate  even the just man falleth  if i have endeavoured to wean you from this foolish love affair of yours it has been entirely because i saw that it was against your own interests  you have told lies in order to turn me away from the only man who ever loved me  you and your odious son have conspired to ruin my happiness and break my heart  what have you told him that keeps him away i shall see him and learn the truth  kates face was unnaturally calm and rigid as she faced her guardians angry gaze  silence the old man cried hoarsely  you forget your position in this house  you are presuming too much upon my kindness  as to this girls fancy of yours you may put all thought of it out of your head i am still your guardian and i should be culpably remiss if i ever allowed you to see this man again  this afternoon you shall come with me to hampshire  to hampshire  yes  i have taken a small country seat there where we intend to spend some months of the winter  you shall leave it when you have reconciled yourself to forget these romantic ideas of yoursbut not till then  then i shall never leave it said kate with a sigh  that will depend upon yourself  you shall at least be guarded there from the advances of designing persons  when you come of age you may follow your own fancies  until then my conscience demands and the law allows that i should spare no pains to protect you from your own folly we start from waterloo at four  girdlestone turned for the door but looked round as he was leaving the room  may god forgive you he said solemnly raising his lean hands towards the ceiling for what you have done this day  poor kate left to herself was much concerned by this fresh misfortune she knew that her guardian had power to carry out his plan and that there was no appeal from his decision  what could she do  she had not a friend in the wide world to whom she could turn for advice or assistance  it occurred to her to fly to the dimsdales at kensington and throw herself upon their compassion  it was only the thought of tom which prevented her  in her heart she had fully exonerated him yet there was much to be explained before they could be to each other as of old  she might write to mrs dimsdale but then her guardian had not told her what part of hampshire they were going to  she finally came to the conclusion that it would be better to wait and to write when she had reached her destination  in the meantime she went drearily to her room and began packing aided by the ruddycheeked maid rebecca  at halfpast three a cab drove up to the door and the old merchant stepped out of it  the boxes were thrown upon the top and the young lady curtly ordered to get in  girdlestone took his seat beside her and gave a sign to the cabman to drive on  as they rattled out of the square kate looked back at the great gloomy mansion in which she had spent the last three years of her life  had she known what the future was to bring it is possible that she would have clung even to that sombre and melancholy old house as to an ark of safety  another cab passed through eccleston square that eveninga cab which bore a palefaced and wildeyed young man who looked ever and anon impatiently out of the window to see if he were nearing his destination long before reaching no 69 he had opened the door and was standing upon the step  the instant that the cab pulled up he sprang off and rang loudly at the great brass bell which flanked the heavy door  is mr girdlestone in he asked as rebecca appeared at the door  no sir  miss harston is she at home he said excitedly  no sir  they have both gone away  gone away  yes  gone into the country sir  and mr ezra too sir  and when are they coming back he asked in bewilderment  they are not coming back  impossible tom cried in despair  what is their address then  they have left no address  i am sorry i cant help you  good night sir  rebecca closed the door laughing maliciously at the visitors bewildered looks  she knew the facts of the case well and having long been jealous of her young mistress she was not sorry to find things going wrong with her  tom dimsdale stood upon the doorstep looking blankly into the night he felt dazed and bewildered  what fresh villainy was this  was it a confirmation of the germans report or was it a contradiction of it cold beads stood upon his forehead as he thought of the possibility of such a thing  i must find her he cried with clenched hands and turned away heartsick into the turmoil and bustle of the london streets    chapter xxxii   a conversation in the eccleston square library  rebecca the freshcomplexioned waitingmaid was still standing behind the ponderous hall door listening with a smile upon her face to young dimsdales retreating footsteps when another and a brisker tread caught her ear coming from the opposite direction  the smile died away as she heard it and her features assumed a peculiar expression in which it would be hard to say whether fear or pleasure predominated  she passed her hands up over her face and smoothed her hair with a quick nervous gesture glancing down at the same time at her snowy apron and the bright ribbons which set it off  whatever her intentions may have been she had no time to improve upon her toilet before a key turned in the door and ezra girdlestone stepped into the hall  as he saw her shadowy figure for the gas was low he uttered a hoarse cry of surprise and fear and staggered backwards against the doorpost  dont be afeared mister ezra she said in a whisper its only me  the devil take you cried ezra furiously  what makes you stand about like that  you gave me quite a turn  i didnt mean for to do it  ive only just been answering of the door why surely youve come in before now and found me in the hall without making much account of it  ah lass answered ezra my nerves have had a shake of late ive felt queer all day  look how my hand shakes  well im blessed said the girl with a titter turning up the gas i never thought to see you afeared of anything  why you looks as white as a sheet  there thats enough he answered roughly  where are the others  jane is out  cook and william and the boy are downstairs  come into the library here  they will think that you are up in the bedrooms  i want to have a quiet word or two with you  turn up that reading lamp  well are they gone  yes they are gone she answered standing by the side of the couch on which he had thrown himself  your father came about three with a cab and took her away  she didnt make a fuss  make a fuss  no why should she  theres fuss enough made about her in all conscience  oh ezra before she got between us you was kind to me at times  i could stand harsh words from you six days a week if there was a chance of a kind one on the seventh  but nownow what notice do you take of me  she began to whimper and to wipe her eyes with a little discoloured pockethandkerchief  drop it woman drop it cried her companion testily  i want information not snivelling  she seemed reconciled to go  yes she went quiet enough the girl said with a furtive sob  just give me a drop of brandy out of that bottle over therethe one with the cork half out  ive not got over my start yet  did you hear my father say anything as to where they were going  i heard him tell the cabman to drive to waterloo station  nothing more  no  well if he wont tell you i will  they have gone down to hampshire my lass  bedsworth is the name of the place and it is a pleasant little corner near the sea  i want you to go down there as well tomorrow  want me to go  yes they need some one who is smart and handy to keep house for them there is some old woman already i believe but she is old and useless ill warrant you wouldnt take long getting things shipshape  my father intends to stay down there some little time with miss harston  and how about you the girl asked with a quick flash of suspicion in her dark eyes  dont trouble about me  i shall stay behind and mind the business some one must be on the spot  i think cook and jane and william ought to be able to look after me among them  and i wont see you at all the girl cried with a quiver in her voice  oh yes you shall  ill be down from saturday to monday every week and perhaps oftener  if business goes well i may come down and stay for some time  whether i do or not may depend upon you  rebecca taylforth started and uttered an exclamation of surprise how can it depend upon me she asked eagerly  well said ezra in a hesitating way it may depend upon whether you are a good girl and do what you are told or not  i am sure that you would do anything to serve me would you not  you know very well that i would mister ezra  when you want anything done you remember it but if you have no use for me then there is never a kind look on your face or a kind word from your lips  if i was a dog you could not use me worse  i could stand your harshness  i could stand the blow you gave me and forgive you for it from my heart but oh it cut me to the very soul to be standing by and waiting while you were making up to another woman  it was more than i can bear  never mind my girl said ezra in a soothing voice  thats all over and done with  see what ive brought you  he rummaged in his pocket and produced a little parcel of tissue paper which he handed to her  it was only a small silver anchor with scotch pebbles inlaid in it the womans eyes however flashed as she looked at it and she raised it to her lips and kissed it passionately  god bless it and you too she said  ive heard tell as the anchors the emblem of hope and so it shall be with me  oh ezra you may travel far and meet them as can play and can sing and do many a thing as i cant do but youll never get one who will love you as dearly and well  i know it my lass i know it said ezra smoothing down her dark hair for she had dropped upon her knees beside the couch  ive never met your equal yet  thats why i want you down at bedsworth  i must have some one there that i can trust  what am i to do down at bedsworth she asked  i want you to be miss harstons companion  shell be lonely and will need some other woman in the house to look after her  curse her cried rebecca springing to her feet with flashing eyes you are still thinking of her then  she must have this she must have that  everything else is as dirt before her  ill not serve herso there  you can knock me down if you like  rebecca said ezra slowly do you hate kate harston  from the bottom of my soul she answered  well if you hate her i tell you that i hate her a thousand times more  you thought that i was fond of her  all that is over now and you may set your mind at ease  why do you want her so well cared for then asked the girl suspiciously  i want some one who feels towards her as i do to be by her side if she were never to come back from bedsworth it would be nothing to me  what makes you look at me so strangely she said shrinking away from his intense gaze  never mind  you go  you will understand many things in time which seem strange to you now  at present if you will do what i ask you will oblige me greatly  will you go  yes i will go  theres a good lass  give us a kiss my girl  you have the right spirit in you  ill let you know when the train goes tomorrow and i will write to my father to expect you  now off with you or youll have them gossiping downstairs  good night  good night mister ezra said the girl with her hand upon the handle of the library door  youve made my heart glad this night  i live in hopeever in hope  i wonder what the deuce she hopes about the young merchant said to himself as she closed the door behind her  hopes ill marry her i suppose  she must be of a very sanguine disposition  a girl like that might be invaluable down at bedsworth  if we had no other need for her she would be an excellent spy  he lay  for some little time on the couch with bent brow and pursed lips musing over the possibilities of the future  while this dialogue had been going on in the library of eccleston square tom dimsdale was still wending his way homewards with a feeling of weight in his mind and a presentiment of misfortune which overshadowed his whole soul  in vain he assured himself that this disappearance of kates was but temporary and that the rumour of an engagement between her and ezra was too ridiculous to be believed for a moment  argue it as he would the same dread horrible feeling of impending trouble weighed upon him  impossible as it was to imagine that kate was false to him it was strange that on the very day that this rumour reached his ears she should disappear from london how bitterly he regretted now that he had allowed himself to be persuaded by john girdlestone into ceasing to communicate with her he began to realize that he had been duped and that all these specious promises as to a future consent to their union had been so many baits to amuse him while the valuable present was slipping away  what could he do now to repair the past  his only course was to wait for the morrow and see whether the senior partner would appear at the offices if he did so the young man was determined that he should have an understanding with him  so downcast was tom that on arriving at phillimore gardens he would have slipped off to his room at once had he not met his burly father upon the stairs  bed roared the old man upon hearing his sons proposition  nothing of the sort sir  come down into the parlour and smoke a pipe with me  your mother has been waiting for you all the evening  i am sorry to be late mother the lad said kissing the old lady i have been down at the docks all day and have been busy and worried  mrs dimsdale was sitting in her chair beside the fire knitting when her son came in  at the sound of his voice she glanced anxiously up at his face with all her motherly instincts on the alert  what is it my boy she said  you dont look yourself something has gone wrong with you  surely youre not keeping anything secret from your old mother  dont be so foolish as that my boy said the doctor earnestly if you have anything on your mind out with it  theres nothing so far wrong but that it cant be set right ill be bound  thus pressed their son told them all that had happened the rumour which he had heard from von baumser at the cock and cowslip and the subsequent visit to eccleston square  i can hardly realize it all yet he said in conclusion  my head seems to be in a whirl and i cant reason about it  the old couple listened very attentively to his narrative and were silent some little time after he had finished  his mother first broke the silence  i was always sure she said that we were wrong to stop our correspondence at the request of mr girdlestone  its easy enough to say that now said tom ruefully  at the time it seemed as if we had no alternative  theres no use crying over spilt milk remarked the old physician who had been very grave during his sons narrative  we must set to work and get things right again  there is one thing very certain tom and that is that kate harston is a girl who never did or could do a dishonourable thing  if she said that she would wait for you my boy you may feel perfectly safe and if you doubt her for one moment you ought to be deuced well ashamed of yourself  well said governor cried tom with beaming face  now that is exactly my own feeling but there is so much to be explained  why have they left london and where have they gone to  no doubt that old scoundrel girdlestone thought that your patience would soon come to an end so he got the start of you by carrying the girl off into the country  and if he has done this what can i do  nothing  it is entirely within his right to do it  and have her stowed away in some little cottage in the country with that brute ezra girdlestone hanging round her all the time  it is the thought of that that drives me wild  you trust in her my boy said the old doctor  well try our best in the meantime to find out where she has gone to  if she is unhappy or needs a friend you may be sure that she will write to your mother  yes there is always that hope exclaimed tom in a more cheerful voice  tomorrow i may learn something at the office  dont make the mistake of quarrelling with the girdlestones after all they are within their rights in doing what they appear to have done  they may be within their legal rights tom cried indignantly but the old man made a deliberate compact with me which he has broken  never mind  dont give them an advantage by losing your temper the doctor chatted away over the matter for some time and his words together with those of his mother cheered the young fellows heart nevertheless after they had retired to their rooms dr dimsdale continued to be very thoughtful and very grave  i dont like it he said more than once  i dont like the idea of the poor girl being left entirely in the hands of that pair of beauties  god grant that no harm come of it matilda a prayer which his good wife echoed with all the strength of her kindly nature    chapter xxxiii   the journey to the priory  it was already dusk when john girdlestone and his ward reached waterloo station  he gave orders to the guard that the luggage should be stamped but took care that she should not hear the name of their destination  hurrying her rapidly down the platform amid the confused heaps of luggage and currents of eager passengers he pushed her into a firstclass carriage and sprang after her just as the bell rang and the wheels began to revolve  they were alone  kate crouched up into the corner among the cushions and wrapped her rug round her for it was bitterly cold  the merchant pulled a notebook from his pocket and proceeded by the light of the lamp above him to add up columns of figures  he sat very upright in his seat and appeared to be as absorbed in his work as though he were among his papers in fenchurch street  he neither glanced at his companion nor made any inquiry as to her comfort  as she sat opposite to him she could not keep her eyes from his hard angular face every rugged feature of which was exaggerated by the flickering yellow light above him  those deepset eyes and sunken cheeks had been familiar to her for years  how was it that they now for the first time struck her as being terrible  was it that new expression which had appeared upon them that hard inexorable set about the mouth which gave a more sinister character to his whole face as she gazed at him an ineffable loathing and dread rose in her soul and she could have shrieked out of pure terror  she put her hand up to her throat with a gasp to keep down the sudden inclination to cry out as she did so her guardian glanced over the top of the notebook with his piercing light grey eyes  dont get hysterical he cried  you have given us trouble enough without that  oh why are you so harsh she cried throwing out her arms towards him in eloquent entreaty while the tears coursed down her cheeks what have i done that is so dreadful  i could not love your son and i do love another  i am so grieved to have offended you  you used to be kind and like a father to me  and a nice return you have made me  honour your father says the good old book  what honour did you give me save to disobey every command which i have ever given you  i have to blame myself to some extent for having allowed you to go on that most pernicious trip to scotland where you were thrown into the company of this young adventurer by his scheming old fool of a father  it would have been a study for a rembrandt to depict the craggy strongly lined face of the old merchant and the beautiful pleading one which looked across at him with the light throwing strange shadows over both  as he spoke she brushed the tears from her eyes and an angry flush sprang to her cheeks  you may say what you like of me she said bitterly  i suppose that is one of your privileges as my guardian  you have no right however to speak evil of my friends  he who calleth his brother a fool i think the good old book says something of that  girdlestone was staggered for a moment by this unexpected counter then he took off his broadbrimmed hat and bowed his head with drooping lids  out of the mouths of babes and of sucklings he cried  you are right  i spoke too warmly  it is my zeal for you which betrays me  the same zeal which made you tell me so many things which i now know to be untrue about mr dimsdale said  kate waxing more fearless as her mind turned to her wrongs  you are becoming impertinent he answered and resumed his calculations in his notebook  kate cowered back into her corner again while the train thundered and screeched and rattled through the darkness  looking through the steamy window nothing was to be seen save the twinkle here and there of the lights of the scattered country cottages  occasionally a red signal lamp would glare down upon her like the bloodshot eye of some demon who presided over this kingdom of iron and steam  far behind a lurid trail of smoke marked the way that they had come  to kates mind it was all as weird and gloomy and cheerless even as the thoughts within her  and they were gloomy enough  where was she going  how long was she going for  what was she to do when there  on all these points she was absolutely ignorant  what was the object of this sudden flight from london  her guardian could have separated her from the dimsdales in many less elaborate ways than this  could it be that he intended some system of pressure and terrorism by which she should be forced to accept ezra as a suitor  she clenched her little white teeth as she thought of it and registered a vow that nothing in this world would ever bring her to give in upon that point  there was only one bright spot in her outlook  when she reached her destination she would at once write to mrs dimsdale tell her where she was and ask her frankly for an explanation of their sudden silence  how much wiser if she had done so before  only a foolish pride had withheld her from it  the train had already stopped at one large junction  looking out through the window she saw by the lamps that it was guildford after another interminable interval of clattering and tossing and plunging through the darkness they came to a second station of importance petersfield  we are nearing our destination girdlestone remarked shutting up his book  this proved to be a small wayside station illuminated by a single lamp which gave no information as to the name  they were the only passengers who alighted and the train rolled on for portsmouth leaving them with their trunks upon the dark and narrow platform  it was a black night with a bitter wind which carried with it a suspicion of dampness which might have been rain or might have been the drift of the neighbouring ocean  kate was numb with the cold and even her gaunt companion stamped his feet and shivered as he looked about him  i telegraphed for a trap said he to the guard  is there not one waiting  yes sir if you be mister girdlestone theres a trap from the flyin bull  here carker heres your gentleman  at this summons a roughlooking ostler emerged into the circle of light thrown by the single lamp and touching his hat announced in a surly voice that he was the individual in question  the guard and he then proceeded to drag the trunks to the vehicle  it was a small wagonette with a high seat for the driver in front  where to sir asked the driver when the travellers had taken their seats  to hampton priory  do you know where that is  bettern two mile from here and close to the railway line said the man  there haint been no one livin there for two year at the least  we are expected and all will be ready for us said girdlestone go as fast as you can for we are cold  the driver cracked his whip and the horse started at a brisk trot down the dark country road  looking round her kate saw that they were passing through a large country village consisting of a broad main street with a few insignificant offshoots branching away on either side  a church stood on one side and on the other the village inn  the door was open and the light shining through the red curtains of the bar parlour looked warm and cosy  the clink of glasses and the murmur of cheerful voices sounded from within  kate as she looked across felt doubly cheerless and lonely by the contrast  girdlestone looked too but with different emotions  another plague spot he cried jerking his head in that direction in town or country it is the same  these poisonsellers are scattered over the whole face of  the land and every one of them is a focus of disease and misery  beg your pardon sir the surly driver observed screwing round in his seat  that eres the flyin bull sir where i be in sarvice and it aint no poisonseller but a real right down good house  all liquor is poison and every house devoted to the sale of it is a sinful house girdlestone said curtly  dont you say that to my maister remarked the driver  he be a big man wi a terbly bad temper and a hand like a leg o mutton  hold up will ye  the last remark was addressed to the horse which had stumbled in going down a sharp incline  they were out of the village by this time and the road was lined on either side by high hedges which threw a dense shadow over everything  the feeble lamps of the wagonette bored two little yellow tunnels of light on either side  the man let the reins lie loose upon the horses back and the animal picked out the roadway for itself  as they swung round from the narrow lane on to a broader road kate broke out into a little cry of pleasure  theres the sea she exclaimed joyfully  the moon had broken from behind the clouds and glittered on the vast silvery expanse  yes thats the sea the driver said and them lights down yonder is at lea claxton where the fisherfolk live and over there pointing with his whip to a long dark shadow on the waters is the oilywoite  the what  the isle of wight he means said girdlestone  the driver looked at him reproachfully  of course said he if you lunnon folks knows more about it than we who are born an bred in the place its no manner o use our tryin to teach you  with this sarcastic comment he withdrew into himself and refused to utter another word until the end of their journey  it was not long before this was attained  passing down a deeply rutted lane they came to a high stone wall which extended for a couple of hundred yards  it had a crumbling decaying appearance as far as could be judged in the uncertain light  this wall was broken by a single iron gate flanked by two high pillars each of which was surmounted by some weatherbeaten heraldic device  passing through they turned up a winding avenue with lines of trees on either side which shot their branches so thickly above them that they might have been driving through some sombre tunnel  this avenue terminated in an open space in the midst of which towered a great irregular whitewashed building which was the old priory  all below it was swathed in darkness but the upper windows caught the glint of the moon and emitted a pallid and sickly glimmer  the whole effect was so weird and gloomy that kate felt her heart sink within her  the wagonette pulled up in front of the door and girdlestone assisted her to alight  there had been no lights or any symptoms of welcome but as they pulled down the trunks the door opened and a little old woman appeared with a candle in her hand which she carefully shaded from the wind while she peered out into the darkness  is that mr girdlestone she cried  of course it is the merchant said impatiently  did i not telegraph and tell you that i was coming  yes yes she answered hobbling forward with the light  and this is the young lady  come in my dear come in  we have not got things very smart yet but they will soon come right  she led the way through a lofty hall into a large sittingroom which no doubt had been the monkish refectory in bygone days  it looked very bleak and cold now although a small fire sputtered and sparkled in the corner of the great iron grate  there was a pan upon the fire and the deal table in the centre of the room was laid out roughly as for a meal the candle which the old woman had carried in was the only light though the flickering fire cast strange fantastic shadows in the further corners and among the great oaken rafters which formed the ceiling  come up to the fire my dear said the old woman  take off your cloak and warm yourself  she held her own shrivelled arms towards the blaze as though her short exposure to the night air had chilled her glancing at her kate saw that her face was sharpfeatured and cunning with a loose lower lip which exposed a line of yellow teeth and a chin which bristled with a tuft of long grey hairs  from without there came the crunching of gravel as the wagonette turned and rattled down the avenue  kate listened to the sound of the wheels until they died away in the distance  they seemed somehow to be the last link which bound her to the human race  her heart failed her completely and she burst into tears  whats the matter then the old woman asked looking up at her what are ye crying about  oh i am so miserable and so lonely she cried  what have i done that i should be so unhappy  why should i be taken to this horrible horrible place  whats the matter with the place asked her withered companion i dont see nought amiss with it  heres mr girdlestone acomin he dont grumble at the place ill warrnt  the merchant was not in the best of tempers for he had had an altercation with the driver about the fare and was cold into the bargain  at it again he said roughly as he entered  it is i who ought to weep i think who have been put to all this trouble and inconvenience by your disobedience and weakness of mind  kate did not answer but sat upon a coarse deal chair beside the fire and buried her face in her hands  all manner of vague fears and fancies filled her mind  what was tom doing now  how quickly he would fly to her rescue did he but know how strangely she was situated she determined that her very first action next morning should be to write to mrs dimsdale and to tell her not only where she was but all that had occurred  the reflection that she could do this cheered her heart and she managed to eat a little of the supper which the old woman had now placed upon the table  it was a rough stew of some sort but the long journey had given an edge to their appetites and the merchant though usually epicurean in his tastes ate a hearty meal  when supper was over the crone who was addressed by girdlestone as jorrocks led the way upstairs and showed kate to her room  if the furniture of the diningroom had been spartan in its simplicity this was even more so for there was nothing in it save a small iron bedstead much rusted from want of use and a high wooden box on which stood the simplest toilet requisites  in spite of the poverty of the apartment kate had never been more glad to enter her luxurious chamber at home  the little carpetless room was a haven of rest where she would be left for one night at least to her own thoughts  as she lay in bed however she could hear far away the subdued murmur of girdlestones voice and the shrill tones of the old woman  they were in deep and animated converse  though they were too far distant for her to distinguish a word something told her that their talk was about herself and the same instinct assured her that it boded her little good    chapter xxxiv   the man with the campstool  when she awoke in the morning it was some little time before she could realize where she was or recall the events which had made such a sudden change in her life  the bare cold room with the whitewashed walls and the narrow bed upon which she lay brought back to her the recollection of a hospital ward which she had seen in edinburgh and her first thought was that she had had some accident and had been conveyed to some such establishment  the delusion was only momentary however for her true situation came back to her at once with all its vague horror  of the two she would have preferred that her first impression had been correct  the small window of her apartment was covered by a dirty muslin blind she rose and drawing it aside looked eagerly out  from what she had seen the night before she had hoped that this prison to which she had been conveyed might make amends for its loneliness by some degree of natural beauty  the scene which now met her eyes soon dispelled any expectations of the sort  the avenue with its trees lay on the other side of the house  from her window nothing was visible but a dreary expanse of bogland and mudbanks stretching down to the sea  at high tide this enormous waste of dreariness and filth was covered by the water but at present it lay before her in all its naked hideousness the very type of dullness and desolation  here and there a few scattered reeds or an unhealthy greenish scum upon the mud gave a touch of colour to the scene but for the most part the great plain was all of the same sombre mud tint with its monotony broken only by the white flecks where the swarms of gulls and kittiwakes had settled in the hope of picking up whatever had been left by the receding tide away across the broad surface a line of sparkling foam marked the fringe of the ocean which stretched away to the horizon  a mile or two to the eastward of her kate saw some sign of houses and a blue smoke which flickered up into the air  this she guessed to be the fishing village of lea claxton which the driver had mentioned the night before  she felt as she gazed at the little hamlet and the masts of the boats in front of it that she was not alone in the world and that even in this strange and desolate place there were honest hearts to whom as a last resource she could appeal  she was still standing at the window when there came a knocking at the door and she heard the voice of the old woman asking if she were awake breakfast is ready she said and the master is awondering why you beant down  on this summons kate hastened her toilet and made her way down the old winding stair to the room in which they had supped the night before surely girdlestone must have had a heart of flint not to be melted by the sight of that fair fresh face  his features set as hard as adamant as she entered the room and he looked at her with eyes which were puckered and angry  you are late he said coldly  you must remember that you are not in eccleston square  an idle soul shall suffer hunger says the prophet you are here to be disciplined and disciplined you shall be  i am sorry she answered  i think that i must have been tired by our journey  the vast room looked even more comfortless and bleak than on the preceding evening  on the table was a plate of ham and eggs john girdlestone served out a portion and pushed it in her direction she sat down on one of the rough wooden chairs and ate listlessly wondering how all this was going to end  after breakfast girdlestone ordered the old woman out of the room and standing in front of the fire with his long legs apart and his hands behind his back he told her in harsh concise language what his intentions were  i had long determined he said that if you ran counter to my wishes and persisted in your infatuated affection for that scapegrace i should remove you to some secluded spot where you might reconsider your conduct and form better resolutions for the future  this country house answered the purpose admirably and as an old servant of mine mrs jorrocks chanced to reside in the neighbourhood i have warned her that at any time i might come down and should expect to find things ready your rash and heartless conduct has however precipitated matters and we have arrived before her preparations were complete  our future arrangements will therefore be less primitive than they are at present here you shall remain young lady until you show signs of repentance and of a willingness to undo the harm which you have done  if you mean until i consent to marry your son then i shall live and die here the girl said bravely  that rests with yourself  as i said before you are under discipline here and you may not find existence such a bed of roses as it was in eccleston square  can i have my maid kate asked  i can hardly stay here with no one but the old woman in the house  rebecca is coming down  i had a telegram from ezra to that effect and he will himself join us for a day or two in each week  ezra here kate cried in horror  her chief consolation through all her troubles had been that there seemed to be some chance of getting rid of her terrible suitor  and why not the old man asked angrily  are you so bitter against the lad as to grudge him the society of his own father  kate was saved from further reproaches by the entrance of the old woman to clear the table  the last item of intelligence however had given her a terrible shock and at the same time had filled her with astonishment  what could the fastliving comfortseeking man about town want in this dreary abode  she knew ezra well and was sure that he was not a man to alter his ways of life or suffer discomfort of any kind without some very definite object  it seemed to her that this was a new mesh in the net which was being drawn round her  when her guardian had left the room kate asked mrs jorrocks for a sheet of paper  the crone shook her head and wagged her pendulous lip in derision  mister girdlestone thought as you would be after that she said there aint no paper here nor pens neither nor ink neither  what none dear mrs jorrocks do have pity on me and get me a sheet however old and soiled  see here is some silver  you are very welcome to it if you will give me the materials for writing one letter  mrs jorrocks looked longingly with her bleared eyes at the few shillings which the girl held out to her but she shook her head i dursnt do it she said  its as much as my place is worth  then i shall walk down to bedsworth myself said kate angrily i have no doubt that the people in the post office will let me sit there and write it  the old hag laughed hoarsely to herself until the scraggy sinews of her withered neck stood out like whipcord  she was still chuckling and coughing when the merchant came back into the room  what then he asked sternly looking from one to the other  he was himself constitutionally averse to merriment and he was irritated by it in others  why are you laughing mrs jorrocks  i was alaughing at her the woman wheezed pointing with tremulous fingers  she was askin me for paper and sayin as she would go and write a letter at the bedsworth post office  you must understand once for all girdlestone roared turning savagely upon the girl that you are cut off entirely from the outer world i shall give you no loophole which you may utilize to continue your intimacy with undesirable people  i have given orders that you should not be provided with either paper or ink  poor kates last hope seemed to be fading away  her heart sank within her but she kept a brave face for she did not wish him to see how his words had stricken her  she had a desperate plan in her head which would be more likely to be successful could she but put him off his guard  she spent the morning in her own little room  she had been provided with a ponderous brown bible out of which the fly leaves had been carefully cut and this she read though her thoughts often wandered away from the sacred pages  about one oclock she heard the clatter of hoofs and the sound of wheels on the drive  going down she found that it was a cart which had come from bedsworth with furniture  there were carpets a chest of drawers tables and several other articles which the driver proceeded to carry upstairs helped by john girdlestone  the old woman was in the upper room  it seemed to kate that she might never again have such an opportunity of carrying out the resolve which she had formed  she put on her bonnet and began to stroll listlessly about in front of the door picking a few straggling leaves from the neglected lawn  gradually she sauntered away in this manner to the head of the avenue and then taking one swift timid glance around she slipped in among the trees and made the best of her way half walking half running down the dark winding drive  oh the joy of the moment when the great white house which had already become so hateful to her was obscured among the trees behind her she had some idea of the road which she had traversed the night before behind her were all her troubles  in front the avenue gate bedsworth and freedom  she would send both a telegram and a letter to dr dimsdale and explain to him her exact situation  if the kindhearted and energetic physician once knew of it he would take care that no harm befell her  she could return then and face with a light heart the worst which her guardian could do to her  here was the avenue entrance now the high licheneaten stone pillars with the battered device upon the top  the iron gate between was open  with a glad cry she quickened her pace and in another moment would have been in the highroad when  now then where are you acomin to cried a gruff voice from among the bushes which flanked the gate  the girl stopped all in a tremble  in the shadow of the trees there was a campstool and on the campstool sat a savagelooking man dressed in a dark corduroy suit with a blackened clay pipe stuck in the corner of his mouth  his weatherbeaten mahogany face was plentifully covered with smallpox marks and one of his eyes was sightless and white from the effects of the same disease  he rose now and interposed himself between her and the gate  sink me if it aint her he said slowly surveying her from head to foot  i were given to understand that she was a spanker an a spanker she be  with this oracular remark he took a step back and surveyed kate again with his one eye  my good man she said in a trembling voice for his appearance was far from reassuring i wish to go past and to get to bedsworth here is a shilling and i beg that you will not detain me  her companion stretched out a very dirty hand took the coin spun it up in the air caught it bit it and finally plunged it into the depths of his trouser pockets  no road this way missy he said ive given my word to the guvnor and i cant go back from it  you have no right to detain me kate cried angrily  i have good friends in london who will make you suffer for this  shes agoin to flare up said the oneeyed man  knock me helpless if she aint  i shall come through the girl cried in desperation  she was only a dozen yards from the lane which led to freedom so she made a quick little feminine rush in the hope of avoiding this dreadful sentinel who barred her passage  he caught her round the waist however and hurled her back with such violence that she staggered across the path and would have fallen had she not struck violently against a tree  as it was she was badly bruised and the breath shaken out of her body  she has flared up said the oneeyed man removing his pipe from his lips  blow me asunder if she beant a rustler  he brought his campstool from the side of the pillar and planting it right in the centre of the gateway sat down upon it again  you see missy he remarked its no manner o use  if you did get out it would only be to be put in a reglar sylum  an asylum gasped kate sobbing with pain and anger  do you think i am mad then  i dont think nowt about it the man remarked calmly  i knows it  this was a new light to kate  she was so bewildered that she could hardly realize the significance of the remark  who are you she said  why is it that you treat me in this cruel way  ah now we come to business he said in a satisfied way crossing his legs and blowing great wreaths from his pipe  this is more like reason  who am i says you  well my names stevensbill stevens hesquire o claxton in the county o hants  ive been an ab in the navy and ive got my pension to show it  ive been in the looncy business toowas second warder in the suicide ward at portsmouth for moren two year  ive been out of a billet for some time and muster girdlestone he came to me and he says youre william stevens hesquire says he  i am says i  youve had experience o loonies says he  i have says i  then youre the man i want says he  you shall have a pound a week an nothing to do  the very crib

an comfortble  so you see missy it aint no use at all and youll never get out this way  but if you let me past he will think that i ran by so quickly that you could not stop me  he could not be very angry then and i shall give you more money than you would lose  no no said the man shaking his head energetically im true to my colours sink me but i am  i never was bribed yet and never will be unless you can offer cash down instead o promises  you cant lay them by to live on in your old age  alas kate cried i have no money except these few shillings  give them over here then  he put them in his trouser pocket beside the other one  thats all right missy he said in a beery whisper i wont say anything now to muster girdlestone about this job hed be wild if he knew but mums the word with william stevens hesquire  lor if this aint my wife acomin out wi my dinner away with ye away  if she seed me aspeakin to you shed tear your hair for you as like as not  shes jealous thats whats the matter wi her  if she sees a woman makin much o me its just pisen to her and she goes for em straight  shes the one to make the fur fly away with you i say  poor kate appalled by the possibility of making a new enemy turned and retraced her steps slowly and sadly up the avenue  as she glanced back she saw a gaunt hardfeatured woman trudging up the lane with a tin can in her hand  lonely and forlorn but not yet quite destitute of hope she turned to the right among the trees and pushed her way through bushes and brambles to the boundary of the priory grounds  it was a lofty wall at least nine feet in height with a coping which bristled with jagged pieces of glass  kate walked along the base of it her fair skin all torn and bleeding with scratches from the briars until she satisfied herself that there was no break in it  there was one small wooden door on the side which was skirted by the railway line but it was locked and impassable  the only opening through which a human being could pass was that which was guarded in the manner she had seen  the sickening conviction took possession of her mind that without wings it was an utter impossibility either to get away or to give the least information to any one in the world as to where she was or what might befall her  when she came back to the house tired and dishevelled after her journey of exploration girdlestone was standing by the door to receive her with a sardonic smile upon his thin lips  how do you like the grounds then he asked with the nearest approach to hilarity which she had ever heard from him  and the ornamental fencing and the lodgekeeper how did you like them all  kate tried for a moment to make some brave retort but it was a useless attempt  her lips trembled her eyes filled and with a cry of grief and despair which might have moved a wild beast she fled to her room and throwing herself upon her bed burst into such scalding bitter tears as few women are ever called upon to shed    chapter xxxv   a talk on the lawn  that same evening rebecca came down from london  her presence was a comfort to kate for though she had never liked or trusted the girl yet the mere fact of having some one of her own age near her gave her a sense of security and of companionship  her room too had been altered for the better and the maid was given the one next door so that by knocking on the wall she could always communicate with her  this was an unspeakable consolation for at night the old house was so full of the sudden crackings of warped timber and the scampering of rats that entire loneliness was unendurable  apart from these uncanny sounds there were other circumstances which gave the priory a sinister reputation  the very aspect of the building was enough to suggest weird impressions  its high white walls were blotched with patches of mildew and in some parts there were long greenish stains from roof to ground like tear streaks on the crumbling plaster  indoors there was a dank graveyard smell in the low corridors and narrow staircases  floors and ceilings were equally wormeaten and rotten  broad flakes of plaster from the walls lay littered about in the passages  the wind too penetrated the building through many cracks and crannies so that there was a constant sighing and soughing in the big dreary rooms which had a most eerie and melancholy effect  kate soon learned however that besides these vague terrors all predisposing the mind to alarm and exciting the imagination there was a general belief that another more definite cause for fear existed in the old monastery  with cruel minuteness of detail her guardian had told her the legend which haunted those gloomy corridors  it appears that in olden times the priory had been inhabited by dominicans and that in the course of years these monks had fallen away from their original state of sanctity  they preserved a name for piety among the country folk by their austere demeanour but in secret within the walls of their own monastery they practised every sort of dissipation and crime  while the community was in this state of demoralization each from the abbot downwards vying with the other in the number and enormity of their sins there came a piousminded youth from a neighbouring village who begged that he might be permitted to join the order  he had been attracted he said by the fame of their sanctity  he was received amongst them and at first was not admitted to their revels but gradually as his conscience was supposed to become more hardened he was duly initiated into all their mysteries  horrified by what he saw the good youth concealed his indignation until he had mastered all the abominations of the establishment and then rising up on the altar steps he denounced them in fiery scathing words  he would leave them that night he said and he would tell his experiences through the length and breadth of the country  incensed and alarmed the friars held a hasty meeting and then seizing the young novice they dragged him down the cellar steps and locked him up there  this same cellar had long been celebrated for the size and ferocity of the rats which inhabited it which were so fierce and strong that even during the day they had been known to attack those who entered  it is said that long into the weary hours of the night the fearful shrieks and terrible struggles of the captive as he fought with his innumerable assailants resounded through the long corridors  they do say that he walks about the house at times girdlestone said in conclusion  no one has ever been found who would live here very long since then  but of course such a strongminded young woman as you who cannot even obey your own guardian would never be frightened by such a childish idea as that  i do not believe in ghosts and i dont think i shall be frightened kate answered but for all that the horrible story stuck in her mind and added another to the many terrors which surrounded her  mr girdlestones room was immediately above hers  on the second day of her imprisonment she went up on to this landing for having nothing to read save the bible and no materials for writing she had little to do but to wander over the old house and through the grounds  the door of girdlestones room was ajar and she could not help observing as she passed that the apartment was most elegantly and comfortably furnished so was the next room the door of which was also open  the solid furniture and rich carpet contrasted strangely with her own bare whitewashed chamber  all this pointed to the fact that her removal to the priory had not been a sudden impulse on the part of the old merchant but that he had planned and arranged every detail beforehand her refusal of ezra was only the excuse for setting the machinery in motion  what was the object then and what was to be the end of this subtle scheming  that  was the question which occurred to her every hour of the day and every hour the answer seemed more grim and menacing  there was one link in the chain which was ever hidden from her  it had never occurred to the girl that her fortune could be of moment to the firm  she had been so accustomed to hear ezra and his father talk glibly of millions that she depreciated her own little capital and failed to realize how important it might be in a commercial crisis indeed the possibility of such a crisis never entered her head for one of her earliest impressions was hearing her father talk of the great resources of the firm and of its stability  that this firm was now in the direst straits and that her money was absolutely essential to its existence were things which never for one instant entered her thoughts  yet that necessity was becoming more pressing every day  ezra in london was doing all that indomitable energy and extraordinary business capacity could do to prolong the struggle  as debts became due he would still stave off each creditor with such skill and plausibility as allayed every suspicion  day by day however the work became more severe and he felt that he was propping up an edifice which was so rotten that it must sooner or later come crumbling about his ears when he came down to the priory upon the saturday the young mans haggard and anxious face showed the severe ordeal which he had undergone  kate had already retired to her room when he arrived  she heard the sound of the trap however and guessed who it was even before his deep bass voice sounded in the room beneath  looking out of her window a little later she saw him walking to and fro in the moonlight talking earnestly to his father  it was a bitter night and she wondered what they could have to talk about which might not be said beside the warm fire in the diningroom  they flickered up and down among the shadows for more than an hour and then the girl heard the door slam and shortly afterwards the heavy tread of the two men passed her chamber and ascended to the rooms above  it was a momentous conversation which she had witnessed  in it ezra had shown his father how impossible it was to keep up appearances and how infallible was their ruin unless help came speedily  i dont think any of them smell a rat he said  mortimer and johnson pressed for their bill in rather an ugly manner but i talked them over completely  i took out my chequebook  look here gentlemen said i if you wish i shall write a cheque for the amount  if i do it will be the last piece of business which we shall do together  a great house like ours cant afford to be disturbed in the routine of their business  they curled up at once and said no more about it  it was an anxious moment though for if they had taken my offer the whole murder would have been out  the old man started at the word his son had used and rubbed his hands together as though a sudden chill had struck through him  dont you think ezra he said clutching his sons arm that is a very foolish saying about murder will out  i remember pilkington the detective who was a member of our church when i used to worship at durham street speaking on this subject  he said that it was his opinion that people are being continually made away with and that not more than one in ten are ever accounted for  nine chances to one ezra and then those which are found out are very vulgar affairs  if a man of intellect gave his mind to it there would be little chance of detection  how very cold the night is  yes returned his son  it is best to talk of such things in the open air though  how has all gone since you have been down here  very well  she was restive the first day and wanted to get to bedsworth  i think that she has given it up now as a bad job stevens the gatekeeper is a very worthy fellow  what steps have you taken asked ezra striking a fusee and lighting a cigar  i have taken care that they should know that she is an invalid both at bedsworth and at claxton  they have all heard of the poor sick young lady at the priory  i have let them know also that her mind is a little strange which accounts of course for her being kept in solitude when it happens  for gods sake be quiet the young man cried with a shudder its an awful job it wont bear thinking of  yes it is a sad business but what else is there  and how would you do it ezra asked in a hoarse whisper no violence i hope  it may come to that  i have other plans in my head however which may be tried first  i think that i see one way out of it which would simplify matters  if there is no alternative i have a man who is ripe for any job of the sort  ah who is that  a fellow who can hit a good downright blow as i can testify to my cost  his name is burt  he is the man who cut my head open in africa i met him in london the other day and spotted him at once  he is a halfstarved poor devil and as desperate as a man could be  he is just in the key for any business of the sort  ive got the whiphand of him now and he knows it so that i could put him up to anything i believe that such a job would be a positive pleasure to him for the fellow is more like a wild beast than a man  sad sad girdlestone exclaimed  if a man once falls away what is there to separate him from the beasts  how can i find this man  wire to me  put send a doctor that will do as well as anything else and will sound well at the postoffice  ill see that he comes down by the next train  youd best meet him at the station for the chances are that he will be drunk  bring him down said girdlestone  you must be here yourself  surely you can do without me  no no  we must stand or fall together  ive a good mind to throw the thing over said ezra stopping in his walk  it sickens me  what go back now the old man cried vehemently  no no that would be too craven  we have everything in our favour and all that we want is a stout heart  oh my boy my boy on the one side of you are ruin dishonour a sordid existence and the scorn of your old companions on the other are success and riches and fame and all that can make life pleasant  you know as well as i do that the girls money would turn the scale and that all would then be well  your whole future depends upon her death  we have given her every chance  she laughed at your love it is time now to show her your hate  that is true enough ezra said walking on  there is no reason why i should pity her  ive put my hand to the plough and i shall go on i seem to be getting into your infernal knack of scripture quoting  there is a brave good lad cried his father  it would not do to draw back now  you will find rebecca useful the young man said you may trust her entirely  you did well to send her  have they asked for me much  yes  i have told them all the same storynervous exhaustion and doctors orders that you were not to be disturbed by any business letters  the only man who seemed to smell a rat was that young dimsdale  ah cried the old man with a chuckle of course he would be surprised at our disappearance  he looks like a madman asked me where you had gone and when i answered him as i had the others stormed out that he had a right to know and that he would know  his blood was up and there was nearly being a pretty scene before the clerks  he follows me home every evening to eccleston square and waits outside half the night through to see that i do not leave the house  does he though  yes he came after me to the station today  he had a cravat round his mouth and an ulster but i could see that it was he  i took a ticket for colchester  he took one also and made for the colchester train i gave him the slip got the right ticket and came on  ive no doubt he is at colchester at this moment  remember my boy the merchant said as they turned from the door this is the last of our trials  if we succeed in this all is well for the future  we have tried diamonds and we have tried marriage  the third time is the charm said ezra as he threw away his cigar and followed his father    chapter xxxvi   the incident of the corridor  ezra girdlestone hardly went through the formality of greeting kate next morning when she came down to breakfast  he was evidently ill at ease and turned away his eyes when she looked at him though he glanced at her furtively from time to time  his father chatted with him upon city matters but the young mans answers were brusque and monosyllabic his sleep had been troubled and broken for the conversation of the night before had obtruded unpleasantly on his dreams  kate slipped away from them as soon as she could and putting on her bonnet went for a long walk through the grounds partly for the sake of exercise and partly in the hope of finding some egress  the oneeyed gatekeeper was at his post and set up a hideous shout of laughter when he saw her so she branched off among the trees to avoid him and walked once more very carefully round the boundary wall  it was no easy matter to follow it continuously for the briars and brambles grew in a confused tangle up to its very base  by perseverance however she succeeded in tracing every foot of it and so satisfying herself finally that there was no diminution anywhere in its height no break in its continuity save the one small wooden door which was securely fastened  there was one spot however where a gleam of hope presented itself at an angle of the wall there stood a deserted wooden shed which had been used for the protection of gardeners tools in the days when the grounds had been kept in better order  it was not buttressed up against the wall but stood some eight or ten feet from it  beside the shed was an empty barrel which had once been a waterbutt  the girl managed to climb to the top of the barrel and from this she was easily able to gain the sloping roof of the shed  up this she clambered until she stood upon the summit a considerable height above the ground  from it she was able to look down over the wall on to the countryroad and the railway line which lay on the other side of it  true that an impassable chasm lay between her and the wall but it would be surely possible for her to hail passersby from here and to persuade some of them to carry a letter to bedsworth or to bring paper from there  fresh hope gushed into her heart at the thought  it was not a very secure footing for the planks of which the shed was composed were wormeaten and rotten  they cracked and crumbled beneath her feet but what would she not dare to see a friendly human face as she stood there a couple of country louts young lads about sixteen came strolling down the road the one whistling and the other munching at a raw turnip  they lounged along until they came opposite to kates point of observation when one of them looking up saw her pale face surmounting the wall  hey bill he cried to his companion blowed if the mad wench beant up on the shed over yander  so she be said the other eagerly  give me your turnip  jimmy an ill shy it at her  noa ill shy it mysel said the gallant jimmy and at the word whizz came the half of a turnip within art inch of kates ear  youve missed her shrieked the other savage  ere quick where be a stone  but before he could find one the poor girl sick at heart clambered down from her exposed situation  there is no hope for me anywhere she sobbed to herself  every mans hand is against me  i have only one true friend and he is far away she went back to her room utterly disheartened and dispirited  her guardian knocked at her door before dinner time  i trust he said that you have read over the service  it is as well to do so when you cannot go to church  and why should you prevent me from going to church she asked  ah my lady he said with a sneer you are reaping what you have sown  you are tasting now the bitter fruits of your disobedience repent before it is too late  i have done no wrong she said turning on him with flashing eyes it is for you to repent you violent and hypocritical man  it is for you to answer for your godly words and your ungodly and wicked actions there is a power which will judge between us some day and will exact atonement for your broken oath to your dead friend and for your cruel treatment of one who was left to your care  she spoke with burning cheeks and with such fearless energy that the hard city man fairly cowered away from her  we will leave that to the future he said  i came up to do you a kindness and you abuse me  i hear that there are insects about the house beetles and the like  a few drops from this bottle scattered about the room would keep them away  take care for it is a violent though painless poison if taken by a human being  he handed her a phial with a brownish turbid liquid in it and a large red poison label which she took without comment and placed upon the mantelpiece girdlestone gave a quick keen glance at her as he retired  in truth he was astonished at the alteration which the last few days had made in her appearance  her cheeks were colourless and sunken save for the single hectic spot which announced the fever within  her eyes were unnaturally bright  a strange and new expression had settled upon her whole countenance  it seemed to girdlestone that there was every chance that his story might become a reality and her reason be permanently deranged  she had however more vitality than her guardian gave her credit for  indeed at the very time when he set her down in his mind as a broken woman she had formed a fresh plan for escape which it would require both energy and determination to put into execution  during the last few days she had endeavoured to make friends with the maid rebecca but the invincible aversion which the latter had entertained for her ever since ezra had visited her with his unwelcome attentions was not to be overcome by any advances which she could make she performed her offices with a heart full of malice and an eye which triumphed in her mistresss misfortunes  kate had bethought herself that stevens the gatekeeper only mounted guard during the day  she had observed too at the time of her conversation with him that the iron gate was in such a state of disrepair that even if it were locked it would not be a difficult matter to scramble through or over it  if she could only gain the open air during the night there would be nothing to prevent her from making her way to bedsworth whence she could travel on to portsmouth which was only seven miles away  surely there she would find some charitable people who would communicate with her friends and give her a temporary shelter  the front door of the house was locked every night but there was a nail behind it on which she hoped to find the key  there was another door at the back  then there were the windows of the groundfloor which might be tried in case the doors were too securely fastened  if only she could avoid waking any one there was no reason why she should not succeed  if the worst came to the worst and she was detected they could not treat her more cruelly than they had already done  ezra had gone back to london so that she had only three enemies to contend against girdlestone rebecca and old mrs jorrocks  of these girdlestone slept upon the floor above and mrs jorrocks who might have been the most dangerous of all as her room was on the groundfloor was fortunately so deaf that there was little risk of disturbing her  the problem resolved itself therefore into being able to pass rebeccas room without arousing her and as she knew the maid to be a sound sleeper there seemed to be every chance of success  she sat at her window all that afternoon steeling her mind to the ordeal before her  she was weak poor girl and shaken little fit for anything which required courage and resolution  her mind ran much upon her father and upon the mother whom she had never known but whose miniature was among her most precious treasures  the thought of them helped to dispel the dreadful feeling of utter loneliness which was the most unendurable of all her troubles  it was a cold bright day and the tide was in covering the mudbanks and lapping up against the walls of the priory grounds  so clear was it that she could distinguish the houses at the east end of the isle of wight  when she opened her window and looked out she could perceive that the sea upon her right formed a great inlet dreary and dry at low tide but looking now like a broad reedgirt lake  this was langston harbour and far away at its mouth she could make out a clump of buildings which marked the wateringplace of hayling  there were other signs however of the presence of man  from her window she could see the great menofwar  steaming up the channel to and from the anchorage at spithead  some were low in the water and venomous looking with bulbous turrets and tiny masts  others were long and stately with great lowering hulks and broad expanse of canvas occasionally a foreign service gunboat would pass white and ghostly like some tired seabird flapping its way home  it was one of kates few amusements to watch the passing and repassing of the vessels and to speculate upon whence they had come and whither they were bound  on that eventful evening rebecca went to bed rather earlier than usual kate retired to her room and having made her final preparations and stuffed her few articles of jewelry into her pockets to serve in place of money she lay down upon her bed and trembled at the thought of what was in front of her  down below she could hear her guardians shuffling step as he moved about the refectory  then came the creaking of the rusty lock as he secured the door and shortly afterwards he passed upstairs to his room  mrs jorrocks had also gone to bed and all was quiet in the house  kate knew that some hours must elapse before she could venture to make the attempt  she remembered to have read in some book that the sleep of a human being was usually deepest about two in the morning so she had chosen that hour for her enterprise  she had put on her strongest dress and her thickest shoes but had muffled the latter in cloth so that they should make no sound  no precaution which she could think of had been neglected  there was now nothing to be done but to spend the time as best she might until the hour of action should arrive  she rose and looked out of the window again  the tide was out now and the moon glittered upon the distant ocean  a mist was creeping up however and even as she looked it drew its veil over the water it was bitterly cold  she shivered and her teeth began to chatter stretching herself upon the bed once more she wrapped the blankets round her and worn out with anxiety and fatigue dropped into a troubled sleep  she slumbered some hours before she awoke  looking at her watch she found that it was after two  she must not delay any longer  with the little bundle of her more valuable possessions in her hand she gave such a gasp as a diver gives before he makes his spring and slipping past rebeccas halfopened door she felt her way down the wooden stair picking her steps very carefully  even in the daytime she had often noticed how those old planks creaked and cracked beneath her weight  now in the dead silence of the night they emitted such sounds that her heart sank within her  she stopped several times convinced that she must be discovered but all was hushed and still  it was a relief when at last she reached the groundfloor and was able to feel her way along the passage to the door  shaking in every limb from cold and fear she put her hand to the lock the key was not there  she tried the nail there was nothing there her wary gaoler had evidently carried it away with him to his room would it occur to him to do the same in the case of the back door it was very possible that he might have overlooked it  she retraced her steps down the passage passed mrs jorrocks room where the old woman was snoring peacefully and began to make her way as best she could through the great rambling building  running along the basement floor from front to back there was a long corridor one side of which was pierced for windows  at the end of this corridor was the door which she wished to reach  the moon had broken through the fog and pouring its light through each opening cast a succession of silvery flickering spots upon the floor  between each of these bars of uncertain light was an interval of darkness  kate stood at the head of this corridor with her hand against the wall awed by the sudden sight of the moonlight and by the weird effect which was produced by the alternate patches of shadow and brightness  as she stood there suddenly with eyes distended with horror she became aware that something was approaching her down the corridor  she saw it moving as a dark formless mass at the further end  it passed through the bar of light vanished appeared once more lost itself in the darkness emerged again  it was halfway down the passage and still coming on  petrified with terror she could only wait and watch nearer it came and nearer  it was gliding into the last bar of light immediately in front of her  it was on her  god of mercy it was a dominican friar  the moon shone clear and cold upon his gaunt figure and his sombre robes  the poor girl threw up her hands gave one terrible scream of horror which rang through the old house and sank senseless to the ground    chapter xxxvii   a chase and a brawl  it would be impossible to describe the suspense in which tom dimsdale lived during these weeks  in vain he tried in every manner to find some way of tracing the fugitives  he wandered aimlessly about london from one inquiry office to another telling his story and appealing for assistance  he advertised in papers and crossquestioned every one who might know anything of the matter  there were none however who could help him or throw any light upon the mystery  no one at the office knew anything of the movements of the senior partner  to all inquiries ezra replied that he had been ordered by the doctors to seek complete repose in the country  dimsdale dogged ezras footsteps night after night in the hope of gaining some clue but in vain  on the saturday he followed him to the railway station but ezra as we have seen succeeded in giving him the slip  his father became seriously anxious about the young fellows health he ate nothing and his sleep was much broken  both the old people tried to inculcate patience and moderation  that fellow ezra girdlestone knows where they are tom would cry striding wildly up and down the room with unkempt hair and clenched hands  i will have his secret if i have to tear it out of him  steady lad steady the doctor replied to one of these outbursts there is nothing to be gained by violence  they are on the right side of the law at present and you will be on the wrong if you do anything rash  the girl could have written if she were uncomfortable  ah so she could  she must have forgotten us  how could she after all that has passed  let us hope for the best let us hope for the best the doctor would say soothingly  yet it must be confessed that he was considerably staggered by the turn which things had taken  he had seen so much of the world in his professional capacity that he had become a very reliable judge of character  all his instincts told him that kate harston was a truehearted and wellprincipled girl  it was not in her nature to leave london and never to send a single line to her friends to tell them where or why she had gone  there must he was sure be some good reason for her silence and this reason resolved itself into one or two thingseither she was ill and unable to hold a pen or she had lost her freedom and was restrained from writing to them  the last supposition seemed to the doctor to be the more serious of the two  had he known the instability of the girdlestone firm and the necessity they were under of getting ready money he would at once have held the key to the enigma  he had no idea of that but in spite of his ignorance he was deeply distrustful of both father and son  he knew and had often deplored the clause in john harstons will by which the wards money reverted to the guardian  forty thousand pounds were a bait which might tempt even a wealthy man into crooked paths  it was saturdaythe third saturday since girdlestone and his ward had disappeared  dimsdale had fully made up his mind that go where he would ezra should not escape him this time  on two consecutive saturdays the young merchant had managed to get away from him and had been absent each time until the monday morning  tom knew and the thought was a bitter one that these days were spent in some unknown retreat in the company of kate and of her guardian  this time at least he should not get away without revealing his destination  the two young men remained in the office until two oclock  then ezra put on his hat and overcoat buttoning it up close for the weather was bitterly cold  tom at once picked up his wideawake and followed him out into fenchurch street so close to his heels that the swinging door had not shut on the one before the other passed through  ezra glanced round at him when he heard the footsteps and gave a snarl like an angry dog  there was no longer any pretence of civility between the two and whenever their eyes met it was only to exchange glances of hatred and defiance  a hansom was passing down the street and ezra with a few muttered words to the driver sprang in  fortunately another had just discharged its fare and was still waiting by the curb  tom ran up to it keep that red cab in sight he said  whatever you do dont let it get away from you  the driver who was a man of few words nodded and whipped up his horse  it chanced that this same horse was either a faster or a fresher one than that which bore the young merchant  the red cab rattled down fleet street then doubled on its tracks and coming back by st pauls plunged into a labyrinth of side streets from which it eventually emerged upon the thames embankment  in spite of all its efforts however it was unable to shake off its pursuer  the red cab journeyed on down the embankment and across one of the bridges toms able charioteer still keeping only a few yards behind it  among the narrow streets on the surrey side ezras vehicle pulled up at a low beershop toms drove on a hundred yards or so and then stopped where he could have a good view of whatever occurred  ezra had jumped out and entered the publichouse  tom waited patiently outside until he should reappear  his movements hitherto had puzzled him completely  for a moment the wild hope came into his head that kate might be concealed in this strange hidingplace but a little reflection showed him the absurdity and impossibility of the idea  he had not long to wait  in a very few minutes young girdlestone came out again accompanied by a tall burly man with a bushy red beard who was miserably dressed and appeared to be somewhat the worse for drink he was helped into the cab by ezra and the pair drove off together tom was more bewildered than ever  who was this fellow and what connexion had he with the matter on hand  like a sleuthhound the pursuing hansom threaded its way through the torrent of vehicles which pour down the london streets never for one moment losing sight of its quarry  presently they wheeled into the waterloo road close to the waterloo station  the red cab turned sharp round and rattled up the incline which leads to the main line  tom sprang out tossed a sovereign to the driver and followed on foot at the top of his speed  as he ran into the station ezra girdlestone and the redbearded stranger were immediately in front of him  there was a great swarm of people all around for as it was saturday there were special trains to the country  tom was afraid of losing sight of the two men in the crowd so he elbowed his way through as quickly as he could and got immediately behind themso close that he could have touched them with his hand they were approaching the bookingoffice when ezra glanced round and saw his rival standing behind him  he gave a bitter curse and whispered something to his halfdrunken companion  the latter turned and with an inarticulate cry like a wild beast rushed at the young man and seized him by the throat with his brawny hands  it is one thing however to catch a man by the throat and another to retain that grip especially when your antagonist happens to be an international football player  to tom this redbearded rough who charged him so furiously was nothing more than the thousands of bullheaded forwards who had come upon him like thunderbolts in the days of old  with the ease begotten by practice he circled his assailant with his long muscular arms and gave a quick convulsive jerk in which every sinew of his body participated  the redbearded mans stumpy legs described a halfcircle in the air and he came down on the stone pavement with a sounding crash which shook every particle of breath from his enormous body  toms fighting blood was all aflame now and his grey eyes glittered with a berserk joy as he made at ezra  all the cautions of his father and the exhortations of his mother were cast to the winds as he saw his enemy standing before him  to do him justice ezra was nothing loth but sprang forward to meet him hitting with both hands  they were well matched for both were trained boxers and exceptionally powerful men ezra was perhaps the stronger but tom was in better condition there was a short eager rallyblow and guard and counter so quick and hard that the eye could hardly follow it  then a rush of railway servants and bystanders tore them asunder  tom had a red flush on his forehead where a blow had fallen ezra was spitting out the fragments of a broken tooth and bleeding profusely  each struggled furiously to get at the other with the result that they were dragged farther apart eventually a burly policeman seized tom by the collar and held him as in a vice  where is he tom cried craning his neck to catch a glimpse of his enemy  hell get away after all  cant elp that said the guardian of the peace phlegmatically a genelman like you ought to be ashamed  keep quiet now  would yer then  this last at some specially energetic effort on the part of the prisoner to recover his freedom  theyll get away  i know they will tom cried in despair for both ezra and his companion who was none other than burt of african notoriety had disappeared from his sight  his fears proved to be only too well founded for when at last he succeeded in wresting himself from the constables clutches he could find no trace of his enemies  a dozen bystanders gave a dozen different accounts of their movements he rushed from one platform to another over all the great station he could have torn his hair at the thought of the way in which he had allowed them to slip through his fingers  it was fully an hour before he finally abandoned the search and acknowledged to himself that he had been hoodwinked for the third time and that a long week would elapse before he could have another chance of solving the mystery  he turned at last sadly and reluctantly away from the station and walked across to waterloo bridge brooding over all that had occurred and cursing himself for his stupidity in allowing himself to be drawn into a vulgar brawl when he might have attained his end so much better by quiet observation  it was some consolation however that he had had one fair crack at ezra girdlestone  he glanced down at his knuckles which were raw and bleeding with a mixture of satisfaction and disgust with half a smile he put his injured hand in his pocket and looking up once more became aware that a redfaced gentleman was approaching him in a highly excited manner  it could not be said that the redfaced gentleman walked neither could it be said that the redfaced gentleman ran  his mode of progression might best be described as a succession of short and unwieldy jumps which as he was a rather stout gentleman appeared to indicate some very urgent and pressing need for hurry  his face was bathed in perspiration and his collar had become flaccid and shapeless from the same cause  it appeared to tom as he gazed at those rubicund though anxious features that they should be well known to him  that glossy hat those speckless gaiters and the long frockcoat surely they could belong to none other than the gallant major tobias clutterbuck late of her majestys 119th of the line  as the old soldier approached tom he quickened his pace so that when he eventually came up with him he could only puff and pant and hold out a soiled letter  read he managed to ejaculate  tom opened the letter and glanced his eye over the contents with a face which had turned as pale as the majors was red  when he finished it he turned without a word and began to run in the direction from which he had come the major following as quickly as his breath would permit    chapter xxxviii   girdlestone sends for the doctor  when kate came to herself after the terrible incident which frustrated her attempt at escape she found herself in bed in her own little room by the light which shone in through the window she knew that it must be well on in the day  her head was throbbing violently and she was so weak that she could hardly raise herself in bed  when she looked round she found that rebecca had brought a chair in from her room and was sitting by the fire  at the sound of her movement the maid glanced up and perceived that her mistress had recovered consciousness  lor bless me she cried youve given us a pretty fright we thought you wasnt coming back to your senses no more  youve been alyin there since the middle of the night and now its close on to twelve oclock  kate lay silent for some little time putting together all that had occurred  oh rebecca she said at last shivering at the recollection i have seen the most dreadful sight  either i am going mad or i have seen a ghost  we thought you were a ghost yourself said the girl reproachfully what with the screechin and you lying so white in the middle of the passage it was enough to make any ones air turn grey mr girdlestone he lifted you up an carried you back into your room he was cut to the heart the good gentleman when he saw what youd been after atryin to give him the slip  oh this dreadful house will kill meit will kill me kate moaned i cannot stay in it any longer  what shall i do  oh rebecca rebecca what shall i do  the freshcoloured maid came across with a simper upon her pretty vulgar face and sat on the side of the bed  whats the matter then she asked  what is it that you have seen  i have seenoh rebecca it is too dreadful to talk of  i have seen that poor monk who was killed in the cellars  it was not fancy  i saw him as plainly as i see you now with his tall thin figure and long loose gown and the brown cowl drawn over his face  god preserve us cried rebecca nervously glancing over her shoulder it is enough to give one the creeps  i pray that i may never see such a sight again  oh rebecca if you have the heart of a woman help me to get away from this place they mean that i should never go from it alive  i have read it in my guardians eyes  he longs for my death  do do tell me what i should do for the best  im surprised at you the maid said with dignity  when mr girdlestone and mr ezra is so good to you and provides you with a countryhouse and every convenience as eart could wish all you can find to do is to go screamin about at night and then talk as if you was agoin to be murdered in the day  i really am surprised theres mr girdlestone acallin  hed be shocked poor gentleman if he knew how you was abusin of him rebeccas face assumed an expression of virtuous indignation as she swept out of the room but her black eyes shone with the unholy light of cruelty and revenge  left to herself kate rose and dressed as well as her weakness would permit  her nerves were so shaken that she started at the least sound and she could hardly recognize the poor pale face which she saw in the glass as her own  she had scarcely finished her toilet before her guardian came up into her room  you are better then he said  i am very ill she answered gently  no wonder after rushing about the corridors in that absurd fashion in the dead of the night  rebecca tells me that you imagine you met with some apparition  you are crying  are you so unhappy then  very very miserable kate answered sinking her face upon her hands  ah said girdlestone softly it is only in some higher life that we shall find entire peace and contentment  his voice had altered so that a little warm spring of hope began to rise in the girls heart that perhaps the sight of her many miseries was beginning to melt this iron man  beyond the grave is rest he continued in the same gentle tones it has seemed to me sometimes that if it were not for the duties which i have to perform in this world and the many who are dependent upon me i should be tempted to shorten my existence in order to attain the peace which is to come  some precisians have pronounced it to be sinful to cut the thread of life  for my part i have never thought it so and yet my view of morals has been a strict one  i hold that of all things in this world ones life is the thing which belongs most entirely to ones self and may therefore most freely be terminated when it seems good to us  he picked up the phial from the mantelpiece and gazed thoughtfully at it  how strange he said to think that within the compass of this tiny bottle lies a cure for every earthly evil  one draught and the body slips off like a garment while the soul walks forth in all its beauty and freedom  trouble is over  one draught andah let go i say  what have you done  kate had snatched the bottle from him and with a quick feminine gesture had hurled it against the wall where it splintered to pieces sending a strong turpentiney odour through the apartment  her strength was so impaired that she staggered back after this feat and sat down on the side of the bed while her guardian grim and threatening stood over her with his long bony fingers opening and shutting as though he found it difficult to keep them from her throat  i will not help you in it she said in a low but firm voice you would kill my soul as well  the mask had fairly dropped from girdlestone  no gaunt old wolf could have glared down with fiercer eyes or a more cruel mouth  you fool he hissed  i am not afraid to die she said looking up at him with brave steadfast eyes  girdlestone recovered his selfpossession by an effort  it is clear to me he said calmly that your reason is unhinged  what is all this nonsense about death  there is nothing that will harm you except your own evil actions  he turned abruptly and strode out of the room with the firm and decided step of a man who has taken an irrevocable resolution  with a set and rigid face he ascended the steps which led to his bedroom and rummaging in his desk produced a telegram form  this he filled up and took with him downstairs  there he put on his hat and started off to the bedsworth postoffice at full speed  at the avenue gate he met his sentinel who was sitting on his camp stool as grim as ever  she is very bad stevens girdlestone said stopping and jerking his head in the direction of the house  she is going downhill  i am afraid that she cant last long  if any one asks you about her you can say that she was despaired of  i am just sending off a telegram to a doctor in london so that she may have the best advice  stevens touched his greasypeaked cap as a token of respect  she was down here behavin outrageous the other day said he  let me pass says she and you shall have ten golden guineas  thems her very words  not for ten hundred golden guineas i answers would william stevens hesquire do what he didnt ought to  very proper very proper indeed said girdlestone approvingly every man in his own station has his own duties to fulfil and he will be judged as he has fulfilled them well or ill  i shall see that you are no loser by your staunchness  thank ye guvnor  she is wild and delirious and can get about in spite of her low state of health  it is possible that she may make some effort to get away so be vigilant  good day to you  good day sir william stevens stood at the gate looking pensively after his employer then he reseated himself upon his campstool and lighting his pipe resumed his meditations  i cant make nought of it he muttered scratching his head it do seem uncommon queer to be sure  the boss he says shes very low says he and then next minute he says she may be comin down and tryin to escape  ive seen diers o all shapes and sizes but ive never seed one as went a galivantin about like thisat least not among them as died a natral death it do seem uncommon strange  then again hes off telegrayphin for a doctor to lunnon when theres doctor corbett o claxton or doctor hutton o bedsworth would come quick enough if he wanted them i cant make no sense of it  why bust my buttons he continued taking his pipe out of his mouth in a paroxysm of astonishment if here haint the dier herself  it was indeed kate who learning that her guardian was gone had come out with some vague idea of making a last struggle for her life and freedom  with the courage of despair she came straight down the avenue to the sole spot where escape seemed possible  good mornin missy cried stevens as she approached  you dont look extra bright this mornin but you aint as bad as your good guardian made me think  you dont seem to feel no difficulty in gettin about  there is nothing the matter with me the girl answered earnestly i assure you there is not  my mind is as sound as yours  thats what they all says said the exwarder with a chuckle  but it is so  i cannot stay in that house longer  i cannot mr stevens i cannot  it is haunted and my guardian will murder me he means to  i read it in his eyes  he as good as tried this morning to die without one word to those i lovewithout any explanation of what has passedthat would give a sting to death  well if this aint outragis cried the oneeyed man  perfectly outragis  going to murder you says you  whats he agoin to do that for  god knows  he hates me for some reason  i have never gone against his wishes save in one respect and in that i can never obey him for it is a matter in which he has no right to command  quite so said stevens winking his one eye  i knows the feeling myself cuss me but i do  thine for once and thine for never as the song says  why wont you let me pass pleaded kate  you may have had daughters of your own  what would you do if they were treated as i have been if i had money you should have it but i have none  do do let me go god will reward you for it  perhaps when you are on your last bed of sickness the memory of this one good deed may outweigh all the evil that you have done  lor dont she speak said stevens appealing confidentially to the nearest tree  its like a dictionary  and you wont lose by it in this life the girl added eagerly see here is my watch and my chain  you shall have that if you will let me through  lets see it  he opened it and examined it critically eighteen caratits only a geneva though  what can you expect for a geneva  and you shall have fifty pounds when i get back to my friends do let me pass good mr stevens for my guardian may return at any moment  see here miss stevens said solemnly dooty is dooty and if every hair of your ead was tagged wi a jewel and you offered to make me your barber i wouldnt let you through that gate  as to this ere watch if so be as you would like to write a line to your friends ill post it for you at bedsworth in exchange for it though it be only a geneva  you good kind man cried kate all excitement and delight  i have a pencil in my pocket  what shall i do for paper  she looked eagerly round and spied a small piece which lay among the brushwood  with a cry of joy she picked it out  it was very coarse and very dirty but she managed to scrawl a few lines upon it describing her situation and asking for aid  i will write the address upon the back she said when you get to bedsworth you must buy an envelope and ask the postoffice people to copy the address on to it  i bargained to post it for the geneva he said  i didnt bargain to buy envelopes and copy addresses  thats a nice pencilcase of yourn now ill make a clean job of it if youll throw that in  kate handed it over without a murmur  at last a small ray of light seemed to be finding its way through the darkness which had so long surrounded her  stevens put the watch and pencilcase in his pocket and took the little scrap of paper on which so much depended  as kate handed it to him she saw over his shoulder that coming up the lane was a small ponycarriage in which sat a buxom lady and a very small page the sleek little brown pony which drew it ambled along at a methodical pace which showed that it was entirely master of the situation while the whole turnout had an indescribable air of comfort and good nature poor kate had been so separated from her kind that the sight of people who if not friendly were at least not hostile to her sent a thrill of pleasure into her heart  there was something wholesome and prosaic too about this homely equipage which was inexpressibly soothing to a mind so worn by successive terrors  heres some one acomin cried stevens  clear out from hereits the governors orders  oh do let me stay and say one word to the lady  stevens seized his great stick savagely  clear out he cried in a hoarse angry voice and made a step towards her as if he would strike her  she shrank away from him and then a sudden thought seizing her she turned and ran through the woods as fast as her feeble strength would allow  the instant that she was out of sight stevens very deliberately and carefully tore up the little slip of paper with which she had entrusted him and scattered the pieces to the wind    chapter xxxix   a gleam of light  kate harston fled as quickly as she could through the wood stumbling over the brambles and crashing through the briars regardless of pain or scratches or anything else which could stand between her and the possibility of safety  she soon gained the shed and managed to mount on to the top of it by the aid of the barrel  craning her neck she could see the long dusty lane with the bare withered hedges upon either side and the dreary line of the railway embankment beyond  there was no ponycarriage in sight  she hardly expected that there would be for she had taken a short cut and the carriage would have to go some distance round  the road along which it was travelling ran at right angles to the one which she was now overlooking and the chances were equal as to whether the lady would turn round or go straight on  in the latter case it would not be possible for her to attract her attention  her heart seemed to stand still with anxiety as she peered over the high wall at the spot where the two roads crossed  presently she heard the rattle of wheels and the brown pony trotted round the corner  the carriage drew up at the end of the lane and the driver seemed to be uncertain how to proceed  then she shook the reins and the pony lumbered on along the road  kate gave a cry of despair and the last ray of hope died away from her heart  it chanced however that the page in the carriage was just at that happy age when the senses are keen and on the alert  he heard the cry and glancing round he saw through a break in the hedge that a lady was looking over the wall which skirted the lane they had passed he mentioned the fact to his mistress  maybe wed better go back maam he said  maybe wed better not john said the buxom lady  people can look over their garden walls without our interfering with them cant they  yes maam but she was ahollerin at us  no john was she though  maybe this is a private road and we have no right to be on it  she gave a holler as if some one was ahurtin of her said john with decision  then well go back said the lady and turned the pony round  hence it came about that just as kate was descending with a sad heart from her post of observation she was electrified to see the brown pony reappear and come trotting round the curve of the lane with a rapidity which was altogether foreign to that quadrupeds usual habits indeed the girl turned so very white at the sight and her face assumed such an expression of relief and delight that the lady who was approaching saw at once that it was no common matter which had caused her to summon them  what is it my dear she cried pulling up when she came abreast of the place  her good kind heart was touched already by the pleading expression upon the girls sweet face  oh madam whoever you may be said kate in a low rapid voice i believe god has sent you here this day  i am shut up in these grounds and shall be murdered unless help comes  be murdered cried the lady in the ponycarriage dropping back in her seat and raising her hands in astonishment  it is only too true kate said trying to speak concisely and clearly so as to enforce conviction but feeling a choking sensation about her throat as though an hysterical attack were impending  my guardian has shut me up here for some weeks and i firmly believe that he will never let me out alive  oh dont pray dont think me mad  i am as sane as you are though god knows what i have gone through has been enough to shake my reason  this last appeal of kates was in answer to an expression of incredulity and doubt which had passed over the face of the lady below  it was successful in its object for the ring of truth with which she spoke and the look of anxiety and terror upon her face were too genuine to be mistaken  the lady drew her rein so as to bring the carriage as near the wall as was possible without losing sight of kates face  my dear she said you may safely tell me everything  whatever i can do to help you shall be done and where i am powerless there are others who are my friends and may be of assistance  scully is my name mrs lavinia scully of london  dont cry my poor girl but tell me all about it and let us see how we can put matters right  thus encouraged kate wiped away the tears which had been brought to her eyes by the unwonted sound of a friendly voice  leaning forward as far as she could and preventing herself from falling by passing her arm round a great branch which shot across the top of the shed she gave in as few words as she could a detailed account of all that had befallen her  she described her guardians anxiety that she should marry his son her refusal their sudden departure from london their life at the priory the manner in which she was cut off from all human aid and the reasons which made her believe that an attempt would be made upon her life  in conclusion she narrated the scene which had occurred that very morning when her guardian had tempted her to commit suicide  the only incident which she omitted from her story was that which had occurred the night before for she felt that it might put too severe a tax upon mrs scullys credulity  indeed looking back at it she almost persuaded herself that the sight which she had seen might be some phantom conjured up by her own imagination weakened as she was in mind and in body  having concluded her narrative she wound up by imploring her newfound friend to assist her by letting her friends in london know what had become of her and where she was  mrs scully listened with a face which expressed alternately the most profound pity and the most burning indignation  when kate had finished she sat silent for a minute or more entirely absorbed in her own thoughts  she switched her whip up and down viciously and her usually placid countenance assumed an expression so fierce that kate looking down at her feared that she had given her offence  when she looked up at last however she smiled so pleasantly that the poor girl was reassured and felt instinctively that she had really found a true and effective friend at last  we must act promptly she said for we dont know what they may be about or what their plans are for the future  who did you say your friends were  dr dimsdale of phillimore gardens kensington  hasnt he got a grownup son  yes said kate with a slight flush on her pale cheeks  ah cried the good lady with a very roguish smile  i see how the land lies  of course of course why shouldnt it  i remember hearing about that young man  i have heard about the girdlestones also african merchants they were in the city  you see i know all about you  you know tom kate cried in astonishment  oh dont let us get talking of tom said mrs scully goodhumouredly  when girls get on a subject of that sort theres an end to everything  what i want now is business  in the first place i shall drive down to bedsworth and i shall send to london  god bless you ejaculated kate  but not to phillimore gardens  hotheaded young men do foolish things under such circumstances as these  this is a case that wants careful management  i know a gentleman in london who is just the man and who i know would be only too proud to help a lady in distress  he is a retired officer and his name is major clutterbuckmajor tobias clutterbuck  oh i know him very well and i have heard of you too said kate with a smile  i remember your name now in connection with his  it was mrs scullys turn to blush now  never mind that she said i can trust the major and i know he will be down here at a word from me  i shall let him have the facts and he can tell the dimsdales if he thinks it best  goodbye dear dont be unhappy any more but remember that you have friends outside who will very quickly set all right goodbye and waving her hand in encouragement the good widow woke up the pony which had fallen fast asleep and rattled away down the lane in the direction from which she had come    chapter xl   the major has a letter  at four oclock mr girdlestone stepped into the bedsworth telegraph office and wired his short message  it ran thus case hopeless  come on tomorrow with a doctor  on receipt of this he knew by their agreement that his son would come down bringing with him the man of violence whom he had spoken of at their last interview  there was nothing for it now but that his ward should die  if he delayed longer the crash might come before her money was available and then how vain all regrets would be  it seemed to him that there was very little risk in the matter the girl had had no communication with any one  even of those around her mrs jorrocks was in her dotage rebecca taylforth was staunch and true and stevens knew nothing  every one on the country side had heard of the invalid young lady at the priory  who would be surprised to hear that she had passed away  he dare not call in any local medical man but his inventive brain had overcome the difficulty and had hit upon a device by which he might defy both doctors and coroner  if all went as he had planned it it was difficult to see any chance of detection in the case of a poorer man the fact that the girls money reverted to him might arouse suspicion but he rightly argued that with his great reputation no one would ever dream that such a consideration could have weight with him  having sent the telegram off and so taken a final step john girdlestone felt more at his ease  he was proud of his own energy and decision  as he walked very pompously and gravely down the village street his heart glowed within him at the thought of the long struggle which he had maintained against misfortune  he passed over in his mind all the successive borrowings and speculations and makeshifts and ruses which the firm had resorted to  yet in spite of every danger and difficulty it still held up its head with the best and would weather the storm at last  he reflected proudly that there was no other man in the city who would have had the dogged tenacity and the grim resolution which he had displayed during the last twelve months  if ever any one should put it all in a book he said to himself there are few who would believe it possible  it is not by my own strength that i have done it  the man had no consciousness of blasphemy in him as he revolved this thought in his mind  he was as thoroughly in earnest as were any of those religious fanatics who throughout history have burned sacked and destroyed committing every sin under heaven in the name of a god of peace and of mercy  when he was halfway to the priory he met a small ponycarriage which was rattling towards bedsworth at a great pace driven by a goodlooking middleaged lady with a small page by her side  the merchant encountered this equipage in a narrow country lane without a footpath and as it approached him he could not help observing that the lady wore an indignant and gloomy look upon her features which was out of keeping with their general contour  her forehead was contracted into a very decided frown and her lips were gathered into what might be described as a negative smile  girdlestone stood aside to let her pass but the lady by a sudden twitch of her righthand rein brought the wheels across in so sudden a manner that they were within an ace of going over his toes  he only saved himself by springing back into a gap of the hedge  as it was he found on looking down that his pearl grey trousers were covered with flakes of wet mud  what made the incident more perplexing was that both the middleaged lady and the page laughed very heartily as they rattled away to the village  the merchant proceeded on his way marvelling in his heart at the uncharitableness and innate wickedness of unregenerated human nature  good mrs scully little dreamed of the urgency of the case  had she seen the telegram which john girdlestone had just despatched it is conceivable that she might have read between the words and by acting more promptly have prevented a terrible crime  as a matter of fact with all her sympathy the worthy woman had taken a large part of kates story with the proverbial grain of salt  it seemed to her to be incredible and impossible that in this nineteenth century such a thing as deliberate and carefully planned murder should occur in christian england  that these things occur in the abstract we are ready to admit but we find it very difficult to realize that they may come within the horizon of our own experience  hence mrs scully set no importance upon kates fears for her life and put them down to the excited state of the girls imagination  she did consider it however to be a very iniquitous and unjustifiable thing that a young girl should be cooped up and separated from all the world in such a very dreary place of seclusion as the priory  this consideration and nothing more serious had set that look of wrath upon her pleasant face and had stirred her up to frustrate girdlestone and to communicate with kates friends  her intention had been to telegraph to london but as she drove to bedsworth she bethought her how impossible it would be for her within the limits of a telegram to explain to her satisfaction all that she wanted to express  a letter she reflected would if posted now reach the major by the first post on saturday morning  it would simply mean a few hours delay in the taking of steps to relieve kate and what difference could a few hours more or less make to the girl she determined therefore that she would write to the major explaining all the circumstances and leave it to him what course of action should be pursued  mrs scully was well known at the post office and they quickly accommodated her with the requisites for correspondence  within a quarter of an hour she had written sealed stamped and posted the following epistle      dearest toby      i am afraid you must find your period of probation very slow      poor boy what does he do no billiards no cards no betting      how does he manage to get through the day at all  smokes i      suppose and looks out of the window and tells all his grievances      to mr von baumser  arent you sorry that ever you made the      acquaintance of morrisons second floor front poor toby      who do you think i have come across down here  no less a person      than that miss harston who was girdlestones ward  you used to      talk about her i remember and indeed you were a great admirer of      hers  you would be surprised if you saw her now so thin and worn      and pale  still her face is very sweet and pretty so i wont      deny your good tastehow could i after you have paid your      addresses to me      her guardian has brought her down here and has locked her up in a      great bleak house called the priory  she has no one to speak to      and is not allowed to write letters  she seemed to be heartbroken      because none of her friends know where she is and she fears that      they may imagine that she has willingly deserted them  of course      by her friends she means that curlyheaded mr dimsdale that you      spoke of  the poor girl is in a very low nervous state and told      me over the wall of the park that she feared her guardian had      designs on her life  i can hardly believe that but i do think      that she is far from well and that it is enough to drive her mad      to coop her up like that  we must get her out somehow or another      i suppose that her guardian is within his rights and that it is      not a police matter  you must consider what must be done and let      young dimsdale know if you think best  he will want to come down      to see her no doubt and if toby were to come too i should not be      sorry      i should have telegraphed about it but i could not explain myself      sufficiently  i assure you that the poor girl is in a very bad      way and we cant be too energetic in what we do  it was very sad      to hear the positive manner in which she declared that her guardian      would murder her though she did not attempt to give any reason why      he should commit such a terrible crime  we saw a horrid oneeyed      man at the gate who appeared to be on guard to prevent any one      from coming out or in  on our way to bedsworth we met no less a      person than the great mr girdlestone himself and we actually      drove so clumsily that we splashed him all over with mud      wasnt that a very sad and unaccountable thing  i fancy i see toby      smiling over that      goodbye my dear lad  be as good as you can  i know youve got      rather out of the way of it but practice works wonders      ever yours      lavinia scully  it happened that on the morning on which this missive came to kennedy place von baumser had not gone to the city  the major had just performed his toilet and was marching up and down with a cigarette in his mouth and the united service gazette in his hand descanting fluently as is the habit of old soldiers on the favouritism of the horse guards and the deterioration of the service  look at this fellow carmoichael he cried excitedly slapping the paper with one hand while he crumpled it up with the other  theyve made him lieutinantgineral  the demndest booby in the regiment sir a fellow whos seen no service and never heard a shot fired in anger they promoted him on the stringth of a sham fight bedad  he commanded a definding force operating along the thames and opposing an invading army that was advancing from guildford  did iver ye hear such infernal nonsense in your life  and theres stares and knight and underwood and a dozen more i could mintion that have volunteered for everything since the sikh war of 46 all neglicted sirneglicted  the british army is going straight to the divil  dats a very bad lookout for the devil said von baumser filling up a cup of coffee  the major continued to stride angrily about the room  thats why we niver have a satisfactory campaign with a european foe he broke out our success is always half and half and leads to nothing  yet we have the finest raw material and the greatest individual fighting power and divilment of any army in the world  always of course not counting de army of his most graceworthy majesty de emperor william said von baumser with his mouth full of toast here is de girl mit a letter  let us hope dat it is my frankfort money  two to one its for me  ah he must not bet cried von baumser with upraised finger you have right though  it is for you and from de proper quarter too i think  it was the letter which we have already quoted  the major broke the seal and read it over very carefully after which he read it again von baumser watching him across the table saw a very anxious and troubled look upon his ruddy face  i hope dere is nothing wrong mit my good vriend madame scully he remarked at last  no nothing wrong with her  there is with some one else though and with that he read to his companion all that part of his letter which referred to miss harston  dat is no joke at all the german remarked and the two sat for some little time lost in thought the major with the letter still lying open upon his knee  what dye think of it he asked at last  i think dat it is a more bad thing than the good madame seems to think i think dat if miss harston says dat herr girdlestone intends to kill her it is very likely dat he has dat intention  ged hes not a man to stick at troifles the major said rubbing his chin reflectively  heres a nice kettle of fish  what the deuce could cause him to do such a thing  money of course  i have told you my good vriend dat since a year de firm has been in a very bad way indeed  it is not generally known but i know it and so do others  dis girl i have heard has money which would come to de old man in case of her death  it is as plain as de vingers on my hand  be george the thing looks very ugly said the major pacing up and down the room  i believe that fellow and his beauty of a son are game for anything  lavinia takes the mather too lightly  fancy any one being such a scounthrel as to lay a hand on that dear girl though ged baumser it makes ivery drop of blood in me body tingle in me veins  my dear vriend von baumser answered it is very good of your blood for to tingle but i do not see how dat will help the mees  let us be practical and make up our brains what we should do  i must find young dimsdale at once  he has a right to know  yes i should find him  dere is no doubt that you and he should at once start off for dis place  i know dat young man  dere vill be no holding him at all when he has heard of it  you must go too to prevent him from doing dummheiten and also because good madame scully has said so in her letter  certainly  we shall go down togither  one of us will manage to see the young lady and find out if she requoires assistance  bedad if she does she shall have it guardian or no guardian  if we dont whip her out in a brace of shakes me names not clutterbuck  you must remember remarked baumser dat dese people are desperate if dey intend to murder a voman dey vould certainly not stick at a man or two men  you have no knowledge of how many dere may be  dere is certainly herr girdlestone and his son and de man mit de eye but madame knows not how many may be at de house  remember also dat de police are not on your side but rather against you for as yet dere is no evidence dat any crime is intentioned  ven you think of all dis i am sure dat you vill agree with me dat it would be vell to take mit you two or tree men dat would stick by you through thin and broad  the major was so busy in making his preparations for departure that he could only signify by a nod that he agreed with his friends remarks what men could i git he asked  dere is i myself said the german counting upon his big red fingers and dere are some of our society who would very gladly come on such an errand and are men who are altogether to be relied upon  dere is little fritz bulow of kiel and a russian man whose name i disremember but he is a good man  he vas a nihilist at odessa and is sentenced to death suppose they could him catch  dere are others as good but it might take me time to find dem  dese two i can very easily get dey are living together and have neither of dem nothing to do  bring them then said the major  git a cab and run them down to waterloo station  thats the one for bedsworth  ill bring dimsdale down with me and mate you there  in me opinion theres no time to be lost  the major was ready to start so von baumser threw on his coat and hat and picked out a thick stick from a rack in the corner  we may need something of de sort he said  i have me derringer the soldier answered  they left the house together and von baumser drove off to the east end where his political friends resided  the major called a cab and rattled away to phillimore gardens and thence to the office without being able to find the man of whom he was in search  he then rushed down the strand as quickly as he could intending to catch the next train and go alone but on his way to waterloo station he fell in with tom dimsdale as recorded in a preceding chapter  the letter was a thunderbolt to tom in his worst dreams he had never imagined anything so dark as this  he hurried back to the station at such a pace that the poor major was reduced to a most asthmatical and wheezy condition  he trotted along pluckily however and as he went heard the account of toms adventures in the morning and of the departure of ezra girdlestone and of his redbearded companion the majors face grew more anxious still when he heard of it  pray god we may not be too late he panted    chapter xli   the clouds grow darker  when kate had made a clean breast of all her troubles to the widow scully and had secured that good womans cooperation a great weight seemed to have been lifted from her heart and she sprang from the shed a different woman  it would soon be like a dream all these dreary weeks in the grim old house  within a day she was sure that either tom or the major would find means of communicating with her  the thought made her so happy that the colour stole back into her cheeks and she sang for very lightness of heart as she made her way back to the priory  mrs jorrocks and rebecca observed the change which had come over her and marvelled at it  kate attempted to aid the former in her household work but the old crone refused her assistance and repulsed her harshly her maid too answered her curtly when she addressed her and eyed her in anything but a friendly manner  you dont seem much the worse she remarked for all the wonderful things you seed in the night  oh dont speak of it said kate  i am afraid that i have given you a great fright  i was feeling far from well and i suppose that i must have imagined all about that dreadful monk  yet at the time i assure you that i saw it as plainly as i see you now  whats that she says asked mrs jorrocks with her hand to her ear  she says that she saw a ghost last night as plain as she sees you now  pack of nonsense cried the old woman rattling the poker in the grate  ive been here afore she cameall alone in the house tooand i haint seen nothing of the sort  when shes got nothing else to grumble about she pretends as she has seen a ghost  no no the girl said cheerily  i am not grumblingindeed i am not  its like her contrariness to say so old mrs jorrocks cried hoarsely  shes always acontradictin  youre not in a good temper today kate remarked and went off to her room going up the steps two at a time with her old springy footstep  rebecca followed her and noticing the change interpreted it in her own narrow fashion  you seems cheerful enough now she said standing at kates door and looking into her room with a bitter smile on her lips  tomorrow is saturday  thats whats the matter with you  tomorrow saturday kate repeated in astonishment  yes you know what i mean well enough  its no use pretending that you dont  the girls manner was so aggressive that kate was astonished i havent the least idea of what you mean she said  oh no cried rebecca with her arms akimbo and a sneer on her face she doesnt know what i mean  she doesnt know that her young man is coming down on the saturday  she does not know that mr ezra comes all the way from london on that day just for to see her  it isnt that that makes you cheerful is it  oh you double face  the girls pretty features were all distorted with malice as she spoke and her two hands were clenched passionately  rebecca cried kate energetically i really think that you are the most complete fool that ever i met in my life  i will trouble you to remember that i am your mistress and you are my servant  how dare you speak to me in such a way  leave my room this instant  the girl stood her ground as though she intended to brazen it out but kate swept towards her with so much honest anger in her voice and such natural dignity in her bearing that she sank her bold gaze and with a few muttered words slunk away into her own room  kate closed the door behind her and then her sense of the ludicrous overpowering her anger she laughed for the first time since she had been in the priory  it was so intensely ridiculous that even the most foolish of mortals should imagine that she could under any circumstances be desirous of seeing ezra girdlestone  the very thought of him brought her amusement to an end for the maid was right and tomorrow would bring him down once more  perhaps her friends might arrive before he did  god grant it  it was a cold but a bright day  from her window she could see the snowwhite sails of the hampshire fishingboats dipping and rising against the deep blue sea  a single barque rode amongst them like a swan among ducklings beating up against the wind for portsmouth or southampton  away on the right was the long line of white foam which marked the winner sands  the tide was in and the great mudbanks had disappeared save that here and there their duncoloured convexity rose above the surface like the back of a sleeping leviathan  overhead a great flock of wild geese were flapping their way southward like a broad arrow against the sky  it was an exhilarating bracing scene and accorded well with her own humour  she felt so full of life and hope that she could hardly believe that she was the same girl who that very morning had hurled away the poison bottle knowing in her heart that unless she destroyed it she might be tempted to follow her guardians sinister suggestions  yet the incident was real enough for there were the fragments of glass scattered over the bare planks of her floor and the insidious odour of the drug was still so strong that she opened the window in order to dissipate it  looking back at it now it all seemed like some hideous nightmare  she had no very clear idea as to what she expected her friends to do that she would be saved and that speedily she never for one instant doubted  she had only to wait patiently and all would be well by tomorrow night at the latest her troubles would be over  so thought girdlestone too as he sat down below with his head bent upon his breast and his eyes looking moodily from under his shaggy brows at the glowing coals  tomorrow evening would settle the matter once and for ever  burt and ezra would be down by five oclock and that would be the beginning of the end  as to burts future there was no difficulty about that  he was a broken man  if well supplied with unlimited liquor he would not live long to trouble them  he had nothing to gain and everything to lose by denouncing them  should the worst come to the worst the ravings of a dipsomaniac could do little harm to a man as respected as the african merchant  every event had been foreseen and provided for by the old schemer  above all he had devised a method by which even a coroners inquiry could be faced with impunity and which would do away with all necessity for elaborate concealment  he beckoned mrs jorrocks over to him for he had been sitting in the large room which was used both as a diningroom and as a kitchen  what is the latest train tomorrow he asked  there be one that reaches bedsworth at a quarter to ten  it passes the grounds at about twenty to ten then  that reglar that i could set my clock by it  thatll do  where is miss harston  upstairs sir  she came back alaughin and ajumpin and as sassy as you please to them as was old before she was born  laughing said girdlestone raising his eyebrows  she did not seem in a laughing mood this morning  you dont think she has gone out of her mind do you  i dont know nought about that  there was rebecca came down here acryin cause shed ordered her out of her room  oh shes mistress of the housetheres no  doubt about that  shell be agivin of us all the sack presently  girdlestone relapsed into silence but his face showed that he was puzzled by what he had heard  kate slept a sound and dreamless sleep that night  at her age trouble is shaken from the young mind like water from the feathers of a duck it had been all very gloomy and terrible while it lasted but now the dawn of better days had come  she woke cheerful and lighthearted she felt that when once she was free she could forgive her guardian and rebecca and all of themeven ezra  she would bury the whole hideous incident and never think of it or refer to it again  she amused herself that morning by reckoning up in her mind what the sequence of events would be in london and how long it would be before she heard from her friends  if mrs scully had telegraphed news would have reached them last night  probably she would write as well giving all the particulars about her  the post came in about nine oclock she thought  then some time would elapse before the major could find tom after that no doubt they would have to consider what had best be done and perhaps would go and consult with dr dimsdale  that would occupy the morning and part of the afternoon  they could hardly reach the priory before nightfall  ezra would be down by that time  on the saturday before he had arrived between five and six  a great dread filled her soul at the thought of meeting the young merchant again  it was merely the natural instinct of a lady shrinking from whatever is rough and coarse and antagonistic she had no conception of the impending danger or of what his coming might mean to her  mr girdlestone was more gracious to her than usual that morning at breakfast  he seemed anxious to efface the remembrance of his fierce and threatening words the day before  rebecca who waited upon them was astonished to hear the way in which he spoke  his whole manner was less heavy and ungainly than usual for now that the time for action was at hand he felt braced and invigorated as energetic men do  you should study botany while you are down here he said blandly depend upon it one cannot learn too many things in ones youth besides a knowledge of natural science teaches us the marvellous harmony which prevails throughout the universe and so enlarges our minds  i should very much like to know something of it answered kate my only fear is that i should not be clever enough to learn it  the wood here is full of wonders  the tiniest mushroom is as extraordinary and as worthy of study as the largest oak  your father was fond of plants and animals  yes i can remember that said kate her face growing sad as her mind travelled back to years gone by  what would that same father have thought she wondered had he known how this man opposite to her had treated her  what did it matter now though when she would so soon be out of his power  i remember said girdlestone stirring his tea thoughtfully when we lived in the city as prentice lads together we shared a room above the shop  he used to have a dormouse that he was very fond of  all his leisure time was spent in nursing the creature and cleaning its cage it seemed to be his only pleasure in life  one night it was running across the floor and i put my foot upon it  oh poor papa cried kate  i did it upon principle  you have devoted too much time to the creature i said  raise up your thoughts higher  he was grieved and angry but in time he came to thank me  it was a useful lesson  kate was so startled by this anecdote that she remained silent for some little time  how old were you then she asked at last  i was about sixteen  then you were alwaysinclined that way  she found some difficulty in conveying her meaning in polite tones  yes i received a call when i was very young  i became one of the elect at an early age  and which are the elect his ward asked demurely  the members of the community of the primitive trinitariansor at least those of them who frequent purbrook street chapel  i hold that the ministers in the other chapels that i have attended do not preach the unadulterated word and have therefore missed the narrow path  then said kate you think that no one will be saved except those who frequent the purbrook street chapel  and not all of themno nor one in ten the merchant said confidently and with some approach to satisfaction  heaven must be a very small place kate remarked as she rose from the table  are you going out  i was thinking of having a stroll in the wood  think over a text as you walk  it is an excellent commencement of the day  what text should i think of she asked standing smiling in the doorway with the bright sunshine bursting in behind her  in the midst of life we are in death he said solemnly  his voice was so hollow and stern that it struck a chill into the girls heart the effect was only momentary however  the day was so fine and the breeze so fresh that sadness was out of the question  besides was not her deliverance at hand on this of all mornings she should be free from vague presentiments and dim forebodings  the change in her guardians manner was an additional cause for cheerfulness  she almost persuaded herself that she had misconstrued his words and his intentions upon the preceding day  she went down the avenue and had a few words with the sentry there she felt no bitterness against him nowon the contrary she could afford to laugh at his peculiarities  he was in a very bad humour on account of some domestic difficulties  his wife had been abusing him and had ended by assaulting him  she used to argey first and then fetch the poker he said ruefully but now its the poker first and there aint no argeyment at all  kate looked at his savage face and burly figure and thought what a very courageous woman his wife must be  its all cause the fisher lasses wont lemme alone he explained with a leer  she dont like it knock me sideways if she do  it aint my fault though  i allers had a kind o a fetchin way wi women  did you post my note asked kate  yes in course i did he answered  itll be in lunnon now most like  his one eye moved about in such a very shifty way as he spoke that she was convinced that he was telling a lie  she could not be sufficiently thankful that she had something else to rely upon besides the old scoundrels assurances  there was nothing to be seen down the lane except a single cart with a loutish young man walking at the horses head  she had a horror of the country folk since her encounter with the two bumpkins upon the sunday she therefore slipped away from the gate and went through the wood to the shed which she mounted  on the other side of the wall there was standing a little boy in buttons so rigid and motionless that he might have been one of madame tussauds figures were it not for his eyes which were rolling about in every direction and which finally fixed themselves on kates face  good morning miss said this apparition  good morning she answered  i think i saw you with mrs scully yesterday  yes miss  missus she told me to wait here and never to move until i seed you  she said as you would be sure to come  ive been waitin here for nigh on an hour  your mistress is an angel kate said enthusiastically and you are a very good little boy  indeed youve hit it about the missus said the youth in a hoarse whisper nodding his head to emphasize his remarks  shes got a heart as is big enough for three  kate could not help smiling at the enthusiasm with which the little fellow spoke  you seem fond of her she said  id be a bad un if i wasnt  she took me out of the workus without character or nothing and now shes aeducatin of me  she sent me ere with a message  what was it  she said as how she had written instead o electrotelegraphing cause she had so much to say she couldnt fit it all on a telegraph  i thought that would be so kate said  she wrote to majormajorhim as is afollerin of her  she said as she had no doubt as hed be down today and you was to keep up your sperrits and let her know by me if any one was awexin you  no no  not at all kate answered smiling again  you can tell her that my guardian has been much kinder today  i am full of hope now give her my warmest thanks for her kindness  all right miss  say that chap at the gate hasnt been giving you no cheek has hehim with the game eye  no no john  john looked at her suspiciously  if he hasnt its all right he said but i think as youre one of them as dont complain if you can elp it  he opened his hand and showed a great jagged flint which he carried  id ha knocked his other peeper out with this he said blowed if i wouldnt  dont do anything of the sort john but run home like a good little boy  all right miss  goodbye to ye  kate watched him stroll down the lane  he paused at the bottom as if irresolute and then she was relieved to see him throw the stone over into a turnip field and walk rapidly off in the opposite direction to the priory gates    chapter xlii   the three faces at the window  late in the afternoon ezra arrived at the priory  from one of the passage windows kate saw him driving up the avenue in a high dogcart there was a broadshouldered redbearded man sitting beside him and the ostler from the flying bull was perched behind  kate had rushed to the window on hearing the sound of wheels with some dim expectation that her friends had come sooner than she anticipated  a glance however showed her that the hope was vain  from behind a curtain she watched them alight and come into the house while the trap wheeled round and rattled off for bedsworth again  she went slowly back to her room wondering what friend this could be whom ezra had brought with him  she had noticed that he was roughly clad presenting a contrast to the young merchant who was vulgarly spruce in his attire  evidently he intended to pass the night at the priory since they had let the trap go back to the village  she was glad that he had come for his presence would act as a restraint upon the girdlestones  in spite of her guardians amiability at breakfast she could not forget the words which he had used the morning before or the incident of the poison bottle  she was as convinced as ever that he meant mischief to her but she had ceased to fear him  it never for one moment occurred to her that her guardians machinations might come to a head before her rescuers could arrive  as the long afternoon stole away she became more and more impatient and expectant  she had been sewing in her room but she found that she could no longer keep her attention on the stitches  she paced nervously up and down the little apartment  in the room beneath she could hear the dull muffled sound of mens voices in a long continuous monotone broken only by the interposition now and again of one voice which was so deep and loud that it reminded her of the growl of a beast of prey this must belong to the redbearded stranger  kate wondered what it could be that they were talking over so earnestly  city affairs no doubt or other business matters of importance  she remembered having once heard it remarked that many of the richest men on change were eccentric and slovenly in their dress so the newcomer might be a more important person than he seemed  she had determined to remain in her room all the afternoon to avoid ezra but her restlessness was so great that she felt feverish and hot the fresh air she thought would have a reviving effect upon her she slipped down the staircase treading as lightly as possible not to disturb the gentlemen in the refectory  they appeared to hear her however for the hum of conversation died away and there was a dead silence until after she had passed  she went out on to the little lawn which lay in front of the old house there were some flowerbeds scattered about on it but they were overgrown with weeds and in the last stage of neglect  she amused herself by attempting to improve the condition of one of them and kneeling down beside it she pulled up a number of the weeds which covered it  there was a withered rosebush in the centre so she pulled up that also and succeeded in imparting some degree of order among the few plants which remained  she worked with unnatural energy pausing every now and again to glance down the dark avenue or to listen intently to any chance sound which might catch her ear  in the course of her work she chanced to look up at the priory the refectory faced the lawn and at the window of it there stood the three men looking out at her  the girdlestones were nodding their heads as though they were pointing her out to the third man who stood between them  he was looking at her with an expression of interest kate thought as she returned his gaze that she had never seen a more savage and brutal face  he was flushed and laughing while ezra beside him appeared to be pale and anxious  they all when they saw that she noticed them stepped precipitately back from the window  she had only a momentary glance at them and yet the three facesthe strange fierce red one and the two hard familiar pale ones which flanked itremained vividly impressed upon her memory  girdlestone had been so pleased at the early appearance of his allies and the prospect of settling the matter once for all that he received them with a cordiality which was foreign to his nature  always punctual my dear son and always to be relied upon he said you are a model to our young business men  as to you mr burt he continued grasping the navvys horny hand i am delighted to see you at the priory much as i regret the sad necessity which has brought you down  talk it over afterwards said ezra shortly  burt and i have had no luncheon yet  i am cursed near starved the other growled throwing himself into a chair  ezra had been careful to keep him from drink on the way down and he was now sober or as nearly sober as a brain saturated with liquor could ever be  girdlestone called for mrs jorrocks who laid the cloth and put a piece of cold corned beef and a jug of beer upon the table  ezra appeared to have a poor appetite but burt ate voraciously and filled his glass again and again from the jug  when the meal was finished and the ale all consumed he rose with a grunt of repletion and pulling a roll of black tobacco from his pocket proceeded to cut it into slices and to cram it into his pipe  ezra drew a chair up to the fire and his father did the same after ordering the old woman out of the room and carefully closing the door behind her  you have spoken to our friend here about the business girdlestone asked nodding his head in the direction of burt  yes  i have made it all clear  five hundred pounds down and a free passage to africa said burt  an energetic man like you can do a great deal in the colonies with five hundred pounds girdlestone remarked  what i do with it is nothin to you guvnor burt remarked surlily i does the job you pays the money and theres an end as far as you are concerned  quite so the merchant said in a conciliatory voice  you are free to do what you like with the money  without axin your leave growled burt  he was a man of such a turbulent and quarrelsome disposition that he was always ready to go out of his way to make himself disagreeable  the question is how it is to be done interposed ezra  he was looking very nervous and uneasy  hard as he was he had neither the pseudoreligious monomania of his father nor the callous brutality of burt and he shuddered at the thought of what was to come  his eyes were red and bleared and he sat with one arm thrown over the back of his chair while he drummed nervously with the fingers of his other hand upon his knee  youve got some plan in your head i suppose he said to his father  its high time the thing was carried through or we shall have to put up the shutters in fenchurch street  his father shivered at the very thought  anything rather than that he said  it will precious soon come to that  it was the devil of a fight to keep things straight last week  whats the matter with your lip  it seems to be swollen  i had a turn with that fellow dimsdale ezra answered putting his hand up to his mouth to hide the disfigurement  he followed us to the station and we had to beat him off but i think i left my marks upon him  he played some damned hokeypokey business on me said burt he tripped me in some newfangled way and nigh knocked the breath out of me  i dont fall as light as i used  he did not succeed in tracing you girdlestone asked uneasily there is no chance of his turning up here and spoiling the whole business  not the least said ezra confidently  he was in the hands of a policeman when i saw him last  that is well  now i should like before we go further to say a few words to mr burt as to what has led up to this  you havent got a drop to drink boss  yes yes of course  what is that in the bottle over there ginger wine  how will that do  heres something better ezra said rummaging in the cupboard here is a bottle of hollands  it is mrs jorrocks private store i fancy  burt poured himself out half a tumblerful and filled it up with water drive along he said i am lisnin  girdlestone rose and stood with his back to the fire and his hands under his coattails  i wish you to understand he said that this is no sudden determination of ours but that events have led up to it in such a way that it was impossible to avoid it  our commercial honour and integrity are more precious to us than anything else and we have both agreed that we are ready to sacrifice anything rather than lose it unfortunately our affairs have become somewhat involved and it was absolutely necessary that the firm should have a sum of money promptly in order to extricate itself from its difficulties  this sum we endeavoured to get through a daring speculation in diamonds which was though i say it ingeniously planned and cleverly carried out and which would have succeeded admirably had it not been for an unfortunate chance  i remember said burt  of course  you were there at the time  we were able to struggle along for some time after this on money which we borrowed and on the profits of our african trade  the time came however when the borrowed money was to be repaid and once again the firm was in danger  it was then that we first thought of the fortune of my ward  it was enough to turn the scale in our favour could we lay our hands upon it  it was securely tied up however in such a way that there were only two means by which we could touch a penny of it  one was by marrying her to my son the other was by the young ladys death  do you follow me  burt nodded his shaggy head  this being so we did all that we could to arrange a marriage without flattery i may say that no girl was ever approached in a more delicate and honourable way than she was by my son ezra  i for my part brought all my influence to bear upon her in order to induce her to meet his advances in a proper spirit  in spite of our efforts she rejected him in the most decided way and gave us to understand that it was hopeless to attempt to make her change her mind  some one else maybe suggested burt  the man who put you on your back at the station said ezra  ha  ill pay him for that the navvy growled viciously  a human life mr burt continued girdlestone is a sacred thing but a human life when weighed against the existence of a great firm from which hundreds derive their means of livelihood is a small consideration indeed  when the fate of miss harston is put against the fate of the great commercial house of girdlestone it is evident which must go to the wall  burt nodded and poured some more hollands from the square bottle  having seen girdlestone continued that this sad necessity might arise i had made every arrangement some time before  this building is as you may have observed in your drive situated in a lonely and secluded part of the country  it is walled round too in such a manner that any one residing here is practically a prisoner  i removed the lady so suddenly that no one can possibly know where she has gone to and i have spread such reports as to her condition that no one down here would be surprised to hear of her decease  but there is bound to be an inquiry  how about a medical certificate asked ezra  i shall insist upon a coroners inquest his father answered  an inquest  are you mad  when you have heard me i think that you will come to just the opposite conclusion  i think that i have hit upon a scheme which is really neatneat in its simplicity  he rubbed his hands together and showed his long yellow fangs in his enjoyment of his own astuteness  burt and ezra leaned forward to listen while the old man sank his voice to a whisper  they think that she is insane he said  yes  theres a small door in the boundary wall which leads out to the railway line  well what of that  suppose that door to be left open would it be an impossible thing for a crazy woman to slip out through it and to be run over by the ten oclock express  if she would only get in the way of it  you dont quite catch my idea yet  suppose that the express ran over the dead body of a woman would there be anything to prove afterwards that she was dead and not alive at the time of the accident  do you think that it would ever occur to any ones mind that the express ran over a dead body  i see your meaning said his son thoughtfully  you would settle her and then put her there  of course  what could be more delightfully simple  friend burt here does his work we carry her through the garden gate and lay her on the darkest part of the rails  then we miss her at the house  there is an alarm and a search  the gate is found open  we naturally go through with lanterns and find her on the line  i dont think we need fear the coroner or any one else then  hes a sharp un is the guvnor cried burt slapping his thigh enthusiastically  its the downiest lay i have heard this many a day  i believe you are the devil incarnate said ezra looking at his father with a mixture of horror and of admiration  but how about jorrocks and stevens and rebecca  would you trust them  certainly not girdlestone answered  it is not necessary  mr burt can do his part of the business out of doors  we can entice her out upon some excuse  there is no reason why any one should have a suspicion of the truth  but they know that she is not mad  they will think that she did it on purpose  the secret will be locked up in our three breasts  after one nights work our friend here goes to the colonies a prosperous man and the firm of girdlestone holds up its head once more stainless and irreproachable  speak low said ezra in a whisper  i hear her coming downstairs they listened to her light springy footstep as it passed the door come here burt he said after a pause  she is at work on the lawn come and have a look at her  they all went over to the window and looked out  it was then that kate glancing up saw the three cruel faces surveying her  shes a rare wellbuilt un said burt as he stepped back from the window  it is the ugliest job as ever i was on  but we can rely upon you girdlestone asked looking at him with puckered eyes  you betas long as you pay me the navvy answered phlegmatically and went back to his pipe and to mrs jorrocks bottle of hollands    chapter xliii   the bait on the hook  the grey winter evening was beginning to steal in before the details had all been arranged by the conspirators  it had grown so chill that kate had abandoned her attempt at gardening and had gone back to her room ezra left his father and burt by the fire and came out to the open halldoor  the grim old trees looked gaunt and eerie as they waved their naked arms about in the cutting wind  a slight fog had come up from the sea and lay in light wreaths over the upper branches like a thin veil of gauze  ezra was shivering as he surveyed the dreary scene when he felt a hand on his arm and looking round saw that the maid rebecca was standing beside him  havent you got one word for me she said sadly looking up into his face  its but once a week and then never a word of greeting  i didnt see you my lass ezra answered  how does the priory suit you  one place is the same as another to me she said drearily  you asked me to come here and i have come  you said once that you would let me know how i could serve you down here  when am i to know  why theres no secret about that  you do serve me when you look after my father as you have done these weeks back  that old woman isnt fit to manage the whole place by herself  that wasnt what you meant though said the girl looking at him with questioning eyes  i remember your face now as you spoke the words you have something on your mind and have now only you keep it to yourself  why wont you trust me with it  dont be a fool answered ezra curtly  i have a great deal to worry me in business matters  much good it would do telling you about them  its more than that said rebecca doggedly  who is that man who has come down  a business man from london  he has come to consult my father about money matters  any more questions you would like to ask  i should like to know how long we are to be kept down here and what the meaning of it all may be  we are going back before the end of the winter and the meaning of it is that miss harston was not well and needed a change of air  now are you satisfied  he was determined to allay as far as possible any suspicions that the girl might have previously formed  and what brings you down here she asked with the same searching look  you dont come down into this hole without some good reason i did think at first that you might come down in order to see me but you soon showed me that it wasnt that  there was a time when you was fond of me  so i am now lass  ay very fond  not a word nor a look from you last time you came you must have some reason though that brings you here  theres nothing wonderful in a man coming to see his own father  much you cared for him in london she cried with a shrill laugh if he was under the sod you would not be the sadder  its my belief as you come down after that dollfaced missy upstairs  dry up now said ezra roughly  ive had enough of your confounded nonsense  you dont talk in that style to her she said excitedly  you scorn me but i know this that if i cant have your love no one else shall ive got a dash of the gipsy in me as you know  rather than that girl should have you i would knife her and you too  she shook her clenched right hand as she spoke and her face was so full of vindictive passion that ezra was astonished  i always knew that you were a spitfire he said but you never came it quite so strong as this before  the reaction had already come upon her however and tears were running down her cheeks  youll never leave me entirely she cried clasping his arm  i could bear to share your love with another but i wouldnt have you turn altogether against me  youll have my father out presently with your damned noise said ezra get away and wash your face  his word was law to her and she turned away still weeping bitterly in her poor dim eventless life the sole bright spot had been the attention which the young merchant had occasionally shown her  to her distorted fancy he was a man among men a hero all that was admirable and magnificent  what was there which she would not do for him she had the faithfulness of a dog but like a dog she would snarl fiercely at any one who came between her masters affection and herself deep down in her heart rankled the one suspicion which no assurances could remove that an understanding existed between the man she loved and the woman she hated  as she withdrew to her room she determined that during this visit of ezras she would manage in such a way that no communication could pass between them without her knowledge  she knew that it was a dangerous thing to play the spy upon the young man for he had shown her before now that her sex was no precaution against his brutality  nevertheless she set herself to do it with all the cunning and perseverance of a jealous woman  as the light faded and the greys of evening deepened into darkness kate sat patiently in her bare little room  a coal fire sputtered and sparkled in the rusty grate and there was a tin bucket full of coals beside the fender from which to replenish it  she was very cold so she drew her single chair up to the blaze and held her hands over it it was a lonesome and melancholy vigil while the wind whistled through the branches of the trees and moaned drearily in the cracks and crannies of the old house  when were her friends coming  perhaps something had occurred to detain them today  this morning such a thing would have appeared to her to be an impossibility but now that the time had come when she had expected them it appeared probable enough that something might have delayed them  tomorrow at latest they could not fail to come  she wondered what they would do if they did arrive  would they come boldly up the avenue and claim her from the girdlestones or would they endeavour to communicate with her first  whatever they decided upon would be sure to be for the best  she went to the window once and looked out  it promised to be a wild night  far away in the southwest lay a great cumulus of rugged clouds from which dark streamers radiated over the sky like the advance guard of an army  here and there a pale star twinkled dimly out through the rifts but the greater part of the heavens was black and threatening it was so dark that she could no longer see the sea but the crashing booming sound of the great waves filled the air and the salt spray came driving in through the open window  she shut it and resumed her seat by the fire shivering partly from cold and partly from some vague presentiment of evil  an hour or more had passed when she heard a step upon the stairs and a knock came to her door  it was rebecca with a cup of tea upon a tray and some breadandbutter  kate was grateful at this attention for it saved her from having to go down to the diningroom and face ezra and his unpleasantlooking companion   rebecca laid down the tray and then to her mistresss surprise turned back and shut the door the girls face was very pale and her manner was wild and excited  heres a note for you she said  it was given mrs jorrocks to give you but i am better at climbing stairs than  she is so i brought it up  she handed kate a little slip of paper as she spoke  a note for her  could it be that her friends had arrived and had managed to send a message to her  it must be so  she took it from the maid  as she did so she noticed that the others hands were shaking as though she had the ague  you are not well rebecca said kate kindly oh yes i am  you read your note and dont mind me the girl answered in her usual surly fashion  instead of leaving the room she was bustling about the bed as though putting things in order  kates impatience was too great to allow her to wait so she untwisted the paper which had no seal or fastening  she had hoped in her heart to see the name of her lover at the end of it  instead of that her eye fell upon the signature of ezra girdlestone  what could he have to say to her  she moved the solitary candle on to the mantelpiece and read the following note roughly scribbled upon a coarse piece of paper      my dear miss harston      i am afraid your confinement here has been very irksome to you      i have repeatedly requested my father to alleviate or modify it      but he has invariably refused  as he still persists in his      refusal i wish to offer you my aid and to show you that i am      your sincere friend in spite of all that has passed it you could      slip out tonight at nine oclock and meet me by the withered oak      at the head of the avenue i shall see you safe to bedsworth and      you can if you wish go on to portsmouth by the next train      i shall manage so that you may find the door open by that time      i shall not of course go to portsmouth with you but shall return      here after dropping you at the station  i do this small thing to      show you that hopeless as it may be the affection which i bear      you is still as deep as ever       yours      e girdlestone  our heroine was so surprised at this epistle that she sat for some time dangling the slip of paper between her fingers and lost in thought when she glanced round rebecca had left the room  she rolled the paper up and threw it into the fire  ezra then was not so hardhearted as she had thought him  he had used his influence to soften his father should she accept this chance of escape or should she wait some word from her friends  perhaps they were already in bedsworth but did not know how to communicate with her  if so this offer of ezras was just what was needed  in any case she could go on to portsmouth and telegraph from there to the dimsdales  it was too good an offer to be refused  she made up her mind that she would accept it  it was past eight now and nine was the hour  she stood up with the intention of putting on her cloak and her bonnet    chapter xliv   the shadow of death  this conversation with rebecca had suggested to ezra that he might still have influence enough with his fathers ward to induce her to come out of doors and so put herself within the reach of burt  he had proposed the plan to his father who approved of it heartily  the only weak point in his scheme had been the difficulty which might arise in inducing the girl to venture out of the priory on that tempestuous winters night  there was evidently only one incentive strong enough to bring it about and that was the hope of escape  by harping skilfully upon this string they might lure her into the trap  ezra and his father composed the letter together and the former handed it to mrs jorrocks with a request that she should deliver it  it chanced however that rebecca keenly alive to any attempt at communication between the young merchant and her mistress saw the crone hobbling down the passage with the note in her hand  whats that mother she asked  its a letter for her wheezed the old woman nodding her tremulous head in the direction of kates room  ill take it up said rebecca eagerly  i am just going up there with her tea  thank ye  them stairs tries my rheumatiz something cruel  the maid took the note and carried it upstairs  instead of taking it straight to her mistress she slipped into her own room and read every word of it  it appeared to confirm her worst suspicions  here was ezra asking an interview with the woman whom he had assured her that he hated  it was true that the request was made in measured words and on a plausible pretext  no doubt that was merely to deceive any other eye which might rest upon it  there was an understanding between them and this was an assignation  the girl walked swiftly up and down the room like a caged tigress striking her head with her clenched hands in her anger and biting her lip until the blood came  it was some time before she could overcome her agitation sufficiently to deliver the note and when she did so her mistress as we have seen noticed that her manner was nervous and wild  she little dreamed of the struggle which was going on in the darkeyed girls mind against the impulse which urged her to seize her imagined rival by the white throat and choke the life out of her  its eight oclock now ezra was saying downstairs  i wonder whether she will come  she is sure to come his father said briefly  suppose she didnt  in that case we should find other means to bring her out  we have not gone so far to break down over a trifle at the last moment  i must have something to drink ezra said after a pause helping himself from the bottle  i feel as cold as ice and as nervous as a cat  i cant understand how you look so unconcerned  if you were going to sign an invoice or audit an account or anything else in the way of business you could not take it more calmly  i wish the time would come this waiting is terrible  let us pass the time to advantage said john girdlestone and drawing a little fat bible from his pocket he began to read it aloud in a solemn and sonorous voice  the yellow light illuminated the old merchants massive features as he stooped forwards towards the candle his strongly marked nose and his hollow cheeks gave him a vulturelike aspect which was increased by the effect of his deepset glittering eyes  ezra leaning back in his chair with the firelight flickering over his haggard but still handsome face looked across at his father with a puzzled expression  he had never yet been able to determine whether the old man was a consummate hypocrite or a religious monomaniac  burt lay with his feet in the light of the fire and his head sunk back across the arm of the chair fast asleep and snoring loudly  isnt it time to wake him up ezra asked interrupting the reading  yes i think it is his father answered closing the sacred volume reverently and replacing it in his bosom  ezra took up the candle and held it over the sleeping man  what a brute he looks he said  did ever you see such an animal in your life  the navvy was certainly not a pretty sight  his muscular arms and legs were all asprawl and his head hung back at a strange angle to his body so that his fiery red beard pointed upwards exposing all the thick sinewy throat beneath it  his eyes were half open and looked bleared and unhealthy while his thick lips puffed out with a whistling sound at every expiration  his dirty brown coat was thrown open and out of one of the pockets protruded a short thick cudgel with a leaden head  john girdlestone picked it out and tried it in the air  i think i could kill an ox with this he said  dont wave it about my head cried ezra  as you stand in the firelight brandishing that stick in your long arms you are less attractive than usual  john girdlestone smiled and replaced the cudgel in the sleepers pocket wake up burt he cried shaking him by the arm  its halfpast eight  the navvy started to his feet with an oath and then fell back into his chair staring round him vacantly at a loss as to where he might be his eye fell upon the bottle of hollands which was now nearly empty and he held out his hand to it with an exclamation of recognition  ive been asleep guvnor he said hoarsely  must have a dram to set me straight  did you say it was time for the job  we have made arrangements by which she will be out by the withered oak at nine oclock  thats not for half an hour cried burt in a surly voice  you need not have woke me yet  wed better go out there now  she may come rather before the time  come on then said the navvy buttoning up his coat and rolling a ragged cravat round his throat  who is acomin with me  we shall both come answered john girdlestone firmly  you will need help to carry her to the railway line  surely burt can do that himself ezra remarked  shes not so very heavy  girdlestone drew his son aside  dont be so foolish ezra he said we cant trust the halfdrunken fellow  it must be done with the greatest carefulness and precision and no traces left  our old business watchword was to overlook everything ourselves and we shall certainly do so now  its a horrible affair ezra said with a shudder  i wish i was out of it  you wont think that tomorrow morning when you realize that the firm is saved and no one the wiser  he has gone on  dont lose sight of him  they both hurried out and found burt standing in front of the door it was blowing half a gale now and the wind was bitterly cold there came a melancholy rasping and rustling from the leafless wood and every now and again a sharp crackling sound would announce that some rotten branch had come crashing down  the clouds drove across the face of the moon so that at times the cold clear light silvered the dark wood and the old monastery while at others all was plunged in darkness from the open door a broad golden bar was shot across the lawn from the lamp in the hall  the three dark figures with their long fantastic shadows looked eerie and unnatural in the yellow glare  are we to have a lantern asked burt  no no cried ezra  we shall see quite enough as it is  we dont want a light  i have one said the father  we can use it if it is necessary i think we had better take our places now  she may come sooner than we expect  it will be well to leave the door as it is  she will see that there is no obstacle in the way  youre not half sharp enough said ezra  if the door was left like that it might suggest a trap to her  better close the diningroom door and then leave the hall door just a little ajar  that would look more natural  she would conclude that burt and you were in there  where are jorrocks and rebecca girdlestone asked closing the door as suggested  jorrocks is in her room  rebecca i have no doubt is in hers also  things look safe enough  come along burt  this way  the three tramped their way across the gravelled drive and over the slushy grass to the border of the wood  this is the withered oak said girdlestone as a dark mass loomed in front of them  it stood somewhat apart from the other trees and the base of it was free from the brambles which formed a thick undergrowth elsewhere  burt walked round the great trunk and made as careful an examination of the ground as he could in the dark  would the lantern be of any use to you girdlestone asked  no its all serene  i think i know how to fix it now  you two can get behind those trees or where you like as long as youre not in the way  i dont want no sistance  when jem burt takes a job in hand he carries it through in a workmanlike manner  i dont want nobody else foolin around  we would not dream of interfering with your arrangements said girdlestone  youd better not burt growled  ill lay down behind this oak dye see  when she comes shell think as hes not arrived yet and shell get standin around and waitin  when i see my chance ill get behind her and shell never know that she has not been struck by lightnin  excellent cried john girdlestone excellent  we had best get into our places  mind you do it all in one crack ezra said  dont let us have any crying out afterwards  i could stand a good deal but not that  you should know how i hits burt remarked with a malicious grin which was hidden from his companion  if your head wasnt well nigh solid you wouldnt be here now  ezras hand involuntarily went up to the old scar  i think such a one as that would settle her he said as he withdrew with his father the two took up their position under the shadow of some trees fifty yards off or more  burt crouched down behind the withered oak with his weapon in his hand and waited for the coming of his victim  ezra though usually resolute and daring had completely lost his nerve and his teeth were chattering in his head  his father on the other hand was emotionless and impassive as ever  its close upon nine oclock ezra whispered  ten minutes to said the other peering at his great golden chronometer through the darkness  what if she fails to come  we must devise other means of bringing her out  from the spot where they stood they had a view of the whole of the priory  she could not come out without being seen  above the door was a long narrow window which opened upon the staircase  on this girdlestone and his son fixed their eyes for they knew that on her way down she would be visible at it  as they looked the dim light which shone through it was obscured and then reappeared  she has passed  hush  another moment and the door was stealthily opened  once again the broad golden bar shot out across the lawn almost to the spot where the confederates were crouching  in the centre of the zone of light there stood a figurethe figure of the girl  even at that distance they could distinguish the pearlgrey mantle which she usually wore and the closefitting bonnet  she had wrapped a shawl round the lower part of her face to protect her from the boisterous wind  for a minute or more she stood peering out into the darkness of the night as though uncertain whether to proceed or to go back  then with a quick sudden gesture she closed the door behind her  the light was no longer there but they knew that she was outside the house and that the appointment would be kept  what an age it seemed before they heard her footsteps  she came very slowly putting one foot gingerly before the other as if afraid of falling over something in the darkness  once or twice she stopped altogether looking round no doubt to make sure of her whereabouts at that instant the moon shone out from behind a cloud and they saw her dark figure a short distance on  the light enabled her to see the withered oak for she came rapidly towards it  as she approached she satisfied herself apparently that she was the first on the ground for she slackened her pace once more and walked in the listless way that people assume when they are waiting  the clouds were overtaking the moon again and the light was getting dimmer  i can see her still said ezra in a whisper grasping his fathers wrist in his excitement  the old man said nothing but he peered through the darkness with eager straining eyes  there she is standing out a little from the oak the young merchant said pointing with a quivering finger  shes not near enough for him to reach her  hes coming out from the shadow now the other said huskily dont you see him crawling along the ground  i see him returned the other in the same subdued awestruck voice now he has stopped now he goes on again  my god hes close behind her  she is looking the other way  a thin ray of light shot down between the clouds  in its silvery radiance two figures stood out hard and black that of the unconscious girl and of the man who crouched like a beast of prey behind her he made a step forward which brought him within a yard of her  she may have heard the heavy footfall above the shriek of the storm for she turned suddenly and faced him  at the same instance she was struck down with a crashing blow  there was no time for a prayer no time for a scream  one moment had seen her a magnificent woman in all the pride of her youthful beauty the next left her a poor battered senseless wreck the navvy had earned his bloodmoney  at the sound of the blow and the sight of the fall both the old man and the young ran out from their place of concealment  burt was standing over the body his bludgeon in his hand  not even a groan he said  what dye think of that  girdlestone wrung his hand and congratulated him warmly  shall i light the lantern he asked  for gods sake dont ezra said earnestly  i had no idea that you were so fainthearted my son the merchant remarked  however i know the way to the gate well enough to go there blindfold  what a comfort it is to know that there is no blood about thats the advantage of a stick over a knife  youre correct there guvnor burt said approvingly  will you kindly carry one end and ill take the other  ill go first if you dont mind because i know the way best  the train will pass in less than half an hour so we have not long to wait  within that time every chance of detection will have gone  girdlestone raised up the head of the murdered girl and burt took her feet  ezra walked behind as though he were in some dreadful dream he had fully recognized the necessity for the murder but he had never before realized how ghastly the details would be  already he had begun to repent that he had ever acquiesced in it  then came thoughts of the splendid possibilities of the african business which could only be saved from destruction by this womans death  how could he with his luxurious tastes bear the squalor and poverty which would be his lot were the firm to fail  better a rope and a long drop than such a life as that  all these considerations thronged into his mind as he plodded along the slippery footpath which led through the forest to the wooden gate    chapter xlv   the invasion of hampshire  when tom and the major arrived at waterloo station the latter in the breathless condition described in a preceding chapter they found the german waiting for them with his two fellowexiles  the gentleman of nihilistic proclivities was somewhat tall and thin with a long frockcoat buttoned almost up to his throat which showed signs of giving at the seams every here and there  his grizzly hair fell over his collar behind and he had a short bristling beard  he stood with one hand stuck into the front of his coat and the other upon his hip as though rehearsing the position in which his statue might be some day erected in the streets of his native russia when the people had their own and despotism was no more  in spite of his worn attire there was something noble and striking about the man  his bow when baumser introduced him to the major and tom would have graced any court in europe  round his neck he had a coarse string from which hung a pair of double eyeglasses  these he fixed upon his aquiline nose and took a good look at the gentlemen whom he had come to serve  bulow of kiel was a small darkeyed cleanshaven fellow quick and energetic in his movements having more the appearance of a celt than of a teuton  he seemed to be full of amiability and assured the major in execrable english how very happy he was to be able to do a service to one who had shown kindness to their esteemed colleague and persecuted patriot von baumser  indeed both of the men showed great deference to the german and the major began to perceive that his friend was a very exalted individual in socialistic circles  he liked the look of the two foreigners and congratulated himself upon having their cooperation in the matter on hand  ill luck was in store for the expedition however  on inquiry at the ticketoffice they found that there was no train for upwards of two hours and then it was a slow one which would not land them until eight oclock at bedsworth  at this piece of information tom dimsdale fairly broke down and stamped about the station raving and beseeching the officials to run a special be the cost what it might  this however could by no means be done owing to the press of saturday traffic there was nothing for it but to wait  the three foreigners went off in search of something to eat and having found a convenient cookshop they disappeared therein and feasted royally at von baumsers expense major tobias clutterbuck remained with the young man who resolutely refused to leave the platform  the major knew of a snug little corner not far off where he could have put in the time very comfortably but he could not bring himself to desert his companion even for a minute i have no doubt that that wait of two hours in the draughty station is marked up somewhere to the old sinners credit account  indeed it was well that day that young dimsdale had good friends at his back  his appearance was so strange and wild that the passersby turned back to have another look at him his eyes were open and staring giving a fearinspiring character to his expression  he could not sit still for an instant but paced up and down and backwards and forwards under the influence of the fierce energy which consumed him while the major plodded along manfully at his side suggesting every consideration which might cheer him up and narrating many tales true and apocryphal most of which fell upon heedless ears  ezra girdlestone had four hours start of them  that was the thought which rankled in toms heart and outweighed every other consideration he knew kates nature so well that he was convinced that she would never have expressed such fears to mrs scully unless she had very assured reasons for them  in fact apart from her own words what could this secrecy and seclusion mean except foul play  after what he had learned about the insurance of the ships and the manner in which the elder girdlestone had induced him to cease corresponding with kate he could believe anything of his partners  he knew also that in case of kates death the money reverted to her guardian  there was not a single link missing in the chain of evidence which showed that a crime was in contemplation  then who was that butcherlike man whom ezra was taking down with him  tom could have torn his hair as he thought of his present impotence and of his folly in losing sight of young girdlestone  the major has put it on record that those two hours appeared to him the longest that ever he passed in his life and tom no doubt would endorse the sentiment  everything must have an end however and the station clock the hands of which seemed several times to have stopped altogether began at last to approach the hour at which the portsmouth train was timed to depart  baumser and his two friends had come back all three smoking cigarettes and looking the better for their visit to the cookshop  the five got into a firstclass railway carriage and waited  would they never have done examining tickets and stamping luggage and going through all sorts of tedious formalities  at last thank god comes the shrill whistle of the guard the answering snort from the engine and they are fairly started upon their mission of rescue  there was much to be arranged as to their plan of action  tom von baumser and the major talked it over in a low voice while the two socialists chatted together in german and consumed eternal cigarettes tom was for marching straight up to the priory and demanding that girdlestone should deliver his ward up to them  to the major and the german this seemed an unwise proceeding  it was to put themselves hopelessly wrong from a legal point of view  girdlestone had only to say as he assuredly would that the whole story was a ridiculous mares nest and then what proof could they adduce or what excuse give for their interference  however plausible their suspicions might be they were after all only suspicions which other people might not view in as grave a light  what would you advise then  tom asked passing his hand over his heated forehead  bedad ill tell you the plan the old soldier answered and i think me friend von baumser will agray with me  i understand that this place is surrounded by a wall to which there is only one gate  sure we shall wait outside this wall and one of us can go in as a skirmisher and find out how the land lies  let him ascertain from the young lady herself if she requires immadiate help and what she would wish done  if he cant make his way to her let him hang about the house and see and hear all that he can  we shall then have something solid to work on  i have a dog whistle here on me watchchain given me by charley gill of the inniskillens  our skirmisher could take that with him and if he wants immadiate help one blow of it would be enough to bring the four of us over to him  though how the divil i am to git over a wall concluded the major ruefully looking down at his own proportions is more than i can tell  i hope my vriends said von baumser dat you vill allow me the honour of going first for ven i vas in the swabian jager i vas always counted a very good spion  that is my place said tom with decision  you have the best claim the major answered  what a train this is ged its as slow as the one which jimmy travers of the commissariat travelled in in america  they were staming along according to jimmy when they saw a cow walking along the loine in front of them  they all thought that they were going to run into her but it was all right for they never overtook her and she soon walked clane out of sight  here we are at a station  how far to bedsworth guard  next station sir  thank the lord  its twinty to eight  we are rather behind our time you always are if you are in a particular hurry  it was nearly eight oclock by the time they reached their destination the stationmaster directed them to the flying bull where they secured the very vehicle in which kate and her guardian had been originally driven up  by the time that the horse was put in it was close upon the halfhour  drive as hard as you can go to the proiory me man said the major  the sulky ostler made no remark but a look of surprise passed over his phlegmatic countenance  for years back so little had been heard of the old monastery that its very existence had been almost forgotten in bedsworth  now whole troops of londoners were coming down in succession demanding to be driven there  he pondered over the strange fact as he drove through the darkness but the only conclusion to which his bucolic mind could come was that it was high time to raise the fare to that particular point  it was a miserable night stormy and wet and bitterly cold  none of the five men had a thought to spare for the weather however  the two foreigners had been so infected by the suppressed excitement of their companions or had so identified themselves with their comrades cause that they were as eager as the others  are we near the major asked  the gate is just at the end o the lane sir  dont pull up at the gate but take us a little past it  there aint no way in except the gate the driver remarked  do what youre ordered said the major sternly  once again the ostlers face betrayed unbounded astonishment  he slewed halfway round in his seat and took as good a look as was possible in the uncertain light at the faces of his passengers  it had occurred to him that it was more than likely that he would have to swear to them at some future date in a policecourt  id know that thick un wi the red face he muttered to himself and him wi the yeller beard and the stick  they passed the stone pillars with the weatherbeaten heraldic devices and drove along by the high park wall  when they had gone a hundred yards or so the major ordered the driver to pull up and they all got down  the increased fare was paid without remonstrance and the ostler rattled away homewards with the intention of pulling up at the county policestation and lodging information as to the suspicious visitors whom he had brought down  it is loikely that they have a watch at the gate said the major we must kape away from there  this wall is a great hoight  wed best kape on until we find the aisiest place to scale it  i could get over it here tom said eagerly  wait a bit  a few minutes can make no difference one way or the other ould sir colin used to say that there were more battles lost by overhaste than by slowness  whats the high bank running along on the right here  dats a railway bankment said von baumser  see de posts and de little red lights over yonder  so it is  the wall seems to me to be lower here  whats this dark thing  hullo heres a door lading into the grounds  it is locked though  give me a hoist here tom said imploringly  dont throw a minute away  you cant tell what may be going on inside  at this very moment for all we know they may be plotting her murder  he has right said von baumser  we shall await here until we hear from you  help him my vriendsshove him up  tom caught the coping of the wall although the broken glass cut deeply into his hands  with a great heave he swung himself up and was soon astride upon the top  heres the whistle said the major standing on tiptoe to reach a downstretched hand  if you want us give a good blow at it  well be with you in a brace of shakes  if we cant get over the wall well have the door down  divil a fear but well be there  tom was in the act of letting himself drop into the wood when suddenly the watchers below saw him crouch down upon the wall and lie motionless as though listening intently  hush he whispered leaning over  some one is coming through the wood  the wind had died away and the storm subsided  even from the lane they could hear the sound of feet and of muffled voices inside the grounds they all crouched down in the shadow of the wall  tom lay flat upon the glassstudded coping and no one looking from below could distinguish him from the wall itself  the voices and the footsteps sounded louder and louder until they were just at the other side of the boundary  they seemed to come from several people walking slowly and heavily  there was the shrill rasping of a key and the wooden door swung back on its rusty hinges while three dark figures passed out who appeared to bear some burden between them  the party in the shadow crouched closer still and peered through the darkness with eager anxious eyes  they could discern little save the vague outlines of the moving men and yet as they gazed at them an unaccountable and overpowering horror crept into the hearts of every one of them  they breathed the atmosphere of death  the newcomers tramped across the road and pushing through the thin hedge ascended the railway embankment upon the other side  it was evident that their burden was a heavy one for they stopped more than once while ascending the steep grassy slope and once when near the top one of the party slipped and there was a sound as though he had fallen upon his knees together with a stifled oath  they reached the top however and their figures which had disappeared from view came into sight again standing out dimly against the murky sky  they bent down over the railway line and placed the indistinguishable mass which they bore carefully upon it  we must have the light said a voice  no no theres no need another expostulated  we cant work in the dark said a third loudly and harshly wheres your lantern guvnor  ive got a lucifer  we must manage that the train passes over right the first voice remarked  here burt you light it  there was the sharp sound of the striking of a match and a feeble glimmer appeared in the darkness  it flickered and waned as though the wind would extinguish it but next instant the wick of the lantern had caught and threw a strong yellow glare upon the scene  the light fell upon the major and his comrades who had sprung into the road and it lit up the group on the railway line  yet it was not upon the rescuing party that the murderers fixed their terrorstricken eyes and the major and his friends had lost all thought of the miscreants above themfor there standing in the centre of the roadway there with the light flickering over her pale sweet face like a spirit from the tomb stood none other than the muchenduring cruellytreated girl for whom burts murderous blow had been intended  for a few moments she stood there without either party moving a foot or uttering a sound  then there came from the railway line a cry so wild that it will ring for ever in the ears of those who heard it burt dropped upon his knees and put his band over his eyes to keep out the sight  john girdlestone caught his son by the wrist and dashed away into the darkness flying wildly madly with white faces and staring eyes as men who have looked upon that which is not of this world in the meantime tom had sprung down from his perch and had clasped kate in his arms and there she lay sobbing and laughing with many pretty feminine ejaculations and exclamations and questions saved at last from the net of death which had been closing upon her so long    chapter xlvi   a midnight cruise  if ever two men were completely cowed and broken down those two were the african merchants and his son  wet torn and soiled they still struggled on in their aimless flight crashing through hedges and clambering over obstacles with the one idea in their frenzied minds of leaving miles between them and that fair accusing face  exhausted and panting they still battled through the darkness and the storm until they saw the gleam of the surge and heard the crash of the great waves upon the beach  then they stopped amid the sand and the shingle the moon was shining down now in all its calm splendour illuminating the great tossing ocean and the long dark sweep of the hampshire coast by its light the two men looked at one another such a look as two lost souls might have exchanged when they heard the gates of hell first clang behind them  who could have recognized them now as the respected trader of fenchurch street and his fastidious son  their clothes were tattered their faces splashed with mud and scarred by brambles and thorns the elder man had lost his hat and his silvery hair blew out in a confused tangle behind him  even more noticeable however than the change in their attire was the alteration in their expression  both had the same startled furtive look of apprehension like beasts of prey who hear the baying of the hounds in the distance  their quivering hands and gasping breath betrayed their exhaustion yet they glanced around them nervously as though the least sound would send them off once more upon their wild career  you devil ezra cried at last in a harsh choking voice taking a step towards his father with a gesture as though he would have struck him  you have brought us to this with your canting and scheming and plotting  what are we to do noweh  answer me that  he caught the old man by the coat and shook him violently  girdlestones face was all drawn as though he were threatened with a fit and his eyes were glassy and vacant  the moonlight glittered in them and played over his contorted features  did you see her he whispered with trembling lips  did you see her  yes i saw her the other answered brusquely  and i saw that infernal fellow from london and the major and god knows how many more behind her  a nice hornets nest to bring about ones ears  it was her spirit said his father in the same awestruck voice the spirit of john harstons murdered daughter  it was the girl herself said ezra  he had been panicstricken at the moment but had had time during their flight to realize the situation we have made a pretty botch of the whole thing  the girl herself cried girdlestone in bewilderment  for heavens sake dont mock me  who was it that we carried through the wood and laid upon the rails  who was it  why that jealous jade rebecca taylforth of course who must have read my note and come out in the others cloak and hat to hear what i had to say to her  the cursed fool  the wrong woman girdlestone muttered with the same vacant look upon his face  all for nothing thenfor nothing  dont stand mumbling to yourself there cried ezra catching his fathers arm and half dragging him along the beach  dont you understand that theres a hue and cry out after you and that well be hung if we are taken  wake up and exert yourself  the gallows would be a nice end to all your preaching and praying wouldnt it  they hurried along together down the beach ploughing their way through the loose shingle and tripping over the great mats of seaweed which had been cast up in the recent gale  the wind was still so great that they had to lower their heads and to put their shoulders against it while the salt spray caused their eyes to smart and tingled on their lips  where are you taking me my son asked the old man once  to the only chance we have of safety  come on and ask no questions  through the murkiness of the night they saw a single light flickering dimly ahead of them  this was evidently the goal at which ezra was aiming  as they toiled on it grew larger and brighter until it resolved itself into the glare of a lamp shining through a small diamondpaned window  girdlestone recognized the place now  it was the hut of a fisherman named sampson who lived a mile or more from claxton he remembered having his attention attracted to the place by the curious nature of the building which was constructed out of the remnants of a norwegian barque stranded some years before  the thatch which covered it and the windows and door cut in the sides gave it a curiously hybrid appearance and made it an object of interest to sightseers in those parts  sampson was the owner of a fairsized fishingboat which he worked with his eldest son and which was said to yield him a decent livelihood  what are you going to do asked girdlestone as his son made his way to the door  dont look like a ghost ezra answered in an angry whisper were all safe if we are only cool  i am better now  you can trust me  keep a smiling face then said ezra and knocked loudly at the door of the hut  the occupants had not heard their approach owing to the storm but the instant that the young merchant struck the door there was a buzz of conversation and the sharp barking of a dog  then came a dull thud and the barking ceased from which ezra concluded that some one had hurled a boot at the animal  we haint no bait cried a gruff voice  can i see mr sampson asked ezra  i tell ee we haint no bait roared the voice in a more irritable tone  we dont want bait  we want a word of talk said ezra  as he spoke the door flew open and a burly middleaged man in a red shirt appeared with a face which was almost the same colour as his garment  we haint got no he was beginning when he suddenly recognized his visitors and broke short off staring at them with as much surprise as it is possible for human features to express  well if it aint the genelman from the priory he exclaimed at last with a whistle which seemed to be his way of letting off the astonishment which would otherwise remain bottled up in his system  we want a minutes talk with you mr sampson said ezra  surely sirsurely the fisherman cried bustling indoors and rubbing the top of two stools with his sleeve  coom in ere jarge pull the seats up for the genelmen  at this summons a lanky bigboned hobbledehoy in sea boots pushed the stools up towards the fire on which a log of wood was blazing cheerily  the two girdlestones sat warming themselves while the fisherman and his son surveyed them silently with open eyes and mouth as though they were a pair of strange zoological curiosities cast up by the gale  keep doon sammy the fisherman said hoarsely to a great collie dog who was licking at girdlestones hands  what be he a suckin at why sure sir there be blood on your hands  my father scratched himself said ezra promptly  his hat has blown away too and we lost our way in the dark so were rather in a mess  why so you be sampson cried eyeing them up and down  i thought when i heard you as it was they folk from claxton as comes ere for bait whenever they be short  thats nigh about the only visitors we ever gets here beant it jarge  george thus appealed to made no articulate reply but he opened his great mouth and laughed vociferously  weve come for something which will pay you better than that said ezra  you remember my meeting you two or three saturdays ago and speaking to you about your house and your boat and one thing or another  the fisherman nodded  you said something then about your boat being a good seagoing craft and that it was as roomy as many a yacht  i think i told you that i might give it a try some day  the fisherman nodded again  his wondering eyes were still surveying his visitors dwelling on every rent in their clothes or stain on their persons  my father and i want to get down the coast as far as the downs  now we thought that we might just as well give your boat a turn and have your son and yourself to work it  i suppose she is fit to go that distance  fit whoy she be fit to go to meriky  the downs aint moren hunder and twenty mile  with a good breeze she would do it in a day by tomorrow afternoon wed be ready to make a start if the wind slackens  tomorrow afternoon  we must be there by that time  we want you to start tonight  the seaman looked round at his son and the boy burst out laughing once again  it ud be a rum start for a vyage at this time o night with half a gale from the souwest i never heard tell o sich a thing  look here said ezra bending forward and emphasizing his words with his uplifted hand weve set our minds on going and we dont mind paying for the fancy  the sooner we start the better pleased we shall be  name your price  if you wont take us there are many in claxton that will  well it be a cruel bad night to be sure the fisherman answered like as not wed get the boat knocked about an maybe have her riggin damaged  weve been afresh paintin of her too and that would be spoiled  its a powerful long way and then theres the gettin back it means the loss of two or three days work and theres plenty of fish on the coast now and a good market for them  would thirty pounds pay you asked ezra  the sum was considerably more than the fisherman would have ventured to ask  the very magnificence of it however encouraged him to hope that more might be forthcoming  fiveandthirty wouldnt pay me for the loss and trouble he said forbye the damage to the boat  say forty then said ezra  its rather much to pay for a freak of this sort but we wont haggle over a pound or two  the old seaman scratched his head as though uncertain whether to take this blessing which the gods had sent or to hold out for more  ezra solved the matter by springing to his feet  come on to claxton father he cried  well get what we want there  steady sir steady the fisherman said hastily  i didnt say as i wasnt good for the job  im ready to start for the sum you names hurry up jarge and get the tackle ready  the seabooted youth began to bustle about at this summons bearing things out into the darkness and running back for more with an alacrity which one would hardly have suspected from his uncouth appearance  can i wash my hands asked girdlestone  there were several crimson stains where he had held the body of the murdered girl  it appeared that burts bludgeon was not such a bloodless weapon after all  theres water sir in that bucket  maybe you would like a bit o plaster to bind up the cut  its not bad enough for that said the merchant hastily  ill leave you here the fisherman remarked  theres much to be done down theer  youll have poor feedin im afraid biscuits and water and bully beef  never mind that  hurry up all you can  the man tramped away down to the beach and ezra remained with his father in the hut  the old man washed his hands very carefully and poured the stained water away outside the door  how are you going to pay this man he asked  i have some money sewed up in my waistcoat ezra answered  i wasnt such a fool as not to know that a crash might come at any moment  i was determined that all should not go to the creditors  how much have you  whats that to you ezra asked angrily  you mind your own affairs the moneys mine since i have saved it  its quite enough if i spend part of it in helping you away  i dont dispute it my boy the old merchant said meekly  its a blessing that you had the foresight to secure it   are you thinking of making for france now  france  pshaw man the telegraph would have set every gendarme on the coast on the lookout  no no that would be a poor hope of safety  where then  where is the fisherman asked ezra suspiciously peering out from the door into the darkness  no one must know our destination  well pick up miggs ship the black eagle in the downs  she was to have gone down the thames today and to lie at gravesend and then to work round to the downs where she will be tomorrow  it will be a sunday so no news can get about  if we get away with him they will lose all trace of us  well get him to land up upon the spanish coast  i think it will fairly puzzle the police  no doubt they are watching every station on the line by this time  i wonder what has become of burt  i trust that they will hang him john girdlestone cried with a gleam of his old energy  if he had taken the ordinary precaution of making sure who the girl was this would never have occurred  dont throw the blame on him said ezra bitterly  who was it who kept us all up to it whenever we wished to back out  if it had not been for you who would have thought of it  i acted for the best cried the old man throwing his hands up with a piteous gesture  you should be the last to upbraid me  it was the dream of leaving you rich and honoured which drove me on  i was prepared to do anything for that end  you have always excellent intentions his son said callously they have a queer way of showing themselves however  look out heres sampson  as he spoke they heard the crunching of the fishermans heavy boots on the shingle and he looked in with his ruddy face all shining with the salt water  were all ready now sirs he said  jarge and i will get into our oil duds and then we can lock up the shop  itll have to take care of itself until we come back  the two gentlemen walked down to the edge of the sea  there was a little dinghy there and the boat was anchored a couple of hundred yards off  they could just make out the loom of her through the darkness and see her shadowy spars dipping rising and falling with the wash of the waves  to right and left spread the long white line of thundering foam as though the ocean were some great beast of prey which was gnashing its glistening teeth at them  the gale had partially died away but there still came fitful gusts from the southwest and the thick clouds overhead were sweeping in a majestic procession across the sky and falling like a dark cataract over the horizon showing that up there at least there was no lull in the tempest  it was bitterly cold and both men buttoned up their coats and slapped their hands against each other to preserve their warmth  after some little delay sampson and his son came down from the hut with a lantern in each of their hands  they had locked the door behind them which showed that they were ready for a final start  by the lights which they carried it could be seen that they were dressed in yellow suits of oilskin and souwester hats as if prepared for a wet night  you aint half dressed for a cruise of this kind sampson said youll be nigh soaked through i fear  thats our lookout answered ezra  let us get off  step in sir and well get in after  the dinghy was shoved off into the surf and the two seamen clambered in after  ezra and his father sat in the sheets while the others rowed the sea was running very highso high that when the dinghy lay in the trough of a wave they could see neither the boat for which they were steering nor the shore which they had leftnothing indeed but the black line of hissing water above their heads  at times they would go up until they hung on the crest of a great roller and saw the dark valleys gaping beyond into which they were forthwith precipitated  sometimes when they were high upon a wave the fishingboat would be between the seas and then there would be nothing of her visible except the upper portion of her mast  it was only a couple of hundred yards but seemed a long journey to the shivering fugitives  stand by with the boathook sampson cried at last  the dark outline of the boat was looming immediately above them  all right father  the dinghy was held alongside and the two gentlemen scrambled aboard as best they could followed by their companions  have you the painter jarge  ay ay  make it fast aft then  the lad fastened the rope which held the dinghy to a stanchion beside the tiller  then he and his father proceeded to hoist the foresail so as to get the boats head round  shell do now sampson cried  give us a hand here sir if you dont mind  ezra caught hold of the rope which was handed him and pulled for some time  it was a relief to him to have something however small which would distract his mind from the events of the night  that will do sir the skipper cried and leaning over the bows he seized the anchor which ezra had hauled up and tumbled it with a crash on the deck  now jarge with three reefs in her we might give her the mainsle  with much pulling at ropes and with many strange nautical cries the father and the son aided by their passengers succeeded in raising the great brown sail  the little vessel lay over under the pressure of the wind until her lee bulwark was flush with the water and the deck lay at such an angle that it was only by holding on to the weather rigging that the two gentlemen could retain their footing  the wild waves swirled and foamed round her bows and beat at her quarter and beneath her counter but the little boat rose gallantly to them and shot away through the storm running due eastward  it aint much of a cabin sampson said apologetically  such as it is youll find it down there  thank you answered ezra well stay on deck at present  when ought we to get to the downs  at this rate well be there by tomorrow afternoon  thank you  the fisherman and his boy took turn and turn one steering and the other keeping a lookout forward and trimming the sails  the two passengers crouched huddled together against the weather rail  they were each too occupied with thought to have time for speech  suddenly after passing claxton and rounding the point they came in full sight of the priory every window of which was blazing with light  they could see dark figures passing to and fro against the glare  look there girdlestone whispered  ay the police have not taken long his son answered john girdlestone was silent for some time  then he suddenly dropped his face upon his hands and sobbed hoarsely for the first and last time in his career  i am thinking of monday in fenchurch street he said  my god is this the end of a life of hard work  oh my business my business that i built up myself  it will break my heart  and so through the long cold winters night they sat together while the boat ploughed its way down the english channel  who shall say what their thoughts were as they stared with pale rigid faces into the darkness while their minds perhaps peered even more cheerlessly into the dismal obscurity which lay over their future  better be the lifeless wreck whom they have carried up to the priory than be torn as these men are torn by the demons of fear and remorse and grief and crushed down by the weight of a sinstained and irrevocable past    chapter xlvii   law and order  the ruffian burt was so horrorstricken at the sight of the girl whom he imagined that he had murdered that he lay grovelling on the railway lines by the side of his victim moaning with terror and incapable of any resistance  he was promptly seized by the majors party and the nihilist secured his hands with a handkerchief so quickly and effectively that it was clearly not the first time that he had performed the feat  he then calmly drew a very long and bright knife from the recesses of his frockcoat and having pressed it against burts nose to ensure his attention he brandished it in front of him in a menacing way as a hint that an attempt at escape might be dangerous  and who is dis asked baumser lifting up the dead womans head and resting it upon his knee  poor girl  she will niver spake again whoever she may have been the major said holding the lantern to her cold pale face  heres where the cowards struck her  death must have been instantaneous and painless  i could have sworn it was the young lady we came afther if it were not that we have her safe down there thank the lord  vere are those oders asked von baumser peering about through the darkness  if dere is justice in de country dey vill hang for the work of dis night  they are off the major answered laying the girls head reverently down again  its hopeless to follow them as we know nothing of the counthry nor which direction they took  they ran like madmen hullo  what the divil can this be  the sight which had attracted the veterans attention was nothing less than the appearance at the end of the lane of three brilliant luminous discs moving along abreast of one another  they came rapidly nearer increasing in brilliancy as they approached  then a voice rang out of the darkness there they are officers  close with them  dont let em get away  and before the major and his party could quite grasp the situation they were valiantly charged by three of those muchenduring stouthearted mortals known as the british police force  it takes courage to plunge into the boiling surf and to carry the rope to the breaking vessel  it takes courage to spring from the ships side and support the struggling swimmer never knowing the moment at which a flickering shadow may appear in the deep green water and the tiger of the deep turn its white belly upwards as it dashes on its prey there is courage too in the infantryman who takes a sturdy grip of his rifle and plants his feet firmly as he sees the lancers sweeping down on his comrades and himself  but of all these types of bravery there is none that can compare with that of our homely constable when he finds on the dark november nights that a door on his beat is ajar and listening below learns that the time has come to show the manhood that is in him he must fight odds in the dark  he must singlehanded cage up desperate men like rats in a hole  he must oppose his simple weapon to the sixshooter and the lifepreserver  all these thoughts and the remembrance of his wife and children at home and of how easy it would be not to observe the open door come upon him and then what does he do  why with the thought of duty in his heart and his little cudgel in his hand he goes to what is too often his death like a valiant highminded englishman who fears the reproach of his own conscience more than pistol bullet or bludgeon stroke  which digression may serve to emphasize the fact that these three burly hampshire policemen having been placed upon our friends track by the ostler of the flying bull and having themselves observed manoeuvres which could only be characterized as suspicious charged down with such vehemence that in less time than it takes to tell it both tom and the major and von baumser were in safe custody  the nihilist who had an unextinguishable hatred of the law and who could never be brought to understand that it might under any circumstances be on his side pulled himself very straight and held his knife down at his hip as though he meant to use it while bulow of kiel likewise assumed an aggressive attitude  fortunately however the appearance of their prisoners and a few hurried words from the major made the inspector in charge understand how the land lay and he transferred his attention to burt on whose wrists he placed the handcuffs  he then listened to a more detailed account of the circumstances from the lips of the major  who is this young lady he asked pointing to kate  this is the miss harston whom we came to rescue and for whom no doubt the blow was intended which killed this unhappy girl  perhaps sir said the inspector to tom you had better take her up to the house  thank you said tom and went off through the wood with kate upon his arm  on their way she told him how being unable to find her bonnet and cloak which rebecca had abstracted she had determined to keep her appointment without them  her delay rendered her a little late however but on reaching the withered oak she heard voices and steps in front of her which she had followed  these had led her to the open gate and the lighting of the lantern had revealed her to friends and foes  ere she concluded her story tom noticed that she leaned more and more heavily upon him until by the time that they reached the priory he was obliged to lift her up and carry her to prevent her from falling the hardships of the last few weeks and this final terrible and yet most joyful incident of all had broken down her strength  he bore her into the house and laying her by the fire in the diningroom watched tenderly over her and exhausted his humble stock of medical knowledge in devising remedies for her condition  in the meantime the inspector having thoroughly grasped the majors lucid narrative was taking prompt and energetic measures  you go down to the station constable jones he ordered  wire to london john girdlestone aged sixtyone and his son aged twentyeight wanted for murder  address eccleston square and fenchurch street city  send a description of them  father six feet one inch in height hatchetfaced grey hair and whiskers deepset eyes heavy brows round shoulders  son five feet ten darkfaced black eyes black curly hair strongly made legs rather bandy well dressed usually wears a dogs head scarfpin that ought to do  yes thats near enough observed the major  wire to every station along the line to be on the lookout  send a description to the chief constable of portsmouth and have a watch kept on the shipping  that should catch them  it vill cried von baumser confidentially  ill bet money dat it vill  it was as well that the germans sporting offer found no takers otherwise our good friend would have been a poorer man  let us carry the poor soul up to the house the inspector continued after making careful examination of the ground all round the body  the party assisted in raising the girl up and in carrying her back along the path by which she had been brought  burt tramped stolidly along behind with the remaining policeman beside him  the nihilist brought up the rear with his keen eye fixed upon the navvy and his knife still ready for use  when they reached the priory the prisoner was safely locked away in one of the numerous empty rooms while rebecca was carried upstairs and laid upon the very bed which had been hers  we must search the house the inspector said and mrs jorrocks having been brought out of her room and having forthwith fainted and been revived again was ordered to accompany the police in their investigation which she did in a very dazed and stupefied manner indeed not a word could be got from her until entering the diningroom she perceived her bottle of hollands upon the table on which she raised up her voice and cursed the whole company from the inspector downwards with the shrillest volubility of invective having satisfied her soul in this manner she wound up by a perfect shriek of profanity and breaking away from her guardians she regained the shelter of her room and locked herself up there after which they could hear by the drumming of her heels that she went into a violent hysterical attack upon the floor  kate had however recovered sufficiently to be able to show the police the different rooms and to explain to them which was which the inspector examined the scanty furniture of kates apartment with great interest  you say you have been living here for three weeks he said  nearly a month kate answered  god help you  no wonder you look pale and ill  you have a fine prospect from the window  he drew the blind aside and looked out into the darkness  a gleam of moonlight lay upon the heaving ocean and in the centre of this silver streak was a single brownsailed fishingboat running to the eastward before the wind  the inspectors keen eye rested upon it for an instant and then he dropped the blind and turned away  it never flashed across his mind that the men whom he was hunting down could have chosen that means of escape and were already beyond his reach  he examined very carefully the rooms of ezra and of his father both had been furnished comfortably if not solidly with spring mattresses to their beds and carpets upon the floor  the young mans room had little in it beyond the mere furniture which was natural as his visits were so short  in the merchants chamber however were many books and papers  on the little square table was a long slip of foolscap covered with complex figures  it appeared to be a statement of his affairs in which he had been computing the liabilities of the firm by the side of it was a small calfbound diary  the inspector glanced over one of the pages and uttered an exclamation of disgust  here are some pretty entries he cried  feel the workings of grace within me  prayed that i might be given a livelier interest in the holy scriptures  the books full of that sort of thing he added turning over the leaves  the fellow seems to have played the hypocrite even with himself for he could never have known that other eyes would rest upon this  derell be some queer company among de elect if he is dere von baumser remarked  whats all this asked the inspector tumbling a heap of clothes out of the corner with his foot  why heres a monks dress  kate sprang forward at the words  then i did see him she cried i had almost persuaded myself that it was a dream  what was that  kate told her story as well as she could and the inspector made notes of it  the crafty old dog he cried  no doubt he could reconcile it with his conscience more easily to frighten you to death than to actually kill you  he told you that cockandabull story to excite your imagination and then feeling sure that you would sooner or later try and escape by night he kept guard in this rig  the only wonder is that he didnt succeed in either killing you or driving you mad with fright  never mind now dear tom whispered as he saw the look of fear spring into her eyes at the recollection of what had passed  dont think of these terrible things  you will soon be safe in phillimore gardens in my mothers arms  in the meanwhile i think you would be the better for some sleep  i think i should tom  are you afraid to sleep in your own room  no i am afraid of nothing now that i know you are near me  i knew so well that you would come  i have been expecting you all the evening  i can never thank my good friends here enough for the help which they have given me tom exclaimed turning to his companions  it is i who should thank them said kate earnestly i have found friends indeed  who can say now that the days of chivalry are past  me dear young lady the major answered bowing with all the innate grace of an irish gentleman ye have warmed us by what ye say i personally was as ye know under orders which left me no choice but to come  i hope however that ye will believe that had mrs scully not occupied the place in me affections which she does i should still be as prompt as me friends here to hasten to the rescue of a lady tobias clutterbuck may be ould miss harston but his heart will niver grow so hardened but that it will milt at the thought of beauty in distriss  with this beautiful sentiment the major placed his fat hand over his heart and bowed again even more gracefully than before the three foreigners behind made no remark but they all stood in a line grinning in a most amicable fashion and nodding their heads as if to intimate that the major was expressing their united sentiments to a nicety  kates last recollection of that eventful evening was the smiling visages of von baumser bulow and the nameless russian as they beamed their good night at her    chapter xlviii   captain hamilton miggs sees a vision  ezra girdlestone had given many indications during his life both in africa and elsewhere of being possessed of the power of grasping a situation and of acting for the best at the shortest notice  he never showed this quality more conclusively than at that terrible moment when he realized not only that the crime in which he bad participated had failed but that all was discovered and that his father and he were hunted criminals  with the same intuitive quickness which made him a brilliant man of business he saw instantly what were the only available means of escape and proceeded at once to adopt them  if they could but reach the vessel of captain hamilton miggs they might defy the pursuit of the law  the black eagle had dropped down the thames on the very saturday which was so fruitful of eventful episodes  miggs would lie at gravesend and intended afterwards to beat round to the downs there to await the final instructions of the firm  if they could catch him before he left there was very little chance that he would know anything of what had occurred it was a fortunate chance that the next day was sunday and there would be no morning paper to enlighten him as to the doings in hampshire they had only to invent some plausible excuse for their wish to accompany him and get him to drop them upon the spanish coast  once out of sight of england and on the broad ocean what detective could follow their track  of course upon sampsons return all would come out  ezra reckoned however that it would be some time before the fisherman got back from his journey  what was a favourable wind going would be dead in his teeth coming back  it might take him a weeks tacking and beating about before he got home  by that time ezra hoped to be beyond the reach of all danger  he had a thousand five pound bank of england notes sewn into the back of his waistcoat for knowing that a crash might come at any moment he had long made provision against it  with this he felt that he could begin life again in the new world and with his youth and energy he might hope to attain success  as to his father he was fully determined to abandon him completely at the first opportunity  through the whole of that wintry night the fishingboat scudded away to the eastward and the two fugitives remained upon deck drenched through with rain and with spray but feeling that the wild turmoil around them was welcome as a relief to their own thoughts  better the cutting wind and the angry sea than the thought of the dead girl upon the rails and of the bloodhounds of the law  ezra pointed up once at the moon on whose face two storm wreaths had marked a rectangular device  look at that he cried  it looks like a gallows  what is there to live for said his father looking up with the cold light glittering on his deepset eyes  not much for you perhaps his son retorted  youve had your fling but i am young and have not yet had a fair show  i have no fancy to be scragged yet  poor lad the father muttered poor lad  they havent caught me yet said ezra  if they did i question whether they could do much  they couldnt hang three for the death of one  you would have to swing and thats about all  about two in the morning they saw a line of lights which the fisherman informed them was from the town of worthing  again before daybreak they scudded past another and far brighter and larger area of twinkling points which marked the position of brighton  they were nearly halfway upon their journey already  as the dawn approached the dark stormclouds gathered away to the northern horizon and lay in a great shadow over the coast  on all other points the sky was clear save that here and there a single puff of white vapour sailed along like the feather of some gigantic bird floating in the ocean of air these isolated clouds which had been pearly grey in the dim light of early day gradually took a lilac tint which deepened into pink and then blushed suddenly to a fiery scarlet as the red rim of the sun rose majestically over the horizon  all the heaven was filled with colour from the palest lightest blue at the zenith to the most brilliant crimson in the east as though it were natures palette on which she had dashed every tint that she possessed  the sea reflected the rich glow and the tossing waves were gashed with scarlet streaks  it looks like a sea of blood the merchant remarked with a shudder as he gazed at the wonderful spectacle  by the returning light the two fugitives were able to notice each others appearance  both were pale haggard dishevelled with bloodshot darkrimmed eyes and anxious weary faces  this wont do remarked ezra  if miggs sees us like this hell smell a rat  he dipped a bucket overboard and after some search a small piece of soap and a broken comb were extracted from one of the lockers with these materials they managed to perform their toilets they rearranged and cleaned each others clothing too and ezra purchased a yachtingcap from sampson for his father the jaunty nature of which contrasted strangely with the old mans grim angular visage  theres a fine view sampson observed pointing towards the land just as his two passengers had finished their toilet  they were passing a high range of cliffs which ran along for a great distance  some were of chalk and others were brownish as though consisting of some sort of earth  there was one which terminated the line towering up above the rest and as remarkable for the boldness of its outline as for its height  a lighthouse stood upon the summit and the whole showed up so clearly in the bright morning air that the fugitives could see the green grass round the house and the coastguardsman at the signal station who was strolling leisurely about and looking down from his elevation at their little craft  to the eastward of this chalk promontory was a large finelooking town which stretched in a wide semicircle round the shores of a curving bay  thats beachy head said sampson pointing at the cliff  its the hoiest pint down channel and they have a lookout place up there to report ships as pass  it was a muster lloyd as put it up  i doant know who he be that same muster lloyd but he do seem to take a powerful deal of interest in everythink which has to do wi shipping hes an admiral belike or something o the sort  neither of the girdlestones appeared inclined to enlighten him upon the point  whats the town asked ezra  eastbourne the fisherman answered shortly and lounged away into the bows while his son remained at the tiller  the two fugitives had their breakfast but as it consisted of nothing more appetising than tinned cornedbeef and ships biscuits and as neither of them had much inclination for food it was not a very lengthy meal  then they sat in the sheets once more watching the grand panorama of green woodland and swelling down and towering cliff which passed before them on the one side while on the other the great ocean highway was dotted with every variety of vessel from the portland ketch or the sunderland brig with its cargo of coals to the majestic fourmasted liner which swept past with the green waves swirling round her forefoot and breaking away into a fork of eddying waters in her wake  ezra cautioned his father to sit down for he observed a row of curious faces gazing at them over the quarter of one great vessel  our dress isnt quite what you would expect to see in a fishingboat he said  there is no use setting tongues wagging  there was still a fresh breeze and the little boat continued to fly before it at the rate of six or eight knots  this wind is a lucky chance ezra remarked rather to himself than to his companion  it is the working of providence answered john girdlestone with an earnestness which showed that his mind still retained its habitual peculiarity  by ten oclock they were abreast of the long stone terraces of hastings at halfpast eleven they saw the masts of the fishingsmacks of winchelsea  by one they were rounding the sharp bold promontory of dungeness  they kept further to sea after that so that the long white wall and the spires of folkestone and of dover lay far on the horizon on the other side a dim haze upon the blue water marked the position of the french coast  it was nearly five and the sun was beginning to sink down again in the west when the fisherman after gazing steadily ahead for some time with his horny hand shading his eyes touched ezra on the sleeve  see them breakers over there he said pointing over the starboard bow  far away ezra could see a long roll of foam breaking the monotony of the broad stretch of ocean  thems the goodwins he went on and them craft ahead is at anchor in the downs  the vessels in question were miles away but ezra brightened up at the sight of their destination and he once again arranged his toilet and that of his father  thank goodness he muttered with a long sigh of relief as he peered at the ships which were growing clearer and larger every moment that outer one is the black eagle or i am much mistaken  hes not gone yet  that is the black eagle his father said with confidence  i know her by the cut of her stern and the rake of her masts  as they came nearer still any lingering doubt was finally dispelled  theres the white paint line said ezra  its certainly her take us alongside that ship which is lying to the outside there sampson  the fisherman looked ahead once more  to the barque which has just got her anchor up he said  why we wont be in time to catch her  her anchor up screamed ezra  you dont mean to tell me shes off  look at that the man answered  as he spoke they saw first one great square of canvas appear above the vessel and then another until she had spread her white wings to their fullest extent  dont say we cant catch her cried ezra with a furious oath i tell you man that we must catch her  everything depends on that  she must take three short tacks before shes out from the goodwins if we run right on as we are going we may get near her before shes free  for gods sake clap on all the sail you can  get these reefs out with trembling fingers ezra let out the sail and the boat lay over further under the increased pressure  is there no other sail that we could put up  if we were running we could rig up a spinnaker the fisherman answered but the wind has come round three points  we can do no more  i think we are catching her john girdlestone cried keeping his eyes fixed upon the barque which was about a mile and a half ahead  yes we are now but she haint got her way on yet  shell draw ahead presently wont she jarge  the fishermans son nodded and burst into hoarse merriment its bettern a race he cried  with our necks for a prize ezra muttered to himself  its a little too exciting to be pleasant  we are still gaining  they had a clear view of the dark hull and towering canvas of the barque as she swept along in front of them intending evidently to take advantage of the wind in order to get outside the goodwins before beating up channel  shes going about sampson remarked  as he spoke the snowwhite pile lay over in the opposite direction and the whole broadside of the vessel became visible to them every sail standing out as though carved from ivory against the cold blue sky  if we dont catch her on this tack we wont get her at all the fisherman observed  when they put about next theyll reach right out into the channel  wheres something white said ezra excitedly  he dived into the cabin and reappeared with a dirty tablecloth  stand up here father now keep on waving it  they may see you  i think as we are overhaulin of them remarked the boy  were doing that his father answered  the question is will we get near enough to stop em afore they gets off on the next tack  the old merchant was standing in the bows waving the signal in the air his son sprang up beside him and flourished his handkerchief they dont look more than half a mile off  let us shout together the two blended their voices in a hoarse roar which was taken up by the boatman and his son  once again cried ezra and again their shout resounded over the seaa longdrawn cry it was with a ring of despair and of sorrow  still the barque kept steadily on her way  if they dont go about we shall catch them the fisherman said if they keep on another five minutes we are right  do you hear that ezra cried to his father and they both shouted with new energy and waved their signals  theyre goin about george burst in  its all up girdlestone groaned as he saw the mainyard swing back  they all strained their eyes waiting for the other to follow  it remained stationary  they have seen us cried the fisherman  they are waitin to pick us up  then we are saved said ezra stepping down and wiping the perspiration which poured from his forehead  go down into the cabin father and put yourself straight  you look like a ghost  captain hamilton miggs had found the liquor of the cock and cowslip so very much to his taste in spite of its vitriolic peculiarities recorded in a preceding chapter that he rejoined his ship in a very shaky and demoralized condition  he was a devout believer in the homoeopathic revelation that like may be cured by like so he forthwith proceeded to set himself straight by the consumption of an unlimited quantity of ships rum  whats the good of having a pilot aboard if i am to keep sober he hiccoughed to his mate mcpherson  after which piece of logic he shut himself up in his cabin and roared comic songs all the way from london to gravesend  he was so exhausted by his performance that he fell fast asleep and snored stertorously for fifteen hours at the end of which time he came on deck and found that the black eagle was lying off deal and that her anchor was just being hoisted for a start up channel  captain hamilton miggs watched the sailsetting with his hands in his pockets and swore promiscuously at every one from the mate downwards in a hearty comprehensive way which showed a mind that was superior to petty distinctions  having run over all the oaths that he could think of he dived below and helped himself from the rum bottle a process which appeared to aid his memory or his invention for he reappeared upon deck and evolved a new manyjointed expletive at the man at the wheel  he then strode in gloomy majesty up and down the quarterdeck casting his eyes at the sails and at the clouds in a critical way calculated to impress the crew generally with a sense of their captains extraordinary sagacity  the blank eagle had gone about for the second time and was just about to free herself from the goodwins and reach out into the channel when miggs eye happened to fall upon the fishing boat in pursuit and the white flutter in her bows  he examined her with his glass steadying it as well as he could by leaning it across the rail as his hand was very shaky  after a short inspection a look of astonishment followed by one of resignation stole over his features  ive got them again mac he remarked to the mate  got what sir  the diddleums the jumps the visions  its the change of air as has done it  you look all right remarked the mate in a sympathetic voice  so i may but ive got em  its usually ratsrats and sometimes cockroaches but its worse than that this time  as im a livin man i looked through the glass at that fishingboat astern of us and i saw young muster ezra girdlestone in it and the old boss standin up wi a yachtincap at the side of his head and waving a towel  this is the smartest bout that ever i have had  ill take some of the medicine left from my last touch and ill turn in  he vanished down the companion and having taken a strong dose of bromide of potassium tumbled into his bunk cursing loudly at his ill luck  the astonishment of mcpherson upon deck was as great as that of captain miggs when on looking through the glass he ascertained beyond all doubt that both of his employers were in the fishingboat  he at once ordered the mainyard to be hauled back and awaited their arrival  in a few minutes the boat was alongside a ladder thrown down and the two girdlestones were on the deck of their own ship  wheres the captain asked the head of the firm  hes below sir  hes no very salubrious the mates love of long words rose superior to any personal emotion  you can square the yard said ezra  we are going with you  ay ay sir  square away that yard there  it swung round into position and the black eagle resumed her voyage  there is some business to be looked after in spain girdlestone remarked to mcpherson  it came up suddenly or we should have given you notice  it was absolutely necessary that we should be there personally it was more convenient to go in our own vessel than to wait for a passenger ship  where will you sleep sir asked the mate  i doubt the accommodations no very munificent  there are two settees in the cabin  we can do on them very well i think we cant do better than go down there at once for we have had a long and tiring journey  after they had disappeared into the cabin mcpherson trod the deck for the remainder of his watch with a grave and a thoughtful face  like most of his countrymen he was shrewd and longheaded  it struck him that it was a very strange thing for the two partners to be absent at the same time from their business  again where was their luggage grave misgivings arose in his mind as to the reason of it all  he kept them to himself however and contented himself with remarking to the carpenter that in all his experience he had never met with a more monumentous episode    chapter xlix   a voyage in a coffin ship  the early part of the voyage of the black eagle was extremely fortunate  the wind came round to the eastward and wafted them steadily down channel until on the third day they saw the isle of ushant lying low upon the skyline  no inquisitive gunboat or lurking police launch came within sight of them though whenever any vessels course brought her in their direction the heart of ezra girdlestone sank within him  on one occasion a small brig signalled to them and the wretched fugitives when they saw the flags run up thought that all was lost  it proved however to be merely some trivial message and the two owners breathed again  the wind fell away on the day that they cleared the channel and the whole surface of the sea was like a great expanse of quicksilver which shimmered in the rays of the wintry sun  there was still a considerable swell after the recent gale and the black eagle lay rolling about as though she had learned habits of inebriation from her skipper  the sky was very clear above but all round the horizon a low haze lay upon the water   so silent was it that the creaking of the boats as they swung at the davits and the straining of the shrouds as the ship rolled sounded loud and clear as did the raucous cries of a couple of gulls which hovered round the poop  every now and then a rumbling noise ending in a thud down below showed that the swing of the ship had caused something to come down with a run  underlying all other sounds however was a muffled clank clank which might almost make one forget that this was a sailing ship it sounded so like the chipping of a propeller  what is that noise captain miggs asked john girdlestone as he stood leaning over the quarter rail while the old seadog sextant in hand was taking his  midday observations  the captain had been on his good behaviour since the unexpected advent of his employers and he was now in a wonderful and unprecedented state of  sobriety  thems the pumps agoin miggs answered packing his sextant away in its case  the pumps  i thought they were only used when a ship was in danger  ezra came along the deck at this moment and listened with interest to the conversation  this ship is in danger miggs remarked calmly  in danger cried ezra looking round the clear sky and placid sea where is the danger  i did not think you were such an old woman miggs  we will see about that the seaman answered angrily  if a ships got no bottom in her shes bound to be in danger be the weather fair or foul  do you mean to tell me this ship has no bottom  i mean to tell you that there are places where you could put your fingers through her seams  its only the pumpin that keeps her afloat  this is a pretty state of things said girdlestone  how is it that i have not been informed of it before  it is most dangerous  informed cried miggs  informed of it  has there been a vyage yet that i havent come to ye muster girdlestone and told ye i was surprised ever to find myself back in lunnon  a year agone i told ye how this ship was and ye laughed at me ye did  its only when ye find yourselves on her in the middle o the broad sea that ye understan what it is that sailor folk have to put up wi  girdlestone was about to make some angry reply to this address but his son put his hand on his arm to restrain him  it would never do to quarrel with hamilton miggs before they reached their port of refuge they were too completely in his power  what the captain says has a great deal of truth in it he remarked with a laugh  you dont realize a thing until youve had to experience it  the black eagle shall certainly have an overhauling next time and well see if we cant give her captain an increase at the same time  miggs gave a grunt which might be taken as expressing thanks or as signifying doubt  perhaps there was a mixture of both in his mind  i presume girdlestone said in a conciliatory voice that there would be no real danger as long as the weather was fine  it wont be fine long the captain answered gruffly  the glass was well under thirty when i come up and it is fallin fast  ive been about here before at this time o year in a calm with a ground swell and a sinkin glass  no good ever came of it  look there at the norrard  what dye make o that sandy  in conjunction wi the descending glass it has an ominous appairance the scotchman answered with much stress on the first syllable of the adjective  the phenomenon which had attracted their professional attention did not appear to either of the girdlestones to be a very important one the haze on the horizon to the north was rather thicker than elsewhere and a few thin streaky clouds straggled upwards across the clear cold heaven like the feelers of some giant octopus which lay behind the fog bank  at the same time the sea changed in places from the appearance of quicksilver to that of grained glass  theres the wind miggs said confidently  id furl the topgallant sails and get her staysails down mr mcpherson  whenever he gave an order he was careful to give the mate his full title though at other times he called him indiscriminately sandy or mac  the mate gave the necessary commands while miggs dived down into the cabin  he came up again looking even graver than when he left the deck  the glass is nearly down to twentyeight he said  i never seed it as low since ive been at sea  take in the mainsl mr mcpherson and have the topsails reefed down  ay ay sir  there was no lack of noise now as the men hauled at the halliards with their shrill strange cries which sounded like the piping of innumerable seabirds  half a dozen lay out on the yard above tucking away the great sail and making all snug  take a reef in the foresl the mate roared and look alive about it  hurry up ye swabs miggs bellowed  youll be blown away every mothers son of ye if you dont stir yourselves  even the two landsmen could see now that the danger was no imaginary one and that a storm was about to burst over them  the long black lines of vapour had lengthened and coalesced until now the whole northern heaven was one great rolling black cloud with an angry ragged fringe which bespoke the violence of the wind that drove it  here and there against the deep black background a small whitish or sulphurcoloured wreath stood clearly out looking livid and dangerous the whole great mass was sweeping onwards with prodigious and majestic rapidity darkening the ocean beneath it and emitting a dull moaning muttering sound which was indescribably menacing and mournful  this may be the same gale as was on some days ago miggs remarked they travel in circles very often and come back to where they start from  we are all snug aloft but this ship wont stand much knocking about an thats a fact observed the mate gloomily  it was blowing now in short frequent puffs which ruffled the surface of the water and caused the black eagle to surge slowly forward over the rollers  a few drops of rain came pattering down upon the deck the great bank of cloud was above the ship still hurrying wildly across the heavens  look out cried an old quartermaster  here she comes  as he spoke the storm burst with a shriek as though all the demons of the air had been suddenly unchained and were rejoicing in their freedom the force of the blast was so great that girdlestone could almost have believed that he had been struck by some solid object  the barque heeled over until her lee rail touched the water and lay so for a minute or more in a smother of foam  her deck was at such an angle that it seemed as though she never could right herself  gradually however she rose a little staggered and trembled like a living thing and then plunged away through the storm as a piece of paper is whirled before the wind  by evening the gale was at its height  the black eagle was running under maintopsail and foretopmast staysail  the sea had risen very quickly as it will when wind comes upon a swell  as far as the eye could see from the summit of a wave there was a vista of dark towering ridges with their threatening crests of foam  when the barque sank in the hollow these gleaming summits rose as high as her mainyard and the two fugitives clinging to the weathershrouds looked up in terror and amazement at the masses of water which hung above them  once or twice waves actually broke over the vessel crashing and roaring down the deck and washing hither and thither until gradually absorbed between the planks or drained away through the scupperholes  on each of these occasions the poor rotten vessel would lurch and shiver in every plank as if with a foreknowledge of her fate  it was a dreary night for all on board  as long as there was light they could at least see what danger was to be faced but now the barque was plunging and tossing through an inky obscurity  with a wild scooping motion she was hurled up on the summit of a great wave and thence she shot down into the black gulf beyond with such force that when checked by meeting the next billow her whole fabric jarred from truck to keelson  there were two seamen at the wheel and two at the relieving tackles yet it was all that they could do among the wild commotion to keep her steady  no one thought of going below  it was better to see and know the worst than to be shut up in a coffin where one could not stretch out a hand to help ones self  once captain hamilton miggs clawed his way along the rail to where the girdlestones were standing  look there he roared pointing to windward  it was difficult to turn ones face straight to the wild rush of wind and spray and hail  shading their eyes they peered into the storm right in the heart of it and apparently not more than a couple of hundred yards from the barque was a lurid glare of ruddy light rising and falling with the sea but advancing rapidly through it  there was a bright central glowing spot with smaller lights glimmering above and beside it  the effect of the single glare of light against the inky darkness of the sea and sky would have made a study for a turner  whats that  its a steamer the captain shouted  it was only by great exertions that he could make himself audible above the shrieking of the wind and the dash of the waves  what do you think of it all ezra asked  very bad miggs answered  couldnt be worse and with that he clawed his way aft again grasping every stanchion or shroud on his way like a parroquet in a cage  the clouds above broke somewhat towards morning but there was no sign of abatement in the tempest  here and there through the rifts the glimmer of the stars might be seen and once the pale moon gleamed through the storm wreath  the dawn broke cheerless and dreary disclosing the great turmoil of endless slatecoloured waves and the solitary little barque with her rag of canvas like a brokenwinged seabird staggering to the south  even the girdlestones had noticed that whereas towards the commencement of the storm it had been a rare occurrence for a wave to break over the ship the decks were now continually kneedeep in water and there was a constant splashing and crashing as the seas curled over the weather bulwark  miggs had already observed it and conferred gravely with his mate on the point  i dont like the looks of her mac he shouted  she dont rise to them  shes near waterlogged im thinkin the mate responded gravely  he knew the danger and his thoughts were wandering away to a little slatetiled cottage near peterhead  it is true that there was not much in it save a wife who was said to give sandy the rough side of her tongue and occasionally something rougher still  affection is a capricious emotion however and will cling to the most unlikely objects so the big scotchmans eyes were damp with something else beside the sea spray as he realized that he might never look upon cottage or occupant again  no wonder said miggs when shes takin in water above and below too  the men are weary wi pumpin and it still gains  i doot its our last vyage thgither the mate remarked his scottish accent waxing broader under the influence of emotion  what dye say to heavin her to  id let her run on  she would na rise tae the waves im fearin we canna be vera fa frae the spanish coast accordin to my surmisation  that wud gie us a chance o savin oorsels though im a feared na boat would live in siccan a sea  youre right  we have a better chance so than if we let her ride shed founder as sure as eggs are eggs  damn it mac i could almost be glad this has happened now weve got them two aboard  well teach em what coffin ships is like in a gale o wind  the rough seaman laughed hoarsely as he spoke  the carpenter came aft at this moment balancing himself as best he could for the deck was only a few degrees off the perpendicular  the leak is gaining fast he said  the hands are clean done up theres land on the port bow  the mate and the captain peered out through the dense wrack and haze a great dark cliff loomed out upon the left jagged inhospitable and menacing  wed best run towards it the mate said  weve na chance o saving the ship but we might run her ashore  the ship will go down before you reach it the carpenter remarked gloomily  keep your heart up miggs shouted and then crawled along to the girdlestones  there is no hope for the ship but we may save ourselves he said  youll have to take your turn at the pumps  they followed him forward without a word  the crew listless and weary were grouped about the pumps  the feeble clanking sounded like the ticking of a watch amid the horrible uproar which filled the air  buckle to again boys cried miggs  these two will help you and the carpenter and mate  ezra and his father the old mans grizzled locks flying wildly from his head seized the rope and worked with the crew hardly able to retain their foothold upon the slippery sloping decks  miggs went down into the cabin  his behaviour during the gale had been most exemplary but he recognized now that there was nothing more to be done and having thrown off his public responsibilities he renewed his private peculiarities  he filled out nearly a tumblerful of raw rum and took it off at a gulp  then he began to sing and made his way on deck in a very hilarious and reckless mood  the vessel was still flying towards the rugged line of cliffs which were now visible along the whole horizon the great projection on the left being their culminating point  she was obviously sinking lower in the water and she plunged in a heavy sulky manner through the waves instead of rising to them as she did before  the water was steadily gaining in her interior and it was clear that she would not float long the straining of the gale had increased the longneglected rifts between her timbers and no amount of pumping could save her  on the other hand the sky had broken above them and the wind was by no means so violent as before  the sun broke through between two great hurrying clouds and turned all the waves to the brightest emerald green with sparkling snowwhite crests of foam  this sudden change and the brightness of the scene made their fate seem all the harder to the seamen aboard the sinking vessel  the gale is clearin remarked mcpherson  if wed had a ship that wasna rotten to the hairt like her owners wed ha pued through  right you are old sandy  but were all goin together captain and owners and the whole bilin yelled miggs recklessly  the mate looked at him half in surprise and half in contempt youve been at the bottle he said  eh mun mun if we are a drooned as seems likely its an awfu thing to appear before your maker wi your meeserable soul a steeped in drink  you go down and have a drink yourself miggs cried huskily  na na  if i am to dee ill dee sober  youll die a fool the skipper shouted wrathfully  well old preacher youve brought us into a nice hole with your damned insurance cheating cheeseparing business  what dye think of it now when the ships settlin down under our feet eh  would you repair her if you had her back in the albert dock eh  this speech was addressed to the old merchant who had ceased pumping and was leaning against the cuddy and looking up hopelessly at the long line of brown cliffs which were now only half a mile away  they could hear the roar of the surf and saw the white breakers where the atlantic stormed in all its fury against natures breakwater  hes not fit to command said ezra to the mate  what would you advise  well bring her round and lower the boats on the lee side  they may live or no but its the only chance for us  them twa boats will hold us a easy  the ship was settling down in the water so fast that it was no difficult matter to let the boats down  they only hung a few feet above the surface  the majority of the crew got safely into the long boat and the girdlestones with miggs and four seamen occupied the gig  it was no easy thing to prevent the boats from being stove as the waves alternately drove them from the ships side or brought the two together with a force which seemed irresistible  by skilful management however they both succeeded in casting off and getting clear without accident  it was only when they emerged from under the shelter of the vessel that they felt the full power of the sea  if it had appeared stupendous when they trod the deck of the barque how much more so now when by leaning the arm over the side they could touch the surface  the great glassy green billows hurled them up and down and tossed them and buffeted them as though the two boats were their playthings and they were trying what antics they could perform with them without destroying them girdlestone sat very grim and pale with ezra at his side  the young fellows expression was that of a daring man who realizes his danger but is determined to throw no chance of safety away  his mouth was set firm and hard and his dark eyebrows were drawn down over his keen eyes which glanced swiftly to right and left like a rat in a trap miggs held the tiller and laughed from time to time in a drunken fashion while the four seamen quiet and subdued steadied the boat as long as they could with their oars and looked occasionally over their shoulders at the breakers behind them  the sun was shining on the rugged precipices showing out the green turf upon their summit and a little dark group of peasants who were watching the scene from above but making no effort to assist the castaways  there was no alternative but to row straight in for the nearest point of land for the boats were filling and might go down at any moment  the ships gone ezra said as they rose on the summit of a wave when they came up again all looked round but there was no sign of the illfated black eagle  well all be gone when we get among the breakers shouted captain hamilton miggs  pull ye devils pull  beat the mates boat  its a race my lads and the winnin post is hell  ezra glanced at his father and saw that his lips were moving tremulously as they pattered forth prayers  still at it he said with a sneer  making my peace the old man said solemnly  my faith is now indeed a staff and a comfort  i look back at my long life and though i humbly confess that i have erred and erred grievously still in the main i have walked straight  from my youth i have been frugal and industrious oh my boy look with candid eyes into your own heart and see if you are fit to be called away  look to your own beam ezra answered keeping his eye upon the line of boiling surf which came nearer and nearer every moment  how about john harstons daughter eh  even at that awful hour ezra felt a sinister pleasure at observing the spasm which shot across his fathers face at the mention of his ward  if i sinned i sinned for a worthy purpose he answered  it was to preserve my business  its fall was a blow to righteousness and a triumph to evil  into thy hands i commend my spirit  as he spoke a great wave hurled the boat in upon its broad bosom and flung it down upon the cruel jagged rocks which bristled from the base of the cliff  there was a horrible rending crash and the stout keel snapped asunder while a second wave swept over it tearing out the struggling occupants and bearing them on only to hurl them upon a second ridge beyond  the peasants upon the cliff gave piteous cries of grief and pity which blended with the agonized groans and screams of drowning men and the thunder of the pitiless surge  looking down they could see the black dots which indicated the heads of the poor wretches below diminishing one by one as they were hurled upon the rocks or dragged down by the undercurrent  ezra was a strong swimmer but when he had shaken himself free of the boat and kicked away a seaman who clung to him he made no attempt to strike out  he knew that the waves would bear him quickly enough on to the rocks and he reserved himself for the struggle with them  a great roller came surging over the outlying reef  it carried him in like a feather and hurled him up against the face of the cliff  as he struggled upon its crest he mechanically put out his hands and seized a projecting portion of the rock  the shock of the contact was tremendous but he retained his grasp and found himself when the wave receded standing battered and breathless upon a small niche in the front of the rock which just gave him foothold  it was a marvellous escape for looking on either side he could not see any break in the sheer declivity  he was by no means safe as yet  if a wave had landed him there another might come as high and drag him away  looking down he saw one or two smaller ones break into spray far below him and then a second great green billow came rolling majestically towards him  he eyed it as it came foaming in and calculated that it would come at least as high as his knees  would it drag him back with it or could he hold his own he braced himself as firmly as he could placing his feet apart and digging his nails into the inequalities of the rock until the blood gushed from them  the water surged up upon him and he felt it tugging like some murderous demon at his legs but he held on bravely until the pressure decreased  looking below the saw the wave sinking down the face of the cliff  another wave overtook it and welled it up again and then from the depths of the green waters ezra saw a long white arm shoot up and grasp the edge of the ledge upon which he stood  even before the face appeared the young man knew that the hand was his fathers  a second followed the first and then the old merchants face was uplifted from the waves  he was cruelly bruised and battered and his clothes had been partly torn away  he recognized his son however and looked up at him beseechingly while he held on with all his strength to the ledge of rock  so small was the space that his clinging fingers touched ezras toes  theres no room here the young man said brutally  for gods sake  hardly room for one  the merchant was hanging with the lower portion of his body in the water  it was but a few instants but the old man had time to think of many an incident in his past life  once more he saw the darkened sickroom and his own form standing by the bed of the dying man what are these words which ring in his ears above the crash of the surf may your flesh and blood treat you as you treat her  he looked up appealing at his son  ezra saw that the next wave would lift him right up on to the ledge  in that case he might be hustled off  leave go he cried  help me ezra  his son brought down his heavy heel upon the bloodless hands  the old african trader gave a wild shriek and fell back into the sea  looking down ezra saw his despairing face gazing at him through the water slowly it sank until it was but a flickering white patch far down in the green depths  at the same instant a thick rope came dangling down the face of the cliff and the young man knew that he was saved    chapter l   winds up the thread and ties two knots at the end  great was the excitement of the worthy couple at phillimore gardens when kate harston was brought back to them  good mrs dimsdale pressed her to her ample bosom and kissed her and scolded her and wept over her while the doctor was so moved that it was only by assuming an expression of portentous severity and by bellowing and stamping about that he was able to keep himself in decent control  and you really thought we had forgotten you because we were insane enough to stop writing at that villains request he said patting kates pale cheeks tenderly and kissing her  i was very foolish she said blushing prettily and rearranging her hair which had been somewhat tumbled by her numerous caresses  oh that scoundrelthat pair of scoundrels roared the doctor shaking his fist and dancing about on the hearthrug  pray god they may catch em before the trial comes off  the good physicians prayer was not answered in this case for burt was the only criminal who appeared in the dock  our friends all went down to the winchester assizes to give evidence and the navvy was duly convicted of the death of rebecca taylforth and condemned to death he was executed some three weeks afterwards dying as he had lived stolid and unrepenting  there is a little unpretending church not far from phillimore gardens in which a little unpretending clergyman preaches every sunday out of a very shabby pulpit  it lies in castle lane which is a narrow byway and the great crowd of churchgoers ebbs and flows within a hundred yards of it but none know of its existence for it has never risen to the dignity of a spire and the bell is so very diminutive that the average muffin man produces quite as much noise  hence with the exception of some few families who have chanced to find their way there and have been so pleased with their spiritual welcome that they have returned there is a poor and fluctuating congregation  so scanty is it that the struggling incumbent could very well weep when he has spent the week in polishing and strengthening his sermon and then finds upon the sunday how very scanty is the audience to whom it is to be addressed  imagine then this good mans surprise when asked to publish the banns of marriage of two couples simultaneously each of whom he knew to be in the upper circles of life and when informed at the same time that the said marriages were actually to be celebrated under his own auspices and in his own church  in the fullness of his heart he at once bought a most unwearable black bonnet with lilac flowers and red berries which he brought in triumph to his wife who good woman affected extreme delight and afterwards cut away all the obnoxious finery and replaced it to her own taste  the scanty congregation was no less surprised when they heard that tobias clutterbuck bachlelor was about to marry lavinia scully widow and that thomas dimsdale bachelor was to do as much to catherine harston spinster  they communicated the tidings to their friends and the result was a great advertisement to the little church so that the incumbent preached his favourite sermon upon barren fig trees to a crowded audience and received such an offertory as had never entered into his wildest dreams  and if this was an advertisement to the castle lane church how much more so was it when the very pompous carriages came rolling up with their very pompous drivers all of whom being married men had a depreciatory and wearied expression upon their faces to show that they had done it all before and that it was nothing new to them  out of the one carriage there jumped a very jaunty gentleman somewhat past the middle age and a little inclined to stoutness but looking very healthy and rosy nevertheless  besides him there walked a tall tawnybearded man who glanced solicitously every now and again at his companion as though he were the bottleholder at a prizefight and feared that his man might collapse at a moments notice  from a second carriage there emerged an athletic brownfaced young fellow accompanied by a small wizened gentleman in spotless attire who was in such a state of nervousness that he dropped his lavender glove twice on his way up the aisle  these gentlemen grouped themselves at the end of the church conversing in low whispers and looking exceedingly uncomfortable as is the prerogative of the sterner sex under such circumstances mr gilray who was toms best man was introduced to herr von baumser and every one was very affable and nervous  now there comes a rustling of drapery and every one turns their heads as the brides sweep up to the altar  here is mrs scully looking quite as charming as she did fifteen years ago on the last occasion when she performed the ceremony  she was dressed in a french grey gown with bonnet to match and the neatest little bouquet in the world for which the major had ransacked covent garden  behind her came bonny kate a very vision of loveliness in her fairylike lace and beautiful ivory satin  her dark lashes drooped over her violet eyes and a slight flush tinged her cheeks but she glided steadily into her place and did her share in the responses when the earnest little clergyman appeared upon the scene  there was dr dimsdale too with the brightest of smiles and snowiest of waistcoats giving away the brides in the most openhanded fashion  his wife too was by his side in tears and purple velvet and many other friends and relations including the two socialists who came at the majors invitation and beamed on every one out of a side pew  then there was the signing of the registers and such a kissing and a weeping and a distributing of fees as never was seen in castle lane church before  and mrs dimsdale as one of the witnesses would insist upon writing her name in the space reserved for the bride on which there were many small jokes passed and much laughter  then the wheezy old organ struck up mendelssohns wedding march and the major puffed out his chest and stumped down the aisle with his bride while tom followed with his looking round with proud and happy eyes the carriages rolled up there was a slamming of doors and a cracking of whips and two more couples had started hand in hand down the long road of life which leadswho shall say whither  the breakfast was at phillimore gardens and a very glorious breakfast it was  those who were present still talk of the manner in which the health of the brides was proposed by dr dimsdale and of the enthusiasm with which the toast was received by the company  also of the flowery address in which the major returned thanks for the said toast and the manly demeanour of the younger man as he followed suit  they speak too of many other pleasant things said and done upon that occasion  how von baumser proposed the health of the little incumbent and the little incumbent that of dr dimsdale and the doctor drank to the unpronounceable russian who being unable to reply sang a revolutionary song which no one could understand  very happy and very hearty was every one by the time that the hour came at which the carriages were ordered when amid a patter ing of rice and a chorus of heartfelt good wishes the happy couples drove off upon their travels  the liabilities of the firm of girdlestone proved to be less serious than was at first imagined  after the catastrophe which had befallen the founder of the business there was almost a panic in fenchurch street but on examination it proved that though the books had been deliberately falsified for some time yet trade had been so brisk of late that with a little help the firm could continue to exist dimsdale threw all his money and his energy into the matter and took gilray into partnership which proved to be an excellent thing for both of them  the firm of dimsdale and gilray is now among the most successful and popular of all the english firms connected with the african trade  of their captains there is none upon whom they place greater reliance than upon mcpherson whose boat was providentially saved from the danger which destroyed his former captain and his employer  what became of ezra girdlestone was never known  some years after tom heard from a commercial traveller of a melancholy broken man who haunted the low bettinghouses of san francisco and who met his death eventually in some drunken fracas  there was much about this desperado which tallied with the description of young girdlestone but nothing certain was ever known about the matter  and now i must bid adieu to the shadowy company with whom i have walked so long  i see them going on down the vista of the future gathering wisdom and happiness as they go  there is the major as stubbytoed and pigeonbreasted as ever broken from many of his bohemian ways but still full of anecdote and of kindliness  there is his henchman von baumser too who is a constant diner at his hospitable board and who conveys so many sweets to a young clutterbuck who has made his appearance that one might suspect him of receiving a commission from the family doctor  mrs clutterbuck as buxom and pleasant as ever makes noble efforts at stopping these contraband supplies but the wily teuton still manages to smuggle them through in the face of every obstacle  i see kate and her husband chastened by their many troubles and making the road to the grave pleasant to the good old couple who are so proud of their son  all these i watch as they pass away into the dim coming time and i know as i shut the book that whatever may be in store for us there they at least can never in the eternal justice of things come to aught but good   the end
