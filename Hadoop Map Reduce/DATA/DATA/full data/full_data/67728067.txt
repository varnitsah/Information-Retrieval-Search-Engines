67728067	deep waters  by ww jacobs     made to measure  mr mott brought his niece home from the station with considerable pride although he had received a photograph to assist identification he had been very dubious about accosting the pretty welldressed girl who had stepped from the train and gazed around with dovelike eyes in search of him  now he was comfortably conscious of the admiring gaze of his younger fellowtownsmen  youll find it a bit dull after london i expect he remarked as he inserted his key in the door of a small house in a quiet street  im tired of london said miss garland  i think this is a beautiful little old townso peaceful  mr mott looked gratified  i hope youll stay a long time he said as he led the way into the small front room  im a lonely old man  his niece sank into an easy chair and looked about her  thank you she said slowly  i hope i shall  i feel better already there is so much to upset one in london  noise queried mr mott  and other things said miss garland with a slight shudder  mr mott sighed in sympathy with the unknown and judging by his nieces expression the unknowable  he rearranged the teacups and going to the kitchen returned in a few minutes with a pot of tea  mrs pett leaves at three he said in explanation to look after her children but she comes back again at eight to look after my supper  and how is your mother  miss garland told him  last letter i had from her said mr mott stealing a glance at the girls ringfinger i understood you were engaged  his niece drew herself up  certainly not she said with considerable vigour  i have seen too much of married life  i prefer my freedom  besides i dont like men  mr mott said modestly that he didnt wonder at it and finding the subject uncongenial turned the conversation on to worthier subjects miss garlands taste it seemed lay in the direction of hospital nursing or some other occupation beneficial to mankind at large  simple and demure she filled the simpler mr mott with a strong sense of the shortcomings of his unworthy sex  within two days under the darkling glance of mrs pett she had altered the arrangements of the house  flowers appeared on the mealtable knives and forks were properly cleaned and plates no longer appeared ornamented with the mustard of a previous meal  fresh air circulated through the house and passing from mrs petts left knee to the lumbar region of mr mott went on its beneficent way rejoicing  on the fifth day of her visit mr mott sat alone in the front parlour the window was closed the door was closed and mr mott sitting in an easy chair with his feet up was aroused from a sound nap by the door opening to admit a young man who deserted by mrs pett stood bowing awkwardly in the doorway  is miss garland in  he stammered  mr mott rubbed the remnants of sleep from his eyelids  she has gone for a walk he said slowly  the young man stood fingering his hat  my name is hurst he said with slight emphasis  mr alfred hurst  mr mott still somewhat confused murmured that he was glad to hear it  i have come from london to see florrie continued the intruder  i suppose she wont be long  mr mott thought not and after a moments hesitation invited mr hurst to take a chair  i suppose she told you we are engaged  said the latter  engaged said the startled mr mott  why she told me she didnt like men  playfulness replied mr hurst with an odd look  ah here she is  the handle of the front door turned and a moment later the door of the room was opened and the charming head of miss garland appeared in the opening  back again she said brightly  ive just been  she caught sight of mr hurst and the words died away on her lips  the door slammed and the two gentlemen exchanging glances heard a hurried rush upstairs and the slamming of another door  also a key was heard to turn sharply in a lock  she doesnt want to see you said mr mott staring  the young man turned pale  perhaps she has gone upstairs to take her things off he muttered resuming his seat  dontdont hurry her  i wasnt going to said mr mott  he twisted his beard uneasily and at the end of ten minutes looked from the clock to mr hurst and coughed  if you wouldnt mind letting her know im waiting said the young man brokenly  mr mott rose and went slowly upstairs  more slowly still after an interval of a few minutes he came back again  she doesnt want to see you he said slowly  mr hurst gasped  ii must see her he faltered  she wont see you repeated mr mott  and she told me to say she was surprised at you following her down here  mr hurst uttered a faint moan and with bent head passed into the little passage and out into the street leaving mr mott to return to the sittingroom and listen to such explanations as miss garland deemed advisable  great goodness of heart in the face of persistent and unwelcome attentions appeared to be responsible for the late engagement  well its over now said her uncle kindly and no doubt hell soon find somebody else  there are plenty of girls would jump at him i expect  miss garland shook her head  he said he couldnt live without me she remarked soberly  mr mott laughed  in less than three months i expect hell be congratulating himself he said cheerfully  why i was nearly caumarried four times  its a silly age  his niece said indeed and informing him in somewhat hostile tones that she was suffering from a severe headache retired to her room  mr mott spent the evening by himself and retiring to bed at tenthirty was awakened by a persistent knocking at the front door at halfpast one half awakened he lit a candle and stumbling downstairs drew back the bolt of the door and stood gaping angrily at the pathetic features of mr hurst  sorry to disturb you said the young man but would you mind giving this letter to miss garland  sorry to disturb me stuttered mr mott  what do you mean by it  eh what do you mean by it  it is important said mr hurst  i cant rest  ive eaten nothing all day  glad to hear it snapped the irritated mr mott  if you will give her that letter i shall feel easier said mr hurst  ill give it to her in the morning said the other snatching it from him  now get off  mr hurst still murmuring apologies went and mr mott also murmuring returned to bed  the night was chilly and it was some time before he could get to sleep again  he succeeded at last only to be awakened an hour later by a knocking more violent than before  in a state of mind bordering upon frenzy he dived into his trousers again and went blundering downstairs in the dark  sorry to began mr hurst  mr mott made uncouth noises at him  i have altered my mind said the young man  would you mind letting me have that letter back again  it was too final  yougetoff   said the other trembling with cold and passion  i must have that letter said mr hurst doggedly  all my future happiness may depend upon it  mr mott afraid to trust himself with speech dashed upstairs and after a search for the matches found the letter and returning to the front door shut it on the visitors thanks  his nieces door opened as he passed it and a gentle voice asked for enlightenment  how silly of him  she said softly  i hope he wont catch cold what did you say  i was coughing said mr mott hastily  youll get cold if youre not careful said his thoughtful niece thats the worst of men they never seem to have any thought  did he seem angry or mournful or what  i suppose you couldnt see his face  i didnt try said mr mott crisply  good night  by the morning his illhumour had vanished and he even became slightly facetious over the events of the night  the mood passed at the same moment that mr hurst passed the window  better have him in and get it over he said irritably  miss garland shuddered  never she said firmly  hed be down on his knees  it would be too painful  you dont know him  dont want to said mr mott  he finished his breakfast in silence and after a digestive pipe proposed a walk  the profile of mr hurst as it went forlornly past the window again served to illustrate miss garlands refusal  ill go out and see him said mr mott starting up  are you going to be a prisoner here until this young idiot chooses to go home  its preposterous  he crammed his hat on firmly and set out in pursuit of mr hurst who was walking slowly up the street glancing over his shoulder  morning said mr mott fiercely  good morning said the other  now look here said mr mott  this has gone far enough and i wont have any more of it  why you ought to be ashamed of yourself chivvying a young lady that doesnt want you  havent you got any pride  no said the young man not where she is concerned  i dont believe you have said the other regarding him and i expect thats where the trouble is  did she ever have reason to think you were looking after any other girls  never i swear it said mr hurst eagerly  just so said mr mott with a satisfied nod  thats where you made a mistake  she was too sure of you it was too easy  no excitement girls like a man that other girls want they dont want a turtledove in fancy trousers  mr hurst coughed  and they like a determined man continued miss garlands uncle  why in my young days if i had been jilted and come down to see about it dyou think id have gone out of the house without seeing her  i might have been put outby halfadozenbut id have taken the mantelpiece and a few other things with me  and you are bigger than i am  we arent all made the same said mr hurst feebly  no were not said mr mott  im not blaming you in a way im sorry for you  if youre not born with a high spirit nothingll give it to you  it might be learnt said mr hurst  mr mott laughed  high spirits are born not made he said  the best thing you can do is to go and find another girl and marry her before she finds you out  mr hurst shook his head  theres no other girl for me he said miserably  and everything seemed to be going so well  weve been buying things for the house for the last six months and ive just got a good rise in my screw  itll do for another girl said mr mott briskly  now you get off back to town  you are worrying florrie by staying here and you are doing no good to anybody  goodbye  ill walk back as far as the door with you said mr hurst  youve done me good  its a pity i didnt meet you before  remember what ive told you and youll do well yet he said patting the young man on the arm  i will said mr hurst and walked on by his side deep in thought  i cant ask you in said mr mott jocularly as he reached his door and turned the key in the lock  goodbye  goodbye said mr hurst  he grasped the others outstretched hand and with a violent jerk pulled him into the street  then he pushed open the door and slipping into the passage passed hastily into the front room closely followed by the infuriated mr mott  whatwhatwhat stammered that gentleman  im taking your tip said mr hurst pale but determined  im going to stay here until i have seen florrie  youyoure a serpent said mr mott struggling for breath  iim surprised at you  you go out before you get hurt  not without the mantelpiece said mr hurst with a distorted grin  a viper said mr mott with extreme bitterness  if you are not out in two minutes ill send for the police  florrie wouldnt like that said mr hurst  shes awfully particular about what people think  you just trot upstairs and tell her that a gentleman wants to see her  he threw himself into mr motts own particular easy chair and crossing his knees turned a deaf ear to the threats of that incensed gentleman not until the latter had left the room did his features reveal the timorousness of the soul within  muffled voices sounded from upstairs and it was evident that an argument of considerable length was in progress  it was also evident from the return of mr mott alone that his niece had had the best of it  ive done all i could he said but she declines to see you  she says she wont see you if you stay here for a month and you couldnt do that you know  why not inquired mr hurst  why not repeated mr mott repressing his feelings with some difficulty food  mr hurst started  and drink said mr mott following up his advantage  theres no good in starving yourself for nothing so you may as well go  when ive seen florrie said the young man firmly  mr mott slammed the door and for the rest of the day mr hurst saw him no more  at one oclock a savoury smell passed the door on its way upstairs and at five oclock a middleaged woman with an inane smile looked into the room on her way aloft with a loaded teatray  by supper time he was suffering considerably from hunger and thirst  at ten oclock he heard the footsteps of mr mott descending the stairs the door opened an inch and a gruff voice demanded to know whether he was going to stay there all night  receiving a cheerful reply in the affirmative mr mott secured the front door with considerable violence and went off to bed without another word  he was awakened an hour or two later by the sound of something falling and sitting up in bed to listen became aware of a warm and agreeable odour  it was somewhere about the hour of midnight but a breakfast smell of eggs and bacon would not be denied  he put on some clothes and went downstairs  a crack of light showed under the kitchen door and pushing it open with some force he gazed spellbound at the spectacle before him  come in said mr hurst heartily  ive just finished  he rocked an empty beerbottle and patted another that was half full satiety was written on his face as he pushed an empty plate from him and leaning back in his chair smiled lazily at mr mott  go on said that gentleman hoarsely  mr hurst shook his head  enough is as good as a feast he said reasonably  ill have some more tomorrow  oh will you  said the other  will you  mr hurst nodded and opening his coat disclosed a bottle of beer in each breastpocket  the other pockets it appeared contained food  and heres the money for it he said putting down some silver on the table  i am determined but honest  with a sweep of his hand mr mott sent the money flying  tomorrow morning i send for the police  mind that  he roared  id better have my breakfast early then said mr hurst tapping his pockets  good night  and thank you for your advice  he sat for some time after the disappearance of his host and then returning to the front room placed a chair at the end of the sofa and with the tablecloth for a quilt managed to secure a few hours troubled sleep  at eight oclock he washed at the scullery sink and at ten oclock mr mott with an air of great determination came in to deliver his ultimatum  if youre not outside the front door in five minutes im going to fetch the police he said fiercely  i want to see florrie said the other  well you wont see her shouted mr mott  mr hurst stood feeling his chin  well would you mind taking a message for me he asked  i just want you to ask her whether i am really free  ask her whether i am free to marry again  mr mott eyed him in amazement  you see i only heard from her mother pursued mr hurst and a friend of mine who is in a solicitors office says that isnt good enough  i only came down here to make sure and i think the least she can do is to tell me herself  if she wont see me perhaps shed put it in writing you see theres another lady  but said the mystified mr mott  you told me  you tell her that said the other  mr mott stood for a few seconds staring at him and then without a word turned on his heel and went upstairs  left to himself mr hurst walked nervously up and down the room and catching sight of his face in the oldfashioned glass on the mantelpiece heightened its colour by a few pinches  the minutes seemed interminable but at last he heard the steps of mr mott on the stairs again  shes coming down to see you herself said the latter solemnly  mr hurst nodded and turning to the window tried in vain to take an interest in passing events  a light step sounded on the stairs the door creaked and he turned to find himself confronted by miss garland  uncle told me she began coldly  mr hurst bowed  i am sorry to have caused you so much trouble he said trying to control his voice but you see my position dont you  no said the girl  well i wanted to make sure said mr hurst  its best for all of us isnt it  best for you best for me and of course for my young lady  you never said anything about her before said miss garland her eyes darkening  of course not said mr hurst  how could i  i was engaged to you and then she wasnt my young lady but of course as soon as you broke it off  who is she inquired miss garland in a casual voice  you dont know her said mr hurst  what is she like  i cant describe her very well said mr hurst  i can only say shes the most beautiful girl i have ever seen  i think thats what made me take to her  and shes easily pleased  she liked the things i have been buying for the house tremendously  did she said miss garland with a gasp  all except that pair of vases you chose continued the veracious mr hurst  she says they are in bad taste but she can give them to the charwoman  oh said the girl  oh indeed  very kind of her  isnt there anything else she doesnt like  mr hurst stood considering  she doesnt like the upholstering of the best chairs he said at last she thinks they are too showy so shes going to put covers over them  there was a long pause during which mr mott taking his niece gently by the arm assisted her to a chair  otherwise she is quite satisfied concluded mr hurst  miss garland took a deep breath but made no reply  i have got to satisfy her that i am free said the young man after another pause  i suppose that i can do so  iill think it over said miss garland in a low voice  i am not sure what is the right thing to do  i dont want to see you made miserable for life  its nothing to me of course but still  she got up and shaking off the proffered assistance of her uncle went slowly and languidly up to her room  mr mott followed her as far as the door and then turned indignantly upon mr hurst  youyouve broke her heart he said solemnly  thats all right said mr hurst with a delighted wink  ill mend it again
