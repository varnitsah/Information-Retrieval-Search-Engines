57133709	literary friends and acquaintances  by william dean howells    contents     biographical    my first visit to new england    first impressions of literary new york    roundabout to boston    literary boston as i knew it    oliver wendell holmes    the white mr longfellow    studies of lowell    cambridge neighbors    a belated guest    my mark twain      literary friends and acquaintances     bibliographical  long before i began the papers which make up this volume i had meant to write of literary history in new england as i had known it in the lives of its great exemplars during the twentyfive years i lived near them in fact i had meant to do this from the time i came among them but i let the days in which i almost constantly saw them go by without record save such as i carried in a memory retentive indeed beyond the common but not so full as i could have wished when i began to invoke it for my work still upon insistent appeal it responded in sufficient abundance and though i now wish i could have remembered more instances i think my impressions were accurate enough i am sure of having tried honestly to impart them in the ten years or more when i was desultorily endeavoring to share them with the reader  the papers were written pretty much in the order they have here beginning with my first visit to new england which dates from the earliest eighteennineties if i may trust my recollection of reading it from the manuscript to the editor of harpers magazine where we lay under the willows of magnolia one pleasant summer morning in the first years of that decade it was printed no great while after in that periodical but i was so long in finishing the study of lowell that it had been anticipated in harpers by other reminiscences of him and it was therefore first printed in scribners magazine it was the paper with which i took the most pains and when it was completed i still felt it so incomplete that i referred it to his closest and my best friend the late charles eliot norton for his criticism he thought it wanting in unity it was a group of studies instead of one study he said i must do something to draw the different sketches together in a single effect of portraiture and this i did my best to do  it was the latest written of the three articles which give the volume substance and it represents mare finally and fully than the others my sense of the literary importance of the men whose like we shall not look upon again longfellow was easily the greatest poet of the three holmes often the most brilliant and felicitous but lowell in spite of his forays in politics was the finest scholar and the most profoundly literary as he was above the others most deeply and thoroughly new england in quality  while i was doing these sketches sometimes slighter and sometimes less slight of all those poets and essayists and novelists i had known in cambridge and boston and concord and new york i was doing many other things half a dozen novels as many more novelettes and shorter stories with essays and criticisms and verses so that in january 1900 i had not yet done the paper on lowell which with another was to complete my reminiscences of american literary life as i had witnessed it when they were all done at last they were republished in a volume which found instant favor beyond my deserts if not its own  there was a good deal of trouble with the name but literary friends and acquaintance was an endeavor for modest accuracy with which i remained satisfied until i thought long too late of literary friends and neighbors then i perceived that this would have been still more accurate and quite as modest and i gladly give any reader leave to call the book by that name who likes  since the collection was first made i have written little else quite of the kind except the paper on bret harte which was first printed shortly after his death and the study of mark twain which i had been preparing to make for forty years and more and wrote in two weeks of the spring of 1910 others of my time and place have now passed whither there is neither time nor place and there are moments when i feel that i must try to call them back and pay them such honor as my sense of their worth may give but the impulse has as yet failed to effect itself and i do not know how long i shall spare myself the supreme pleasurepain the hochst angenehmer schmerz of seeking to live here with those who live here no more  w d h     my first visit to new england     i  if there was any one in the world who had his being more wholly in literature than i had in 1860 i am sure i should not have known where to find him and i doubt if he could have been found nearer the centres of literary activity than i then was or among those more purely devoted to literature than myself i had been for three years a writer of news paragraphs book notices and political leaders on a daily paper in an inland city and i do not know that my life differed outwardly from that of any other young journalist who had begun as i had in a country printingoffice and might be supposed to be looking forward to advancement in his profession or in public affairs but inwardly it was altogether different with me inwardly i was a poet with no wish to be anything else unless in a moment of careless affluence i might so far forget myself as to be a novelist i was with my friend j j piatt the halfauthor of a little volume of very unknown verse and mr lowell had lately accepted and had begun to print in the atlantic monthly five or six poems of mine besides this i had written poems and sketches and criticisms for the saturday press of new york a longforgotten but once very lively expression of literary intention in an extinct bohemia of that city and i was always writing poems and sketches and criticisms in our own paper these as well as my feats in the renowned periodicals of the east met with kindness if not honor in my own city which ought to have given me grave doubts whether i was any real prophet but it only intensified my literary ambition already so strong that my veins might well have run ink rather than blood and gave me a higher opinion of my fellowcitizens if such a thing could be they were indeed very charming people and such of them as i mostly saw were readers and lovers of books society in columbus at that day had a pleasant refinement which i think i do not exaggerate in the fond retrospect it had the finality which it seems to have had nowhere since the war it had certain fixed ideals which were none the less graceful and becoming because they were the simple old american ideals now vanished or fast vanishing before the knowledge of good and evil as they have it in europe and as it has imparted itself to american travel and sojourn there was a mixture of many strains in the capital of ohio as there was throughout the state virginia kentucky pennsylvania new york and new england all joined to characterize the manners and customs i suppose it was the south which gave the social tone the intellectual taste among the elders was the southern taste for the classic and the standard in literature but we who were younger preferred the modern authors we read thackeray and george eliot and hawthorne and charles reade and de quincey and tennyson and browning and emerson and longfellow and ii read heine and evermore heine when there was not some new thing from the others now and then an immediate french book penetrated to us we read michelet and about i remember we looked to england and the east largely for our literary opinions we accepted the saturday review as law if we could not quite receive it as gospel one of us took the cornhill magazine because thackeray was the editor the atlantic monthly counted many readers among us and a visiting young lady from new england who screamed at sight of the periodical in one of our houses why have you got the atlantic monthly out here could be answered with cold superiority there are several contributors to the atlantic in columbus there were in fact two my roommate who wrote browning for it while i wrote heine and longfellow but i suppose two are as rightfully several as twenty are     ii  that was the heyday of lecturing and now and then a literary light from the east swam into our skies i heard and saw emerson and i once met bayard taylor socially at the hospitable house where he was a guest after his lecture heaven knows how i got through the evening i do not think i opened my mouth to address him a word it was as much as i could do to sit and look at him while he tranquilly smoked and chatted with our host and quaffed the beer which we had very good in the nest all the while i did him homage as the first author by calling whom i had met i longed to tell him how much i liked his poems which we used to get by heart in those days and i longed how much more i longed to have him know that       auch ich war in arkadien geboren  that i had printed poems in the atlantic monthly and the saturday press and was the potential author of things destined to eclipse all literature hitherto attempted but i could not tell him and there was no one else who thought to tell him perhaps it was as well so i might have perished of his recognition for my modesty was equal to my merit  in fact i think we were all rather modest young fellows we who formed the group wont to spend some part of every evening at that house where there was always music or whist or gay talk or all three we had our opinions of literary matters but perhaps because we had mostly accepted them from england or new england as i have said we were not vain of them and we would by no means have urged them before a living literary man like that i believe none of us ventured to speak except the poet my roommate who said he believed so and so was the original of so and so and was promptly told he had no right to say such a thing naturally we came away rather critical of our hosts guest whom i afterwards knew as the kindliest heart in the world but we had not shone in his presence and that galled us and we chose to think that he had not shone in ours     iii  at that time he was filling a large space in the thoughts of the young people who had any thoughts about literature he had come to his full repute as an agreeable and intelligent traveller and he still wore the halo of his early adventures afoot in foreign lands when they were yet really foreign he had not written his novels of american life once so welcomed and now so forgotten it was very long before he had achieved that incomparable translation of faust which must always remain the finest and best and which would keep his name alive with goethes if he had done nothing else worthy of remembrance but what then most commended him to the regard of us stareyed youth now blinking sadly toward our seventies was the poetry which he printed in the magazines from time to time in the first putnams where there was a dashing picture of him in an arab burnoose and a turban and in harpers and in the atlantic it was often very lovely poetry i thought and i still think so and it was rightfully his though it paid the inevitable allegiance to the manner of the great masters of the day it was graced for us by the pathetic romance of his early love which some of its sweetest and saddest numbers confessed for the young girl he married almost in her death hour and we who were hoping to have our hearts broken or already had them so would have been glad of something more of the obvious poet in the popular lecturer we had seen refreshing himself after his hour on the platform  he remained for nearly a year the only author i had seen and i met him once again before i saw any other our second meeting was far from columbus as far as remote quebec when i was on my way to new england by way of niagara and the canadian rivers and cities i stopped in toronto and realized myself abroad without any signal adventures but at montreal something very pretty happened to me i came into the hotel office the evening of a first days lonely sightseeing and vainly explored the register for the name of some acquaintance as i turned from it two smartly dressed young fellows embraced it and i heard one of them say to my great amaze and happiness hello heres howells  oh i broke out upon him i was just looking for some one i knew i hope you are some one who knows me  only through your contributions to the saturday press said the young fellow and with these golden words the precious first personal recognition of my authorship i had ever received from a stranger and the rich reward of all my literary endeavor he introduced himself and his friend i do not know what became of this friend or where or how he eliminated himself but we two others were inseparable from that moment he was a young lawyer from new york and when i came back from italy four or five years later i used to see his sign in wall street with a neverfulfilled intention of going in to see him in whatever world he happens now to be i should like to send him my greetings and confess to him that my art has never since brought me so sweet a recompense and nothing a thousandth part so much like fame as that outcry of his over the hotel register in montreal we were comrades for four or five rich days and shared our pleasures and expenses in viewing the monuments of those ancient canadian capitals which i think we valued at all their picturesque worth we made jokes to mask our emotions we giggled and made giggle in the right way we fell in and out of love with all the pretty faces and dresses we saw and we talked evermore about literature and literary people he had more acquaintance with the one and more passion for the other but he could tell me of pfaffs lagerbeer cellar on broadway where the saturday press fellows and the other bohemians met and this for the time was enough i resolved to visit it as soon as i reached new york in spite of the tobacco and beer which i was given to understand were de rigueur though they both so far as i had known them were apt to make me sick  i was very desolate after i parted from this good fellow who returned to montreal on his way to new york while i remained in quebec to continue later on mine to new england when i came in from seeing him off in a calash for the boat i discovered bayard taylor in the readingroom where he sat sunken in what seemed a somewhat weary muse he did not know me or even notice me though i made several errands in and out of the readingroom in the vain hope that he might do so doubly vain for i am aware now that i was still flown with the pride of that pretty experience in montreal and trusted in a repetition of something like it at last as no chance volunteered to help me i mustered courage to go up to him and name myself and say i had once had the pleasure of meeting him at doctors in columbus the poet gave no sign of consciousness at the sound of a name which i had fondly begun to think might not be so all unknown he looked up with an unkindling eye and asked ah how was the doctor and when i had reported favorably of the doctor our conversation ended  he was probably as tired as he looked and he must have classed me with that multitude all over the country who had shared the pleasure i professed in meeting him before it was surely my fault that i did not speak my name loud enough to be recognized if i spoke it at all but the courage i had mustered did not quite suffice for that in after years he assured me first by letter and then by word of his grief for an incident which i can only recall now as the untoward beginning of a cordial friendship it was often my privilege in those days as reviewer and editor to testify my sense of the beautiful things he did in so many kinds of literature but i never liked any of them better than i liked him he had a fervent devotion to his art and he was always going to do the greatest things in it with an expectation of effect that never failed him the things he actually did were none of them mean or wanting in quality and some of them are of a lasting charm that any one may feel who will turn to his poems but no doubt many of them fell short of his hopes of them with the reader it was fine to meet him when he was full of a new scheme he talked of it with a singlehearted joy and tried to make you see it of the same colors and proportions it wore to his eyes he spared no toil to make it the perfect thing he dreamed it and he was not discouraged by any disappointment he suffered with the critic or the public  he was a tireless worker and at last his health failed under his labors at the newspaper desk beneath the midnight gas when he should long have rested from such labors i believe he was obliged to do them through one of those business fortuities which deform and embitter all our lives but he was not the man to spare himself in any case he was always attempting new things and he never ceased endeavoring to make his scholarship reparation for the want of earlier opportunity and training i remember that i met him once in a cambridge street with a book in his hand which he let me take in mine it was a greek author and he said he was just beginning to read the language at fifty a patriarchal age to me of the early thirties  i suppose i intimated the surprise i felt at his taking it up so late in the day for he said with charming seriousness oh but you know i expect to use it in the other world yea that made it worth while i consented but was he sure of the other world as sure as i am of this he said and i have always kept the impression of the young faith which spoke in his voice and was more than his words  i saw him last in the hour of those tremendous adieux which were paid him in new york before he sailed to be minister in germany it was one of the most graceful things done by president hayes who most of all our presidents after lincoln honored himself in honoring literature by his appointments to give that place to bayard taylor there was no one more fit for it and it was peculiarly fit that he should be so distinguished to a people who knew and valued his scholarship and the service he had done german letters he was as happy in it apparently as a man could be in anything here below and he enjoyed to the last drop the many cups of kindness pressed to his lips in parting though i believe these farewells at a time when he was already fagged with work and excitement were notably harmful to him and helped to hasten his end some of us who were near of friendship went down to see him off when he sailed as the dismal and futile wont of friends is and i recall the kind great fellow standing in the cabin amid those sad flowers that heaped the tables saying goodby to one after another and smiling fondly smiling wearily upon all there was champagne of course and an odious hilarity without meaning and without remission till the warning bell chased us ashore and our brave poet escaped with what was left of his life     iv  i have followed him far from the moment of our first meeting but even on my way to venerate those new england luminaries which chiefly drew my eyes i could not pay a less devoir to an author who if curtis was not was chief of the new york group of authors in that day i distinguished between the newenglanders and the newyorkers and i suppose there is no question but our literary centre was then in boston wherever it is or is not at present but i thought taylor then and i think him now one of the first in our whole american province of the republic of letters in a day when it was in a recognizably flourishing state whether we regard quantity or quality in the names that gave it lustre lowell was then in perfect command of those varied forces which will long if not lastingly keep him in memory as first among our literary men and master in more kinds than any other american longfellow was in the fulness of his worldwide fame and in the ripeness of the beautiful genius which was not to know decay while life endured emerson had emerged from the popular darkness which had so long held him a hopeless mystic and was shining a lambent star of poesy and prophecy at the zenith hawthorne the exquisite artist the unrivalled dreamer whom we still always liken this one and that one to whenever this one or that one promises greatly to please us and still leave without a rival without a companion had lately returned from his long sojourn abroad and had given us the last of the incomparable romances which the world was to have perfect from his hand doctor holmes had surpassed all expectations in those who most admired his brilliant humor and charming poetry by the invention of a new attitude if not a new sort in literature the turn that civic affairs had taken was favorable to the widest recognition of whittiers splendid lyrical gift and that heart of fire doubly snowbound by quaker tradition and puritan environment was penetrating every generous breast with its flamy impulses and fusing all wills in its noble purpose mrs stowe who far outfamed the rest as the author of the most renowned novel ever written was proving it no accident or miracle by the fiction she was still writing  this great new england group might be enlarged perhaps without loss of quality by the inclusion of thoreau who came somewhat before his time and whose drastic criticism of our expediential and mainly futile civilization would find more intelligent acceptance now than it did then when all resentment of its defects was specialized in enmity to southern slavery doctor edward everett hale belonged in this group too by virtue of that humor the most inventive and the most fantastic the sanest the sweetest the truest which had begun to find expression in the atlantic monthly and there a wonderful young girl had written a series of vivid sketches and taken the heart of youth everywhere with amaze and joy so that i thought it would be no less an event to meet harriet prescott than to meet any of those i have named  i expected somehow to meet them all and i imagined them all easily accessible in the office of the atlantic monthly which had lately adventured in the fine air of high literature where so many other periodicals had gasped and died before it the best of these hitherto and better even than the atlantic for some reasons the lamented putnams magazine had perished of inanition at new york and the claim of the commercial capital to the literary primacy had passed with that brilliant venture new york had nothing distinctive to show for american literature but the decrepit and doting knickerbocker magazine harpers new monthly though curtis had already come to it from the wreck of putnams and it had long ceased to be eclectic in material and had begun to stand for native work in the allied arts which it has since so magnificently advanced was not distinctively literary and the weekly had just begun to make itself known the century scribners the cosmopolitan mcclures and i know not what others were still unimagined by five and ten and twenty years and the galaxy was to flash and fade before any of them should kindle its more effectual fires the nation which was destined to chastise rather than nurture our young literature had still six years of dreamless potentiality before it and the nation was always more bostonian than newyorkish by nature whatever it was by nativity  philadelphia had long counted for nothing in the literary field grahams magazine at one time showed a certain critical force but it seemed to perish of this expression of vitality and there remained godeys ladys book and petersons magazine publications really incredible in their insipidity in the south there was nothing but a mistaken social ideal with the moral principles all standing on their heads in defence of slavery and in the west there was a feeble and foolish notion that western talent was repressed by eastern jealousy at boston chiefly if not at boston alone was there a vigorous intellectual life among such authors as i have named every young writer was ambitious to join his name with theirs in the atlantic monthly and in the lists of ticknor  fields who were literary publishers in a sense such as the business world has known nowhere else before or since their imprint was a warrant of quality to the reader and of immortality to the author so that if i could have had a book issued by them at that day i should now be in the full enjoyment of an undying fame     v  such was the literary situation as the passionate pilgrim from the west approached his holy land at boston by way of the grand trunk railway from quebec to portland i have no recollection of a sleepingcar and i suppose i waked and watched during the whole of that long rough journey but i should hardly have slept if there had been a car for the purpose i was too eager to see what new england was like and too anxious not to lose the least glimpse of it to close my eyes after i crossed the border at island pond i found that in the elmdotted levels of maine it was very like the western reserve in northern ohio which is indeed a portion of new england transferred with all its characteristic features and flattened out along the lake shore it was not till i began to run southward into the older regions of the country that it lost this look and became gratefully strange to me it never had the effect of hoary antiquity which i had expected of a country settled more than two centuries with its woodbuilt farms and villages it looked newer than the coalsmoked brick of southern ohio i had prefigured the new england landscape bare of forests relieved here and there with the tees of orchards or plantations but i found apparently as much woodland as at home  at portland i first saw the ocean and this was a sort of disappointment tides and salt water i had already had at quebec so that i was no longer on the alert for them but the color and the vastness of the sea i was still to try upon my vision when i stood on the promenade at portland with the kind young unitarian minister whom i had brought a letter to and who led me there for a most impressive first view of the ocean i could not make more of it than there was of lake erie and i have never thought the color of the sea comparable to the tender blue of the lake i did not hint my disappointment to my friend i had too much regard for the feelings of an eastern man to decry his ocean to his face and i felt besides that it would be vulgar and provincial to make comparisons i am glad now that i held my tongue for that kind soul is no longer in this world and i should not like to think he knew how far short of my expectations the sea he was so proud of had fallen i went up with him into a tower or belvedere there was at hand and when he pointed to the eastern horizon and said now there was nothing but sea between us and africa i pretended to expand with the thought and began to sound myself for the emotions which i ought to have felt at such a sight but in my heart i was empty and heaven knows whether i saw the steamer which the ancient mariner in charge of that tower invited me to look at through his telescope i never could see anything but a vitreous glare through a telescope which has a vicious habit of dodging about through space and failing to bring down anything of less than planetary magnitude  but there was something at portland vastly more to me than seas or continents and that was the house where longfellow was born i believe now i did not get the right house but only the house he went to live in later but it served and i rejoiced in it with a rapture that could not have been more genuine if it had been the real birthplace of the poet i got my friend to show me         the breezy dome of groves         the shadows of deerings woods  because they were in one of longfellows loveliest and tenderest poems and i made an errand to the docks for the sake of the         black wharves and the slips         and the seatides tossing free         and spanish sailors with bearded lips         and the beauty and mystery of the ships         and the magic of the sea  mainly for the reason that these were colors and shapes of the fond vision of the poets past i am in doubt whether it was at this time or a later time that i went to revere         the dead captains as they lay         in their graves oerlooking the tranquil bay         where they in battle died  but i am quite sure it was now that i wandered under         the trees which shadow each wellknown street         as they balance up and down  for when i was next in portland the great fire had swept the city avenues bare of most of those beautiful elms whose gothic arches and traceries i well remember  the fact is that in those days i was bursting with the most romantic expectations of life in every way and i looked at the whole world as material that might be turned into literature or that might be associated with it somehow i do not know how i managed to keep these preposterous hopes within me but perhaps the trick of satirizing them which i had early learnt helped me to do it i was at that particular moment resolved above all things to see things as heinrich heine saw them or at least to report them as he did no matter how i saw them and i went about framing phrases to this end and trying to match the objects of interest to them whenever there was the least chance of getting them together     vi  i do not know how i first arrived in boston or whether it was before or after i had passed a day or two in salem as salem is on the way from portland i will suppose that i stopped there first and explored the quaint old town quainter then than now but still quaint enough for the memorials of hawthorne and of the witches which united to form the salem i cared for i went and looked up the house of seven gables and suffered an unreasonable disappointment that it had not a great many more of them but there was no loss in the deathwarrant of bridget bishop with the sheriffs return of execution upon it which i found at the courthouse if anything the pathos of that witness of one of the cruelest delusions in the world was rather in excess of my needs i could have got on with less i saw the pins which the witches were sworn to have thrust into the afflicted children and i saw gallows hill where the hapless victims of the perjury were hanged but that deathwarrant remained the most vivid color of my experience of the tragedy i had no need to invite myself to a sense of it and it is still like a stain of red in my memory  the kind old ships captain whose guest i was and who was transfigured to poetry in my sense by the fact that he used to voyage to the african coast for palmoil in former days led me all about the town and showed me the customhouse which i desired to see because it was in the preface to the scarlet letter but i perceived that he did not share my enthusiasm for the author and i became more and more sensible that in salem air there was a cool undercurrent of feeling about him no doubt the place was not altogether grateful for the celebrity his romance had given it and would have valued more the uninterrupted quiet of its own flattering thoughts of itself but when it came to hearing a young lady say she knew a girl who said she would like to poison hawthorne it seemed to the devout young pilgrim from the west that something more of love for the great romancer would not have been too much for him hawthorne had already had his say however and he had not used his native town with any great tenderness indeed the advantages to any place of having a great genius born and reared in its midst are so doubtful that it might be well for localities designing to become the birthplaces of distinguished authors to think twice about it perhaps only the largest capitals like london and paris and new york and chicago ought to risk it but the authors have an unaccountable perversity and will seldom come into the world in the large cities which are alone without the sense of neighborhood and the personal susceptibilities so unfavorable to the practice of the literary art i dare say that it was owing to the local indifference to her greatest name or her reluctance from it that i got a clearer impression of salem in some other respects than i should have had if i had been invited there to devote myself solely to the associations of hawthorne for the first time i saw an old new england town i do not know but the most characteristic and took into my young western consciousness the fact of a more complex civilization than i had yet known my whole life had been passed in a region where men were just beginning ancestors and the conception of family was very imperfect literature of course was full of it and it was not for a devotee of thackeray to be theoretically ignorant of its manifestations but i had hitherto carelessly supposed that family was nowhere regarded seriously in america except in virginia where it furnished a joke for the rest of the nation but now i found myself confronted with it in its ancient houses and heard its names pronounced with a certain consideration which i dare say was as much their due in salem as it could be anywhere the names were all strange and all indifferent to me but those fine square wooden mansions of a tasteful architecture and a pale buffcolor withdrawing themselves in quiet reserve from the quiet street gave me an impression of family as an actuality and a force which i had never had before but which no westerner can yet understand the east without taking into account i do not suppose that i conceived of family as a fact of vital import then i think i rather regarded it as a color to be used in any aesthetic study of the local conditions i am not sure that i valued it more even for literary purposes than the steeple which the captain pointed out as the first and last thing he saw when he came and went on his long voyages or than the great palmoil casks which he showed me and which i related to the tree that stood          auf brennender felsenwand  whether that was the kind of palm that gives the oil or was a sort only suitable to be the dream of a lonely firtree in the north on a cold height i am in doubt to this day  i heard not without concern that the neighboring industry of lynn was penetrating salem and that the ancient haunt of the witches and the birthplace of our subtlest and somberest wizard was becoming a great shoetown but my concern was less for its memories and sensibilities than for an odious duty which i owed that industry together with all the others in new england before i left home i had promised my earliest publisher that i would undertake to edit or compile or do something literary to a work on the operation of the more distinctive mechanical inventions of our country which he had conceived the notion of publishing by subscription he had furnished me the most immechanical of humankind with a letter addressed generally to the great mills and factories of the east entreating their managers to unfold their mysteries to me for the purposes of this volume his letter had the effect of shutting up some of them like clams and others it put upon their guard against my researches lest i should seize the secret of their special inventions and publish it to the world i could not tell the managers that i was both morally and mentally incapable of this that they might have explained and demonstrated the properties and functions of their most recondite machinery and upon examination afterwards found me guiltless of having anything but a few verses of heine or tennyson or longfellow in my head so i had to suffer in several places from their unjust anxieties and from my own weariness of their ingenious engines or else endure the pangs of a bad conscience from ignoring them as long as i was in canada i was happy for there was no industry in canada that i saw except that of the peasant girls in their evangeline hats and kirtles tossing the hay in the wayside fields but when i reached portland my troubles began i went with that young minister of whom i have spoken to a large foundry where they were casting some sort of ironmongery and inspected the process from a distance beyond any chance spurt of the molten metal and came away sadly uncertain of putting the rather fine spectacle to any practical use a manufactory where they did something with coaloil which i now heard for the first time called kerosene refused itself to me and i said to myself that probably all the other industries of portland were as reserved and i would not seek to explore them but when i got to salem my conscience stirred again if i knew that there were shoeshops in salem ought not i to go and inspect their processes this was a question which would not answer itself to my satisfaction and i had no peace till i learned that i could see shoemaking much better at lynn and that lynn was such a little way from boston that i could readily run up there if i did not wish to examine the shoe machinery at once i promised myself that i would run up from boston but in order to do this i must first go to boston     vii  i am supposing still that i saw salem before i saw boston but however the fact may be i am sure that i decided it would be better to see shoemaking in lynn where i really did see it thirty years later for the purposes of the present visit i contented myself with looking at a machine in haverhill which chewed a shoe sole full of pegs and dropped it out of its iron jaws with an indifference as great as my own and probably as little sense of how it had done its work i may be unjust to that machine heaven knows i would not wrong it and i must confess that my head had no room in it for the conception of any machinery but the mythological which also i despised in my revulsion from the eighteenthcentury poets to those of my own day  i cannot quite make out after the lapse of so many years just how or when i got to haverhill or whether it was before or after i had been in salem there is an apparitional quality in my presences at this point or that in the dim past but i hope that for the credit of their order ghosts are not commonly taken with such trivial things as i was for instance in haverhill i was much interested by the sight of a young man coming gayly down the steps of the hotel where i lodged in pegtop trousers so much more peg top than my own that i seemed to be wearing mere springbottoms in comparison and in a day when every one who respected himself had a necktie as narrow as he could get this youth had one no wider than a shoestring and red at that while mine measured almost an inch and was black to be sure he was one of a band of negro minstrels who were to give a concert that night and he had a light to excel in fashion  i will suppose for convenience sake that i visited haverhill too before i reached boston somehow that shoepegging machine must come in and it may as well come in here when i actually found myself in boston there were perhaps industries which it would have been well for me to celebrate but i either made believe there were none or else i honestly forgot all about them in either case i released myself altogether to the literary and historical associations of the place i need not say that i gave myself first to the first and it rather surprised me to find that the literary associations of boston referred so largely to cambridge i did not know much about cambridge except that it was the seat of the university where lowell was and longfellow had been professor and somehow i had not realized it as the home of these poets that was rather stupid of me but it is best to own the truth and afterward i came to know the place so well that i may safely confess my earlier ignorance  i had stopped in boston at the tremont house which was still one of the first hostelries of the country and i must have inquired my way to cambridge there but i was sceptical of the direction the cambridge horsecar took when i found it and i hinted to the driver my anxieties as to why he should be starting east when i had been told that cambridge was west of boston he reassured me in the laconic and sarcastic manner of his kind and we really reached cambridge by the route he had taken  the beautiful elms that shaded great part of the way massed themselves in the groves of academe at the square and showed pleasant glimpses of old harvards scholar factories red then far fewer than now it must have been in vacation for i met no one as i wandered through the college yard trying to make up my mind as to how i should learn where lowell lived for it was he whom i had come to find he had not only taken the poems i sent him but he had printed two of them in a single number of the atlantic and had even written me a little note about them which i wore next my heart in my breast pocket till i almost wore it out and so i thought i might fitly report myself to him but i have always been helpless in finding my way and i was still depressed by my failure to convince the horsecar driver that he had taken the wrong road i let several people go by without questioning them and those i did ask abashed me farther by not knowing what i wanted to know when i had remitted my search for the moment an ancient man with an open mouth and an inquiring eye whom i never afterwards made out in cambridge addressed me with a hospitable offer to show me the washington elm i thought this would give me time to embolden myself for the meeting with the editor of the atlantic if i should ever find him and i went with that kind old man who when he had shown me the tree and the spot where washington stood when he took command of the continental forces said that he had a branch of it and that if i would come to his house with him he would give me a piece in the end i meant merely to flatter him into telling me where i could find lowell but i dissembled my purpose and pretended a passion for a piece of the historic elm and the old man led me not only to his house but his woodhouse where he sawed me off a block so generous that i could not get it into my pocket i feigned the gratitude which i could see that he expected and then i took courage to put my question to him perhaps that patriarch lived only in the past and cared for history and not literature he confessed that he could not tell me where to find lowell but he did not forsake me he set forth with me upon the street again and let no man pass without asking him in the end we met one who was able to say where mr lowell was and i found him at last in a little study at the rear of a pleasant oldfashioned house near the delta  lowell was not then at the height of his fame he had just reached this thirty years after when he died but i doubt if he was ever after a greater power in his own country or more completely embodied the literary aspiration which would not and could not part itself from the love of freedom and the hope of justice for the sake of these he had been willing to suffer the reproach which followed their friends in the earlier days of the antislavery struggle he had outlived the reproach long before but the fear of his strength remained with those who had felt it and he had not made himself more generally loved by the fable for critics than by the biglow papers probably but in the vision of sir launfal and the legend of brittany he had won a liking if not a listening far wider than his humor and his wit had got him and in his lectures on the english poets given not many years before he came to the charge of the atlantic he had proved himself easily the wisest and finest critic in our language he was already more than any american poet          dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn                   the love of love  and he held a place in the public sense which no other author among us has held i had myself never been a great reader of his poetry when i met him though when i was a boy of ten years i had heard my father repeat passages from the biglow papers against war and slavery and the war for slavery upon mexico and later i had read those criticisms of english poetry and i knew sir launfal must be lowell in some sort but my love for him as a poet was chiefly centred in my love for his tender rhyme auf wiedersehen which i can not yet read without something of the young pathos it first stirred in me i knew and felt his greatness some how apart from the literary proofs of it he ruled my fancy and held my allegiance as a character as a man and i am neither sorry nor ashamed that i was abashed when i first came into his presence and that in spite of his words of welcome i sat inwardly quaking before him he was then fortyone years old and nineteen my senior and if there had been nothing else to awe me i might well have been quelled by the disparity of our ages but i have always been willing and even eager to do homage to men who have done something and notably to men who have done something in the sort i wished to do something in myself i could never recognize any other sort of superiority but that i am proud to recognize and i had before lowell some such feeling as an obscure subaltern might have before his general he was by nature a bit of a disciplinarian and the effect was from him as well as in me i dare say he let me feel whatever difference there was as helplessly as i felt it at the first encounter with people he always was apt to have a certain frosty shyness a smiling cold as from the long highsunned winters of his puritan race he was not quite himself till he had made you aware of his quality then no one could be sweeter tenderer warmer than he then he made you free of his whole heart but you must be his captive before he could do that his whole personality had now an instant charm for me i could not keep my eyes from those beautiful eyes of his which had a certain starry serenity and looked out so purely from under his white forehead shadowed with auburn hair untouched by age or from the smile that shaped the auburn beard and gave the face in its form and color the christlook which pages portrait has flattered in it  his voice had as great a fascination for me as his face the vibrant tenderness and the crisp clearness of the tones the perfect modulation the clear enunciation the exquisite accent the elect dictioni did not know enough then to know that these were the gifts these were the graces of one from whose tongue our rough english came music such as i should never hear from any other in this speech there was nothing of our slipshod american slovenliness but a truly italian conscience and an artistic sense of beauty in the instrument  i saw before he sat down across his writingtable from me that he was not far from the medium height but his erect carriage made the most of his five feet and odd inches he had been smoking the pipe he loved and he put it back in his mouth presently as if he found himself at greater ease with it when he began to chat or rather to let me show what manner of young man i was by giving me the first word i told him of the trouble i had in finding him and i could not help dragging in something about heines search for borne when he went to see him in frankfort but i felt at once this was a false start for lowell was such an impassioned lover of cambridge which was truly his patria in the italian sense that it must have hurt him to be unknown to any one in it he said a little dryly that he should not have thought i would have so much difficulty but he added forgivingly that this was not his own house which he was out of for the time then he spoke to me of heine and when i showed my ardor for him he sought to temper it with some judicious criticisms and told me that he had kept the first poem i sent him for the long time it had been unacknowledged to make sure that it was not a translation he asked me about myself and my name and its welsh origin and seemed to find the vanity i had in this harmless enough when i said i had tried hard to believe that i was at least the literary descendant of sir james howels he corrected me gently with james howel and took down a volume of the familiar letters from the shelves behind him to prove me wrong this was always his habit as i found afterwards when he quoted anything from a book he liked to get it and read the passage over as if he tasted a kind of hoarded sweetness in the words it visibly vexed him if they showed him in the least mistaken but          the love he bore to learning was at fault  for this foible and that other of setting people right if he thought them wrong i could not assert myself against his version of howelss name for my edition of his letters was far away in ohio and i was obliged to own that the name was spelt in several different ways in it he perceived no doubt why i had chosen the form liked my own with the title which the pleasant old turncoat ought to have had from the many masters he served according to their many minds but never had except from that erring edition he did not afflict me for it though probably it amused him too much he asked me about the west and when he found that i was as proud of the west as i was of wales he seemed even better pleased and said he had always fancied that human nature was laid out on rather a larger scale there than in the east but he had seen very little of the west in my heart i did not think this then and i do not think it now human nature has had more ground to spread over in the west that is all but it was not for me to bandy words with my sovereign he said he liked to hear of the differences between the different sections for what we had most to fear in our country was a wearisome sameness of type  he did not say now or at any other time during the many years i knew him any of those slighting things of the west which i had so often to suffer from eastern people but suffered me to praise it all i would he asked me what way i had taken in coming to new england and when i told him and began to rave of the beauty and quaintness of french canada and to pour out my joy in quebec he said with a smile that had now lost all its frost yes quebec was a bit of the seventeenth century it was in many ways more french than france and its people spoke the language of voltaire with the accent of voltaires time  i do not remember what else he talked of though once i remembered it with what i believed an ineffaceable distinctness i set nothing of it down at the time i was too busy with the letters i was writing for a cincinnati paper and i was severely bent upon keeping all personalities out of them this was very well but i could wish now that i had transgressed at least so far as to report some of the things that lowell said for the paper did not print my letters and it would have been perfectly safe and very useful for the present purpose but perhaps he did not say anything very memorable to do that you must have something positive in your listener and i was the mere response the hollow echo that youth must be in like circumstances i was all the time afraid of wearing my welcome out and i hurried to go when i would so gladly have staid i do not remember where i meant to go or why he should have undertaken to show me the way acrosslots but this was what he did and when we came to a fence which i clambered gracelessly over he put his hands on the top and tried to take it at a bound he tried twice and then laughed at his failure but not with any great pleasure and he was not content till a third trial carried him across then he said i commonly do that the first time as if it were a frequent habit with him while i remained discreetly silent and for that moment at least felt myself the elder of the man who had so much of the boy in him he had indeed much of the boy in him to the last and he parted with each hour of his youth reluctantly pathetically     viii  we walked across what must have been jarvis field to what must have been north avenue and there he left me but before he let me go he held my hand while he could say that he wished me to dine with him only he was not in his own house and he would ask me to dine with him at the parker house in boston and would send me word of the time later  i suppose i may have spent part of the intervening time in viewing the wonders of boston and visiting the historic scenes and places in it and about it i certainly went over to charleston and ascended bunker hill monument and explored the navyyard where the immemorial manofwar begun in jacksons time was then silently stretching itself under its long shed in a poetic arrest as if the failure of the appropriation for its completion had been some kind of enchantment in boston i early presented my letter of credit to the publisher it was drawn upon not that i needed money at the moment but from a young eagerness to see if it would be honored and a literary attache of the house kindly went about with me and showed me the life of the city a great city it seemed to me then and a seething vortex of business as well as a whirl of gaiety as i saw it in washington street and in a promenade concert at copelands restaurant in tremont row probably i brought some idealizing force to bear upon it for i was not all so strange to the world as i must seem perhaps i accounted for quality as well as quantity in my impressions of the new england metropolis and aggrandized it in the ratio of its literary importance it seemed to me old even after quebec and very likely i credited the actual town with all the dead and gone bostonians in my sentimental census if i did not it was no fault of my cicerone who thought even more of the city he showed me than i did i do not know now who he was and i never saw him after i came to live there with any certainty that it was he though i was often tormented with the vision of a spectacled face like his but not like enough to warrant me in addressing him  he became part of that ghostly boston of my first visit which would sometimes return and possess again the city i came to know so familiarly in later years and to be so passionately interested in some color of my prime impressions has tinged the fictitious experiences of people in my books but i find very little of it in my memory this is like a web of frayed old lace which i have to take carefully into my hold for fear of its fragility and make out as best i can the figure once so distinct in it there are the narrow streets stretching saltworks to the docks which i haunted for their quaintness and there is faunal hall which i cared to see so much more because wendell phillips had spoken in it than because otis and adams had there is the old colonial house and there is the state house which i dare say i explored with the common sloping before it there is beacon street with the hancock house where it is incredibly no more and there are the beginnings of commonwealth avenue and the other streets of the back bay laid out with their basements left hollowed in the made land which the gravel trains were yet making out of the westward hills there is the public garden newly planned and planted but without the massive bridge destined to make so ungratefully little of the lake that occasioned it but it is all very vague and i could easily believe now that it was some one else who saw it then in my place  i think that i did not try to see cambridge the same day that i saw lowell but wisely came back to my hotel in boston and tried to realize the fact i went out another day with an acquaintance from ohio whom i ran upon in the street we went to mount auburn together and i viewed its monuments with a reverence which i dare say their artistic quality did not merit but i am not sorry for this for perhaps they are not quite so bad as some people pretend the gothic chapel of the cemetery unsorted as it was gave me with its halfdozen statues standing or sitting about an emotion such as i am afraid i could not receive now from the acropolis westminster abbey and santa crocea in one i tried hard for some aesthetic sense of it and i made believe that i thought this thing and that thing in the place moved me with its fitness or beauty but the truth is that i had no taste in anything but literature and did not feel the effect i would so willingly have experienced  i did genuinely love the elmy quiet of the dear old cambridge streets though and i had a real and instant pleasure in the yellow colonial houses with their white corners and casements and their green blinds that lurked behind the shrubbery of the avenue i passed through to mount auburn the most beautiful among them was the most interesting for me for it was the house of longfellow my companion who had seen it before pointed it out to me with an air of custom and i would not let him see that i valued the first sight of it as i did i had hoped that somehow i might be so favored as to see longfellow himself but when i asked about him of those who knew they said oh he is at nahant and i thought that nahant must be a great way off and at any rate i did not feel authorized to go to him there neither did i go to see the author of the amber gods who lived at newburyport i was told as if i should know where newburyport was i did not know and i hated to ask besides it did not seem so simple as it had seemed in ohio to go and see a young lady simply because i was infatuated with her literature even as the envoy of all the infatuated young people of columbus i could not quite do this and when i got home i had to account for my failure as best i could another failure of mine was the sight of whittier which i then very much longed to have they said oh whittier lives at amesbury but that put him at an indefinite distance and without the introduction i never would ask for i found it impossible to set out in quest of him in the end i saw no one in new england whom i was not presented to in the regular way except lowell whom i thought i had a right to call upon in my quality of contributor and from the acquaintance i had with him by letter i neither praise nor blame myself for this it was my shyness that with held me rather than my merit there is really no harm in seeking the presence of a famous man and i doubt if the famous man resents the wish of people to look upon him without some measure great or little of affectation there are bores everywhere but he is likelier to find them in the wonted figures of society than in those young people or old people who come to him in the love of what he has done i am well aware how furiously tennyson sometimes met his worshippers and how insolently carlyle but i think these facts are little specks in their sincerity our own gentler and honester celebrities did not forbid approach and i have known some of them caress adorers who seemed hardly worthy of their kindness but that was better than to have hurt any sensitive spirit who had ventured too far by the rules that govern us with common men     ix  my business relations were with the house that so promptly honored my letter of credit this house had published in the east the campaign life of lincoln which i had lately written and i dare say would have published the volume of poems i had written earlier with my friend piatt if there had been any public for it at least i saw large numbers of the book on the counters but all my literary affiliations were with ticknor  fields and it was the old corner bookstore on washington street that drew my heart as soon as i had replenished my pocket in cornhill after verifying the editor of the atlantic monthly i wised to verify its publishers and it very fitly happened that when i was shown into mr fieldss little room at the back of the store with its window looking upon school street and its scholarly keeping in books and prints he had just got the magazine sheets of a poem of mine from the cambridge printers he was then lately from abroad and he had the zest for american things which a foreign sojourn is apt to renew in us though i did not know this then and could not account for it in the kindness he expressed for my poem he introduced me to mr ticknor who i fancied had not read my poem but he seemed to know what it was from the junior partner and he asked me whether i had been paid for it i confessed that i had not and then he got out a chamoisleather bag and took from it five halfeagles in gold and laid them on the green cloth top of the desk in much the shape and of much the size of the great bear i have never since felt myself paid so lavishly for any literary work though i have had more for a single piece than the twentyfive dollars that dazzled me in this constellation the publisher seemed aware of the poetic character of the transaction he let the pieces lie a moment before he gathered them up and put them into my hand and said i always think it is pleasant to have it in gold  but a terrible experience with the poem awaited me and quenched for the moment all my pleasure and pride it was the pilots story which i suppose has had as much acceptance as anything of mine in verse i do not boast of a vast acceptance for it and i had attempted to treat in it a phase of the national tragedy of slavery as i had imagined it on a mississippi steamboat a young planter has gambled away the slavegirl who is the mother of his child and when he tells her she breaks out upon him with the demand     what will you say to our boy when he cries for me there in saint    louis  i had thought this very well and natural and simple but a fatal proofreader had not thought it well enough or simple and natural enough and he had made the line read     what will you say to our boy when he cries for ma there in saint    louis  he had even had the inspiration to quote the word he preferred to the one i had written so that there was no merciful possibility of mistaking it for a misprint and my blood froze in my veins at sight of it mr fields had given me the sheets to read while he looked over some letters and he either felt the chill of my horror or i made some sign or sound of dismay that caught his notice for he looked round at me i could only show him the passage with a gasp i dare say he might have liked to laugh for it was cruelly funny but he did not he was concerned for the magazine as well as for me he declared that when he first read the line he had thought i could not have written it so and he agreed with me that it would kill the poem if it came out in that shape he instantly set about repairing the mischief so far as could be he found that the whole edition of that sheet had been printed and the air blackened round me again lighted up here and there with baleful flashes of the newspaper wit at my cost which i previsioned in my misery i knew what i should have said of such a thing myself if it had been anothers but the publisher at once decided that the sheet must be reprinted and i went away weak as if in the escape from some deadly peril afterwards it appeared that the line had passed the first proofreader as i wrote it but that the final reader had entered so sympathetically into the realistic intention of my poem as to contribute the modification which had nearly been my end     x  as it fell out i lived without farther difficulty to the day and hour of the dinner lowell made for me and i really think looking at myself impersonally and remembering the sort of young fellow i was that it would have been a great pity if i had not the dinner was at the oldfashioned boston hour of two and the table was laid for four people in some little upper room at parkers which i was never afterwards able to make sure of lowell was already there when i came and he presented me to my inexpressible delight and surprise to dr holmes who was there with him  holmes was in the most brilliant hour of that wonderful second youth which his fame flowered into long after the world thought he had completed the cycle of his literary life he had already received full recognition as a poet of delicate wit nimble humor airy imagination and exquisite grace when the autocrat papers advanced his name indefinitely beyond the bounds which most immortals would have found range enough the marvel of his invention was still fresh in the minds of men and time had not dulled in any measure the sense of its novelty his readers all fondly identified him with his work and i fully expected to find myself in the autocrats presence when i met dr holmes but the fascination was none the less for that reason and the winning smile the wise and humorous glance the whole genial manner was as important to me as if i had foreboded something altogether different i found him physically of the napoleonic height which spiritually overtops the alps and i could look into his face without that unpleasant effort which giants of inferior mind so often cost the man of five feet four  a little while after fields came in and then our number and my pleasure were complete  nothing else so richly satisfactory indeed as the whole affair could have happened to a like youth at such a point in his career and when i sat down with doctor holmes and mr fields on lowells right i felt through and through the dramatic perfection of the event the kindly autocrat recognized some such quality of it in terms which were not the less precious and gracious for their humorous excess i have no reason to think that he had yet read any of my poor verses or had me otherwise than wholly on trust from lowell but he leaned over towards his host and said with a laughing look at me well james this is something like the apostolic succession this is the laying on of hands i took his sweet and caressing irony as he meant it but the charm of it went to my head long before any drop of wine together with the charm of hearing him and lowell calling each other james and wendell and of finding them still cordially boys together  i would gladly have glimmered before those great lights in the talk that followed if i could have thought of anything brilliant to say but i could not and so i let them shine without a ray of reflected splendor from me it was such talk as i had of course never heard before and it is not saying enough to say that i have never heard such talk since except from these two men it was as light and kind as it was deep and true and it ranged over a hundred things with a perpetual sparkle of doctor holmess wit and the constant glow of lowells incandescent sense from time to time fields came in with one of his delightful stories sketches of character they were which he sometimes did not mind caricaturing or with some criticism of the literary situation from his standpoint of both lover and publisher of books i heard fames that i had accepted as proofs of power treated as factitious and witnessed a frankness concerning authorship far and near that i had not dreamed of authors using when doctor holmes understood that i wrote for the saturday press which was running amuck among some bostonian immortalities of the day he seemed willing that i should know they were not thought so very undying in boston and that i should not take the notion of a mutual admiration society too seriously or accept the new york bohemian view of boston as true for the most part the talk did not address itself to me but became an exchange of thoughts and fancies between himself and lowell they touched i remember on certain matters of technique and the doctor confessed that he had a prejudice against some words that he could not overcome for instance he said nothing could induce him to use neath for beneath no exigency of versification or stress of rhyme lowell contended that he would use any word that carried his meaning and i think he did this to the hurt of some of his earlier things he was then probably in the revolt against too much literature in literature which every one is destined sooner or later to share there was a certain roughness very like crudeness which he indulged before his thought and phrase mellowed to one music in his later work i tacitly agreed rather with the doctor though i did not swerve from my allegiance to lowell and if i had spoken i should have sided with him i would have given that or any other proof of my devotion fields casually mentioned that he thought the dandelion was the most popularly liked of lowells briefer poems and i made haste to say that i thought so too though i did not really think anything about it and then i was sorry for i could see that the poet did not like it quite and i felt that i was duly punished for my dishonesty  hawthorne was named among other authors probably by fields whose house had just published his marble faun and who had recently come home on the same steamer with him doctor holmes asked if i had met hawthorne yet and when i confessed that i had hardly yet even hoped for such a thing he smiled his winning smile and said ah well i dont know that you will ever feel you have really met him he is like a dim room with a little taper of personality burning on the corner of the mantel  they all spoke of hawthorne and with the same affection but the same sense of something mystical and remote in him and every word was priceless to me but these masters of the craft i was prentice to probably could not have said anything that i should not have found wise and well and i am sure now i should have been the loser if the talk had shunned any of the phases of human nature which it touched it is best to find that all men are of the same make and that there are certain universal things which interest them as much as the supernal things and amuse them even more there was a saying of lowells which he was fond of repeating at the menace of any form of the transcendental and he liked to warn himself and others with his homely remember the dinnerbell what i recall of the whole effect of a time so happy for me is that in all that was said however high however fine we were never out of hearing of the dinnerbell and perhaps this is the best effect i can leave with the reader it was the first dinner served in courses that i had sat down to and i felt that this service gave it a romantic importance which the older fashion of the west still wanted even at governor chases table in columbus the governor carved i knew of the dinner a la russe as it was then called only from books and it was a sort of literary flavor that i tasted in the successive dishes when it came to the black coffee and then to the petits verres of cognac with lumps of sugar set fire to atop it was something that so far transcended my homekept experience that it began to seem altogether visionary  neither fields nor doctor holmes smoked and i had to confess that i did not but lowell smoked enough for all three and the spark of his cigar began to show in the waning light before we rose from the table the time that never had nor can ever have its fellow for me had to come to an end as all times must and when i shook hands with lowell in parting he overwhelmed me by saying that if i thought of going to concord he would send me a letter to hawthorne i was not to see lowell again during my stay in boston but doctor holmes asked me to tea for the next evening and fields said i must come to breakfast with him in the morning     xi  i recall with the affection due to his friendly nature and to the kindness afterwards to pass between us for many years the whole aspect of the publisher when i first saw him his abundant hair and his full beard as broad as ony spade that flowed from his throat in homeric curls were touched with the first frost he had a fine color and his eyes as keen as they were kind twinkled restlessly above the wholesome russetred of his cheeks his portly frame was clad in those scotch tweeds which had not yet displaced the traditional broadcloth with us in the west though i had sent to new york for a rough suit and so felt myself not quite unworthy to meet a man fresh from the hands of the london tailor  otherwise i stood as much in awe of him as his jovial soul would let me and if i might i should like to suggest to the literary youth of this day some notion of the importance of his name to the literary youth of my day he gave aesthetic character to the house of ticknor  fields but he was by no means a silent partner on the economic side no one can forecast the fortune of a new book but he knew as well as any publisher can know not only whether a book was good but whether the reader would think so and i suppose that his house made as few bad guesses along with their good ones as any house that ever tried the uncertain temper of the public with its ventures in the minds of all who loved the plain brown cloth and tasteful print of its issues he was more or less intimately associated with their literature and those who were not mistaken in thinking de quincey one of the delightfulest authors in the world were especially grateful to the man who first edited his writings in book form and proud that this edition was the effect of american sympathy with them at that day i believed authorship the noblest calling in the world and i should still be at a loss to name any nobler the great authors i had met were to me the sum of greatness and if i could not rank their publisher with them by virtue of equal achievement i handsomely brevetted him worthy of their friendship and honored him in the visible measure of it  in his house beside the charles and in the close neighborhood of doctor holmes i found an odor and an air of books such as i fancied might belong to the famous literary houses of london it is still there that friendly home of lettered refinement and the gracious spirit which knew how to welcome me and make the least of my shyness and strangeness and the most of the little else there was in me illumines it still though my host of that rapturous moment has many years been of those who are only with us unseen and unheard i remember his burlesque pretence that morning of an inextinguishable grief when i owned that i had never eaten blueberry cake before and how he kept returning to the pathos of the fact that there should be a region of the earth where blueberry cake was unknown we breakfasted in the pretty room whose windows look out through leaves and flowers upon the rivers coming and going tides and whose walls were covered with the faces and the autographs of all the contemporary poets and novelists the fieldses had spent some days with tennyson in their recent english sojourn and mrs fields had much to tell of him how he looked how he smoked how he read aloud and how he said when he asked her to go with him to the tower of his house come up and see the sad english sunset which had an instant value to me such as some rich verse of his might have had i was very new to it all how new i could not very well say but i flattered myself that i breathed in that atmosphere as if in the return from lifelong exile still i patriotically bragged of the west a little and i told them proudly that in columbus no book since uncle toms cabin had sold so well as the marble faun this made the effect that i wished but whether it was true or not heaven knows i only know that i heard it from our leading bookseller and i made no question of it myself  after breakfast fields went away to the office and i lingered while mrs fields showed me from shelf to shelf in the library and dazzled me with the sight of authors copies and volumes invaluable with the autographs and the pencilled notes of the men whose names were dear to me from my love of their work everywhere was some souvenir of the living celebrities my hosts had met and whom had they not met in that english sojourn in days before england embittered herself to us during our civil war not tennyson only but thackeray but dickens but charles reade but carlyle but many a minor fame was in my ears from converse so recent with them that it was as if i heard their voices in their echoed words  i do not remember how long i stayed i remember i was afraid of staying too long and so i am sure i did not stay as long as i should have liked but i have not the least notion how i got away and i am not certain where i spent the rest of a day that began in the clouds but had to be ended on the common earth i suppose i gave it mostly to wandering about the city and partly to recording my impressions of it for that newspaper which never published them the summer weather in boston with its sunny heat struck through and through with the coolness of the sea and its clear air untainted with a breath of smoke i have always loved but it had then a zest unknown before and i should have thought it enough simply to be alive in it but everywhere i came upon something that fed my famine for the old the quaint the picturesque and however the day passed it was a banquet a festival i can only recall my breathless first sight of the public library and of the athenaeum gallery great sights then which the vatican and the pitti hardly afterwards eclipsed for mere emotion in fact i did not see these elder treasuries of literature and art between breakfasting with the autocrats publisher in the morning and taking tea with the autocrat himself in the evening and that made a whole worlds difference     xii  the tea of that simpler time is wholly inconceivable to this generation which knows the thing only as a mild form of afternoon reception but i suppose that in 1860 very few dined late in our whole pastoral republic tea was the meal people asked people to when they wished to sit at long leisure and large ease it came at the end of the day at six oclock or seven and one went to it in morning dress it had an unceremonied domesticity in the abundance of its light dishes and i fancy these did not vary much from east to west except that we had a southern touch in our fried chicken and corn bread but at the autocrats tea table the cheering cup had a flavor unknown to me before that day he asked me if i knew it and i said it was english breakfast tea for i had drunk it at the publishers in the morning and was willing not to seem strange to it ah yes he said but this is the flower of the souchong it is the blossom the poetry of tea and then he told me how it had been given him by a friend a merchant in the china trade which used to flourish in boston and was the poetry of commerce as this delicate beverage was of tea that commerce is long past and i fancy that the plant ceased to bloom when the traffic fell into decay  the autocrats windows had the same outlook upon the charles as the publishers and after tea we went up into a back parlor of the same orientation and saw the sunset die over the water and the westering flats and hills nowhere else in the world has the day a lovelier close and our talk took something of the mystic coloring that the heavens gave those mantling expanses it was chiefly his talk but i have always found the best talkers are willing that you should talk if you like and a quick sympathy and a subtle sense met all that i had to say from him and from the unbroken circle of kindred intelligences about him i saw him then in the midst of his family and perhaps never afterwards to better advantage or in a finer mood we spoke of the things that people perhaps once liked to deal with more than they do now of the intimations of immortality of the experiences of morbid youth and of all those messages from the tremulous nerves which we take for prophecies i was not ashamed before his tolerant wisdom to acknowledge the effects that had lingered so long with me in fancy and even in conduct from a time of broken health and troubled spirit and i remember the exquisite tact in him which recognized them as things common to all however peculiar in each which left them mine for whatever obscure vanity i might have in them and yet gave me the companionship of the whole race in their experience we spoke of forebodings and presentiments we approached the mystic confines of the world from which no traveller has yet returned with a passport en regle and properly vise and he held his light course through these filmy impalpabilities with a charming sincerity with the scientific conscience that refuses either to deny the substance of things unseen or to affirm it in the gathering dusk so weird did my fortune of being there and listening to him seem that i might well have been a blessed ghost for all the reality i felt in myself  i tried to tell him how much i had read him from my boyhood and with what joy and gain and he was patient of these futilities and i have no doubt imagined the love that inspired them and accepted that instead of the poor praise when the sunset passed and the lamps were lighted and we all came back to our dear little firmset earth he began to question me about my native region of it from many forgotten inquiries i recall his asking me what was the fashionable religion in columbus or the church that socially corresponded to the unitarian church in boston he had first to clarify my intelligence as towhat unitarianism was we had universalists but not unitarians but when i understood i answered from such vantage as my own wholly outside swedenborgianism gave me that i thought most of the most respectable people with us were of the presbyterian church some were certainly episcopalians but upon the whole the largest number were presbyterians he found that very strange indeed and said that he did not believe there was a presbyterian church in boston that the new england calvinists were all of the orthodox church he had to explain oxthodoxy to me and then i could confess to one congregational church in columbus  probably i failed to give the autocrat any very clear image of our social frame in the west but the fault was altogether mine if i did such lecturing tours as he had made had not taken him among us as those of emerson and other newenglanders had and my report was positive rather than comparative i was full of pride in journalism at that day and i dare say that i vaunted the brilliancy and power of our newspapers more than they merited i should not have been likely to wrong them otherwise it is strange that in all the talk i had with him and lowell or rather heard from them i can recall nothing said of political affairs though lincoln had then been nominated by the republicans and the civil war had practically begun but we did not imagine such a thing in the north we rested secure in the belief that if lincoln were elected the south would eat all its fiery words perhaps from the mere love and inveterate habit of fireeating  i rent myself away from the autocrats presence as early as i could and as my evening had been too full of happiness to sleep upon at once i spent the rest of the night till two in the morning wandering about the streets and in the common with a harvard senior whom i had met he was a youth of like literary passions with myself but of such different traditions in every possible way that his deeply schooled and definitely regulated life seemed as anomalous to me as my own desultory and selffound way must have seemed to him we passed the time in the delight of trying to make ourselves known to each other and in a promise to continue by letter the effort which duly lapsed into silent patience with the necessarily insoluble problem     xiii  i must have lingered in boston for the introduction to hawthorne which lowell had offered me for when it came with a little note of kindness and counsel for myself such as only lowell had the gift of writing it was already so near sunday that i stayed over till monday before i started i do not recall what i did with the time except keep myself from making it a burden to the people i knew and wandering about the city alone nothing of it remains to me except the fortune that favored me that sunday night with a view of the old granary buryingground on tremont street i found the gates open and i explored every path in the place wreaking myself in such meagre emotion as i could get from the tomb of the franklin family and rejoicing with the whole soul of my western modernity in the evidence of a remote antiquity which so many of the dim inscriptions afforded i do not think that i have ever known anything practically older than these monuments though i have since supped so full of classic and mediaeval ruin i am sure that i was more deeply touched by the epitaph of a poor little puritan maiden who died at sixteen in the early sixteenthirties than afterwards by the tomb of caecilia metella and that the heartache which i tried to put into verse when i got back to my room in the hotel was none the less genuine because it would not lend itself to my literary purpose and remains nothing but pathos to this day     xiv  i am not able to say how i reached the town of lowell where i went before going to concord that i might ease the unhappy conscience i had about those factories which i hated so much to see and have it clean for the pleasure of meeting the fabricator of visions whom i was authorized to molest in any aircastle where i might find him i only know that i went to lowell and visited one of the great mills which with their whirring spools the ceaseless flight of their shuttles and the bewildering sight and sound of all their mechanism have since seemed to me the death of the joy that ought to come from work if not the captivity of those who tended them but then i thought it right and well for me to be standing by          with sick and scornful looks averse  while these others toiled i did not see the tragedy in it and i got my pitiful literary antipathy away as soon as i could no wiser for the sight of the ingenious contrivances i inspected and i am sorry to say no sadder in the cool of the evening i sat at the door of my hotel and watched the long files of the workworn factorygirls stream by with no concern for them but to see which was pretty and which was plain and with no dream of a truer order than that which gave them ten hours work a day in those hideous mills and lodged them in the barracks where they rested from their toil  i wonder if there is a stage that still runs between lowell and concord past meadow walls and under the caressing boughs of wayside elms and through the birdhaunted gloom of woodland roads in the freshness of the summer morning by a blessed chance i found that there was such a stage in 1860 and i took it from my hotel instead of going back to boston and up to concord as i must have had to do by train the journey gave me the intimacy of the new england country as i could have had it in no other fashion and for the first time i saw it in all the summer sweetness which i have often steeped my soul in since the meadows were newly mown and the air was fragrant with the grass stretching in long winrows among the brown bowlders or capped with canvas in the little haycocks it had been gathered into the day before i was fresh from the affluent farms of the western reserve and this care of the grass touched me with a rude pity which i also bestowed on the meagre fields of corn and wheat but still the land was lovelier than any i had ever seen with its old farmhouses and brambled gray stone walls its stony hillsides its staggering orchards its wooded tops and its thickbrackened valleys from west to east the difference was as great as i afterwards found it from america to europe and my impression of something quaint and strange was no keener when i saw old england the next year than when i saw new england now i had imagined the landscape bare of trees and i was astonished to find it almost as full of them as at home though they all looked very little as they well might to eyes used to the primeval forests of ohio the road ran through them from time to time and took their coolness on its smooth hard reaches and then issued again in the glisten of the open fields  i made phrases to myself about the scenery as we drove along and yes i suppose i made phrases about the young girl who was one of the inside passengers and who when the common strangeness had somewhat worn off began to sing and sang most of the way to concord perhaps she was not very sage and i am sure she was not of the caste of vere de vere but she was pretty enough and she had a voice of a birdlike tunableness so that i would not have her out of the memory of that pleasant journey if i could she was long ago an elderly woman if she lives and i suppose she would not now point out her fellowpassenger if he strolled in the evening by the house where she had dismounted upon her arrival in concord and laugh and pull another girl away from the window in the high excitement of the prodigious adventure     xv  her fellowpassenger was in far other excitement he was to see hawthorne and in a manner to meet priscilla and zenobia and hester prynne and little pearl and miriam and hilda and hollingsworth and coverdale and chillingworth and dimmesdale and donatello and kenyon and he had no heart for any such poor little reality as that who could not have been got into any story that one could respect and must have been difficult even in a heinesque poem  i wasted that whole evening and the next morning in fond delaying and it was not until after the indifferent dinner i got at the tavern where i stopped that i found courage to go and present lowells letter to hawthorne i would almost have foregone meeting the weird genius only to have kept that letter for it said certain infinitely precious things of me with such a sweetness such a grace as lowell alone could give his praise years afterwards when hawthorne was dead i met mrs hawthorne and told her of the pang i had in parting with it and she sent it me doubly enriched by hawthornes keeping but now if i were to see him at all i must give up my letter and i carried it in my hand to the door of the cottage he called the wayside it was never otherwise than a very modest place but the modesty was greater then than today and there was already some preliminary carpentry at one end of the cottage which i saw was to result in an addition to it i recall pleasant fields across the road before it behind rose a hill wooded with low pines such as is made in septimius felton the scene of the involuntary duel between septimius and the young british officer i have a sense of the woods coming quite down to the house but if this was so i do not know what to do with a grassy slope which seems to have stretched part way up the hill as i approached i looked for the tower which the author was fabled to climb into at sight of the coming guest and pull the ladder up after him and i wondered whether he would fly before me in that sort or imagine some easier means of escaping me  the door was opened to my ring by a tall handsome boy whom i suppose to have been mr julian hawthorne and the next moment i found myself in the presence of the romancer who entered from some room beyond he advanced carrying his head with a heavy forward droop and with a pace for which i decided that the word would be pondering it was the pace of a bulky man of fifty and his head was that beautiful head we all know from the many pictures of it but hawthornes look was different from that of any picture of him that i have seen it was sombre and brooding as the look of such a poet should have been it was the look of a man who had dealt faithfully and therefore sorrowfully with that problem of evil which forever attracted forever evaded hawthorne it was by no means troubled it was full of a dark repose others who knew him better and saw him oftener were familiar with other aspects and i remember that one night at longfellows table when one of the guests happened to speak of the photograph of hawthorne which hung in a corner of the room lowell said after a glance at it yes its good but it hasnt his fine accipitral pertaining to the look of a bird of prey hawklike dw look  in the face that confronted me however there was nothing of keen alertness but only a sort of quiet patient intelligence for which i seek the right word in vain it was a very regular face with beautiful eyes the mustache still entirely dark was dense over the fine mouth hawthorne was dressed in black and he had a certain effect which i remember of seeming to have on a black cravat with no visible collar he was such a man that if i had ignorantly met him anywhere i should have instantly felt him to be a personage  i must have given him the letter myself for i have no recollection of parting with it before but i only remember his offering me his hand and making me shyly and tentatively welcome after a few moments of the demoralization which followed his hospitable attempts in me he asked if i would not like to go up on his hill with him and sit there where he smoked in the afternoon he offered me a cigar and when i said that i did not smoke he lighted it for himself and we climbed the hill together at the top where there was an outlook in the pines over the concord meadows we found a log and he invited me to a place on it beside him and at intervals of a minute or so he talked while he smoked heaven preserved me from the folly of trying to tell him how much his books had been to me and though we got on rapidly at no time i think we got on better for this interposition he asked me about lowell i dare say for i told him of my joy in meeting him and doctor holmes and this seemed greatly to interest him perhaps because he was so lately from europe where our great men are always seen through the wrong end of the telescope he appeared surprised at my devotion and asked me whether i cared as much for meeting them as i should care for meeting the famous english authors i professed that i cared much more though whether this was true i now have my doubts and i think hawthorne doubted it at the time but he said nothing in comment and went on to speak generally of europe and america he was curious about the west which he seemed to fancy much more purely american and said he would like to see some part of the country on which the shadow or if i must be precise the damned shadow of europe had not fallen i told him i thought the west must finally be characterized by the germans whom we had in great numbers and purely from my zeal for german poetry i tried to allege some proofs of their present influence though i could think of none outside of politics which i thought they affected wholesomely i knew hawthorne was a democrat and i felt it well to touch politics lightly but he had no more to say about the fateful election then pending than holmes or lowell had  with the abrupt transition of his talk throughout he began somehow to speak of women and said he had never seen a woman whom he thought quite beautiful in the same way he spoke of the new england temperament and suggested that the apparent coldness in it was also real and that the suppression of emotion for generations would extinguish it at last then he questioned me as to my knowledge of concord and whether i had seen any of the notable people i answered that i had met no one but himself as yet but i very much wished to see emerson and thoreau i did not think it needful to say that i wished to see thoreau quite as much because he had suffered in the cause of john brown as because he had written the books which had taken me and when he said that thoreau prided himself on coming nearer the heart of a pinetree than any other human being i could say honestly enough that i would rather come near the heart of a man this visibly pleased him and i saw that it did not displease him when he asked whether i was not going to see his next neighbor mr alcott and i confessed that i had never heard of him that surprised as well as pleased him he remarked with whatever intention that there was nothing like recognition to make a man modest and he entered into some account of the philosopher whom i suppose i need not be much ashamed of not knowing then since his influence was of the immediate sort that makes a man important to his townsmen while he is still strange to his countrymen  hawthorne descanted a little upon the landscape and said certain of the pleasant fields below us be longed to him but he preferred his hilltop and if he could have his way those arable fields should be grown up to pines too he smoked fitfully and slowly and in the hour that we spent together his whiffs were of the desultory and unfinal character of his words when we went down he asked me into his house again and would have me stay to tea for which we found the table laid but there was a great deal of silence in it all and at times in spite of his shadowy kindness i felt my spirits sink after tea he showed me a book case where there were a few books toppling about on the halffilled shelves and said coldly this is my library i knew that men were his books and though i myself cared for books so much i found it fit and fine that he should care so little or seem to care so little some of his own romances were among the volumes on these shelves and when i put my finger on the blithedale romance and said that i preferred that to the others his face lighted up and he said that he believed the germans liked that best too  upon the whole we parted such good friends that when i offered to take leave he asked me how long i was to be in concord and not only bade me come to see him again but said he would give me a card to emerson if i liked i answered of course that i should like it beyond all things and he wrote on the back of his card something which i found when i got away to be i find this young man worthy the quaintness the little stiffness of it if one pleases to call it so was amusing to one who was not without his sense of humor but the kindness filled me to the throat with joy in fact i entirely liked hawthorne he had been as cordial as so shy a man could show himself and i perceived with the repose that nothing else can give the entire sincerity of his soul  nothing could have been further from the behavior of this very great man than any sort of posing apparently or a wish to affect me with a sense of his greatness i saw that he was as much abashed by our encounter as i was he was visibly shy to the point of discomfort but in no ignoble sense was he conscious and as nearly as he could with one so much his younger he made an absolute equality between us my memory of him is without alloy one of the finest pleasures of my life in my heart i paid him the same glad homage that i paid lowell and holmes and he did nothing to make me think that i had overpaid him this seems perhaps very little to say in his praise but to my mind it is saying everything for i have known but few great men especially of those i met in early life when i wished to lavish my admiration upon them whom i have not the impression of having left in my debt then a defect of the puritan quality which i have found in many newenglanders is that wittingly or unwittingly they propose themselves to you as an example or if not quite this that they surround themselves with a subtle ether of potential disapprobation in which at the first sign of unworthiness in you they helplessly suffer you to gasp and perish they have good hearts and they would probably come to your succor out of humanity if they knew how but they do not know how hawthorne had nothing of this about him he was no more tacitly than he was explicitly didactic i thought him as thoroughly in keeping with his romances as doctor holmes had seemed with his essays and poems and i met him as i had met the autocrat in the supreme hour of his fame he had just given the world the last of those incomparable works which it was to have finished from his hand the marble faun had worthily followed at a somewhat longer interval than usual the blithedale romance and the house of seven gables and the scarlet letter and had perhaps carried his name higher than all the rest and certainly farther everybody was reading it and more or less bewailing its indefinite close but yielding him that full honor and praise which a writer can hope for but once in his life nobody dreamed that thereafter only precious fragments sketches more or less faltering though all with the divine touch in them were further to enrich a legacy which in its kind is the finest the race has received from any mind as i have said we are always finding new hawthornes but the illusion soon wears away and then we perceive that they were not hawthornes at all that he had some peculiar difference from them which by andby we shall no doubt consent must be his difference from all men evermore  i am painfully aware that i have not summoned before the reader the image of the man as it has always stood in my memory and i feel a sort of shame for my failure he was so altogether simple that it seems as if it would be easy to do so but perhaps a spirit from the other world would be simple too and yet would no more stand at parle or consent to be sketched than hawthorne in fact he was always more or less merging into the shadow which was in a few years wholly to close over him there was nothing uncanny in his presence there was nothing even unwilling but he had that apparitional quality of some great minds which kept shakespeare largely unknown to those who thought themselves his intimates and has at last left him a sort of doubt there was nothing teasing or wilfully elusive in hawthornes impalpability such as i afterwards felt in thoreau if he was not there to your touch it was no fault of his it was because your touch was dull and wanted the use of contact with such natures the hand passes through the veridical phantom without a sense of its presence but the phantom is none the less veridical for all that     xvi  i kept the evening of the day i met hawthorne wholly for the thoughts of him or rather for that reverberation which continues in the young sensibilities after some important encounter it must have been the next morning that i went to find thoreau and i am dimly aware of making one or two failures to find him if i ever really found him at all  he is an author who has fallen into that abeyance awaiting all authors great or small at some time or another but i think that with him at least in regard to his most important book it can be only transitory i have not read the story of his hermitage beside walden pond since the year 1858 but i have a fancy that if i should take it up now i should think it a wiser and truer conception of the world than i thought it then it is no solution of the problem men are not going to answer the riddle of the painful earth by building themselves shanties and living upon beans and watching antfights but i do not believe tolstoy himself has more clearly shown the hollowness the hopelessness the unworthiness of the life of the world than thoreau did in that book if it were newly written it could not fail of a far vaster acceptance than it had then when to those who thought and felt seriously it seemed that if slavery could only be controlled all things else would come right of themselves with us slavery has not only been controlled but it has been destroyed and yet things have not begun to come right with us but it was in the order of providence that chattel slavery should cease before industrial slavery and the infinitely crueler and stupider vanity and luxury bred of it should be attacked if there was then any prevision of the struggle now at hand the seers averted their eyes and strove only to cope with the less evil thoreau himself who had so clear a vision of the falsity and folly of society as we still have it threw himself into the tide that was already in kansas and virginia reddened with war he aided and abetted the john brown raid i do not recall how much or in what sort and he had suffered in prison for his opinions and actions it was this inevitable heroism of his that more than his literature even made me wish to see him and revere him and i do not believe that i should have found the veneration difficult when at last i met him in his insufficient person if he had otherwise been present to my glowing expectation he came into the room a quaint stump figure of a man whose effect of long trunk and short limbs was heightened by his fashionless trousers being let down too low he had a noble face with tossed hair a distraught eye and a fine aquilinity of profile which made me think at once of don quixote and of cervantes but his nose failed to add that foot to his stature which lamb says a nose of that shape will always give a man he tried to place me geographically after he had given me a chair not quite so far off as ohio though still across the whole room for he sat against one wall and i against the other but apparently he failed to pull himself out of his revery by the effort for he remained in a dreamy muse which all my attempts to say something fit about john brown and walden pond seemed only to deepen upon him i have not the least doubt that i was needless and valueless about both and that what i said could not well have prompted an important response but i did my poor best and i was terribly disappointed in the result the truth is that in those days i was a helplessly concrete young person and all forms of the abstract the airdrawn afflicted me like physical discomforts i do not remember that thoreau spoke of his books or of himself at all and when he began to speak of john brown it was not the warm palpable loving fearful old man of my conception but a sort of john brown type a john brown ideal a john brown principle which we were somehow with long pauses between the vague orphic phrases to cherish and to nourish ourselves upon  it was not merely a defeat of my hopes it was a rout and i felt myself so scattered over the field of thought that i could hardly bring my forces together for retreat i must have made some effort vain and foolish enough to rematerialize my old demigod but when i came away it was with the feeling that there was very little more left of john brown than there was of me his body was not mouldering in the grave neither was his soul marching on his ideal his type his principle alone existed and i did not know what to do with it i am not blaming thoreau his words were addressed to a far other understanding than mine and it was my misfortune if i could not profit by them i think or i venture to hope that i could profit better by them now but in this record i am trying honestly to report their effect with the sort of youth i was then     xvii  such as i was i rather wonder that i had the courage after this experiment of thoreau to present the card hawthorne had given me to emerson i must have gone to him at once however for i cannot make out any interval of time between my visit to the disciple and my visit to the master i think it was emerson himself who opened his door to me for i have a vision of the fine old man standing tall on his threshold with the card in his hand and looking from it to me with a vague serenity while i waited a moment on the doorstep below him he must then have been about sixty but i remember nothing of age in his aspect though i have called him an old man his hair i am sure was still entirely dark and his face had a kind of marble youthfulness chiselled to a delicate intelligence by the highest and noblest thinking that any man has done there was a strange charm in emersons eyes which i felt then and always something like that i saw in lincolns but shyer but sweeter and less sad his smile was the very sweetest i have ever beheld and the contour of the mask and the line of the profile were in keeping with this incomparable sweetness of the mouth at once grave and quaint though quaint is not quite the word for it either but subtly not unkindly arch which again is not the word  it was his great fortune to have been mostly misunderstood and to have reached the dense intelligence of his fellowmen after a whole lifetime of perfectly simple and lucid appeal and his countenance expressed the patience and forbearance of a wise man content to bide his time it would be hard to persuade people now that emerson once represented to the popular mind all that was most hopelessly impossible and that in a certain sort he was a national joke the type of the incomprehensible the byword of the poor paragrapher he had perhaps disabused the community somewhat by presenting himself here and there as a lecturer and talking face to face with men in terms which they could not refuse to find as clear as they were wise he was more and more read by certain persons here and there but we are still so far behind him in the reach of his farthinking that it need not be matter of wonder that twenty years before his death he was the most misunderstood man in america yet in that twilight where he dwelt he loomed large upon the imagination the minds that could not conceive him were still aware of his greatness i myself had not read much of him but i knew the essays he was printing in the atlantic and i knew certain of his poems though by no means many yet i had this sense of him that he was somehow beyond and above my ken a presence of force and beauty and wisdom uncompanioned in our literature he had lately stooped from his ethereal heights to take part in the battle of humanity and i suppose that if the truth were told he was more to my young fervor because he had said that john brown had made the gallows glorious like the cross than because he had uttered all those truer and wiser things which will still a hundred years hence be leading the thought of the world  i do not know in just what sort he made me welcome but i am aware of sitting with him in his study or library and of his presently speaking of hawthorne whom i probably celebrated as i best could and whom he praised for his personal excellence and for his fine qualities as a neighbor but his last book he added reflectively is a mere mush and i perceived that this great man was no better equipped to judge an artistic fiction than the groundlings who were then crying out upon the indefinite close of the marble faun apparently he had read it as they had for the story but it seems to me now if it did not seem to me then that as far as the problem of evil was involved the book must leave it where it found it that is forever insoluble and it was rather with that than with his more or less shadowy people that the romancer was concerned emerson had in fact a defective sense as to specific pieces of literature he praised extravagantly and in the wrong place especially among the new things and he failed to see the worth of much that was fine and precious beside the line of his fancy  he began to ask me about the west and about some unknown man in michigan who had been sending him poems and whom he seemed to think very promising though he has not apparently kept his word to do great things i did not find what emerson had to say of my section very accurate or important though it was kindly enough and just enough as to what the west ought to do in literature he thought it a pity that a literary periodical which had lately been started in cincinnati should be appealing to the east for contributions instead of relying upon the writers nearer home and he listened with what patience he could to my modest opinion that we had not the writers nearer home i never was of those westerners who believed that the west was kept out of literature by the jealousy of the east and i tried to explain why we had not the men to write that magazine full in ohio he alleged the man in michigan as one who alone could do much to fill it worthily and again i had to say that i had never heard of him  i felt rather guilty in my ignorance and i had a notion that it did not commend me but happily at this moment mr emerson was called to dinner and he asked me to come with him after dinner we walked about in his pleached garden a little and then we came again into his library where i meant to linger only till i could fitly get away he questioned me about what i had seen of concord and whom besides hawthorne i had met and when i told him only thoreau he asked me if i knew the poems of mr william ellery channing i have known them since and felt their quality which i have gladly owned a genuine and original poetry but i answered then truly that i knew them only from poes criticisms cruel and spiteful things which i should be ashamed of enjoying as i once did  whose criticisms asked emerson  poes i said again  oh he cried out after a moment as if he had returned from a far search for my meaning you mean the jingleman  i do not know why this should have put me to such confusion but if i had written the criticisms myself i do not think i could have been more abashed perhaps i felt an edge of reproof of admonition in a characterization of poe which the world will hardly agree with though i do not agree with the world about him myself in its admiration at any rate it made an end of me for the time and i remained as if already absent while emerson questioned me as to what i had written in the atlantic monthly he had evidently read none of my contributions for he looked at them in the bound volume of the magazine which he got down with the effect of being wholly strange to them and then gravely affixed my initials to each he followed me to the door still speaking of poetry and as he took a kindly enough leave of me he said one might very well give a pleasant hour to it now and then  a pleasant hour to poetry i was meaning to give all time and all eternity to poetry and i should by no means have wished to find pleasure in it i should have thought that a proof of inferior quality in the work i should have preferred anxiety anguish even to pleasure but if emerson thought from the glance he gave my verses that i had better not lavish myself upon that kind of thing unless there was a great deal more of me than i could have made apparent in our meeting no doubt he was right i was only too painfully aware of my shortcoming but i felt that it was shortercoming than it need have been i had somehow not prospered in my visit to emerson as i had with hawthorne and i came away wondering in what sort i had gone wrong i was not a forthputting youth and i could not blame myself for anything in my approaches that merited withholding indeed i made no approaches but as i must needs blame myself for something i fell upon the fact that in my confused retreat from emersons presence i had failed in a certain slight point of ceremony and i magnified this into an offence of capital importance i went home to my hotel and passed the afternoon in pure misery i had moments of wild question when i debated whether it would be better to go back and own my error or whether it would be better to write him a note and try to set myself right in that way but in the end i did neither and i have since survived my mortal shame some forty years or more but at the time it did not seem possible that i should live through the day with it and i thought that i ought at least to go and confess it to hawthorne and let him disown the wretch who had so poorly repaid the kindness of his introduction by such misbehavior i did indeed walk down by the wayside in the cool of the evening and there i saw hawthorne for the last time he was sitting on one of the timbers beside his cottage and smoking with an air of friendly calm i had got on very well with him and i longed to go in and tell him how ill i had got on with emerson i believed that though he cast me off he would understand me and would perhaps see some hope for me in another world though there could be none in this  but i had not the courage to speak of the affair to any one but fields to whom i unpacked my heart when i got back to boston and he asked me about my adventures in concord by this time i could see it in a humorous light and i did not much mind his lying back in his chair and laughing and laughing till i thought he would roll out of it he perfectly conceived the situation and got an amusement from it that i could get only through sympathy with him but i thought it a favorable moment to propose myself as the assistant editor of the atlantic monthly which i had the belief i could very well become with advantage to myself if not to the magazine he seemed to think so too he said that if the place had not just been filled i should certainly have had it and it was to his recollection of this prompt ambition of mine that i suppose i may have owed my succession to a like vacancy some four years later he was charmingly kind he entered with the sweetest interest into the story of my economic life which had been full of changes and chances already but when i said very seriously that now i was tired of these fortuities and would like to be settled in something he asked with dancing eyes  why how old are you  i am twentythree i answered and then the laughing fit took him again  well he said you begin young out there  in my heart i did not think that twentythree was so very young but perhaps it was and if any one were to say that i had been portraying here a youth whose aims were certainly beyond his achievements who was morbidly sensitive and if not conceited was intolerably conscious who had met with incredible kindness and had suffered no more than was good for him though he might not have merited his pain any more than his joy i do not know that i should gainsay him for i am not at all sure that i was not just that kind of youth when i paid my first visit to new england      first impressions of literary new york  it was by boat that i arrived from boston on an august morning of 1860 which was probably of the same quality as an august morning of 1900 i used not to mind the weather much in those days it was hot or it was cold it was wet or it was dry but it was not my affair and i suppose that i sweltered about the strange city with no sense of anything very personal in the temperature until nightfall what i remember is being high up in a hotel long since laid low listening in the summer dark after the long day was done to the niagara roar of the omnibuses whose tide then swept broadway from curb to curb for all the miles of its length at that hour the other city noises were stilled or lost in this vaster volume of sound which seemed to fill the whole night it had a solemnity which the modern comer to new york will hardly imagine for that tide of omnibuses has long since ebbed away and has left the air to the strident discords of the elevated trains and the irregular alarum of the gripcar gongs which blend to no such harmonious thunder as rose from the procession of those ponderous and innumerable vans there was a sort of inner quiet in the sound and when i chose i slept off to it and woke to it in the morning refreshed and strengthened to explore the literary situation in the metropolis     i  not that i think i left this to the second day very probably i lost no time in going to the office of the saturday press as soon as i had my breakfast after arriving and i have a dim impression of anticipating the earliest of the bohemians whose gay theory of life obliged them to a good many hardships in lying down early in the morning and rising up late in the day if it was the officeboy who bore me company during the first hour of my visit byandby the editors and contributors actually began to come in i would not be very specific about them if i could for since that bohemia has faded from the map of the republic of letters it has grown more and more difficult to trace its citizenship to any certain writer there are some living who knew the bohemians and even loved them but there are increasingly few who were of them even in the fond retrospect of youthful follies and errors it was in fact but a sickly colony transplanted from the mother asphalt of paris and never really striking root in the pavements of new york it was a colony of ideas of theories which had perhaps never had any deep root anywhere what these ideas these theories were in art and in life it would not be very easy to say but in the saturday press they came to violent expression not to say explosion against all existing forms of respectability if respectability was your bete noire then you were a bohemian and if you were in the habit of rendering yourself in prose then you necessarily shredded your prose into very fine paragraphs of a sentence each or of a very few words or even of one word i believe this fashion prevailed till very lately with some of the dramatic critics who thought that it gave a quality of epigram to the style and i suppose it was borrowed from the more spasmodic moments of victor hugo by the editor of the press he brought it back with him when he came home from one of those sojourns in paris which possess one of the french accent rather than the french language i long desired to write in that fashion myself but i had not the courage  this editor was a man of such open and avowed cynicism that he may have been for all i know a kindly optimist at heart some say however that he had really talked himself into being what he seemed i only know that his talk the first day i saw him was of such a sort that if he was half as bad he would have been too bad to be he walked up and down his room saying what lurid things he would directly do if any one accused him of respectability so that he might disabuse the minds of all witnesses there were four or five of his assistants and contributors listening to the dreadful threats which did not deceive even so great innocence as mine but i do not know whether they found it the sorry farce that i did they probably felt the fascination for him which i could not disown in spite of my inner disgust and were watchful at the same time for the effect of his words with one who was confessedly fresh from boston and was full of delight in the people he had seen there it appeared with him to be proof of the inferiority of boston that if you passed down washington street half a dozen men in the crowd would know you were holmes or lowell or longfellow or wendell phillips but in broadway no one would know who you were or care to the measure of his smallest blasphemy i have since heard this more than once urged as a signal advantage of new york for the aesthetic inhabitant but i am not sure yet that it is so the unrecognized celebrity probably has his mind quite as much upon himself as if some one pointed him out and otherwise i cannot think that the sense of neighborhood is such a bad thing for the artist in any sort it involves the sense of responsibility which cannot be too constant or too keen if it narrows it deepens and this may be the secret of boston     ii  it would not be easy to say just why the bohemian group represented new york literature to my imagination for i certainly associated other names with its best work but perhaps it was because i had written for the saturday press myself and had my pride in it and perhaps it was because that paper really embodied the new literary life of the city it was clever and full of the wit that tries its teeth upon everything it attacked all literary shams but its own and it made itself felt and feared the young writers throughout the country were ambitious to be seen in it and they gave their best to it they gave literally for the saturday press never paid in anything but hopes of paying vaguer even than promises it is not too much to say that it was very nearly as well for one to be accepted by the press as to be accepted by the atlantic and for the time there was no other literary comparison to be in it was to be in the company of fitz james obrien fitzhugh ludlow mr aldrich mr stedman and whoever else was liveliest in prose or loveliest in verse at that day in new york it was a power and although it is true that as henry giles said of it man cannot live by snappingturtle alone the press was very good snappingturtle or it seemed so then i should be almost afraid to test it now for i do not like snappingturtle so much as i once did and i have grown nicer in my taste and want my snappingturtle of the very best what is certain is that i went to the office of the saturday press in new york with much the same sort of feeling i had in going to the office of the atlantic monthly in boston but i came away with a very different feeling i had found there a bitterness against boston as great as the bitterness against respectability and as boston was then rapidly becoming my second country i could not join in the scorn thought of her and said of her by the bohemians i fancied a conspiracy among them to shock the literary pilgrim and to minify the precious emotions he had experienced in visiting other shrines but i found no harm in that for i knew just how much to be shocked and i thought i knew better how to value certain things of the soul than they yet when their chief asked me how i got on with hawthorne and i began to say that he was very shy and i was rather shy and the king of bohemia took his pipe out to break in upon me with oh a couple of shysters and the rest laughed i was abashed all they could have wished and was not restored to myself till one of them said that the thought of boston made him as ugly as sin then i began to hope again that men who took themselves so seriously as that need not be taken very seriously by me  in fact i had heard things almost as desperately cynical in other newspaper offices before that and i could not see what was so distinctively bohemian in these anime prave these souls so baleful by their own showing but apparently bohemia was not a state that you could well imagine from one encounter and since my stay in new york was to be very short i lost no time in acquainting myself further with it that very night i went to the beercellar once very far up broadway where i was given to know that the bohemian nights were smoked and quaffed away it was said so far west as ohio that the queen of bohemia sometimes came to pfaffs a young girl of a sprightly gift in letters whose name or pseudonym had made itself pretty well known at that day and whose fate pathetic at all times outtragedies almost any other in the history of letters she was seized with hydrophobia from the bite of her dog on a railroad train and made a long journey home in the paroxysms of that agonizing disease which ended in her death after she reached new york but this was after her reign had ended and no such black shadow was cast forward upon pfaffs whose name often figured in the verse and the epigrammatically paragraphed prose of the saturday press i felt that as a contributor and at least a brevet bohemian i ought not to go home without visiting the famous place and witnessing if i could not share the revels of my comrades as i neither drank beer nor smoked my part in the carousal was limited to a german pancake which i found they had very good at pfaffs and to listening to the whirling words of my commensals at the long board spread for the bohemians in a cavernous space under the pavement there were writers for the saturday press and for vanity fair a hopefully comic paper of that day and some of the artists who drew for the illustrated periodicals nothing of their talk remains with me but the impression remains that it was not so good talk as i had heard in boston at one moment of the orgy which went but slowly for an orgy we were joined by some belated bohemians whom the others made a great clamor over i was given to understand they were just recovered from a fearful debauch their locks were still damp from the wet towels used to restore them and their eyes were very frenzied i was presented to these types who neither said nor did anything worthy of their awful appearance but dropped into seats at the table and ate of the supper with an appetite that seemed poor i stayed hoping vainly for worse things till eleven oclock and then i rose and took my leave of a literary condition that had distinctly disappointed me i do not say that it may not have been wickeder and wittier than i found it i only report what i saw and heard in bohemia on my first visit to new york and i know that my acquaintance with it was not exhaustive when i came the next year the saturday press was no more and the editor and his contributors had no longer a common centre the best of the young fellows whom i met there confessed in a pleasant exchange of letters which we had afterwards that he thought the pose a vain and unprofitable one and when the press was revived after the war it was without any of the old bohemian characteristics except that of not paying for material it could not last long upon these terms and again it passed away and still waits its second palingenesis  the editor passed away too not long after and the thing that he had inspired altogether ceased to be he was a man of a certain sardonic power and used it rather fiercely and freely with a joy probably more apparent than real in the pain it gave in my last knowledge of him he was much milder than when i first knew him and i have the feeling that he too came to own before he died that man cannot live by snappingturtle alone he was kind to some neglected talents and befriended them with a vigor and a zeal which he would have been the last to let you call generous the chief of these was walt whitman who when the saturday press took it up had as hopeless a cause with the critics on either side of the ocean as any man could have it was not till long afterwards that his english admirers began to discover him and to make his countrymen some noisy reproaches for ignoring him they were wholly in the dark concerning him when the saturday press which first stood his friend and the young men whom the press gathered about it made him their cult no doubt he was more valued because he was so offensive in some ways than he would have been if he had been in no way offensive but it remains a fact that they celebrated him quite as much as was good for them he was often at pfaffs with them and the night of my visit he was the chief fact of my experience i did not know he was there till i was on my way out for he did not sit at the table under the pavement but at the head of one farther into the room there as i passed some friendly fellow stopped me and named me to him and i remember how he leaned back in his chair and reached out his great hand to me as if he were going to give it me for good and all he had a fine head with a cloud of jovian hair upon it and a branching beard and mustache and gentle eyes that looked most kindly into mine and seemed to wish the liking which i instantly gave him though we hardly passed a word and our acquaintance was summed up in that glance and the grasp of his mighty fist upon my hand i doubt if he had any notion who or what i was beyond the fact that i was a young poet of some sort but he may possibly have remembered seeing my name printed after some very heinesque verses in the press i did not meet him again for twenty years and then i had only a moment with him when he was reading the proofs of his poems in boston some years later i saw him for the last time one day after his lecture on lincoln in that city when he came down from the platform to speak with some handshaking friends who gathered about him then and always he gave me the sense of a sweet and true soul and i felt in him a spiritual dignity which i will not try to reconcile with his printing in the forefront of his book a passage from a private letter of emersons though i believe he would not have seen such a thing as most other men would or thought ill of it in another the spiritual purity which i felt in him no less than the dignity is something that i will no more try to reconcile with what denies it in his page but such things we may well leave to the adjustment of finer balances than we have at hand i will make sure only of the greatest benignity in the presence of the man the apostle of the rough the uncouth was the gentlest person his barbaric yawp translated into the terms of social encounter was an address of singular quiet delivered in a voice of winning and endearing friendliness  as to his work itself i suppose that i do not think it so valuable in effect as in intention he was a liberating force a very imperial anarch in literature but liberty is never anything but a means and what whitman achieved was a means and not an end in what must be called his verse i like his prose if there is a difference much better there he is of a genial and comforting quality very rich and cordial such as i felt him to be when i met him in person his verse seems to me not poetry but the materials of poetry like ones emotions yet i would not misprize it and i am glad to own that i have had moments of great pleasure in it some french critic quoted in the saturday press i cannot think of his name said the best thing of him when he said that he made you a partner of the enterprise for that is precisely what he does and that is what alienates and what endears in him as you like or dislike the partnership it is still something neighborly brotherly fatherly and so i felt him to be when the benign old man looked on me and spoke to me     iii  that night at pfaffs must have been the last of the bohemians for me and it was the last of new york authorship too for the time i do not know why i should not have imagined trying to see curtis whom i knew so much by heart and whom i adored but i may not have had the courage or i may have heard that he was out of town bryant i believe was then out of the country but at any rate i did not attempt him either the bohemians were the beginning and the end of the story for me and to tell the truth i did not like the story i remember that as i sat at that table under the pavement in pfaffs beercellar and listened to the wit that did not seem very funny i thought of the dinner with lowell the breakfast with fields the supper at the autocrats and felt that i had fallen very far in fact it can do no harm at this distance of time to confess that it seemed to me then and for a good while afterwards that a person who had seen the men and had the things said before him that i had in boston could not keep himself too carefully in cotton and this was what i did all the following winter though of course it was a secret between me and me i dare say it was not the worst thing i could have done in some respects  my sojourn in new york could not have been very long and the rest of it was mainly given to viewing the monuments of the city from the windows of omnibuses and the platforms of horsecars the world was so simple then that there were perhaps only a halfdozen cities that had horsecars in them and i travelled in those conveyances at new york with an unfaded zest even after my journeys back and forth between boston and cambridge i have not the least notion where i went or what i saw but i suppose that it was up and down the ugly east and west avenues then lying open to the eye in all the hideousness now partly concealed by the elevated roads and that i found them very stately and handsome indeed new york was really handsomer then than it is now when it has so many more pieces of beautiful architecture for at that day the skyscrapers were not yet and there was a fine regularity in the streets that these brute bulks have robbed of all shapeliness dirt and squalor there were a plenty but there was infinitely more comfort the long succession of cross streets was yet mostly secure from business after you passed clinton place commerce was just beginning to show itself in union square and madison square was still the home of the mcflimsies whose kin and kind dwelt unmolested in the brownstone stretches of fifth avenue i tried hard to imagine them from the acquaintance mr butlers poem had given me and from the knowledge the gentle satire of the potiphar papers had spread broadcast through a community shocked by the excesses of our best society it was not half so bad then as the best now probably but i do not think i made very much of it perhaps because most of the people who ought to have been in those fine mansions were away at the seaside and the mountains  the mountains i had seen on my way down from canada but the seaside not and it would never do to go home without visiting some famous summer resort i must have fixed upon long branch because i must have heard of it as then the most fashionable and one afternoon i took the boat for that place by this means i not only saw seabathing for the first time but i saw a storm at sea a squall struck us so suddenly that it blew away all the campstools of the forward promenade it was very exciting and i long meant to use in literature the black wall of cloud that settled on the water before us like a sort of portable midnight i now throw it away upon the reader as it were it never would come in anywhere i stayed all night at long branch and i had a bath the next morning before breakfast an extremely cold one with a lifeline to keep me against the undertow in this rite i had the company of a young newyorker whom i had met on the boat coming down and who was of the light hopeful adventurous business type which seems peculiar to the city and which has always attracted me he told me much about his life and how he lived and what it cost him to live he had a large room at a fashionable boardinghouse and he paid fourteen dollars a week in columbus i had such a room at such a house and paid three and a half and i thought it a good deal but those were the days before the war when america was the cheapest country in the world and the west was incredibly inexpensive  after a day of lonely splendor at this scene of fashion and gaiety i went back to new york and took the boat for albany on my way home i noted that i had no longer the vivid interest in nature and human nature which i had felt in setting out upon my travels and i said to myself that this was from having a mind so crowded with experiences and impressions that it could receive no more and i really suppose that if the happiest phrase had offered itself to me at some moments i should scarcely have looked about me for a landscape or a figure to fit it to i was very glad to get back to my dear little city in the west i found it seething in an august sun that was hot enough to have calcined the limestone state house and to all the friends i was so fond of     iv  i did what i could to prove myself unworthy of them by refusing their invitations and giving myself wholly to literature during the early part of the winter that followed and i did not realize my error till the invitations ceased to come and i found myself in an unbroken intellectual solitude the worst of it was that an ungrateful muse did little in return for the sacrifices i made her and the things i now wrote were not liked by the editors i sent them to the editorial taste is not always the test of merit but it is the only one we have and i am not saying the editors were wrong in my case there were then such a very few places where you could market your work the atlantic in boston and harpers in new york were the magazines that paid though the independent newspaper bought literary material the saturday press printed it without buying and so did the old knickerbocker magazine though there was pecuniary goodwill in both these cases i toiled much that winter over a story i had long been writing and at last sent it to the atlantic which had published five poems for me the year before after some weeks or it may have been months i got it back with a note saying that the editors had the less regret in returning it because they saw that in the may number of the knickerbocker the first chapter of the story had appeared then i remembered that years before i had sent this chapter to that magazine as a sketch to be printed by itself and afterwards had continued the story from it i had never heard of its acceptance and supposed of course that it was rejected but on my second visit to new york i called at the knickerbocker office and a new editor of those that the magazine was always having in the days of its failing fortunes told me that he had found my sketch in rummaging about in a barrel of his predecessors manuscripts and had liked it and printed it he said that there were fifteen dollars coming to me for that sketch and might he send the money to me i said that he might though i do not see to this day why he did not give it me on the spot and he made a very small minute in a very large sheet of paper really like dick swiveller and promised i should have it that night but i sailed the next day for liverpool without it i sailed without the money for some verses that vanity fair bought of me but i hardly expected that for the editor who was then artemus ward had frankly told me in taking my address that ducats were few at that moment with vanity fair i was then on my way to be consul at venice where i spent the next four years in a vigilance for confederate privateers which none of them ever surprised i had asked for the consulate at munich where i hoped to steep myself yet longer in german poetry but when my appointment came i found it was for rome i was very glad to get rome even but the income of the office was in fees and i thought i had better go on to washington and find out how much the fees amounted to people in columbus who had been abroad said that on five hundred dollars you could live in rome like a prince but i doubted this and when i learned at the state department that the fees of the roman consulate came to only three hundred i perceived that i could not live better than a baron probably and i despaired the kindly chief of the consular bureau said that the presidents secretaries mr john nicolay and mr john hay were interested in my appointment and he advised my going over to the white house and seeing them i lost no time in doing that and i learned that as young western men they were interested in me because i was a young western man who had done something in literature and they were willing to help me for that reason and for no other that i ever knew they proposed my going to venice the salary was then seven hundred and fifty but they thought they could get it put up to a thousand in the end they got it put up to fifteen hundred and so i went to venice where if i did not live like a prince on that income i lived a good deal more like a prince than i could have done at rome on a fifth of it  if the appointment was not present fortune it was the beginning of the best luck i have had in the world and i am glad to owe it all to those friends of my verse who could have been no otherwise friends of me they were then beginning very early careers of distinction which have not been wholly divided mr nicolay could have been about twentyfive and mr hay nineteen or twenty no one dreamed as yet of the opportunity opening to them in being so constantly near the man whose life they have written and with whose fame they have imperishably interwrought their names i remember the sobered dignity of the one and the humorous gaiety of the other and how we had some young mens joking and laughing together in the anteroom where they received me with the great soul entering upon its travail beyond the closed door they asked me if i had ever seen the president and i said that i had seen him at columbus the year before but i could not say how much i should like to see him again and thank him for the favor which i had no claim to at his hands except such as the slight campaign biography i had written could be thought to have given me that day or another as i left my friends i met him in the corridor without and he looked at the space i was part of with his ineffably melancholy eyes without knowing that i was the indistinguishable person in whose integrity and abilities he had reposed such special confidence as to have appointed him consul for venice and the ports of the lombardovenetian kingdom though he might have recognized the terms of my commission if i had reminded him of them i faltered a moment in my longing to address him and then i decided that every one who forebore to speak needlessly to him or to shake his hand did him a kindness and i wish i could be as sure of the wisdom of all my past behavior as i am of that piece of it he walked up to the watercooler that stood in the corner and drew himself a full goblet from it which he poured down his throat with a backward tilt of his head and then went wearily within doors the whole affair so simple has always remained one of a certain pathos in my memory and i would rather have seen lincoln in that unconscious moment than on some statelier occasion     v  i went home to ohio and sent on the bond i was to file in the treasury department but it was mislaid there and to prevent another chance of that kind i carried on the duplicate myself it was on my second visit that i met the generous young irishman william d oconnor at the house of my friend piatt and heard his ardent talk he was one of the promising men of that day and he had written an antislavery novel in the heroic mood of victor hugo which greatly took my fancy and i believe he wrote poems too he had not yet risen to be the chief of walt whitmans champions outside of the saturday press but he had already espoused the theory of bacons authorship of shakespeare then newly exploited by the poor lady of bacons name who died constant to it in an insane asylum he used to speak of the reputed dramatist as the fat peasant of stratford and he was otherwise picturesque of speech in a measure that consoled if it did not convince the great war was then full upon us and when in the silences of our literary talk its awful breath was heard and its shadow fell upon the hearth where we gathered round the first fires of autumn oconnor would lift his beautiful head with a fine effect of prophecy and say friends i feel a sense of victory in the air he was not wrong only the victory was for the other aide  who beside oconnor shared in these saddened symposiums i cannot tell now but probably other young journalists and officeholders intending litterateurs since more or less extinct i make certain only of the young boston publisher who issued a very handsome edition of leaves of grass and then failed promptly if not consequently but i had already met in my first sojourn at the capital a young journalist who had given hostages to poetry and whom i was very glad to see and proud to know mr stedman and i were talking over that meeting the other day and i can be surer than i might have been without his memory that i found him at a friends house where he was nursing himself for some slight sickness and that i sat by his bed while our souls launched together into the joyful realms of hope and praise in him i found the quality of boston the honor and passion of literature and not a mere pose of the literary life and the world knows without my telling how true he has been to his ideal of it his earthly mission then was to write letters from washington for the new york world which started in life as a good young evening paper with a decided religious tone so that the saturday press could call it the nightblooming serious i think mr stedman wrote for its editorial page at times and his relation to it as a washington correspondent had an authority which is wanting to the function in these days of perfected telegraphing he had not yet achieved that seat in the stock exchange whose possession has justified his recourse to business and has helped him to mean something more single in literature than many more singly devoted to it i used sometimes to speak about that with another eager young author in certain middle years when we were chafing in editorial harness and we always decided that stedman had the best of it in being able to earn his living in a sort so alien to literature that he could come to it unjaded and with a gust unspoiled by kindred savors but no man shapes his own life and i dare say that stedman may have been all the time envying us our tripods from his high place in the stock exchange what is certain is that he has come to stand for literature and to embody new york in it as no one else does in a community which seems never to have had a conscious relation to letters he has kept the faith with dignity and fought the fight with constant courage scholar and poet at once he has spoken to his generation with authority which we can forget only in the charm which makes us forget everything else  but his fame was still before him when we met and i could bring to him an admiration for work which had not yet made itself known to so many but any admirer was welcome we talked of what we had done and each said how much he liked certain thing of the others i even seized my advantage of his helplessness to read him a poem of mine which i had in my pocket he advised me where to place it and if the reader will not think it an unfair digression i will tell here what became of that poem for i think its varied fortunes were amusing and i hope my own sufferings and final triumph with it will not be without encouragement to the young literary endeavorer it was a poem called with no prophetic sense of fitness forlorn and i tried it first with the atlantic monthly which would not have it then i offered it in person to a former editor of harpers monthly but he could not see his advantage in it and i carried it overseas to venice with me from that point i sent it to all the english magazines as steadily as the post could carry it away and bring it back on my way home four years later i took it to london with me where a friend who knew lewes then just beginning with the fortnightly review sent it to him for me it was promptly returned with a letter wholly reserved as to its quality but full of a poetic gratitude for my wish to contribute to the fortnightly then i heard that a certain mr lucas was about to start a magazine and i offered the poem to him the kindest letter of acceptance followed me to america and i counted upon fame and fortune as usual when the news of mr lucass death came i will not poorly joke an effect from my poem in the fact but the fact remains by this time i was a writer in the office of the nation newspaper and after i left this place to be mr fieldss assistant on the atlantic i sent my poem to the nation where it was printed at last in such scant measure as my verses have pleased it has found rather unusual favor and i need not say that its misfortunes endeared it to its author  but all this is rather far away from my first meeting with stedman in washington of course i liked him and i thought him very handsome and fine with a full beard cut in the fashion he has always worn it and with poets eyes lighting an aquiline profile afterwards when i saw him afoot i found him of a worldly splendor in dress and envied him as much as i could envy him anything the new york tailor whose art had clothed him i had a new york tailor too but with a difference he had a worldly dash along with his supermundane gifts which took me almost as much and all the more because i could see that he valued himself nothing upon it he was all for literature and for literary men as the superiors of every one i must have opened my heart to him a good deal for when i told him how the newspaper i had written for from canada and new england had ceased to print my letters he said think of a man like sitting in judgment on a man like you i thought of it and was avenged if not comforted and at any rate i liked stedmans standing up so stiffly for the honor of a craft that is rather too limp in some of its votaries  i suppose it was he who introduced me to the stoddards whom i met in new york just before i sailed and who were then in the glow of their early fame as poets they knew about my poor beginnings and they were very very good to me stoddard went with me to franklin square and gave the sanction of his presence to the ineffectual offer of my poem there but what i relished most was the long talks i had with them both about authorship in all its phases and the exchange of delight in this poem and that this novel and that with gay wilful runs away to make some wholly irrelevant joke or fire puns into the air at no mark whatever stoddard had then a fame with the sweetness of personal affection in it from the lyrics and the odes that will perhaps best keep him known and mrs stoddard was beginning to make her distinct and special quality felt in the magazines in verse and fiction in both it seems to me that she has failed of the recognition which her work merits her tales and novels have in them a foretaste of realism which was too strange for the palate of their day and is now too familiar perhaps it is a peculiar fate and would form the scheme of a pretty study in the history of literature but in whatever she did she left the stamp of a talent like no other and of a personality disdainful of literary environment in a time when most of us had to write like tennyson or longfellow or browning she never would write like any one but herself  i remember very well the lodging over a corner of fourth avenue and some downtown street where i visited these winning and gifted people and tasted the pleasure of their racy talk and the hospitality of their goodwill toward all literature which certainly did not leave me out we sat before their grate in the chill of the last october days and they set each other on to one wild flight of wit after another and again i bathed my delighted spirit in the atmosphere of a realm where for the time at least no         rumor of oppression or defeat         of unsuccessful or successful war  could penetrate i liked the stoddards because they were frankly not of that bohemia which i disliked so much and thought it of no promise or validity and because i was fond of their poetry and found them in it i liked the absolutely literary keeping of their lives he had then and for long after a place in the custom house but he was no more of that than lamb was of india house he belonged to that better world where there is no interest but letters and which was as much like heaven for me as anything i could think of  the meetings with the stoddards repeated themselves when i came back to sail from new york early in november mixed up with the cordial pleasure of them in my memory is a sense of the cold and wet outdoors and the misery of being in those infamous new york streets then as for long afterwards the squalidest in the world the last night i saw my friends they told me of the tragedy which had just happened at the camp in the city hall park fitz james obrien the brilliant young irishman who had dazzled us with his story of the diamond lens and frozen our blood with his ingenious tale of a ghostwhat was ita ghost that could be felt and heard but not seenhad enlisted for the war and risen to be an officer with the swift process of the first days of it in that camp he had just then shot and killed a man for some infraction of discipline and it was uncertain what the end would be he was acquitted however and it is known how he afterwards died of lockjaw from a wound received in battle     vi  before this last visit in new york there was a second visit to boston which i need not dwell upon because it was chiefly a revival of the impressions of the first again i saw the fieldses in their home again the autocrat in his and lowell now beneath his own roof beside the study fire where i was so often to sit with him in coming years at dinner which we had at two oclock the talk turned upon my appointment and he said of me to his wife think of his having got stillmans place we ought to put poison in his wine and he told me of the wish the painter had to go to venice and follow up ruskins work there in a book of his own but he would not let me feel very guilty and i will not pretend that i had any personal regret for my good fortune  the place was given me perhaps because i had not nearly so many other gifts as he who lost it and who was at once artist critic journalist traveller and eminently each i met him afterwards in rome which the powers bestowed upon him instead of venice and he forgave me though i do not know whether he forgave the powers we walked far and long over the campagna and i felt the charm of a most uncommon mind in talk which came out richest and fullest in the presence of the wild nature which he loved and knew so much better than most other men i think that the book he would have written about venice is forever to be regretted and i do not at all console myself for its loss with the book i have written myself  at lowells table that day they spoke of what sort of winter i should find in venice and he inclined to the belief that i should want a fire there on his study hearth a very brisk one burned when we went back to it and kept out the chill of a cold easterly storm we looked through one of the windows at the rain and he said he could remember standing and looking out of that window at such a storm when he was a child for he was born in that house and his life had kept coming back to it he died in it at last  in a lifting of the rain he walked with me down to the village as he always called the denser part of the town about harvard square and saw me aboard a horsecar for boston before we parted he gave me two charges to open my mouth when i began to speak italian and to think well of women he said that our race spoke its own tongue with its teeth shut and so failed to master the languages that wanted freer utterance as to women he said there were unworthy ones but a good woman was the best thing in the world and a man was always the better for honoring women     roundabout to boston  during the four years of my life in venice the literary intention was present with me at all times and in all places i wrote many things in verse which i sent to the magazines in every part of the englishspeaking world but they came unerringly back to me except in three instances only when they were kept by the editors who finally printed them one of these pieces was published in the atlantic monthly another in harpers magazine the third was got into the new york ledger through the kindness of doctor edward everett hale who used i know not what mighty magic to that end i had not yet met him but he interested himself in my ballad as if it had been his own his brother charles hale later consulgeneral for egypt whom i saw almost every moment of the two visits he paid venice in my time had sent it to him after copying it in his own large fair hand so that it could be read he was not quite of that literary boston which i so fondly remembered my glimpses of he was rather of a journalistic and literary boston which i had never known but he was of boston after all he had been in lowells classes at harvard he had often met longfellow in cambridge he knew doctor holmes of course and he let me talk of my idols to my hearts content i think he must have been amused by my raptures most people would have been but he was kind and patient and he listened to me with a sweet intelligence which i shall always gratefully remember he died too young with his lifes possibilities mainly unfulfilled but none who knew him could fail to imagine them or to love him for what he was     i  besides those few pitiful successes i had nothing but defeats in the sort of literature which i supposed was to be my calling and the defeats threw me upon prose for some sort of literary thing if not one then another i must do if i lived and i began to write those studies of venetian life which afterwards became a book and which i contributed as letters to the boston advertiser after vainly offering them to more aesthetic periodicals however i do not imagine that it was a very smiling time for any literary endeavorer at home in the lifeanddeath civil war then waging some few young men arose who made themselves heard amid the din of arms even as far as venice but most of these were hushed long ago i fancy theodore winthrop who began to speak as it were from his soldiers grave so soon did his death follow the earliest recognition by the public and so many were his posthumous works was chief of these but there were others whom the present readers must make greater effort to remember forceythe willson who wrote the old sergeant became known for the rare quality of his poetry and now and then there came a poem from aldrich or stedman or stoddard the great new series of the biglow papers gathered volume with the force they had from the beginning the autocrat was often in the pages of the atlantic where one often found whittier and emerson with many a fresh name now faded in washington the piatts were writing some of the most beautiful verse of the war and brownell was sounding his battle lyrics like so many trumpet blasts the fiction which followed the war was yet all to come whatever was done in any kind had some hint of the war in it inevitably though in the very heart of it longfellow was setting about his great version of dante peacefully prayerfully as he has told in the noble sonnets which register the mood of his undertaking  at venice if i was beyond the range of literary recognition i was in direct relations with one of our greatest literary men who was again of that literary boston which mainly represented american literature to me the official chief of the consul at venice was the united states minister at vienna and in my time this minister was john lothrop motley the historian he was removed later by that johnson administration which followed lincolns so forgottenly that i name it with a sense of something almost prehistoric among its worst errors was the attempted discredit of a man who had given lustre to our name by his work and who was an ardent patriot as well as accomplished scholar he visited venice during my first year which was the darkest period of the civil war and i remember with what instant security not to say severity he rebuked my scarcely whispered misgivings of the end when i ventured to ask him what he thought it would be austria had never recognized the secessionists as belligerents and in the complications with france and england there was little for our minister but to share the home indignation at the sympathy of those powers with the south in motley this was heightened by that feeling of astonishment of wounded faith which all americans with english friendships experienced in those days and which he whose english friendships were many experienced in peculiar degree  i drifted about with him in his gondola and refreshed myself long ahungered for such talk with his talk of literary life in london through some acquaintance i had made in venice i was able to be of use to him in getting documents copied for him in the venetian archives especially the relations of the venetian ambassadors at different courts during the period and events he was studying all such papers passed through my hands in transmission to the historian though now i do not quite know why they need have done so but perhaps he was willing to give me the pleasure of being a partner however humble in the enterprise my recollection of him is of courtesy to a far younger man unqualified by patronage and of a presence of singular dignity and grace he was one of the handsomest men i ever saw with beautiful eyes a fine blond beard of modish cut and a sensitive nose straight and fine he was altogether a figure of worldly splendor and i had reason to know that he did not let the credit of our nation suffer at the most aristocratic court in europe for want of a fit diplomatic costume when some of our ministers were trying to make their office do its full effect upon all occasions in the dress of an american gentleman the morning after his arrival mr motley came to me with a handful of newspapers which according to the austrian custom at that day had been opened in the venetian postoffice he wished me to protest against this on his behalf as an infringement of his diplomatic extraterritoriality and i proposed to go at once to the director of the post i had myself suffered in the same way and though i knew that a mere consul was helpless i was willing to see the doubleheaded eagle trodden under foot by a minister plenipotentiary mr motley said that he would go with me and we put off in his gondola to the postoffice the director received us with the utmost deference he admitted the irregularity which the minister complained of and declared that he had no choice but to open every foreign newspaper to whomsoever addressed he suggested however that if the minister made his appeal to the lieutenantgovernor of venice count toggenburg would no doubt instantly order the exemption of his newspapers from the general rule  mr motley said he would give himself the pleasure of calling upon the lieutenantgovernor and how fortunate he added when we were got back into the gondola that i should have happened to bring my court dress with me i did not see the encounter of the high contending powers but i know that it ended in a complete victory for our minister  i had no further active relations of an official kind with mr motley except in the case of a naturalized american citizen whose property was slowly but surely wasting away in the keeping of the venetian courts an order had at last been given for the surrender of the remnant to the owner but the lombardovenetian authorities insisted that this should be done through the united states minister at vienna and mr motley held as firmly that it must be done through the united states consul at venice i could only report to him from time to time the unyielding attitude of the civil tribunal and at last he consented as he wrote to act officiously not officially in the matter and the hapless claimant got what was left of his estate  i had a glimpse of the historian afterwards in boston but it was only for a moment just before his appointment to england where he was made to suffer for sumner in his quarrel with grant that injustice crowned the injuries his country had done a most faithful patriot and highspirited gentleman whose fame as an historian once filled the ear of the englishspeaking world his books seemed to have been written in a spirit already no longer modern and i did not find the greatest of them so moving as i expected when i came to it with all the ardor of my admiration for the historian william the silent seemed to me by his worshippers own showing scarcely level with the popular movement which he did not so much direct as follow but it is a good deal for a prince to be able even to follow his people and it cannot be said that motley does not fully recognize the greatness of the dutch people though he may see the prince of orange too large the study of their character made at least a theoretical democrat of a scholar whose instincts were not perhaps democratic and his sympathy with that brave little republic between the dikes strengthened him in his fealty to the great commonwealth between the oceans i believe that so far as he was of any political tradition he was of the old boston whig tradition but when i met him at venice he was in the glow of a generous pride in our war as a war against slavery he spoke of the negroes and their simplehearted singleminded devotion to the union cause in terms that an original abolitionist might have used at a time when original abolitionists were not so many as they have since become  for the rest i fancy it was very well for us to be represented at vienna in those days by an ideal democrat who was also a real swell and who was not likely to discredit us socially when we so much needed to be well thought of in every way  at a court where the family of count schmerling the prime minister could not be received for want of the requisite descents it was well to have a minister who would not commit the mistake of inviting the first society to meet the second society as a former envoy extraordinary had done with the effect of finding himself left entirely to the second society during the rest of his stay in vienna     ii  one of my consular colleagues under motley was another historian of no such popularity indeed nor even of such success but perhaps not of inferior powers this was richard hildreth at trieste the author of one of the sincerest if not the truest histories of the united states according to the testimony both of his liking and his misliking critics i have never read his history and i speak of it only at second hand but i had read before i met him his novel of archy moore or the white slave which left an indelible impression of his imaginative verity upon me the impression is still so deep that after the lapse of nearly forty years since i saw the book i have no misgiving in speaking of it as a powerful piece of realism it treated passionately intensely though with a superficial coldness of wrongs now so remote from us in the abolition of slavery that it is useless to hope it will ever beg generally read hereafter but it can safely be praised to any one who wishes to study that bygone condition and the literature which grew out of it i fancy it did not lack recognition in its time altogether for i used to see it in italian and french translations on the bookstalls i believe neither his history nor his novel brought the author more gain than fame he had worn himself out on a newspaper when he got his appointment at trieste and i saw him in the shadow of the cloud that was wholly to darken him before he died he was a tall thin man absent silent already a phantom of himself but with a scholarly serenity and dignity amidst the ruin when the worst came  i first saw him at the pretty villa where he lived in the suburbs of trieste and where i passed several days and i remember him always reading reading reading he could with difficulty be roused from his book by some strenuous appeal from his family to his conscience as a host the last night he sat with paradise lost in his hand and nothing could win him from it till he had finished it then he rose to go to bed would not he bid his parting guest goodbye the idea of farewell perhaps dimly penetrated to him he responded without looking round         they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow         through eden took their solitary way  and so left the room  i had earlier had some dealings with him as a fellowconsul concerning a deserter from an american ship whom i inherited from my predecessor at venice the man had already been four or five months in prison and he was in a fair way to end his life there for it is our law that a deserting sailor must be kept in the consuls custody till some vessel of our flag arrives when the consul can oblige the master to take the deserter and let him work his passage home such a vessel rarely came to venice even in times of peace and in times of war there was no hope of any so i got leave of the consul at trieste to transfer my captive to that port where now and then an american ship did touch the flag determines the nationality of the sailor and this unhappy wretch was theoretically our fellowcitizen but when he got to trieste he made a clean breast of it to the consul he confessed that when he shipped under our flag he was a deserter from a british regiment at malta and he begged piteously not to be sent home to america where he had never been in his life nor ever wished to be he wished to be sent back to his regiment at malta and to whatever fate awaited him there the case certainly had its embarrassments but the american consul contrived to let our presumptive compatriot slip into the keeping of the british consul who promptly shipped him to malta in view of the strained relations between england and america at that time this was a piece of masterly diplomacy  besides my old ohiotime friend moncure d conway who paid us a visit and in his immediate relations with literary boston seemed to bring the mountain to mahomet i saw no one else more literary than henry ward beecher he was passing through venice on his way to those efforts in england in behalf of the union which had a certain great effect at the time and in the tiny parlor of our apartment on the grand canal i can still see him sitting athletic almost pugilistic of presence with his strong face but kind framed in long hair that swept above his massive forehead and fell to the level of his humorously smiling mouth his eyes quaintly gleamed at the things we told him of our life in the strange place but he only partly relaxed from his strenuous pose and the hands that lay upon his knees were clinched afterwards as he passed our balcony in a gondola he lifted the brave red fez he was wearing many people wore the fez for one caprice or another and saluted our eagle and us we were often on the balcony behind the shield to attest the authenticity of the american eagle     iii  before i left venice however there came a turn in my literary luck and from the hand i could most have wished to reverse the adverse wheel of fortune i had labored out with great pains a paper on recent italian comedy which i sent to lowell then with his friend professor norton jointly editor of the north american review and he took it and wrote me one of his loveliest letters about it consoling me in an instant for all the defeat i had undergone and making it sweet and worthy to have lived through that misery it is one of the hard conditions of this state that while we can mostly make out to let people taste the last drop of bitterness and illwill that is in us our love and gratitude are only semiarticulate at the best and usually altogether tonguetied as often as i tried afterwards to tell lowell of the benediction the salvation his letter was to me i failed but perhaps he would not have understood if i had spoken out all that was in me with the fulness i could have given a resentment his message came after years of thwarted endeavor and reinstated me in the belief that i could still do something in literature to be sure the letters in the advertiser had begun to make their impression among the first great pleasures they brought me was a recognition from my diplomatic chief at vienna but i valued my admission to the north american peculiarly because it was lowell let me in and because i felt that in his charge it must be the place of highest honor he spoke of the pay for my article in his letter and asked me where he should send it and i answered to my fatherinlaw who put it in his savingsbank where he lived in brattleboro vermont there it remained and i forgot all about it so that when his affairs were settled some years later and i was notified that there was a sum to my credit in the bank i said with the confidence i have nearly always felt when wrong that i had no money there the proof of my error was sent me in a check and then i bethought me of the pay for recent italian comedy  it was not a day when i could really afford to forget money due me but then it was not a great deal of money the review was as poor as it was proud and i had two dollars a printed page for my paper but this was more than i got from the advertiser which gave me five dollars a column for my letters printed in a type so fine that the money when translated from greenbacks into gold at a discount of 280 must have been about a dollar a thousand words however i was richly content with that and would gladly have let them have the letters for nothing  before i left venice i had made my sketches into a book which i sent on to messrs trubner  co in london they had consented to look at it to oblige my friend conway who during his sojourn with us in venice before his settlement in london had been forced to listen to some of it they answered me in due time that they would publish an edition of a thousand at half profits if i could get some american house to take five hundred copies when i stopped in london i had so little hope of being able to do this that i asked the trubners if i might without losing their offer try to get some other london house to publish my book they said yes almost joyously and i began to take my manuscript about at most places they would not look at me or it and they nowhere consented to read it the house promptest in refusing to consider it afterwards pirated one of my novels and with some expressions of good intention in that direction never paid me anything for it though i believe the english still think that this sort of behavior was peculiar to the american publisher in the old buccaneering times i was glad to go back to the trubners with my book and on my way across the atlantic i met a publisher who finally agreed to take those five hundred copies this was mr m m hurd of hurd  houghton a house then newly established in new york and cambridge we played ringtoss and shuffleboard together and became of a friendship which lasts to this day but it was not till some months later when i saw him in new york that he consented to publish my book i remember how he said with an air of vague misgiving and an effect of trying to justify himself in an imprudence that it was not a great matter anyway i perceived that he had no faith in it and to tell the truth i had not much myself but the book had an instant success and it has gone on from edition to edition ever since there was just then the interest of a not wholly generous surprise at american things among the english our success in putting down the great confederate rebellion had caught the fancy of our cousins and i think it was to this mood of theirs that i owed largely the kindness they showed my book there were long and cordial reviews in all the great london journals which i used to carry about with me like loveletters when i tried to show them to other people i could not understand their coldness concerning them  at boston where we landed on our return home there was a moment when it seemed as if my small destiny might be linked at once with that of the city which later became my home i ran into the office of the advertiser to ask what had become of some sketches of italian travel i had sent the paper and the managing editor made me promise not to take a place anywhere before i had heard from him i gladly promised but i did not hear from him and when i returned to boston a fortnight later i found that a fatal partner had refused to agree with him in engaging me upon the paper they even gave me back half a dozen unprinted letters of mine and i published them in the nation of new york and afterwards in the book called italian journeys  but after i had encountered fortune in this frowning disguise i had a most joyful little visit with lowell which made me forget there was anything in the world but the delight and glory of sitting with him in his study at elmwood and hearing him talk it must have been my freshness from italy which made him talk chiefly of his own happy days in the land which so sympathetically brevets all its lovers fellowcitizens at any rate he would talk of hardly anything else and he talked late into the night and early into the morning about two oclock when all the house was still he lighted a candle and went down into the cellar and came back with certain bottles under his arms i had not a very learned palate in those days or in these for that matter but i knew enough of wine to understand that these bottles had been chosen upon that principle which longfellow put in verse and used to repeat with a humorous lifting of the eyebrows and hollowing of the voice         if you have a friend to dine         give him your best wine         if you have two         the secondbest will do  as we sat in their mellow afterglow lowell spoke to me of my own life and prospects wisely and truly as he always spoke he said that it was enough for a man who had stuff in him to be known to two or three people for they would not suffer him to be forgotten and it would rest with himself to get on i told him that though i had not given up my place at venice i was not going back if i could find anything to do at home and i was now on my way to ohio where i should try my best to find something at the worst i could turn to my trade of printer he did not think it need ever come to that and he said that he believed i should have an advantage with readers if not with editors in hailing from the west i should be more of a novelty i knew very well that even in my own west i should not have this advantage unless i appeared there with an eastern imprint but i could not wish to urge my misgiving against his faith was i not already richly successful what better thing personally could befall me if i lived forever after on milk and honey than to be sitting there with my hero my master and having him talk to me as if we were equal in deed and in fame  the catbird called in the syringa thicket at his door before we said the goodnight which was good morning using the sweet italian words and bidding each other the dorma bene which has the quality of a benediction he held my hand and looked into my eyes with the sunny kindness which never failed me worthy or unworthy and i went away to bed but not to sleep only to dream such dreams as fill the heart of youth when the recognition of its endeavor has come from the achievement it holds highest and best     iv  i found nothing to do in ohio some places that i heard of proved impossible one way or another in columbus and cleveland and cincinnati there was always the fatal partner and after three weeks i was again in the east i came to new york resolved to fight my way in somewhere and i did not rest a moment before i began the fight  my notion was that which afterwards became bartley hubbards get a basis said the softening cynic of the saturday press when i advised with him among other acquaintances get a salaried place something regular on some paper and then you can easily make up the rest but it was a month before i achieved this vantage and then i got it in a quarter where i had not looked for it i wrote editorials on european and literary topics for different papers but mostly for the times and they paid me well and more than well but i was nowhere offered a basis though once i got so far towards it as to secure a personal interview with the editorinchief who made me feel that i had seldom met so busy a man he praised some work of mine that he had read in his paper but i was never recalled to his presence and now i think he judged rightly that i should not be a lastingly good journalist my point of view was artistic i wanted time to prepare my effects  there was another and clearer prospect opened to me on a literary paper then newly come to the light but long since gone out in the dark here again my work was taken and liked so much that i was offered the basis at twenty dollars a week that i desired i was even assigned to a desk where i should write in the office and the next morning i came joyfully down to spruce street to occupy it but i was met at the door by one of the editors who said lightly as if it were a trifling affair well weve concluded to waive the idea of an engagement and once more my bright hopes of a basis dispersed themselves i said with what calm i could that they must do what they thought best and i went on skirmishing baselessly about for this and the other papers which had been buying my material  i had begun printing in the nation those letters about my italian journeys left over from the boston advertiser they had been liked in the office and one day the editor astonished and delighted me by asking how i would fancy giving up outside work to come there and write only for the nation we averaged my gains from all sources at forty dollars a week and i had my basis as unexpectedly as if i had dropped upon it from the skies  this must have been some time in november and the next three or four months were as happy a time for me as i have ever known i kept on printing my italian material in the nation i wrote criticisms for it not very good criticisms i think now and i amused myself very much with the treatment of social phases and events in a department which grew up under my hand my associations personally were of the most agreeable kind i worked with joy with ardor and i liked so much to be there in that place and in that company that i hated to have each day come to an end  i believed that my lines were cast in new york for good and all and i renewed my relations with the literary friends i had made before going abroad i often stopped on my way up town at an apartment the stoddards had in lafayette place or near it i saw stedman and reasoned high to my hearts content of literary things with them and him  with the winter bayard taylor came on from his home in kennett and took an apartment in east twelfth street and once a week mrs taylor and he received all their friends there with a simple and charming hospitality there was another house which we much resorted tothe house of james lorrimer graham afterwards consulgeneral at florence where he died i had made his acquaintance at venice three years before and i came in for my share of that love for literary men which all their perversities could not extinguish in him it was a veritable passion which i used to think he could not have felt so deeply if he had been a literary man himself there were delightful dinners at his house where the wit of the stoddards shone and taylor beamed with joyous goodfellowship and overflowed with invention and huntington long paris correspondent of the tribune humorously tried to talk himself into the resolution of spending the rest of his life in his own country there was one evening when c p cranch always of a most pensive presence and aspect sang the most killingly comic songs and there was another evening when after we all went into the library something tragical happened edwin booth was of our number a gentle rather silent person in company or with at least little social initiative who as his fate would went up to the cast of a huge hand that lay upon one of the shelves whose hand is this lorry he asked our host as he took it up and turned it over in both his own hands graham feigned not to hear and booth asked again whose hand is this then there was nothing for graham but to say its lincolns hand and the man for whom it meant such unspeakable things put it softly down without a word     v  it was one of the disappointments of a time which was nearly all joy that i did not then meet a man who meant hardly less than lowell himself for me george william curtis was during my first winter in new york away on one of the long lecturing rounds to which he gave so many of his winters and i did not see him till seven years afterwards at mr nortons in cambridge he then characteristically spent most of the evening in discussing an obscure point in brownings poem of my last duchess i have long forgotten what the point was but not the charm of curtiss personality his fine presence his benign politeness his almost deferential tolerance of difference in opinion afterwards i saw him again and again in boston and new york but always with a sense of something elusive in his graciousness for which something in me must have been to blame cold he was not even to the youth that in those days was apt to shiver in any but the higher temperatures and yet i felt that i made no advance in his kindness towards anything like the friendship i knew in the cambridge men perhaps i was so thoroughly attuned to their mood that i could not be put in unison with another and perhaps in curtis there was really not the material of much intimacy  he had the potentiality of publicity in the sort of welcome he gave equally to all men and if i asked more i was not reasonable yet he was never far from any man of goodwill and he was the intimate of multitudes whose several existence he never dreamt of in this sort he had become my friend when he made his first great speech on the kansas question in 1855 which will seen as remote to the young men of this day as the thermopylae question to which he likened it i was his admirer his lover his worshipper before that for the things he had done in literature for the howadji books and for the lovely fantasies of prue and i and for the soundhearted satire of the potiphar papers and now suddenly i learnt that this brilliant and graceful talent this travelled and accomplished gentleman this star of society who had dazzled me with his splendor far off in my western village obscurity was a man with the heart to feel the wrongs of men so little friended then as to be denied all the rights of men i do not remember any passage of the speech or any word of it but i remember the joy the pride with which the soul of youth recognizes in the greatness it has honored the goodness it may love mere politicians might be proslavery or antislavery without touching me very much but here was the citizen of a world far greater than theirs a light of the universal republic of letters who was willing and eager to stand or fall with the just cause and that was all in all to me his country was my country and his kindred my kindred and nothing could have kept me from following after him  his whole life taught the lesson that the world is well lost whenever the world is wrong but never i think did any life teach this so sweetly so winningly the wrong world itself might have been entreated by him to be right for he was one of the few reformers who have not in some measure mixed their love of man with hate of men his quarrel was with error and not with the persons who were in it he was so gently steadfast in his opinions that no one ever thought of him as a fanatic though many who held his opinions were assailed as fanatics and suffered the shame if they did not win the palm of martyrdom in early life he was a communist and then when he came out of brook farm into the world which he was so well fitted to adorn and which would so gladly have kept him all its own he became an abolitionist in the very teeth of the world which abhorred abolitionists he was a believer in the cause of womens rights which has no picturesqueness and which chiefly appeals to the sense of humor in the men who never dreamt of laughing at him the man who was in the last degree amiable was to the last degree unyielding where conscience was concerned the soul which was so tender had no weakness in it his lenity was the divination of a finer justice his honesty made all men trust him when they doubted his opinions his good sense made them doubt their own opinions when they had as little question of their own honesty  i should not find it easy to speak of him as a man of letters only for humanity was above the humanities with him and we all know how he turned from the fairest career in literature to tread the thorny path of politics because he believed that duty led the way and that good citizens were needed more than good romancers no doubt they are and yet it must always be a keen regret with the men of my generation who witnessed with such rapture the early proofs of his talent that he could not have devoted it wholly to the beautiful and let others look after the true now that i have said this i am half ashamed of it for i know well enough that what he did was best but if my regret is mean i will let it remain for it is faithful to the mood which many have been in concerning him  there can be no dispute i am sure as to the value of some of the results he achieved in that other path he did indeed create anew for us the type of goodcitizenship wellnigh effaced in a sordid and selfish time and of an honest politician and a pureminded journalist he never really forsook literature and the world of actual interests and experiences afforded him outlooks and perspectives without which aesthetic endeavor is selflimited and purblind he was a great man of letters he was a great orator he was a great political journalist he was a great citizen he was a great philanthropist but that last word with its conventional application scarcely describes the brave and gentle friend of men that he was he was one that helped others by all that he did and said and was and the circle of his use was as wide as his fame there are other great men plenty of them common great men whom we know as names and powers and whom we willingly let the ages have when they die for living or dead they are alike remote from us they have never been with us where we live but this great man was the neighbor the contemporary and the friend of all who read him or heard him and even in the swift forgetting of this electrical age the stamp of his personality will not be effaced from their minds or hearts     vi  of those evenings at the taylors in new york i can recall best the one which was most significant for me and even fatefully significant mr and mrs fields were there from boston and i renewed all the pleasure of my earlier meetings with them at the end fields said mockingly dont despise boston and i answered as we shook hands few are worthy to live in boston it was newyears eve and that night it came on to snow so heavily that my horsecar could hardly plough its way up to fortyseventh street through the drifts the next day and the next i wrote at home because it was so hard to get downtown the third day i reached the office and found a letter on my desk from fields asking how i should like to come to boston and be his assistant on the atlantic monthly i submitted the matter at once to my chief on the nation and with his frank goodwill i talked it over with mr osgood of ticknor  fields who was to see me further about it if i wished when he came to new york and then i went to boston to see mr fields concerning details i was to sift all the manuscripts and correspond with contributors i was to do the literary proofreading of the magazine and i was to write the four or five pages of booknotices which were then printed at the end of the periodical in finer type and i was to have forty dollars a week i said that i was getting that already for less work and then mr fields offered me ten dollars more upon these terms we closed and on the 1st of march which was my twentyninth birthday i went to boston and began my work i had not decided to accept the place without advising with lowell he counselled the step and gave me some shrewd and useful suggestions the whole affair was conducted by fields with his unfailing tact and kindness but it could not be kept from me that the qualification i had as practical printer for the work was most valued if not the most valued and that as proofreader i was expected to make it avail on the side of economy somewhere in lifes feast the course of humblepie must always come in and if i did not wholly relish this bit of it i dare say it was good for me and i digested it perfectly     literary boston as i knew it  among my fellowpassengers on the train from new york to boston when i went to begin my work there in 1866 as the assistant editor of the atlantic monthly was the late samuel bowles of the springfield republican who created in a subordinate city a journal of metropolitan importance i had met him in venice several years earlier when he was suffering from the cruel insomnia which had followed his overwork on that newspaper and when he told me that he was sleeping scarcely more than one hour out of the twentyfour his worn face attested the misery which this must have been and which lasted in some measure while he lived though i believe that rest and travel relieved him in his later years he was always a man of cordial friendliness and he now expressed a most gratifying interest when i told him what i was going to do in boston he gave himself the pleasure of descanting upon the dramatic quality of the fact that a young newspaper man from ohio was about to share in the destinies of the great literary periodical of new england     i  i do not think that such a fact would now move the fancy of the liveliest newspaper man so much has the west since returned upon the east in a refluent wave of authorship but then the west was almost an unknown quality in our literary problem and in fact there was scarcely any literature outside of new england even this was of new england origin for it was almost wholly the work of new england men and women in the splendid exile of new york the atlantic monthly which was distinctively literary was distinctively a new england magazine though from the first it had been characterized by what was more national what was more universal in the new england temperament its chief contributors for nearly twenty years were longfellow lowell holmes whittier emerson doctor hale colonel higginson mrs stowe whipple rose terry cooke mrs julia ward howe mrs prescott spofford mrs phelps ward and other new england writers who still lived in new england and largely in the region of boston occasionally there came a poem from bryant at new york from mr stedman from mr stoddard and mrs stoddard from mr aldrich and from bayard taylor but all these except the last were not only of new england race but of new england birth i think there was no contributor from the south but mr m d conway and as yet the west scarcely counted though four young poets from ohio who were not immediately or remotely of puritan origin had appeared in early numbers alice cary living with her sister in new york had written now and then from the beginning mr john hay solely represented illinois by a single paper and he was of rhode island stock it was after my settlement at boston that mark twain of missouri became a figure of worldwide fame at hartford and longer after that mr bret harte made that progress eastward from california which was telegraphed almost from hour to hour as if it were the progress of a prince miss constance f woolson had not yet begun to write mr james whitcomb riley mr maurice thompson miss edith thomas octave thanet mr charles warren stoddard mr h b fuller mrs catherwood mr hamlin garland all whom i name at random among other western writers were then as unknown as mr cable miss murfree mrs rives chanler miss grace king mr joel chandler harris mr thomas nelson page in the south which they by no means fully represent  the editors of the atlantic had been eager from the beginning to discover any outlying literature but as i have said there was in those days very little good writing done beyond the borders of new england if the case is now different and the best known among living american writers are no longer newenglanders still i do not think the south and west have yet trimmed the balance and though perhaps the news writers now more commonly appear in those quarters i should not be so very sure that they are not still characterized by new england ideals and examples on the other hand i am very sure that in my early day we were characterized by them and wished to be so we even felt that we failed in so far as we expressed something native quite in our own way the literary theories we accepted were new england theories the criticism we valued was new england criticism or more strictly speaking boston theories boston criticism  of those more constant contributors to the atlantic whom i have mentioned it is of course known that longfellow and lowell lived in cambridge emerson at concord and whittier at amesbury colonel higginson was still and for many years afterwards at newport mrs stowe was then at andover miss prescott of newburyport had become mrs spofford and was presently in boston where her husband was a member of the general court mrs phelps ward as miss elizabeth stuart phelps dwelt in her fathers house at andover the chief of the bostonians were mrs julia ward howe doctor holmes and doctor hale yet boston stood for the whole massachusetts group and massachusetts in the literary impulse meant new england i suppose we must all allow whether we like to do so or not that the impulse seems now to have pretty well spent itself certainly the city of boston has distinctly waned in literature though it has waxed in wealth and population i do not think there are in boston today even so many talents with a literary coloring in law science theology and journalism as there were formerly though i have no belief that the boston talents are fewer or feebler than before i arrived in boston however when all talents had more or less a literary coloring and when the greatest talents were literary these expressed with ripened fulness a civilization conceived in faith and brought forth in good works but that moment of maturity was the beginning of a decadence which could only show itself much later new england has ceased to be a nation in itself and it will perhaps never again have anything like a national literature but that was something like a national literature and it will probably be centuries yet before the life of the whole country the american life as distinguished from the new england life shall have anything so like a national literature it will be long before our larger life interprets itself in such imagination as hawthornes such wisdom as emersons such poetry as longfellows such prophecy as whittiers such wit and grace as holmess such humor and humanity as lowells     ii  the literature of those great men was if i may suffer myself the figure the socinian graft of a calvinist stock their faith in its varied shades was unitarian but their art was puritan so far as it was imperfectand great and beautiful as it was i think it had its imperfectionsit was marred by the intense ethicism that pervaded the new england mind for two hundred years and that still characterizes it they or their fathers had broken away from orthodoxy in the great schism at the beginning of the century but as if their heterodoxy were consciencestricken they still helplessly pointed the moral in all they did some pointed it more directly some less directly but they all pointed it i should be far from blaming them for their ethical intention though i think they felt their vocation as prophets too much for their good as poets sometimes they sacrificed the song to the sermon though not always nor nearly always it was in poetry and in romance that they excelled in the novel so far as they attempted it they failed i say this with the names of all the bostonian group and those they influenced in mind and with a full sense of their greatness it may be ungracious to say that they have left no heirs to their peculiar greatness but it would be foolish to say that they left an estate where they had none to bequeath one cannot take account of such a fantasy as judds margaret the only newenglander who has attempted the novel on a scale proportioned to the work of the newenglanders in philosophy in poetry in romance is mr de forest who is of new haven and not of boston i do not forget the fictions of doctor holmes or the vivid inventions of doctor hale but i do not call them novels and i do not forget the exquisitely realistic art of miss jewett or miss wilkins which is free from the ethicism of the great new england group but which has hardly the novelistss scope new england in hawthornes work achieved supremacy in romance but the romance is always an allegory and the novel is a picture in which the truth to life is suffered to do its unsermonized office for conduct and new england yet lacks her novelist because it was her instinct and her conscience in fiction to be true to an ideal of life rather than to life itself  even when we come to the exception that proves the rule even to such a signal exception as uncle toms cabin i think that what i say holds true that is almost the greatest work of imagination that we have produced in prose and it is the work of a new england woman writing from all the inspirations and traditions of new england it is like begging the question to say that i do not call it a novel however but really is it a novel in the sense that war and peace is a novel or madame flaubert or lassommoir or phineas finn or dona perfecta or esther waters or marta y maria or the return of the native or virgin soil or david grieve in a certain way it is greater than any of these except the first but its chief virtue or its prime virtue is in its address to the conscience and not its address to the taste to the ethical sense not the aesthetical sense  this does not quite say the thing but it suggests it and i should be sorry if it conveyed to any reader a sense of slight for i believe no one has felt more deeply than myself the value of new england in literature the comparison of the literary situation at boston to the literary situation at edinburgh in the times of the reviewers has never seemed to me accurate or adequate and it holds chiefly in the fact that both seem to be of the past certainly new york is yet no london in literature and i think boston was once vastly more than edinburgh ever was at least in quality the scotch literature of the palmy days was not wholly scotch and even when it was rooted in scotch soil it flowered in the air of an alien speech but the new england literature of the great day was the blossom of a new england root and the language which the bostonians wrote was the native english of scholars fitly the heirs of those who had brought the learning of the universities to massachusetts bay two hundred years before and was of as pure a lineage as the english of the mothercountry     iii  the literary situation which confronted me when i came to boston was then as native as could well be and whatever value i may be able to give a personal study of it will be from the effect it made upon me as one strange in everything but sympathy i will not pretend that i saw it in its entirety and i have no hope of presenting anything like a kinetoscopic impression of it what i can do is to give here and there a glimpse of it and i shall wish the reader to keep in mind the fact that it was in a state of transition as everything is always and everywhere it was no sooner recognizably native than it ceased to be fully so and i became a witness of it after the change had begun the publishing house which so long embodied new england literature was already attempting enterprises out of the line of its traditions and one of these had brought mr t b aldrich from new york a few weeks before i arrived upon the scene in that dramatic quality which i think never impressed any one but mr bowles mr aldrich was the editor of every saturday when i came to be assistant editor of the atlantic monthly we were of nearly the same age but he had a distinct and distinguished priority of reputation insomuch that in my western remoteness i had always ranged him with such elders and betters of mine as holmes and lowell and never imagined him the blond slight youth i found him with every imaginable charm of contemporaneity it is no part of the office which i have intended for these slight and sufficiently wandering glimpses of the past to show any writer in his final place and above all i do not presume to assign any living man his rank or station but i should be false to my own grateful sense of beauty in the work of this poet if i did not at all times recognize his constancy to an ideal which his name stands for he is known in several kinds but to my thinking he is best in a certain nobler kind of poetry a serious sort in which the thought holds him above the scrupulosities of the art he loves and honors so much sometimes the file slips in his hold as the file must and will it is but an instrument at the best but there is no mistouch in the hand that lays itself upon the readers heart with the pulse of the poets heart quick and true in it there are sonnets of his grave and simple and lofty which i think of with the glow and thrill possible only from very beautiful poetry and which impart such an emotion as we can feel only         when a great thought strikes along the brain         and flushes all the cheek  when i had the fortune to meet him first i suppose that in the employ of the kindly house we were both so eager to serve our dignities were about the same for if the atlantic monthly was a somewhat prouder affair than an eclectic weekly like every saturday he was supreme in his place and i was subordinate in mine the house was careful in the attitude of its senior partner not to distinguish between us and we were not slow to perceive the tact used in managing us we had our own joke of it we compared notes to find whether we were equally used in this thing or that and we promptly shared the fun of our discovery with fields himself  we had another impartial friend no less a friend of joy in the life which seems to have been pretty nearly all joy as i look back upon it in the partner who became afterwards the head of the house and who forecast in his bold enterprises the change from a new england to an american literary situation in the end james r osgood failed though all his enterprises succeeded the anomaly is sad but it is not infrequent they were greater than his powers and his means and before they could reach their full fruition they had to be enlarged to men of longer purse and longer patience he was singularly fitted both by instinct and by education to become a great publisher and he early perceived that if a leading american house were to continue at boston it must be hospitable to the talents of the whole country he founded his future upon those generous lines but he wanted the qualities as well as the resources for rearing the superstructure changes began to follow each other rapidly after he came into control of the house misfortune reduced the size and number of its periodicals the young folks was sold outright and the north american review long before mr rice bought it and carried it to new york was cut down onehalf so that aldrich said it looked as if destiny had sat upon it his own periodical every saturday was first enlarged to a stately quarto and illustrated and then under stress of the calamities following the great boston fire it collapsed to its former size then both the atlantic monthly and every saturday were sold away from their old ownership and every saturday was suppressed altogether and we two ceased to be of the same employ there was some sort of evening rite more funereal than festive the day after they were sold and we followed osgood away from it under the lamps we all knew that it was his necessity that had caused him to part with the periodicals but he professed that it was his pleasure and he said he had not felt so lighthearted since he was a boy we asked him how could he feel gay when he was no longer paying us our salaries and how could he justify it to his conscience he liked our mocking and limped away from us with a rheumatic easing of his weight from one foot to another a figure pathetic now that it has gone the way to dusty death and dear to memory through benefactions unalloyed by one unkindness     iv  but when i came to boston early in 1866 the atlantic monthly and harpers then divided our magazine world between them the north american review in the control of lowell and professor norton had entered upon a new life every saturday was an instant success in the charge of mr aldrich who was by taste and training one of the best editors and our young folks had the field of juvenile periodical literature to itself  it was under the direction of miss lucy larcom and of mr j t trowbridge who had come from western new york where he was born and must be noted as one of the first returners from the setting to the rising sun he naturalized himself in boston in his later boyhood and he still breathes boston air where he dwells in the street called pleasant on the shore of spy pond at arlington and still weaves the magic web of his satisfying stories for boys he merges in their popularity the fame of a poet which i do not think will always suffer that eclipse for his poems show him to have looked deeply into the heart of common humanity with a true and tender sense of it  miss larcom scarcely seemed to change from date to date in the generation that elapsed between the time i first saw her and the time i saw her last a year or two before her death a goodness looked out of her comely face which made me think of the madonnas in titians assumption and her whole aspect expressed a mild and friendly spirit which i find it hard to put in words she was never of the fine world of literature she dwelt where she was born in that unfashionable beverly which is not beverly farms and was of a simple seafaring godfearing race as she has told in one of the loveliest autobiographies i know a new england girlhood she was the author of many poems whose number she constantly enlarged but she was chiefly and will be most lastingly famed for the one poem hannah binding shoes which years before my days in boston had made her so widely known she never again struck so deep or so true a note but if one has lodged such a note in the ear of time it is enough and if we are to speak of eternity one might very well hold up ones head in the fields of asphodel if one could say to the great others there i wrote hannah binding shoes her poem is very very sad as all who have read it will remember but miss larcom herself was above everything cheerful and she had a laugh of mellow richness which willingly made itself heard she was not only of true new england stock and a boston author by right of race but she came up to that city every winter from her native town  by the same right and on the same terms another new england poetess whom i met those first days in boston was a boston author when i saw celia thaxter she was just beginning to make her effect with those poems and sketches which the sea sings and flashes through as it sings and flashes around the isles of shoals her summer home where her girlhood had been passed in a freedom as wild as the curlews she was a most beautiful creature still very young with a slender figure and an exquisite perfection of feature she was in presence what her work was fine frank finished i do not know whether other witnesses of our literary history feel that the public has failed to keep her as fully in mind as her work merited but i do not think there can be any doubt but our literature would be sensibly the poorer without her work it is interesting to remember how closely she kept to her native field and it is wonderful to consider how richly she made those seabeaten rocks to blossom something strangely full and bright came to her verse from the mystical environment of the ocean like the luxury of leaf and tint that it gave the narrower flowerplots of her native isles her gift indeed could not satisfy itself with the terms of one art alone however varied and she learned to express in color the thoughts and feelings impatient of the pallor of words  she remains in my memories of that far boston a distinct and vivid personality as the authoress of amber gods and in a cellar and circumstance and those other wild romantic tales remains the gentle and somewhat evanescent presence i found her miss prescott was now mrs spofford and her husband was a rising young politician of the day it was his duties as member of the general court that had brought them up from newburyport to boston for that first winter and i remember that the evening when we met he was talking of their some time going to italy that she might study for imaginative literature certain italian cities he named i have long since ceased to own those cities but at the moment i felt a pang of expropriation which i concealed as well as i could and now i heartily wish she could have fulfilled that purpose if it was a purpose or realized that dream if it was only a dream perhaps however that sumptuous and glowing fancy of hers which had taken the fancy of the young readers of that day needed the cold new england background to bring out all its intensities of tint all its splendors of light its effects were such as could not last or could not be farther evolved they were the expression of youth musing away from its environment and smitten with the glories of a world afar and beyond the great world the fine world the impurpled world of romantic motives and passions but for what they were i can never think them other than what they appeared the emanations of a rarely gifted and singularly poetic mind i feel better than i can say how necessarily they were the emanations of a new england mind and how to the subtler sense they must impart the pathos of revolt from the colorless rigidities which are the long result of puritanism in the physiognomy of new england life  their author afterwards gave herself to the stricter study of this life in many tales and sketches which showed an increasing mastery but they could not have the flush the surprise the delight of a young talent trying itself in a kind native and so far as i know peculiar to it from time to time i still come upon a poem of hers which recalls that earlier strain of music of color and i am content to trust it for my abiding faith in the charm of things i have not read for thirty years     v  i speak of this one and that as it happens and with no thought of giving a complete prospect of literary boston thirty years ago i am aware that it will seem sparsely peopled in the effect i impart and i would have the reader always keep in mind the great fames at cambridge and at concord which formed so large a part of the celebrity of boston i would also like him to think of it as still a great town merely where every one knew every one else and whose metropolitan liberation from neighborhood was just begun  most distinctly of that yet uncitified boston was the critic edwin p whipple whose sympathies were indefinitely wider than his traditions he was a most generous lover of all that was excellent in literature and though i suppose we should call him an oldfashioned critic now i suspect it would be with no distinct sense of what is newer fashioned he was certainly as friendly to what promised well in the younger men as he was to what was done well in their elders and there was no one writing in his day whose virtues failed of his recognition though it might happen that his foibles would escape whipples censure he wrote strenuously and of course conscientiously his point of view was solely and always that which enabled him best to discern qualities i doubt if he had any theory of criticism except to find out what was good in an author and praise it and he rather blamed what was ethically bad than what was aesthetically bad in this he was strictly of new england and he was of new england in a certain general intelligence which constantly grew with an interrogative habit of mind  he liked to talk to you of what he had found characteristic in your work to analyze you to yourself and the very modesty of the man which made such a study impersonal as far as he was concerned sometimes rendered him insensible to the sufferings of his subject he had a keen perception of humor in others but he had very little humor he had a love of the beautiful in literature which was perhaps sometimes greater than his sense of it  i write from a cursory acquaintance with his work not recently renewed of the presence of the man i have a vivider remembrance a slight short ecclesiasticized figure in black with a white neckcloth and a silk hat of strict decorum and between the two a square face with square features intensified in their regard by a pair of very large glasses and the prominent myopic eyes staring through them he was a type of outdated new england scholarship in these aspects but in the hospitable qualities of his mind and heart the sort of man to be kept fondly in the memory of all who ever knew him     vi  out of the vague of that faroff time another face and figure as essentially new enland as this and yet so different relieve themselves charles f browne whose drollery wafted his pseudonym as far as the english speech could carry laughter was a westernized yankee he added an ohio way of talking to the maine way of thinking and he so became a literary product of a rarer and stranger sort than our literature had otherwise known he had gone from cleveland to london with intervals of new york and the lecture platform four or five years before i saw him in boston shortly after i went there we had met in ohio and he had personally explained to me the ducatless wellmeaning of vanity fair in new york but many men had since shaken the weary hand of artemus ward when i grasped it one day in front of the tremont temple he did not recognize me but he gave me at once a greeting of great impersonal cordiality with how do you do when did you come and other questions that had no concern in them till i began to dawn upon him through a cloud of other half remembered faces then he seized my hand and wrung it all over again and repeated his friendly demands with an intonation that was now why how are you how are you for me alone it was a bit of comedy which had the fit pathetic relief of his impending doom this was already stamped upon his wasted face and his gay eyes had the deathlook his large loose mouth was drawn for all its laughter at the fact which he owned his profile which burlesqued an eagles was the profile of a drooping eagle his lank length of limb trembled away with him when we parted i did not see him again i scarcely heard of him till i heard of his death and this sad image remains with me of the humorist who first gave the world a taste of the humor which characterizes the whole american people  i was meeting all kinds of distinguished persons in my relation to the magazine and early that winter i met one who remains in my mind above all others a person of distinction he was scarcely a celebrity but he embodied certain social traits which were so characteristic of literary boston that it could not be approached without their recognition the muses have often been acknowledged to be very nice young persons but in boston they were really ladies in boston literature was of good family and good society in a measure it has never been elsewhere it might be said even that reform was of good family in boston and literature and reform equally shared the regard of edmund quincy whose race was one of the most aristocratic in new england i had known him by his novel of wensley it came so near being a firstrate novel and by his life of josiah quincy then a new book but still better by his boston letters to the new york tribune these dealt frankly in the old antislavery days between 1850 and 1860 with other persons of distinction in boston who did not see the right so clearly as quincy did or who at least let their interests darken them to the ugliness of slavery their fault was all the more comical because it was the error of men otherwise so correct of characters so stainless of natures so upright and the quincy letters got out of it all the fun there was in it quincy himself affected me as the finest patrician type i had ever met he was charmingly handsome with a nose of most fit aquilinity smoothshaven lips educated whiskers and perfect glasses his manner was beautiful his voice delightful when at our first meeting he made me his reproaches in terms of lovely kindness for having used in my venetian life the briticism directly for as soon as  lowell once told me that quincy had never had any calling or profession because when he found himself in the enjoyment of a moderate income on leaving college he decided to be simply a gentleman he was too much of a man to be merely that and he was an abolitionist a journalist and for conscience sake a satirist of that political mood of society which he satirized was an eminent man whom it was also my good fortune to meet in my early days in boston and if his great sweetness and kindness had not instantly won my liking i should still have been glad of the glimpse of the older and statelier boston which my slight acquaintance with george ticknor gave me the historian of spanish literature the friend and biographer of prescott and a leading figure of the intellectual society of an epoch already closed dwelt in the fine old square brick mansion which yet stands at the corner of park street and beacon though sunk now to a variety of business uses and lamentably changed in aspect the interior was noble and there was an air of scholarly quiet and of lettered elegance in the library where the host received his guests which seemed to pervade the whole house and which made its appeal to the imagination of one of them most potently it seemed to me that to be master of such circumstance and keeping would be enough of life in a certain way and it all lingers in my memory yet as if it were one with the gentle courtesy which welcomed me  among my fellowguests one night was george s hillard now a faded reputation and even then a life defeated of the high expectation of its youth i do not know whether his six months in italy still keeps itself in print but it was a book once very well known and he was perhaps the more gracious to me as our host was because of our common italian background he was of the old silvergray whig society too and i suppose that order of things imparted its tone to what i felt and saw in that place the civil war had come and gone and that order accepted the result if not with faith then with patience there were two young english noblemen there that night who had been travelling in the south and whose stories of the wretched conditions they had seen moved our host to some open misgiving but the englishmen had no question in spite of all they defended the accomplished fact and when i ventured to say that now at least there could be a hope of better things while the old order was only the perpetuation of despair he mildly assented with a gesture of the hand that waived the point and a deeply sighed perhaps perhaps  he was a presence of great dignity which seemed to recall the past with a steadfast allegiance and yet to relax itself towards the present in the wisdom of the accumulated years his whole life had been passed in devotion to polite literature and in the society of the polite world and he was a type of scholar such as only the circumstances of boston could form those circumstances could alone form such another type as quincy and i wish i could have felt then as i do now the advantage of meeting them so contemporaneously     vii  the historian of spanish literature was an old man nearer eighty than seventy when i saw him and i recall of him personally his dark tint and the scholarly refinement of his cleanshaven face which seemed to me rather english than american in character he was quite exterior to the atlantic group of writers and had no interest in me as one of it literary boston of that day was not a solidarity as i soon perceived and i understood that it was only in my quality of stranger that i saw the different phases of it i should not be just to a vivid phase if i failed to speak of mrs julia ward howe and the impulse of reform which she personified i did not sympathize with this then so much as i do now but i could appreciate it on the intellectual side once many years later i heard mrs howe speak in public and it seemed to me that she made one of the best speeches i had ever heard it gave me for the first time a notion of what women might do in that sort if they entered public life but when we met in those earlier days i was interested in her as perhaps our chief poetess i believe she did not care much to speak of literature she was alert for other meanings in life and i remember how she once brought to book a youthful matron who had perhaps unduly lamented the hardships of housekeeping with the sharp demand child where is your religion after the many years of an acquaintance which had not nearly so many meetings as years it was pleasant to find her at the latest as strenuous as ever for the faith of works and as eager to aid stepniak as john brown in her beautiful old age she survives a certain literary impulse of boston but a still higher impulse of boston she will not survive for that will last while the city endures     viii  the cambridge men were curiously apart from others that formed the great new england group and with whom in my earlier ignorance i had always fancied them mingling now and then i met doctor holmes at longfellows table but not oftener than now and then and i never saw emerson in cambridge at all except at longfellows funeral in my first years on the atlantic i sometimes saw him when he would address me some grave rather retrorsive civilities after i had been newly introduced to him as i had always to be on these occasions i formed the belief that he did not care for me either in my being or doing and i am far from blaming him for that on such points there might easily be two opinions and i was myself often of the mind i imagined in him  if emerson forgot me it was perhaps because i was not of those qualities of things which even then it was said he could remember so much better than things themselves in his later years i sometimes saw him in the boston streets with his beautiful face dreamily set as he moved like one to whose vision         heaven opens inward chasms yawn         vast images in glimmering dawn         half shown are broken and withdrawn  it is known how before the end the eclipse became total and from moment to moment the record inscribed upon his mind was erased some years before he died i sat between him and mrs rose terry cooke at an atlantic breakfast where it was part of my editorial function to preside when he was not asking me who she was i could hear him asking her who i was his great soul worked so independently of memory as we conceive it and so powerfully and essentially that one could not help wondering if after all our personal continuity our identity hereafter was necessarily trammeled up with our enduring knowledge of what happens here his remembrance absolutely ceased with an event and yet his character his personality his identity fully persisted  i do not know whether the things that we printed for emerson after his memory began to fail so utterly were the work of earlier years or not but i know that they were of his best there were certain poems which could not have been more electly more exquisitely his or fashioned with a keener and juster selfcriticism his vision transcended his time so far that some who have tired themselves out in trying to catch up with him have now begun to say that he was no seer at all but i doubt if these form the last court of appeal in his case in manner he was very gentle like all those great new england men but he was cold like many of them to the newcomer or to the oldcomer who came newly as i have elsewhere recorded i once heard him speak critically of hawthorne and once he expressed his surprise at the late flowering brilliancy of holmess gift in the autocrat papers after all his friends supposed it had borne its best fruit but i recall no mention of longfellow or lowell or whittier from him at a dinner where the talk glanced upon walt whitman he turned to me as perhaps representing the interest posterity might take in the matter and referred to whitmans public use of his privately written praise as something altogether unexpected he did not disown it or withdraw it but seemed to feel not indignantly that there had been an abuse of it     ix  the first time i saw whittier was in fieldss room at the publishing office where i had come upon some editorial errand to my chief he introduced me to the poet a tall spare figure in black of quaker cut with a keen cleanshaven face black hair and vivid black eyes it was just after his poem snow bound had made its great success in the modest fashion of those days and had sold not two hundred thousand but twenty thousand and i tried to make him my compliment i contrived to say that i could not tell him how much i liked it and he received the inadequate expression of my feeling with doubtless as much effusion as he would have met something more explicit and abundant if he had judged fit to take my contract off my hands in any way i think he would have been less able to do so than any of his new england contemporaries in him as i have suggested the quaker calm was bound by the frosty puritanic air and he was doubly cold to the touch of the stranger though he would thaw out to old friends and sparkle in laugh and joke i myself never got so far with him as to experience this geniality though afterwards we became such friends as an old man and a young man could be who rarely met our better acquaintance began with some talk at a second meeting about bayard taylors story of kennett which had then lately appeared and which he praised for its fidelity to quaker character in its less amiable aspects no doubt i had made much of my own quaker descent which i felt was one of the few things i had to be proud of and he therefore spoke the more frankly of those traits of brutality into which the primitive sincerity of the sect sometimes degenerated he thought the habit of plainspeaking had to be jealously guarded to keep it from becoming rudespeaking and he matched with stories of his own some things i had heard my father tell of friends in the backwoods who were foes to good manners  whittier was one of the most generous of men towards the work of others especially the work of a new man and if i did anything that he liked i could count upon him for cordial recognition in the quiet of his country home at danvers he apparently read all the magazines and kept himself fully abreast of the literary movement but i doubt if he so fully appreciated the importance of the social movement like some others of the great antislavery men he seemed to imagine that mankind had won itself a clear field by destroying chattel slavery and he had no sympathy with those who think that the man who may any moment be out of work is industrially a slave this is not strange so few men last over from one reform to another that the wonder is that any should not that one should not whittier was prophet for one great need of the divine to man and he spoke his message with a fervor that at times was like the trembling of a flame or the quivering of midsummer sunshine it was hard to associate with the man as one saw him still shy stiff the passion of his verse this imbued not only his antislavery utterances but equally his ballads of the old witch and quaker persecution and flashed a far light into the dimness where his interrogations of mystery pierced whatever doubt there can be of the fate of other new england poets in the great and final account it seems to me that certain of these pieces make his place secure  there is great inequality in his work and i felt this so strongly that when i came to have full charge of the magazine i ventured once to distinguish he sent me a poem and i had the temerity to return it and beg him for something else he magnanimously refrained from all show of offence and after a while when he had printed the poem elsewhere he gave me another by this time i perceived that i had been wrong not as to the poem returned but as to my function regarding him and such as he i had made my reflections and never again did i venture to pass upon what contributors of his quality sent me i took it and printed it and praised the gods and even now i think that with such men it was not my duty to play the censor in the periodical which they had made what it was they had set it in authority over american literature and it was not for me to put myself in authority over them their fame was in their own keeping and it was not my part to guard it against them  after that experience i not only practised an eager acquiescence in their wish to reach the public through the atlantic but i used all the delicacy i was master of in bowing the way to them sometimes my utmost did not avail or more strictly speaking it did not avail in one instance with emerson he had given me upon much entreaty a poem which was one of his greatest and best but the proofreader found a nominative at odds with its verb we had some trouble in reconciling them and some other delays and meanwhile doctor holmes offered me a poem for the same number i now doubted whether i should get emersons poem back in time for it but unluckily the proof did come back in time and then i had to choose between my poets or acquaint them with the state of the case and let them choose what i should do i really felt that doctor holmes had the right to precedence since emerson had withheld his proof so long that i could not count upon it but i wrote to emerson and asked as nearly as i can remember whether he would consent to let me put his poem over to the next number or would prefer to have it appear in the same number with doctor holmess the subjects were cognate and i had my misgivings he wrote me back to return the proofs and break up the forms i could not go to this iconoclastic extreme with the electrotypes of the magazine but i could return the proofs i did so feeling that i had done my possible and silently grieving that there could be such ire in heavenly minds     x  emerson as i say i had once met in cambridge but whittier never and i have a feeling that poet as cambridge felt him to be she had her reservations concerning him i cannot put these into words which would not oversay them but they were akin to those she might have refined upon in regard to mrs stowe neither of these great writers would have appeared to cambridge of the last literary quality their fame was with a world too vast to be the test that her own          one entire and perfect crysolite  would have formed whittier in fact had not arrived at the clear splendor of his later work without some earlier turbidity he was still from time to time capable of a false rhyme like morn and dawn as for the author of uncle toms cabin her syntax was such a snare to her that it sometimes needed the combined skill of all the proofreaders and the assistant editor to extricate her of course nothing was ever written into her work but in changes of diction in correction of solecisms in transposition of phrases the text was largely rewritten on the margin of her proofs the soul of her art was present but the form was so often absent that when it was clothed on anew it would have been hard to say whose cut the garment was of in many places in fact the proofreading of the atlantic monthly was something almost fearfully scrupulous and perfect the proofs were first read by the under proofreader in the printingoffice then the head reader passed them to me perfectly clean as to typography with his own abundant and most intelligent comments on the literature and then i read them making what changes i chose and verifying every quotation every date every geographical and biographical name every foreign word to the last accent every technical and scientific term where it was possible or at all desirable the proof was next submitted to the author when it came back to me i revised it accepting or rejecting the authors judgment according as he was entitled by his ability and knowledge or not to have them the proof now went to the printers for correction they sent it again to the head reader who carefully revised it and returned it again to me i read it a second time and it was again corrected after this it was revised in the office and sent to the stereotyper from whom it came to the head reader for a last revision in the plates  it would not do to say how many of the first american writers owed their correctness in print to the zeal of our proofreading but i may say that there were very few who did not owe something the wisest and ablest were the most patient and grateful like mrs stowe under correction it was only the beginners and the more ignorant who were angry and almost always the proofreading editor had his way on disputed points i look back now with respectful amazement at my proficiency in detecting the errors of the great as well as the little i was able to discover mistakes even in the classical quotations of the deeply lettered sumner and i remember in the earliest years of my service on the atlantic waiting in this statesmans study amidst the prints and engravings that attested his personal resemblance to edmund burke with his proofs in my hand and my heart in my mouth to submit my doubts of his latinity i forget how he received them but he was not a very gracious person  mrs stowe was a gracious person and carried into age the inalienable charm of a woman who must have been very charming earlier i met her only at the fieldses in boston where one night i witnessed a controversy between her and doctor holmes concerning homoeopathy and allopathy which lasted well through dinner after this lapse of time i cannot tell how the affair ended but i feel sure of the liking with which mrs stowe inspired me there was something very simple very motherly in her and something divinely sincere she was quite the person to take au grand serieux the monstrous imaginations of lady byrons jealousy and to feel it on her conscience to make public report of them when she conceived that the time had come to do so  in francis parkman i knew much later than in some others a differentiation of the new england type which was not less characteristic he like so many other boston men of letters was of patrician family and of those easy fortunes which clio prefers her sons to be of but he paid for these advantages by the suffering in which he wrought at what is i suppose our greatest history he wrought at it piecemeal and sometimes only by moments when the terrible head aches which tormented him and the disorder of the heart which threatened his life allowed him a brief respite for the task which was dear to him he must have been more than a quarter of a century in completing it and in this time as he once told me it had given him a daylaborers wages but of course money was the least return he wished from it i read the regularly successive volumes of the jesuits in north america the old regime in canada the wolfe and montcalm and the others that went to make up the whole history with a sufficiently noisy enthusiasm and our acquaintance began by his expressing his gratification with the praises of them that i had put in print we entered into relations as contributor and editor and i know that he was pleased with my eagerness to get as many detachable chapters from the book in hand as he could give me for the magazine but he was of too fine a politeness to make this the occasion of his first coming to see me he had walked out to cambridge where i then lived in pursuance of a regimen which i believe finally built up his health that it was unsparing i can testify from my own share in one of his constitutionals in boston many years later  his experience in laying the groundwork for his history and his researches in making it thorough were such as to have liberated him to the knowledge of other manners and ideals but he remained strictly a bostonian and as immutably of the boston social and literary faith as any i knew in that capital of accomplished facts he had lived like an indian among the wild western tribes he consorted with the canadian archaeologists in their mousings among the colonial archives of their fallen state every year he went to quebec or paris to study the history of new france in the original documents european society was open to him everywhere but he had those limitations which i nearly always found in the boston men i remember his talking to me of the rise of silas lapham in a somewhat troubled and uncertain strain and interpreting his rise as the achievement of social recognition without much or at all liking it or me for it i did not think it my part to point out that i had supposed the rise to be a moral one and later i fell under his condemnation for certain high crimes and misdemeanors i had been guilty of against a wellknown ideal in fiction these in fact constituted lesemajesty of romanticism which seemed to be disproportionately dear to a man who was in his own way trying to tell the truth of human nature as i was in mine his displeasures passed however and my last meeting with our greatest historian as i think him was of unalloyed friendliness he came to me during my final year in boston for nothing apparently but to tell me of his liking for a book of mine describing boylife in southern ohio a halfcentury ago he wished to talk about many points of this which he found the same as his own boylife in the neighborhood of boston and we could agree that the life of the anglosaxon boy was pretty much the same everywhere he had helped himself into my apartment with a crutch but i do not remember how he had fallen lame it was the end of his long walks i believe and not long afterwards i had the grief to read of his death i noticed that perhaps through his enforced quiet he had put on weight his fine face was full whereas when i first knew him he was almost delicately thin of figure and feature he was always of a distinguished presence and his face had a great distinction  it had not the appealing charm i found in the face of james parton another historian i knew earlier in my boston days i cannot say how much his books once so worthily popular are now known but i have an abiding sense of their excellence i have not read the life of voltaire which was the last but all the rest from the first i have read and if there are better american biographies than those of franklin or of jefferson i could not say where to find them the greeley and the burr were younger books and so was the jackson and they were not nearly so good but to all the author had imparted the valuable humanity in which he abounded he was never of the fine world of literature the world that sniffs and sneers and abashes the simplerhearted reader but he was a true artist and english born as he was he divined american character as few americans have done he was a man of eminent courage and in the days when to be an agnostic was to be almost an outcast he had the heart to say of the mysteries that he did not know he outlived the condemnation that this brought and i think that no man ever came near him without in some measure loving him to me he was of a most winning personality which his strong gentle face expressed and a cast in the eye which he could not bring to bear directly upon his visavis endeared i never met him without wishing more of his company for he seldom failed to say something to whatever was most humane and most modern in me our last meeting was at newburyport whither he had long before removed from new york and where in the serene atmosphere of the ancient puritan town he found leisure and inspiration for his work he was not then engaged upon any considerable task and he had aged and broken somewhat but the old geniality the old warmth glowed in him and made a summer amidst the storm of snow that blinded the wintry air without a new light had then lately come into my life by which i saw all things that did not somehow tell for human brotherhood dwarfish and ugly and he listened as i imagined to what i had to say with the tolerant sympathy of a man who has been a long time thinking those things and views with a certain amusement the zeal of the fresh discoverer  there was yet another historian in boston whose acquaintance i made later than either parkmans or partons and whose very recent death leaves me with the grief of a friend no ones indeed could meet john codman ropes without wishing to be his friend or without finding a friend in him he had his likes and his dislikes but he could have had no enmities except for evil and meanness i never knew a man of higher soul of sweeter nature and his whole life was a monument of character it cannot wound him now to speak of the cruel deformity which came upon him in his boyhood and haunted all his after days with suffering his gentle face showed the pain which is always the part of the hunchback but nothing else in him confessed a sense of his affliction and the resolute activity of his mind denied it in every way he was as is well known a very able lawyer in full practice while he was making his studies of military history and winning recognition for almost unique insight and thoroughness in that direction though i believe that when he came to embody the results in those extraordinary volumes recording the battles of our civil war he retired from the law in some measure he knew these battles more accurately than the generals who fought them and he was of a like proficiency in the european wars from the time of napoleon down to our own time i have heard a story which i cannot vouch for that when foreknowledge of his affliction at the outbreak of our civil war forbade him to be a soldier he became a student of soldiership and wreaked in that sort the passion of his most gallant spirit but whether this was true or not it is certain that he pursued the study with a devotion which never blinded him to the atrocity of war some wars he could excuse and even justify but for any war that seemed wanton or aggressive he had only abhorrence  the last summer of a score that i had known him we sat on the veranda of his cottage at york harbor and looked out over the moonlit sea and he talked of the high and true things with the inextinguishable zest for the inquiry which i always found in him though he was then feeling the approaches of the malady which was so soon to end all groping in these shadows for him he must have faced the fact with the same courage and the same trust with which he faced all facts from the first i found him a deeply religious man not only in the ecclesiastical sense but in the more mystical meanings of the word and he kept his faith as he kept his youth to the last every one who knew him knows how young he was in heart and how he liked to have those that were young in years about him he wished to have his house in boston as well as his cottage at york full of young men and young girls whose joy of life he made his own and whose society he preferred to his contemporaries one could not blame him for that or for seeking the sun wherever he could but it would be a false notion of him to suppose that his sympathies were solely or chiefly with the happy in every sort as i knew him he was fine and good the word is not worthy of him after some of its uses and associations but if it were unsmutched by these and whitened to its primitive significance i should say he was one of the most perfect gentlemen i ever knew     oliver wendell holmes     i  elsewhere we literary folk are apt to be such a common lot with tendencies here and there to be a shabby lot we arrive from all sorts of unexpected holes and corners of the earth remote obscure and at the best we do so often come up out of the ground but at boston we were of ascertained and noted origin and good part of us dropped from the skies instead of holding horses before the doors of theatres or capping verses at the ploughtail or tramping over europe with nothing but a flute in the pocket or walking up to the metropolis with no luggage but the ms of a tragedy or sleeping in doorways or under the arches of bridges or serving as apothecaries prenticeswe were good society from the beginning i think this was none the worse for us and it was vastly the better for good society  literature in boston indeed was so respectable and often of so high a lineage that to be a poet was not only to be good society but almost to be good family if one names over the men who gave boston her supremacy in literature during that unitarian harvesttime of the old puritanic seedtime which was her augustan age one names the people who were and who had been socially first in the city ever since the selfexile of the tories at the time of the revolution to say prescott motley parkman lowell norton higginson dana emerson channing was to say patrician in the truest and often the best sense if not the largest boston was small but these were of her first citizens and their primacy in its way was of the same quality as that say of the chief families of venice but these names can never have the effect for the stranger that they had for one to the manner born i say had for i doubt whether in boston they still mean all that they once meant and that their equivalents meant in science in law in politics the most famous if not the greatest of all the literary men of boston i have not mentioned with them for longfellow was not of the place though by his sympathies and relations he became of it and i have not mentioned oliver wendell holmes because i think his name would come first into the readers thought with the suggestion of social quality in the humanities  holmes was of the brahminical caste which his humorous recognition invited from its subjectivity in the new england consciousness into the light where all could know it and own it and like longfellow he was allied to the patriciate of boston by the most intimate ties of life for a long time for the whole first period of his work he stood for that alone its tastes its prejudices its foibles even and when he came to stand in his second period for vastly for infinitely more and to make friends with the whole race as few men have ever done it was always i think with a secret shiver of doubt a backward look of longing and an eye askance he was himself perfectly aware of this at times and would mark his several misgivings with a humorous sense of the situation he was essentially too kind to be of a narrow world too human to be finally of less than humanity too gentle to be of the finest gentility but such limitations as he had were in the direction i have hinted or perhaps more than hinted and i am by no means ready to make a mock of them as it would be so easy to do for some reasons that he has himself suggested to value aright the affection which the old bostonian had for boston one must conceive of something like the patriotism of men in the times when a mans city was a mans country something athenian something florentine the war that nationalized us liberated this love to the whole country but its first tenderness remained still for boston and i suppose a bostonian still thinks of himself first as a bostonian and then as an american in a way that no newyorker could deal with himself the rich historical background dignifies and ennobles the intense public spirit of the place and gives it a kind of personality     ii  in literature doctor holmes survived all the bostonians who had given the city her primacy in letters but when i first knew him there was no apparent ground for questioning it i do not mean now the time when i visited new england but when i came to live near boston and to begin the many happy years which i spent in her fine intellectual air i found time to run in upon him while i was there arranging to take my place on the atlantic monthly and i remember that in this brief moment with him he brought me to book about some vaunting paragraph in the nation claiming the literary primacy for new york he asked me if i knew who wrote it and i was obliged to own that i had written it myself when with the kindness he always showed me he protested against my position to tell the truth i do not think now i had any very good reasons for it and i certainly could urge none that would stand against his i could only fall back upon the saving clause that this primacy was claimed mainly if not wholly for new york in the future he was willing to leave me the connotations of prophecy but i think he did even this out of politeness rather than conviction and i believe he had always a sensitiveness where boston was concerned which could not seem ungenerous to any generous mind whatever lingering doubt of me he may have had with reference to boston seemed to satisfy itself when several years afterwards he happened to speak of a certain character in an early novel of mine who was not quite the kind of bostonian one could wish to be the thing came up in talk with another person who had referred to my bostonian and the doctor had apparently made his acquaintance in the book and not liked him i understood of course he said that he was a bostonian not the bostonian and i could truthfully answer that this was by all means my own understanding too  his fondness for his city which no one could appreciate better than myself i hope often found expression in a burlesque excess in his writings and in his talk perhaps oftener still hard upon my return from venice i had a halfhour with him in his old study on charles street where he still lived in 1865 and while i was there a young man came in for the doctors help as a physician though he looked so very well and was so lively and cheerful that i have since had my doubts whether he had not made a pretext for a glimpse of him as the autocrat the doctor took him upon his word however and said he had been so long out of practice that he could not do anything for him but he gave him the address of another physician somewhere near washington street and if you dont know where washington street is he said with a gay burst at a certain vagueness which had come into the young mans face you dont know anything  we had been talking of venice and what life was like there and he made me tell him in some detail he was especially interested in what i had to say of the minute subdivision and distribution of the necessaries the small coins and the small values adapted to their purchase the intensely retail character in fact of household provisioning and i could see how he pleased himself in formulating the theory that the higher a civilization the finer the apportionment of the demands and supplies the ideal he said was a civilization in which you could buy two cents worth of beef and a divergence from this standard was towards barbarism  the secret of the man who is universally interesting is that he is universally interested and this was above all the secret of the charm that doctor holmes had for every one no doubt he knew it for what that most alert intelligence did not know of itself was scarcely worth knowing this knowledge was one of his chief pleasures i fancy he rejoiced in the consciousness which is one of the highest attributes of the highly organized man and he did not care for the consequences in your mind if you were so stupid as not to take him aright i remember the delight henry james the father of the novelist had in reporting to me the frankness of the doctor when he had said to him holmes you are intellectually the most alive man i ever knew i am i am said the doctor from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot im alive im alive any one who ever saw him will imagine the vivid relish he had in recognizing the fact he could not be with you a moment without shedding upon you the light of his flashing wit his radiant humor and he shone equally upon the rich and poor in mind his gaiety of heart could not withhold itself from any chance of response but he did wish always to be fully understood and to be liked by those he liked he gave his liking cautiously though for the affluence of his sympathies left him without the reserves of colder natures and he had to make up for these with careful circumspection he wished to know the character of the person who made overtures to his acquaintance for he was aware that his friendship lay close to it he wanted to be sure that he was a nice person and though i think he preferred social quality in his fellowman he did not refuse himself to those who had merely a sweet and wholesome humanity he did not like anything that tasted or smelt of bohemianism in the personnel of literature but he did not mind the scent of the newploughed earth or even of the barnyard i recall his telling me once that after two younger brothersinletters had called upon him in the odor of an habitual beeriness and smokiness he opened the window and the very last time i saw him he remembered at eightyfive the offence he had found on his first visit to new york when a metropolitan poet had asked him to lunch in a basement restaurant     iii  he seemed not to mind however climbing to the little apartment we had in boston when we came there in 1866 and he made this call upon us in due form bringing mrs holmes with him as if to accent the recognition socially we were then incredibly young much younger than i find people ever are nowadays and in the consciousness of our youth we felt to the last exquisite value of the fact what it was to have the autocrat come to see us and i believe he was not displeased to perceive this he liked to know that you felt his quality in every way that first winter however i did not see him often and in the spring we went to live in cambridge and thereafter i met him chiefly at longfellows or when i came in to dine at the fieldses in boston it was at certain meetings of the dante club when longfellow read aloud his translation for criticism and there was supper later that one saw the doctor and his voice was heard at the supper rather than at the criticism for he was no italianate he always seemed to like a certain turn of the talk toward the mystical but with space for the feet on a firm ground of fact this side of the shadows when it came to going over among them and laying hold of them with the band of faith as if they were substance he was not of the excursion it is well known how fervent i cannot say devout a spiritualist longfellows brotherinlaw appleton was and when he was at the table too it took all the poets delicate skill to keep him and the autocrat from involving themselves in a cataclysmal controversy upon the matter of manifestations with doctor holmes the inquiry was inquiry to the last i believe and the burden of proof was left to the ghosts and their friends his attitude was strictly scientific he denied nothing but he expected the supernatural to be at least as convincing as the natural  there was a time in his history when the popular ignorance classed him with those who were once rudely called infidels but the world has since gone so fast and so far that the mind he was of concerning religious belief would now be thought religious by a good half of the religious world it is true that he had and always kept a grudge against the ancestral calvinism which afflicted his youth and he was through all rises and lapses of opinion essentially unitarian but of the honest belief of any one i am sure he never felt or spoke otherwise than most tolerantly most tenderly as often as he spoke of religion and his talk tended to it very often i never heard an irreligious word from him far less a scoff or sneer at religion and i am certain that this was not merely because he would have thought it bad taste though undoubtedly he would have thought it bad taste i think it annoyed it hurt him to be counted among the iconoclasts and he would have been profoundly grieved if he could have known how widely this false notion of him once prevailed it can do no harm at this late day to impart from the secrets of the publishing house the fact that a supposed infidelity in the tone of his story the guardian angel cost the atlantic monthly many subscribers now the tone of that story would not be thought even mildly agnostic i fancy and long before his death the author had outlived the error concerning him  it was not the best of his stories by any means and it would not be too harsh to say that it was the poorest his novels all belonged to an order of romance which was as distinctly his own as the form of dramatized essay which he invented in the autocrat if he did not think poorly of them he certainly did not think too proudly and i heard him quote with relish the phrase of a lady who had spoken of them to him as his medicated novels that indeed was perhaps what they were a faint faint odor of the pharmacopoeia clung to their pages their magic was scientific he knew this better than any one else of course and if any one had said it in his turn he would hardly have minded it but what he did mind was the persistent misinterpretation of his intention in certain quarters where he thought he had the right to respectful criticism in stead of the succession of sneers that greeted the successive numbers of his story and it was no secret that he felt the persecution keenly perhaps he thought that he had already reached that time in his literary life when he was a fact rather than a question and when reasons and not feelings must have to do with his acceptance or rejection but he had to live many years yet before he reached this state when he did reach it happily a good while before his death i do not believe any man ever enjoyed the like condition more he loved to feel himself out of the fight with much work before him still but with nothing that could provoke illwill in his activities he loved at all times to take himself objectively if i may so express my sense of a mental attitude that misled many as i have said before he was universally interested and he studied the universe from himself i do not know how one is to study it otherwise the impersonal has really no existence but with all his subtlety and depth he was of a make so simple of a spirit so naive that he could not practise the feints some use to conceal that interest in self which after all every one knows is only concealed he frankly and joyously made himself the startingpoint in all his inquest of the hearts and minds of other men but so far from singling himself out in this and standing apart in it there never was any one who was more eagerly and gladly your fellowbeing in the things of the soul     iv  in the things of the world he had fences and looked at some people through palings and even over the broken bottles on the tops of walls and i think he was the loser by this as well as they but then i think all fences are bad and that god has made enough differences between men we need not trouble ourselves to multiply them even behind his fences however holmes had a heart kind for the outsiders and i do not believe any one came into personal relations with him who did not experience this kindness in that long and delightful talk i had with him on my return from venice i can praise the talk because it was mainly his we spoke of the status of domestics in the old world and how fraternal the relation of high and low was in italy while in england between master and man it seemed without acknowledgment of their common humanity yes he said i always felt as if english servants expected to be trampled on but i cant do that if they want to be trampled on they must get some one else he thought that our american way was infinitely better and i believe that in spite of the fences there was always an instinctive impulse with him to get upon common ground with his fellowman i used to notice in the neighborhood cabman who served our block on beacon street a sort of affectionate reverence for the autocrat which could have come from nothing but the kindly terms between them if you went to him when he was engaged to doctor holmes he told you so with a sort of implication in his manner that the thought of anything else for the time was profanation the good fellow who took him his drives about the beverly and manchester shores seemed to be quite in the joke of the doctors humor and within the bounds of his personal modesty and his functional dignity permitted himself a smile at the doctors sallies when you stood talking with him or listening to him at the carriageside  the civic and social circumstance that a man values himself on is commonly no part of his value and certainly no part of his greatness rather it is the very thing that limits him and i think that doctor holmes appeared in the full measure of his generous personality to those who did not and could not appreciate his circumstance and not to those who formed it and who from lifelong association were so dear and comfortable to him those who best knew how great a man he was were those who came from far to pay him their duty or to thank him for some help they had got from his books or to ask his counsel or seek his sympathy with all such he was most winningly tender most intelligently patient i suppose no great author was ever more visited by letter and in person than he or kept a faithfuler conscience for his guests with those who appeared to him in the flesh he used a miraculous tact and i fancy in his treatment of all the physician native in him bore a characteristic part no one seemed to be denied access to him but it was after a moment of preparation that one was admitted and any one who was at all sensitive must have felt from the first moment in his presence that there could be no trespassing in point of time if now and then some insensitive began to trespass there was a slidingscale of dismissal that never failed of its work and that really saved the author from the effect of intrusion he was not bored because he would not be  i transfer at random the impressions of many years to my page and i shall not try to observe a chronological order in these memories vivid among them is that of a visit which i paid him with osgood the publisher then newly the owner of the atlantic monthly when i had newly become the sole editor we wished to signalize our accession to the control of the magazine by a stroke that should tell most in the public eye and we thought of asking doctor holmes to do something again in the manner of the autocrat and the professor at the breakfast table some letters had passed between him and the management concerning our wish and then osgood thought that it would be right and fit for us to go to him in person he proposed the visit and doctor holmes received us with a mind in which he had evidently formulated all his thoughts upon the matter his main question was whether at his age of sixty years a man was justified in seeking to recall a public of the past or to create a new public in the present he seemed to have looked the ground over not only with a personal interest in the question but with a keen scientific zest for it as something which it was delightful to consider in its generic relations and i fancy that the pleasure of this inquiry more than consoled him for such pangs of misgiving as he must have had in the personal question as commonly happens in the solution of such problems it was not solved he was very willing to take our minds upon it and to incur the risk if we thought it well and were willing to share it  we came away rejoicing and the new series began with the new year following it was by no means the popular success that we had hoped not because the author had not a thousand new things to say or failed to say them with the gust and freshness of his immortal youth but because it was not well to disturb a form associated in the public mind with an achievement which had become classic it is of the autocrat of the breakfast table that people think when they think of the peculiar species of dramatic essay which the author invented and they think also of the professor at the breakfast table because he followed so soon but the poet at the breakfast table came so long after that his advent alienated rather than conciliated liking very likely if the poet had come first he would have had no second place in the affections of his readers for his talk was full of delightful matter and at least one of the poems which graced each instalment was one of the finest and greatest that doctor holmes ever wrote i mean homesick in heaven which seems to me not only what i have said but one of the most important the most profoundly pathetic in the language indeed i do not know any other that in the same direction goes so far with suggestion so penetrating the other poems were mainly of a cast which did not win the metaphysics in them were too much for the human interest and again there rose a foolish clamor of the creeds against him on account of them the great talent the beautiful and graceful fancy the eager imagination of the autocrat could not avail in this third attempt and i suppose the poet at the breakfast table must be confessed as near a failure as doctor holmes could come it certainly was so in the magazine which the brilliant success of the first had availed to establish in the high place the periodical must always hold in the history of american literature lowell was never tired of saying when he recurred to the first days of his editorship that the magazine could never have gone at all without the autocrat papers he was proud of having insisted upon holmess doing something for the new venture and he was fond of recalling the authors misgivings concerning his contributions which later repeated themselves with too much reason though not with the reason that was in his own mind     v  he lived twentyfive years after that selfquestion at sixty and after eighty he continued to prove that threescore was not the limit of a mans intellectual activity or literary charm during all that time the work he did in mere quantity was the work that a man in the prime of life might well have been vain of doing and it was of a quality not less surprising if i asked him with any sort of fair notice i could rely upon him always for something for the january number and throughout the year i could count upon him for those occasional pieces in which he so easily excelled all former writers of occasional verse and which he liked to keep from the newspapers for the magazine he had a pride in his promptness with copy and you could always trust his promise the printers toe never galled the authors kibe in his case he wished to have an early proof which he corrected fastidiously but not overmuch and he did not keep it long he had really done all his work in the manuscript which came printperfect and beautifully clear from his pen in that flowing graceful hand which to the last kept a suggestion of the pleasure he must have had in it like all wise contributors he was not only patient but very glad of all the queries and challenges that proofreader and editor could accumulate on the margin of his proofs and when they were both altogether wrong he was still grateful in one of his poems there was some latinquarter french which our collective purism questioned and i remember how tender of us he was in maintaining that in his parisian time at least some ladies beyond the seine said eh ben instead of eh bien he knew that we must be always on the lookout for such little matters and he would not wound our ignorance i do not think any one enjoyed praise more than he of course he would not provoke it but if it came of itself he would not deny himself the pleasure as long as a relish of it remained he used humorously to recognize his delight in it and to say of the lecture audiences which in earlier times hesitated applause why dont they give me three times three i can stand it he himself gave in the generous fulness he desired he did not praise foolishly or dishonestly though he would spare an open dislike but when a thing pleased him he knew how to say so cordially and skilfully so that it might help as well as delight i suppose no great author has tried more sincerely and faithfully to befriend the beginner than he and from time to time he would commend something to me that he thought worth looking at but never insistently in certain cases where he had simply to ease a burden from his own to the editorial shoulders he would ask that the aspirant might be delicately treated there might be personal reasons for this but usually his kindness of heart moved him his tastes had their geographical limit but his sympathies were boundless and the hopeless creature for whom he interceded was oftener remote from boston and new england than otherwise  it seems to me that he had a nature singularly affectionate and that it was this which was at fault if he gave somewhat too much of himself to the celebration of the class of 29 and all the multitude of boston occasions large and little embalmed in the clear amber of his verse somewhat to the disadvantage of the amber if he were asked he could not deny the many friendships and fellowships which united in the asking the immediate reclame from these things was sweet to him but he loved to comply as much as he loved to be praised in the pleasure he got he could feel himself a prophet in his own country but the country which owned him prophet began perhaps to feel rather too much as if it owned him and did not prize his vaticinations at all their worth some polite bostonians knew him chiefly on this side and judged him to their own detriment from it     vi  after we went to live in cambridge my life and the delight in it were so wholly there that in ten years i had hardly been in as many boston houses as i have said i met doctor holmes at the fieldses and at longfellows when he came out to a dante supper which was not often and somewhat later at the saturday club dinners one parlous time at the publishers i have already recalled when mrs harriet beecher stowe and the autocrat clashed upon homeopathy and it required all the tact of the host to lure them away from the dangerous theme as it was a battle waged in the courteous forms of fontenoy went on pretty well through the dinner and it was only over the coffee that a truce was called i need not say which was heterodox or that each had a deep and strenuous conscience in the matter i have always felt it a proof of his extreme leniency to me unworthy that the doctor was able to tolerate my own defection from the elder faith in medicine and i could not feel his kindness less caressing because i knew it a concession to an infirmity he said something like after all a good physician was the great matter and i eagerly turned his clemency to praise of our family doctor  he was very constant at the saturday club as long as his strength permitted and few of its members missed fewer of its meetings he continued to sit at its table until the ghosts of hawthorne of agassiz of emerson of longfellow of lowell out of others less famous bore him company there among the younger men in the flesh it must have been very melancholy but nothing could deeply cloud his most cheerful spirit his strenuous interest in life kept him alive to all the things of it after so many of his friends were dead the questions which he was wont to deal with so fondly so wisely the great problems of the soul were all the more vital perhaps because the personal concern in them was increased by the translation to some other being of the men who had so often tried with him to fathom them here the last time i was at that table he sat alone there among those great memories but he was as gay as ever i saw him his wit sparkled his humor gleamed the poetic touch was deft and firm as of old the serious curiosity the instant sympathy remained to the witness he was pathetic but to himself he could only have been interesting as the figure of a man surviving in an alien but not unfriendly present the past which held so vast a part of all that had constituted him if he had thought of himself in this way it would have been without one emotion of selfpity such as more maudlin souls indulge but with a love of knowledge and wisdom as keenly alert as in his prime  for three privileged years i lived all but nextdoor neighbor of doctor holmes in that part of beacon street whither he removed after he left his old home in charles street and during these years i saw him rather often we were both on the water side which means so much more than the words say and our library windows commanded the same general view of the charles rippling out into the cambridge marshes and the sunsets and curving eastward under long bridge through shipping that increased onward to the sea he said that you could count fourteen towns and villages in the compass of that view with the three conspicuous monuments accenting the different attractions of it the tower of memorial hall at harvard the obelisk on bunker hill and in the centre of the picture that bulk of tufts college which he said he expected to greet his eyes the first thing when he opened them in the other world but the prospect though generally the same had certain precious differences for each of us which i have no doubt he valued himself as much upon as i did i have a notion that he fancied these were to be enjoyed best in his library through two oval panes let into the bay there apart from the windows for he was apt to make you come and look out of them if you got to talking of the view before you left in this pleasant study he lived among the books which seemed to multiply from case to case and shelf to shelf and climb from floor to ceiling everything was in exquisite order and the desk where he wrote was as scrupulously neat as if the sloven disarray of most authors desks were impossible to him he had a number of ingenious little contrivances for helping his work which he liked to show you for a time a revolving bookcase at the corner of his desk seemed to be his pet and after that came his fountainpen which he used with due observance of its fountain principle though he was tolerant of me when i said i always dipped mine in the inkstand it was a merit in his eyes to use a fountain pen in anywise after you had gone over these objects with him and perhaps taken a peep at something he was examining through his microscope he sat down at one corner of his hearth and invited you to an easy chair at the other his talk was always considerate of your wish to be heard but the person who wished to talk when he could listen to doctor holmes was his own victim and always the loser if you were well advised you kept yourself to the question and response which manifested your interest in what he was saying and let him talk on with his sweet smile and that husky laugh he broke softly into at times perhaps he was not very well when you came in upon him then he would name his trouble with a scientific zest and accuracy and pass quickly to other matters as i have noted he was interested in himself only on the universal side and he liked to find his peculiarity in you better than to keep it his own he suffered a visible disappointment if he could not make you think or say you were so and so too the querulous note was not in his most cheerful register he would not dwell upon a specialized grief though sometimes i have known him touch very lightly and currently upon a slight annoyance or disrelish for this or that as he grew older he must have had of course an old mans disposition to speak of his infirmities but it was fine to see him catch himself up in this when he became conscious of it and stop short with an abrupt turn to something else with a real interest which he gave humorous excess he would celebrate some little ingenious thing that had fallen in his way and i have heard him expatiate with childlike delight upon the merits of a new razor he had got a sort of mower which he could sweep recklessly over cheek and chin without the least danger of cutting himself the last time i saw him he asked me if he had ever shown me that miraculous razor and i doubt if he quite liked my saying i had seen one of the same kind  it seemed to me that he enjoyed sitting at his chimneycorner rather as the type of a person having a good time than as such a person he would rather be up and about something taking down a book making a note going again to his little windows and asking you if you had seen the crows yet that sometimes alighted on the shoals left bare by the ebbtide behind the house the reader will recall his lovely poem my aviary which deals with the winged life of that pleasant prospect i shared with him in the flock of wildducks which used to come into our neighbor waters in spring when the ice broke up and stayed as long as the smallest space of brine remained unfrozen in the fall he was graciously willing i should share in them and in the cloud of gulls which drifted about in the currents of the sea and sky there almost the whole year round i did not pretend an original right to them coming so late as i did to the place and i think my deference pleased him     vii  as i have said he liked his fences or at least liked you to respect them or to be sensible of them as often as i went to see him i was made to wait in the little receptionroom below and never shown at once to his study my name would be carried up and i would hear him verifying my presence from the maid through the opened door then there came a cheery cry of wellcome is that you come up come up and i found him sometimes halfway down the stairs to meet me he would make an excuse for having kept me below a moment and say something about the rule he had to observe in all cases as if he would not have me feel his fence a personal thing i was aware how thoroughly his gentle spirit pervaded the whole house the irish maid who opened the door had the effect of being a neighbor too and of being in the joke of the little formality she apologized in her turn for the receptionroom there was certainly nothing trampled upon in her manner but affection and reverence for him whose gate she guarded with something like the sentiment she would have cherished for a dignitary of the church but nicely differenced and adjusted to the autocrats peculiar merits  the last time i was in that place a visitant who had lately knocked at my own door was about to enter i met the master of the house on the landing of the stairs outside his study and he led me in for the few moments we could spend together he spoke of the shadow so near and said he supposed there could be no hope but he did not refuse the cheer i offered him from my ignorance against his knowledge and at something that was thought or said he smiled with even a breath of laughter so potent is the wont of a lifetime though his eyes were full of tears and his voice broke with his words those who have sorrowed deepest will understand this best  it was during the few years of our beacon street neighborhood that he spent those hundred days abroad in his last visit to england and france he was full of their delight when he came back and my propinquity gave me the advantage of hearing him speak of them at first hand he whimsically pleased himself most with his derbyday experiences and enjoyed contrasting the crowd and occasion with that of forty or fifty years earlier when he had seen some famous race of the derby won nothing else in england seemed to have moved him so much though all that royalties dignities and celebrities could well do for him had been done of certain things that happened to him characteristic of the english and interesting to him in their relation to himself through his character of universally interested man he spoke freely but he has said what he chose to the public about them and i have no right to say more the thing that most vexed him during his sojourn apparently was to have been described in one of the london papers as quite deaf and i could truly say to him that i had never imagined him at all deaf or heard him accused of it before oh yes he said i am a little hard of hearing on one side but it isnt deafness  he had indeed few or none of the infirmities of age that make themselves painfully or inconveniently evident he carried his slight figure erect and until his latest years his step was quick and sure once he spoke of the lessened height of old people apropos of something that was said and they will shrink you know he added as if he were not at all concerned in the fact himself if you met him in the street you encountered a spare carefully dressed old gentleman with a cleanshaven face and a friendly smile qualified by the involuntary frown of his thick senile brows well coated lustrously shod well gloved in a silk hat latterly wound with a mourningweed sometimes he did not know you when he knew you quite well and at such times i think it was kind to spare his years the fatigue of recalling your identity at any rate i am glad of the times when i did so in society he had the same vagueness the same dimness but after the moment he needed to make sure of you he was as vivid as ever in his life he made me think of a bed of embers on which the ashes have thinly gathered and which when these are breathed away sparkles and tinkles keenly up with all the freshness of a newly kindled fire he did not mind talking about his age and i fancied rather enjoyed doing so its approaches interested him if he was going he liked to know just how and when he was going once he spoke of his lasting strength in terms of imaginative humor he was still so intensely interested in nature the universe that it seemed to him he was not like an old man so much as a lusty infant which struggles against having the breast snatched from it he laughed at the notion of this with that impersonal relish which seemed to me singularly characteristic of the selfconsciousness so marked in him i never heard one lugubrious word from him in regard to his years he liked your sympathy on all grounds where he could have it selfrespectfully but he was a most manly spirit and he would not have had it even as a type of the universal decay possibly he would have been interested to have you share in that analysis of himself which he was always making if such a thing could have been  he had not much patience with the unmanly craving for sympathy in others and chiefly in our literary craft which is somewhat ignobly given to it though he was patient after all he used to say and i believe he has said it in printholmes said it in print many times in his three novels and scattered through the breakfast table series dwthat unless a man could show a good reason for writing verse it was rather against him and a proof of weakness i suppose this severe conclusion was something he had reached after dealing with innumerable small poets who sought the light in him with verses that no editor would admit to print yet of morbidness he was often very tender he knew it to be disease something that must be scientifically rather than ethically treated he was in the same degree kind to any sensitiveness for he was himself as sensitive as he was manly and he was most delicately sensitive to any rightful social claim upon him i was once at a dinner with him where he was in some sort my host in a company of people whom he had not seen me with before and he made a point of acquainting me with each of them it did not matter that i knew most of them already the proof of his thoughtfulness was precious and i was sorry when i had to disappoint it by confessing a previous knowledge     viii  i had three memorable meetings with him not very long before he died one a year before and the other two within a few months of the end the first of these was at luncheon in the summerhouse of a friend whose hospitality made it summer the year round and we all went out to meet him when he drove up in his open carriage with the little sunshade in his hand which he took with him for protection against the heat and also a little i think for the whim of it he sat a moment after he arrived as if to orient himself in respect to each of us beside the gifted hostess there was the most charming of all the american essayists and the autocrat seemed at once to find himself singularly at home with the people who greeted him there was no interval needed for fanning away the ashes he tinkled up before he entered the house and at the table he was as vivid and scintillant as i ever saw him if indeed i ever saw him as much so the talk began at once and we had made him believe that there was nothing egotistic in his taking the word or turning it in illustration from himself upon universal matters i spoke among other things of some humble ruins on the road to gloucester which gave the wayside a very aged look the tumbled foundationstones of poor bits of houses and ah he said the cellar and the well he added to the company generally do you know what i think are the two lines of mine that go as deep as any others in a certain direction and he began to repeat stragglingly certain verses from one of his earlier poems until he came to the closing couplet but i will give them in full because in going to look them up i have found them so lovely and because i can hear his voice again in every fondly accented syllable       who sees unmoved a ruin at his feet      the lowliest home where human hearts have beat      its hearthstone shaded with the bistre stain      a centurys showery torrents wash in vain      its starving orchard where the thistle blows      and mossy trunks still mark the broken rows      its chimneyloving poplar oftenest seen      next an old roof or where a roof has been      its knotgrass plantainall the social weeds      mans mute companions following where he leads      its dwarfed pale flowers that show their straggling heads      sown by the wind from grasschoked gardenbeds      its woodbine creeping where it used to climb      its roses breathing of the olden time      all the poor shows the curious idler sees      as lifes thin shadows waste by slow degrees      till naught remains the saddening tale to tell      save homes last wrecksthe cellar and the well  the poets chanting voice rose with a triumphant swell in the climax and there he said isnt it so the cellar and the wellthey cant be thrown down or burnt up they are the human monuments that last longest and defy decay he rejoiced openly in the sympathy that recognized with him the divination of a most pathetic most signal fact and he repeated the last couplet again at our entreaty glad to be entreated for it i do not know whether all will agree with him concerning the relative importance of the lines but i think all must feel the exquisite beauty of the picture to which they give the final touch  he said a thousand witty and brilliant things that day but his pleasure in this gave me the most pleasure and i recall the passage distinctly out of the dimness that covers the rest he chose to figure us younger men in touching upon the literary circumstance of the past and present as representative of modern feeling and thinking and himself as no longer contemporary we knew he did this to be contradicted and we protested affectionately fervently with all our hearts and minds and indeed there were none of his generation who had lived more widely into ours he was not a prophet like emerson nor ever a voice crying in the wilderness like whittier or lowell his note was heard rather amid the sweet security of streets but it was always for a finer and gentler civility he imagined no new rule of life and no philosophy or theory of life will be known by his name he was not constructive he was essentially observant and in this he showed the scientific nature he made his reader known to himself first in the little and then in the larger things from first to last he was a censor but a most winning and delightful censor who could make us feel that our faults were other peoples and who was not wont       to bait his homilies with his brother worms  at one period he sat in the seat of the scorner as far as reform was concerned or perhaps reformers who are so often tedious and ridiculous but he seemed to get a new heart with the new mind which came to him when he began to write the autocrat papers and the light mocker of former days became the serious and compassionate thinker to whom most truly nothing that was human was alien his readers trusted and loved him few men have ever written so intimately with so much dignity and perhaps none has so endeared himself by saying just the thing for his reader that his reader could not say for himself he sought the universal through himself in others and he found to his delight and theirs that the most universal thing was often if not always the most personal thing  in my later meetings with him i was struck more and more by his gentleness i believe that men are apt to grow gentler as they grow older unless they are of the curmudgeon type which rusts and crusts with age but with doctor holmes the gentleness was peculiarly marked he seemed to shrink from all things that could provoke controversy or even difference he waived what might be a matter of dispute and rather sought the things that he could agree with you upon in the last talk i had with him he appeared to have no grudge left except for the puritanic orthodoxy in which he had been bred as a child this he was not able to forgive though its tradition was interwoven with what was tenderest and dearest in his recollections of childhood we spoke of puritanism and i said i sometimes wondered what could be the mind of a man towards life who had not been reared in its awful shadow say an english churchman or a continental catholic and he said he could not imagine and that he did not believe such a man could at all enter into our feelings puritanism he seemed to think made an essential and ineradicable difference i do not believe he had any of that false sentiment which attributes virtue of character to severity of creed while it owns the creed to be wrong  he differed from longfellow in often speaking of his contemporaries he spoke of them frankly but with an appreciative rather than a censorious criticism of longfellow himself he said that day when i told him i had been writing about him and he seemed to me a man without error that he could think of but one error in him and that was an error of taste of almost merely literary taste it was at an earlier time that he talked of lowell after his death and told me that lowell once in the fever of his antislavery apostolate had written him urging him strongly as a matter of duty to come out for the cause he had himself so much at heart afterwards lowell wrote again owning himself wrong in his appeal which he had come to recognize as invasive he was ten years younger than i said the doctor  i found him that day i speak of in his house at beverly farms where he had a pleasant study in a corner by the porch and he met me with all the cheeriness of old but he confessed that he had been greatly broken up by the labor of preparing something that might be read at some commemorative meeting and had suffered from finding first that he could not write something specially for it even the copying and adapting an old poem had overtaxed him and in this he showed the failing powers of age but otherwise he was still young intellectually that is there was no failure of interest in intellectual things especially literary things some new book lay on the table at his elbow and he asked me if i had seen it and made some joke about his having had the good luck to read it and have it lying by him a few days before when the author called i do not know whether he schooled himself against an old mans tendency to revert to the past or not but i know that he seldom did so that morning however he made several excursions into it and told me that his youthful satire of the spectre pig had been provoked by a poem of the elder danas where a phantom horse had been seriously employed with an effect of anticlimax which he had found irresistible another foray was to recall the oppression and depression of his early religious associations and to speak with moving tenderness of his father whose hard doctrine as a minister was without effect upon his own kindly nature  in a letter written to me a few weeks after this time upon an occasion when he divined that some word from him would be more than commonly dear he recurred to the feeling he then expressed fiftysix years agomore than half a centuryi lost my own father his age being seventythree years as i have reached that period of life passed it and now left it far behind my recollections seem to brighten and bring back my boyhood and early manhood in a clearer and fairer light than it came to me in my middle decades i have often wished of late years that i could tell him how i cherished his memory perhaps i may have the happiness of saying all i long to tell him on the other side of that thin partition which i love to think is all that divides us  men are never long together without speaking of women and i said how inevitably mens lives ended where they began in the keeping of women and their strength failed at last and surrendered itself to their care i had not finished before i was made to feel that i was poaching and yes said the owner of the preserve i have spoken of that and he went on to tell me just where he was not going to have me suppose i had invented those notions and i could not do less than own that i must have found them in his book and forgotten it  he spoke of his pleasant summer life in the air at once soft and fresh of that lovely coast and of his drives up and down the country roads sometimes this lady and sometimes that came for him and one or two habitually but he always had his own carriage ordered if they failed that he might not fail of his drive in any fair weather his cottage was not immediately on the sea but in full sight of it and there was a sense of the sea about it as there is in all that incomparable region and i do not think he could have been at home anywhere beyond the reach of its salt breath  i was anxious not to outstay his strength and i kept my eye on the clock in frequent glances i saw that he followed me in one of these and i said that i knew what his hours were and i was watching so that i might go away in time and then he sweetly protested did i like that chair i was sitting in it was a gift to him and he said who gave it with a pleasure in the fact that was very charming as if he liked the association of the thing with his friend he was disposed to excuse the formal look of his bookcases which were filled with sets and presented some phalanxes of fiction in rather severe array  when i rose to go he was concerned about my being able to find my way readily to the station and he told me how to go and what turns to take as if he liked realizing the way to himself i believe he did not walk much of late years and i fancy he found much the same pleasure in letting his imagination make this excursion to the station with me that he would have found in actually going  i saw him once more but only once when a day or two later he drove up by our hotel in magnolia toward the cottage where his secretary was lodging he saw us from his carriage and called us gayly to him to make us rejoice with him at having finally got that commemorative poem off his mind he made a jest of the trouble it had cost him even some sleeplessness and said he felt now like a convalescent he was all brightness and friendliness and eagerness to make us feel his mood through what was common to us all and i am glad that this last impression of him is so one with the first i ever had and with that which every reader receives from his work  that is bright and friendly and eager too for it is throughout the very expression of himself i think it is a pity if an author disappoints even the unreasonable expectation of the reader whom his art has invited to love him but i do not believe that doctor holmes could inflict this disappointment certainly he could disappoint no reasonable expectation no intelligent expectation what he wrote that he was and every one felt this who met him he has therefore not died as some men die the remote impersonal sort but he is yet thrillingly alive in every page of his books the quantity of his literature is not great but the quality is very surprising and surprising first of all as equality from the beginning to the end he wrote one man of course in his successive consciousnesses perhaps every one does this but his work gives the impression of an uncommon continuity in spite of its being the effect of a later and an earlier impulse so very marked as to have made the later an astonishing revelation to those who thought they knew him     ix  it is not for me in such a paper as this to attempt any judgment of his work i have loved it as i loved him with a sense of its limitations which is by no means a censure of its excellences he was not a man who cared to transcend he liked bounds he liked horizons the constancy of shores if he put to sea he kept in sight of land like the ancient navigators he did not discover new continents and i will own that i for my part should not have liked to sail with columbus i think one can safely affirm that as great and as useful men stayed behind and found an america of the mind without stirring from their thresholds     the white mr longfellow  we had expected to stay in boston only until we could find a house in old cambridge this was not so simple a matter as it might seem for the ancient town had not yet quickened its scholarly pace to the modern step indeed in the spring of 1866 the impulse of expansion was not yet visibly felt anywhere the enormous material growth that followed the civil war had not yet begun in cambridge the houses to be let were few and such as there were fell either below our pride or rose above our purse i wish i might tell how at last we bought a house we had no money but we were rich in friends who are still alive to shrink from the story of their constant faith in a financial future which we sometimes doubted and who backed their credulity with their credit it is sufficient for the present record which professes to be strictly literary to notify the fact that on the first day of may 1866 we went out to cambridge and began to live in a house which we owned in fee if not in deed and which was none the less valuable for being covered with mortgages physically it was a carpenters box of a sort which is readily imagined by the angloamerican genius for ugliness but which it is not so easy to impart a just conception of a trim hedge of arborvita tried to hide it from the world in front and a tall board fence behind the little lot was well planted perhaps too well planted with pears grapes and currants and there was a small open space which i lost no time in digging up for a kitchengarden on one side of us were the open fields on the other a brief line of neighborhouses across the street before us was a grove of stately oaks which i never could persuade aldrich had painted leaves on them in the fall we were really in a poor suburb of a suburb but such is the fascination of ownership even the ownership of a fully mortgaged property that we calculated the latitude and longitude of the whole earth from the spot we called ours in our walks about cambridge we saw other places where we might have been willing to live only we said they were too far off we even prized the architecture of our little box though we had but so lately lived in a gothic palace on the grand canal in venice and were not uncritical of beauty in the possessions of others positive beauty we could not have honestly said we thought our cottage had as a whole though we might have held out for something of the kind in the brackets of turned wood under its eaves but we were richly content with it and with life in cambridge as it began to open itself to us we were infinitely more than content this life so refined so intelligent so gracefully simple i do not suppose has anywhere else had its parallel     i  it was the moment before the old american customs had been changed by european influences among people of easier circumstances and in cambridge society kept what was best of its village traditions and chose to keep them in the full knowledge of different things nearly every one had been abroad and nearly every one had acquired the taste for olives without losing a relish for native sauces through the intellectual life there was an entire democracy and i do not believe that since the capitalistic era began there was ever a community in which money counted for less there was little show of what money could buy i remember but one private carriage naturally a publishers and there was not one livery except a livery in the larger sense kept by the stableman pike who made us pay now a quarter and now a half dollar for a seat in his carriages according as he lost or gathered courage for the charge we thought him extortionate and we mostly walked through snow and mud of amazing depth and thickness  the reader will imagine how acceptable this circumstance was to a young literary man beginning life with a fully mortgaged house and a salary of untried elasticity if there were distinctions made in cambridge they were not against literature and we found ourselves in the midst of a charming society indifferent apparently to all questions but those of the higher education which comes so largely by nature that is to say in the cambridge of that day and i dare say of this a mind cultivated in some sort was essential and after that came civil manners and the willingness and ability to be agreeable and interesting but the question of riches or poverty did not enter even the question of family which is of so great concern in new england was in abeyance perhaps it was taken for granted that every one in old cambridge society must be of good family or he could not be there perhaps his mere residence tacitly ennobled him certainly his acceptance was an informal patent of gentility to my mind the structure of society was almost ideal and until we have a perfectly socialized condition of things i do not believe we shall ever have a more perfect society the instincts which governed it were not such as can arise from the sordid competition of interests they flowed from a devotion to letters and from a selfsacrifice in material things which i can give no better notion of than by saying that the outlay of the richest college magnate seemed to be graduated to the income of the poorest  in those days the men whose names have given splendor to cambridge were still living there i shall forget some of them in the alphabetical enumeration of louis agassiz francis j child richard henry dana jun john fiske dr asa gray the family of the jameses father and sons lowell longfellow charles eliot norton dr john g palfrey james pierce dr peabody professor parsons professor sophocles the variety of talents and of achievements was indeed so great that mr bret harte when fresh from his pacific slope justly said after listening to a partial rehearsal of them why you couldnt fire a revolver from your front porch anywhere without bringing down a twovolumer everybody had written a book or an article or a poem or was in the process or expectation of doing it and doubtless those whose names escape me will have greater difficulty in eluding fame these kindly these gifted folk each came to see us and to make us at home among them and my home is still among them on this side and on that side of the line between the living and the dead which invisibly passes through all the streets of the cities of men     ii  we had the whole summer for the exploration of cambridge before society returned from the mountains and the seashore and it was not till october that i saw longfellow i heard again as i heard when i first came to boston that he was at nahant and though nahant was no longer so far away now as it was then i did not think of seeking him out even when we went for a day to explore that coast during the summer it seems strange that i cannot recall just when and where i saw him but early after his return to cambridge i had a message from him asking me to come to a meeting of the dante club at craigie house  longfellow was that winter 18667 revising his translation of the paradiso and the dante club was the circle of italianate friends and scholars whom he invited to follow him and criticise his work from the original while he read his version aloud those who were most constantly present were lowell and professor norton but from time to time others came in and we seldom sat down at the nineoclock supper that followed the reading of the canto in less number than ten or twelve  the criticism especially from the accomplished danteists i have named was frank and frequent i believe they neither of them quite agreed with longfellow as to the form of version he had chosen but waiving that the question was how perfectly he had done his work upon the given lines i myself with whatever right great or little i may have to an opinion believe thoroughly in longfellows plan when i read his version my sense aches for the rhyme which he rejected but my admiration for his fidelity to dante otherwise is immeasurable i remember with equal admiration the subtle and sympathetic scholarship of his critics who scrutinized every shade of meaning in a word or phrase that gave them pause and did not let it pass till all the reasons and facts had been considered sometimes and even often longfellow yielded to their censure but for the most part when he was of another mind he held to his mind and the passage had to go as he said i make a little haste to say that in all the meetings of the club during a whole winter of wednesday evenings i myself though i faithfully followed in an italian dante with the rest ventured upon one suggestion only this was kindly even seriously considered by the poet and gently rejected he could not do anything otherwise than gently and i was not suffered to feel that i had done a presumptuous thing i can see him now as he looked up from the proofsheets on the round table before him and over at me growing consciously smaller and smaller like something through a reversed operaglass he had a shaded droplight in front of him and in its glow his beautiful and benignly noble head had a dignity peculiar to him  all the portraits of longfellow are likenesses more or less bad and good for there was something as simple in the physiognomy as in the nature of the man his head after he allowed his beard to grow and wore his hair long in the manner of elderly men was leonine but mildly leonine as the old painters conceived the lion of st mark once sophocles the exmonk of mount athos so long a greek professor at harvard came in for supper after the reading was over and he was leonine too but of a fierceness that contrasted finely with longfellows mildness i remember the poets asking him something about the punishment of impaling in turkey and his answering with an ironical gleam of his fiery eyes unhappily it is obsolete i dare say he was not so leonine either as he looked  when longfellow read verse it was with a hollow with a mellow resonant murmur like the note of some deepthroated horn his voice was very lulling in quality and at the dante club it used to have early effect with an old scholar who sat in a cavernous armchair at the corner of the fire and who drowsed audibly in the soft tone and the gentle heat the poet had a fat terrier who wished always to be present at the meetings of the club and he commonly fell asleep at the same moment with that dear old scholar so that when they began to make themselves heard in concert one could not tell which it was that most took our thoughts from the text of the paradiso when the duet opened longfellow would look up with an arch recognition of the fact and then go gravely on to the end of the canto at the close he would speak to his friend and lead him out to supper as if he had not seen or heard anything amiss     iii  in that elect company i was silent partly because i was conscious of my youthful inadequacy and partly because i preferred to listen but longfellow always behaved as if i were saying a succession of edifying and delightful things and from time to time he addressed himself to me so that i should not feel left out he did not talk much himself and i recall nothing that he said but he always spoke both wisely and simply without the least touch of pose and with no intention of effect but with something that i must call quality for want of a better word so that at a table where holmes sparkled and lowell glowed and agassiz beamed he cast the light of a gentle gaiety which seemed to dim all these vivider luminaries while he spoke you did not miss fieldss story or tom appletons wit or even the gracious amity of mr norton with his unequalled intuitions  the supper was very plain a cold turkey which the host carved or a haunch of venison or some braces of grouse or a platter of quails with a deep bowl of salad and the sympathetic companionship of those elect vintages which longfellow loved and which he chose with the inspiration of affection we usually began with oysters and when some one who was expected did not come promptly longfellow invited us to raid his plate as a just punishment of his delay one evening lowell remarked with the cayenne poised above his bluepoints its astonishing how fond these fellows are of pepper  the old friend of the cavernous armchair was perhaps not wide enough awake to repress an ah of deep interest in this fact of natural history and lowell was provoked to go on yes ive dropped a red pepper pod into a barrel of them before now and then taken them out in a solid mass clinging to it like a swarm of bees to their queen  is it possible cried the old friend and then longfellow intervened to save him from worse and turned the talk  i reproach myself that i made no record of the talk for i find that only a few fragments of it have caught in my memory and that the sieve which should have kept the gold has let it wash away with the gravel i remember once doctor holmess talking of the physician as the true seer whose awful gift it was to behold with the fatal second sight of science the shroud gathering to the throat of many a doomed man apparently in perfect health and happy in the promise of unnumbered days the thought may have been suggested by some of the toys of superstition which intellectual people like to play with  i never could be quite sure at first that longfellows brotherinlaw appleton was seriously a spiritualist even when he disputed the most strenuously with the unbelieving autocrat but he really was in earnest about it though he relished a joke at the expense of his doctrine like some clerics when they are in the safe company of other clerics he told me once of having recounted to agassiz the facts of a very remarkable seance where the souls of the departed outdid themselves in the athletics and acrobatics they seem so fond of over there throwing large stones across the room moving pianos and lifting dinnertables and setting them atwirl under the chandelier and now he demanded what do you say to that well mr appleton agassiz answered to appletons infinite delight i say that it did not happen  one night they began to speak at the dante supper of the unhappy man whose crime is a red stain in the cambridge annals and one and another recalled their impressions of professor webster it was possibly with a retroactive sense that they had all felt something uncanny in him but apropos of the deep saladbowl in the centre of the table longfellow remembered a supper webster was at where he lighted some chemical in such a dish and held his head over it with a handkerchief noosed about his throat and lifted above it with one hand while his face in the pale light took on the livid ghastliness of that of a man hanged by the neck  another night the talk wandered to the visit which an english author now with god paid america at the height of a popularity long since toppled to the ground with many another he was in very good humor with our whole continent and at longfellows table he found the champagne even surprisingly fine but he said to his host who now told the story it cawnt be genuine you know  many years afterwards this author revisited our shores and i dined with him at longfellows where he was anxious to constitute himself a guest during his sojourn in our neighborhood longfellow was equally anxious that he should not do so and he took a harmless pleasure in outmanoeuvring him he seized a chance to speak with me alone and plotted to deliver him over to me without apparent unkindness when the latest horsecar should be going in to boston and begged me to walk him to harvard square and put him aboard put him aboard and dont leave him till the car starts and then watch that he doesnt get off  these instructions he accompanied with a lifting of the eyebrows and a pursing of the mouth in an anxiety not altogether burlesque he knew himself the prey of any one who chose to batten on him and his hospitality was subject to frightful abuse perhaps mr norton has somewhere told how when he asked if a certain person who had been outstaying his time was not a dreadful bore longfellow answered with angelic patience yes but then you know i have been bored so often  there was one fatal englishman whom i shared with him during the great part of a season a poor soul not without gifts but always ready for more especially if they took the form of meat and drink he had brought letters from one of the best english men alive who withdrew them too late to save his american friends from the sad consequences of welcoming him so he established himself impregnably in a boston club and came out every day to dine with longfellow in cambridge beginning with his return from nahant in october and continuing far into december that was the year of the great horsedistemper when the plague disabled the transportation in boston and cut off all intercourse between the suburb and the city on the street railways i did think longfellow pathetically lamented that when the horsecars stopped running i should have a little respite from l but he walks out  in the midst of his own suffering he was willing to advise with me concerning some poems l had offered to the atlantic monthly and after we had desperately read them together he said with inspiration i think these things are more adapted to music than the magazine and this seemed so good a notion that when l came to know their fate from me i answered confidently i think they are rather more adapted to music he calmly asked why and as this was an exigency which longfellow had not forecast for me i was caught in it without hope of escape i really do not know what i said but i know that i did not take the poems such was my literary conscience in those days i am afraid i should be weaker now     iv  the suppers of the dante club were a relaxation from the severity of their toils on criticism and i will not pretend that their tabletalk was of that seriousness which duller wits might have given themselves up to the passing stranger especially if a light or jovial person was always welcome and i never knew of the enforcement of the rule i heard of that if you came in without question on the club nights you were a guest but if you rang or knocked you could not get in  any sort of diversion was hailed and once appleton proposed that longfellow should show us his winecellar he took up the candle burning on the table for the cigars and led the way into the basement of the beautiful old colonial mansion doubly memorable as washingtons headquarters while he was in cambridge and as the home of longfellow for so many years the taper cast just the right gleams on the darkness bringing into relief the massive piers of brick and the solid walls of stone which gave the cellar the effect of a casemate in some fortress and leaving the corners and distances to a romantic gloom this basement was a work of the days when men built more heavily if not more substantially than now but i forget if i ever knew what date the winecellar was of it was well stored with precious vintages aptly cobwebbed and dusty but i could not find that it had any more charm than the shelves of a library it is the inside of bottles and of books that makes its appeal the whole place witnessed a bygone state and luxury which otherwise lingered in a dim legend or two longfellow once spoke of certain old loveletters which dropped down on the basement stairs from some place overhead and there was the fable or the fact of a subterranean passage under the street from craigie house to the old batchelder house which i relate to these letters with no authority i can allege but in craigie house dwelt the proud fair lady who was buried in the cambridge churchyard with a slave at her head and a slave at her feet          dust is in her beautiful eyes  and whether it was they that smiled or wept in their time over those loveletters i will leave the reader to say the fortunes of her tory family fell with those of their party and the last vassal ended his days a prisoner from his creditors in his own house with a weekly enlargement on sundays when the law could not reach him it is known how the place took longfellows fancy when he first came to be professor in harvard and how he was a lodger of the last mistress craigie there long before he became its owner the house is square with longfellows study where he read and wrote on the right of the door and a statelier library behind it on the left is the drawingroom with the diningroom in its rear from its square hall climbs a beautiful stairway with twisted banisters and a tall clock in their angle  the study where the dante club met and where i mostly saw longfellow was a plain pleasant room with broad panelling in white painted pine in the centre before the fireplace stood his round table laden with books papers and proofs in the farthest corner by the window was a high desk which he sometimes stood at to write in this room washington held his councils and transacted his business with all comers in the chamber overhead he slept i do not think longfellow associated the place much with him and i never heard him speak of washington in relation to it except once when he told me with peculiar relish what he called the true version of a pious story concerning the aidedecamp who blundered in upon him while he knelt in prayer the father of his country rose and rebuked the young man severely and then resumed his devotions he rebuked him said longfellow lifting his brows and making rings round the pupils of his eyes by throwing his scabbard at his head  all the front windows of craigie house look out over the open fields across the charles which is now the longfellow memorial garden the poet used to be amused with the popular superstition that he was holding this vacant ground with a view to a rise in the price of lots while all he wanted was to keep a feature of his beloved landscape unchanged lofty elms drooped at the corners of the house on the lawn billowed clumps of the lilac which formed a thick hedge along the fence there was a terrace part way down this lawn and when a whitepainted balustrade was set some fifteen years ago upon its brink it seemed always to have been there long verandas stretched on either side of the mansion and behind was an oldfashioned garden with beds primly edged with box after a design of the poets own longfellow had a ghost story of this quaint plaisance which he used to tell with an artful reserve of the catastrophe he was coming home one winter night and as he crossed the garden he was startled by a white figure swaying before him but he knew that the only way was to advance upon it he pushed boldly forward and was suddenly caught under the throatby the clothesline with a long nightgown on it  perhaps it was at the end of a long night of the dante club that i heard him tell this story the evenings were sometimes mornings before the reluctant breakup came but they were never half long enough for me i have given no idea of the high reasoning of vital things which i must often have heard at that table and that i have forgotten it is no proof that i did not hear it the memory will not be ruled as to what it shall bind and what it shall loose and i should entreat mine in vain for record of those meetings other than what i have given perhaps it would be well in the interest of some popular conceptions of what the social intercourse of great wits must be for me to invent some ennobling and elevating passages of conversation at longfellows perhaps i ought to do it for the sake of my own repute as a serious and adequate witness but i am rather helpless in the matter i must set down what i remember and surely if i can remember no phrase from holmes that a reader could live or die by it is something to recall how when a certain potent cheese was passing he leaned over to gaze at it and asked does it kick does it kick no strain of high poetic thinking remains to me from lowell but he made me laugh unforgettably with his passive adventure one night going home late when a man suddenly leaped from the top of a high fence upon the sidewalk at his feet and after giving him the worst fright of his life disappeared peaceably into the darkness to be sure there was one most memorable supper when he read the bigelow paper he had finished that day and enriched the meaning of his verse with the beauty of his voice there lingers yet in my sense his very tone in giving the last line of the passage lamenting the waste of the heroic lives which in those dark hours of johnsons time seemed to have been       butchered to make a blind mans holiday  the hush that followed upon his ceasing was of that finest quality which spoken praise always lacks and i suppose that i could not give a just notion of these dante club evenings without imparting the effect of such silences this i could not hopefully undertake to do but i am tempted to some effort of the kind by my remembrance of longfellows old friend george washington greene who often came up from his home in rhode island to be at those sessions and who was a most interesting and amiable fact of those delicate silences a full half of his earlier life had been passed in italy where he and longfellow met and loved each other in their youth with an affection which the poet was constant to in his age after many vicissitudes with the beautiful fidelity of his nature greene was like an old italian housepriest in manner gentle suave very suave smooth as creamy curds cultivated in the elegancies of literary taste and with a certain meek abeyance i think i never heard him speak in all those evenings except when longfellow addressed him though he must have had the dante scholarship for an occasional criticism it was at more recent dinners where i met him with the longfellow family alone that he broke now and then into a quotation from some of the modern italian poets he knew by heart preferably giusti and syllabled their verse with an exquisite roman accent and a bewitching florentine rhythm now and then at these times he brought out a faded italian anecdote faintly smelling of civet and threadbare in its ancient texture he liked to speak of goldoni and of nota of niccolini and manzoni of monti and leopardi and if you came to america of the revolution and his grandfather the quaker general nathaniel greene whose life he wrote and i read in three volumes he worshipped longfellow and their friendship continued while they lived but towards the last of his visits at craigie house it had a pathos for the witness which i should grieve to wrong greene was then a quivering paralytic and he clung tremulously to longfellows arm in going out to dinner where even the modern italian poets were silent upon his lips when we rose from table longfellow lifted him out of his chair and took him upon his arm again for their return to the study  he was of lighter metal than most other members of the dante club and he was not of their immediate intimacy living away from cambridge as he did and i shared his silence in their presence with full sympathy i was by far the youngest of their number and i cannot yet quite make out why i was of it at all but at every moment i was as sensible of my good fortune as of my ill desert they were the men whom of all men living i most honored and it seemed to be impossible that i at my age should be so perfectly fulfilling the dream of my life in their company often the nights were very cold and as i returned home from craigie house to the carpenters box on sacramento street a mile or two away i was as if soulborne through the air by my pride and joy while the frozen blocks of snow clinked and tinkled before my feet stumbling along the middle of the road i still think that was the richest moment of my life and i look back at it as the moment in a life not unblessed by chance which i would most like to live over againif i must live any the next winter the sessions of the dante club were transferred to the house of mr norton who was then completing his version of the vita nuova this has always seemed to me a work of not less graceful art than longfellows translation of the commedia in fact it joins the effect of a sympathy almost mounting to divination with a patient scholarship and a delicate skill unknown to me elsewhere in such work i do not know whether mr norton has satisfied himself better in his prose version of the commedia than in this of the vita nuova but i do not believe he could have satisfied dante better unless he had rhymed his sonnets and canzonets i am sure he might have done this if he had chosen he has always pretended that it was impossible but miracles are never impossible in the right hands     v  after three or four years we sold the carpenters box on sacramento street and removed to a larger house near harvard square and in the immediate neighborhood of longfellow he gave me an easement across that old garden behind his house through an opening in the high board fence which enclosed it and i saw him oftener than ever though the meetings of the dante club had come to an end at the last of them lowell had asked him with fond regret in his jest longfellow why dont you do that indian poem in forty thousand verses the demand but feebly expressed the reluctance in us all though i suspect the indian poem existed only by the challengers invention before i leave my faint and unworthy record of these great times i am tempted to mention an incident poignant with tragical associations the first night after christmas the holly and the pine wreathed about the chandelier above the suppertable took fire from the gas just as we came out from the reading and longfellow ran forward and caught the burning garlands down and bore them out no one could speak for thinking what he must be thinking of when the ineffable calamity of his home befell it curtis once told me that a little while before mrs longfellows death he was driving by craigie house with holmes who said be trembled to look at it for those who lived there had their happiness so perfect that no change of all the changes which must come to them could fail to be for the worse i did not know longfellow before that fatal time and i shall not say that his presence bore record of it except in my fancy he may always have had that look of one who had experienced the utmost harm that fate can do and henceforth could possess himself of what was left of life in peace he could never have been a man of the flowing ease that makes all comers at home some people complained of a certain gene in him and he had a reserve with strangers which never quite lost itself in the abandon of friendship as lowells did he was the most perfectly modest man i ever saw ever imagined but he had a gentle dignity which i do not believe any one the coarsest the obtusest could trespass upon in the years when i began to know him his long hair and the beautiful beard which mixed with it were of one irongray which i saw blanch to a perfect silver while that pearly tone of his complexion which appleton so admired lost itself in the wanness of age and pain when he walked he had a kind of spring in his gait as if now and again a buoyant thought lifted him from the ground it was fine to meet him coming down a cambridge street you felt that the encounter made you a part of literary history and set you apart with him for the moment from the poor and mean when he appeared in harvard square he beatified if not beautified the ugliest and vulgarest looking spot on the planet outside of new york you could meet him sometimes at the market if you were of the same provisionman as he and longfellow remained as constant to his tradespeople as to any other friends he rather liked to bring his proofs back to the printers himself and we often found ourselves together at the university press where the atlantic monthly used to be printed but outside of his own house longfellow seemed to want a fit atmosphere and i love best to think of him in his study where he wrought at his lovely art with a serenity expressed in his smooth regular and scrupulously perfect handwriting it was quite vertical and rounded with a slope neither to the right nor left and at the time i knew him first he was fond of using a soft pencil on printing paper though commonly he wrote with a quill each letter was distinct in shape and between the verses was always the exact space of half an inch i have a good many of his poems written in this fashion but whether they were the first drafts or not i cannot say very likely not towards the last he no longer sent his poems to the magazines in his own hand but they were always signed in autograph  i once asked him if he were not a great deal interrupted and he said with a faint sigh not more than was good for him he fancied if it were not for the interruptions he might overwork he was not a friend to stated exercise i believe nor fond of walking as lowell was he had not indeed the childish associations of the younger poet with the cambridge neighborhoods and i never saw him walking for pleasure except on the east veranda of his house though i was told he loved walking in his youth in this and in some other things longfellow was more european than american more latin than saxon he once said quaintly that one got a great deal of exercise in putting on and off ones overcoat and overshoes  i suppose no one who asked decently at his door was denied access to him and there must have been times when he was overrun with volunteer visitors but i never heard him complain of them he was very charitable in the immediate sort which christ seems to have meant but he had his preferences humorously owned among beggars he liked the german beggars least and the italian beggars most as having most savairfaire in fact we all loved the italians in cambridge he was pleased with the accounts i could give him of the love and honor i had known for him in italy and one day there came a letter from an italian admirer addressed to mr greatest poet longfellow which he said was the very most amusing superscription he had ever seen  it is known that the king of italy offered longfellow the cross of san lazzaro which is the italian literary decoration it came through the good offices of my old acquaintance professor messadaglia then a deputy in the italian parliament whom for some reason i cannot remember i had put in correspondence with longfellow the honor was wholly unexpected and it brought longfellow a distress which was chiefly for the gentleman who had procured him the impossible distinction he showed me the pretty collar and cross not i think without a natural pleasure in it no man was ever less a bigot in things civil or religious than he but he said firmly of course as a republican and a protestant i cant accept a decoration from a catholic prince his decision was from his conscience and i think that all americans who think duly about it will approve his decision     vi  such honors as he could fitly permit himself he did not refuse and i recall what zest he had in his election to the arcadian academy which had made him a shepherd of its roman fold with the title as he said of olimipico something but i fancy his sweetest pleasure in his vast renown came from his popular recognition everywhere few were the lands few the languages he was unknown to he showed me a version of the psalm of life in chinese apparently even the poor lost autographseeker was not denied by his universal kindness i know that he kept a store of autographs ready written on small squares of paper for all who applied by letter or in person he said it was no trouble but perhaps he was to be excused for refusing the request of a lady for fifty autographs which she wished to offer as a novel attraction to her guests at a lunch party  foreigners of all kinds thronged upon him at their pleasure apparently and with perfect impunity sometimes he got a little fun very very kindly out of their excuses and reasons and the englishman who came to see him because there were no ruins to visit in america was no fable as i can testify from the poet himself but he had no prejudice against englishmen and even at a certain time when the coarsehanded british criticism began to blame his delicate art for the universal acceptance of his verse and to try to sneer him into the rank of inferior poets he was without rancor for the clumsy misliking that he felt he could not understand rudeness he was too finely framed for that he could know it only as swedenborgs most celestial angels perceived evil as something distressful angular the illwill that seemed nearly always to go with adverse criticism made him distrust criticism and the discomfort which mistaken or blundering praise gives probably made him shy of all criticism he said that in his early life as an author he used to seek out and save all the notices of his poems but in his latter days he read only those that happened to fall in his way these he cut out and amused his leisure by putting together in scrapbooks he was reluctant to make any criticism of other poets i do not remember ever to have heard him make one and his writings show no trace of the literary dislikes or contempts which we so often mistake in ourselves for righteous judgments no doubt he had his resentments but he hushed them in his heart which he did not suffer them to embitter while poe was writing of longfellow and other plagiarists longfellow was helping to keep poe alive by the loans which always made themselves gifts in poes case he very very rarely spoke of himself at all and almost never of the grievances which he did not fail to share with all who live  he was patient as i said of all things and gentle beyond all mere gentlemanliness but it would have been a great mistake to mistake his mildness for softness it was most manly and firm and of course it was braced with the new england conscience he was born to if he did not find it well to assert himself he was prompt in behalf of his friends and one of the fine things told of him was his resenting some censures of sumner at a dinner in boston during the old proslavery times he said to the gentlemen present that sumner was his friend and he must leave their company if they continued to assail him  but he spoke almost as rarely of his friends as of himself he liked the large impersonal topics which could be dealt with on their human side and involved characters rather than individuals this was rather strange in cambridge where we were apt to take our instances from the environment it was not the only thing he was strange in there he was not to that manner born he lacked the final intimacies which can come only of birth and lifelong association and which make the men of the boston breed seem exclusive when they least feel so he was longfellow to the friends who were james and charles and wendell to one another he and hawthorne were classmates at college but i never heard him mention hawthorne i never heard him mention whittier or emerson i think his reticence about his contemporaries was largely due to his reluctance from criticism he was the finest artist of them all and if he praised he must have praised with the reservations of an honest man of younger writers he was willing enough to speak no new contributor made his mark in the magazine unnoted by him and sometimes i showed him verse in manuscript which gave me peculiar pleasure i remember his liking for the first piece that mr maurice thompson sent me and how he tasted the fresh flavor of it and inhaled its wild new fragrance he admired the skill of some of the young storytellers he praised the subtlety of one in working out an intricate character and said modestly that he could never have done that sort of thing himself it was entirely safe to invite his judgment when in doubt for he never suffered it to become aggressive or used it to urge upon me the manuscripts that must often have been urged upon him  longfellow had a house at nahant where he went every summer for more than a quarter of a century he found the slight transition change enough from cambridge and liked it perhaps because it did not take him beyond the range of the friends and strangers whose company he liked agassiz was there and appleton sumner came to sojourn with him and the tourists of all nations found him there in half an hour after they reached boston his cottage was very plain and simple but was rich in the sight of the illimitable sea and it had a luxury of rocks at the foot of its garden draped with seaweed and washed with the indefatigable tides as he grew older and feebler he ceased to go to nahant he remained the whole year round at cambridge he professed to like the summer which he said warmed him through there better than the cold spectacle of summer which had no such effect at nahant  the hospitality which was constant at either house was not merely of the worldly sort longfellow loved good cheer he tasted history and poetry in a precious wine and he liked people who were acquainted with manners and men and brought the air of capitals with them but often the man who dined with longfellow was the man who needed a dinner and from what i have seen of the sweet courtesy that governed at that board i am sure that such a man could never have felt himself the least honored guest the poets heart was open to all the homelessness of the world and i remember how once when we sat at his table and i spoke of his poem of the challenge then a new poem and said how i had been touched by the fancy of         the povertystricken millions         who challenge our wine and bread         and impeach us all as traitors         both the living and the dead  his voice sank in grave humility as he answered yes i often think of those things he had thought of them in the days of the slave when he had taken his place with the friends of the hopeless and hapless and as long as he lived he continued of the party which had freed the slave he did not often speak of politics but when the movement of some of the best republicans away from their party began he said that he could not see the wisdom of their course but this was said without censure or criticism of them and so far as i know he never permitted himself anything like denunciation of those who in any wise differed from him on a matter of yet deeper interest i do not feel authorized to speak for him but i think that as he grew older his hold upon anything like a creed weakened though he remained of the unitarian philosophy concerning christ he did not latterly go to church i believe but then very few of his circle were churchgoers once he said something very vague and uncertain concerning the doctrine of another life when i affirmed my hope of it to the effect that he wished he could be sure with the sigh that so often clothed the expression of a misgiving with him     vii  when my acquaintance with longfellow began he had written the things that made his fame and that it will probably rest upon evangeline hiawatha and the courtship of miles standish were by that time old stories but during the eighteen years that i knew him he produced the best of his minor poems the greatest of his sonnets the sweetest of his lyrics his art ripened to the last it grew richer and finer and it never knew decay he rarely read anything of his own aloud but in three or four cases he read to me poems he had just finished as if to give himself the pleasure of hearing them with the sympathetic sense of another the hexameter piece elizabeth in the third part of tales of a wayside inn was one of these and he liked my liking its rhythmical form which i believed one of the measures best adapted to the english speech and which he had used himself with so much pleasure and success  about this time he was greatly interested in the slight experiments i was beginning to make in dramatic form and he said that if he were himself a young man he should write altogether for the stage he thought the drama had a greater future with us he was pleased when a popular singer wished to produce his masque of pandora with music and he was patient when it failed of the effect hoped for it as an opera when the late lawrence barrett in the enthusiasm which was one of the fine traits of his generous character had taken my play of a counterfeit presentment and came to the boston museum with it longfellow could not apparently have been more zealous for its popular acceptance if it had been his own work he invited himself to one of the rehearsals with me and he sat with me on the stage through the four acts with a fortitude which i still wonder at and with the keenest zest for all the details of the performance no finer testimony to the love and honor which all kinds of people had for him could have been given than that shown by the actors and employees of the theatre high and low they thronged the scenery those who were not upon the stage and at the edge of every wing were faces peering round at the poet who sat unconscious of their adoration intent upon the play he was intercepted at every step in going out and made to put his name to the photographs of himself which his worshippers produced from their persons  he came to the first night of the piece and when it seemed to be finding favor with the public he leaned forward out of his line to nod and smile at the author when they had the author up it was the sweetest flattery of the applause which abused his fondness that longfellow clapped first and loudest  where once he had given his kindness he could not again withhold it and he was anxious no fact should be interpreted as withdrawal when the emperor dom pedro of brazil who was so great a lover of longfellow came to boston he asked himself out to dine with the poet who had expected to offer him some such hospitality soon after longfellow met me and as if eager to forestall a possible feeling in me said i wanted to ask you to dinner with the emperor but he not only sent word he was coming he named his fellowguests i answered that though i should probably never come so near dining with an emperor again i prized his wish to ask me much more than the chance i had missed and with this my great and good friend seemed a little consoled i believe that i do not speak too confidently of our relation he was truly the friend of all men but i had certainly the advantage of my propinquity we were near neighbors as the pleonasm has it both when i lived on berkeley street and after i had built my own house on concord avenue and i suppose he found my youthful informality convenient he always asked me to dinner when his old friend greene came to visit him and then we had an italian time together with more or less repetition in our talk of what we had said before of italian poetry and italian character one day there came a note from him saying in effect salvini is coming out to dine with me tomorrow night and i want you to come too there will be no one else but greene and myself and we will have an italian dinner  unhappily i had accepted a dinner in boston for that night and this invitation put me in great misery i must keep my engagement but how could i bear to miss meeting salvini at longfellows table on terms like these we consulted at home together and questioned whether i might not rush into boston seek out my host there possess him of the facts and frankly throw myself on his mercy then a sudden thought struck us go to longfellow and submit the case to him i went and he entered with delicate sympathy into the affair but he decided that taking the large view of it i must keep my engagement lest i should run even a remote risk of wounding my friends susceptibilities i obeyed and i had a very good time but i still feel that i missed the best time of my life and that i ought to be rewarded for my sacrifice somewhere  longfellow so rarely spoke of himself in any way that one heard from him few of those experiences of the distinguished man in contact with the undistinguished which he must have had so abundantly but he told while it was fresh in his mind an incident that happened to him one day in boston at a tobacconists where a certain brand of cigars was recommended to him as the kind longfellow smoked ah then i must have some of them and i will ask you to send me a box said longfellow and he wrote down his name and address the cigardealer read it with the smile of a worsted champion and said well i guess you had me that time at a funeral a mourner wished to open conversation and by way of suggesting a theme of common interest began youve buried i believe  sometimes people were shown by the poet through craigie house who had no knowledge of it except that it had been washingtons headquarters of course longfellow was known by sight to every one in cambridge he was daily in the streets while his health endured and as he kept no carriage he was often to be met in the horsecars which were such common ground in cambridge that they were often like small invited parties of friends when they left harvard square so that you expected the gentlemen to jump up and ask the ladies whether they would have chicken salad in civic and political matters he mingled so far as to vote regularly and he voted with his party trusting it for a general regard to the public welfare  i fancy he was somewhat shy of his fellowmen as the scholar seems always to be from the sequestered habit of his life but i think longfellow was incapable of marking any difference between himself and them i never heard from him anything that was de haut en bas when he spoke of people and in cambridge where there was a good deal of contempt for the less lettered and we liked to smile though we did not like to sneer and to analyze if we did not censure longfellow and longfellows house were free of all that whatever his feeling may have been towards other sorts and conditions of men his effect was of an entire democracy he was always the most unassuming person in any company and at some large public dinners where i saw him i found him patient of the greater attention that more public men paid themselves and one another he was not a speaker and i never saw him on his feet at dinner except once when he read a poem for whittier who was absent he disliked afterdinner speaking and made conditions for his own exemption from it     viii  once your friend longfellow was always your friend he would not think evil of you and if he knew evil of you he would be the last of all that knew it to judge you for it this may have been from the impersonal habit of his mind but i believe it was also the effect of principle for he would do what he could to arrest the delivery of judgment from others and would soften the sentences passed in his presence naturally this brought him under some condemnation with those of a severer cast and i have heard him criticised for his benevolence towards all and his constancy to some who were not quite so true to themselves perhaps but this leniency of longfellows was what constituted him great as well as good for it is not our wisdom that censures others as for his goodness i never saw a fault in him i do not mean to say that he had no faults or that there were no better men but only to give the witness of my knowledge concerning him i claim in no wise to have been his intimate such a thing was not possible in my case for quite apparent reasons and i doubt if longfellow was capable of intimacy in the sense we mostly attach to the word something more of egotism than i ever found in him must go to the making of any intimacy which did not come from the tenderest affections of his heart but as a man shows himself to those often with him and in his noted relations with other men he showed himself without blame all men that i have known besides have had some foible it often endeared them the more or some meanness or pettiness or bitterness but longfellow had none nor the suggestion of any no breath of evil ever touched his name he went in and out among his fellowmen without the reproach that follows wrong the worst thing i ever heard said of him was that he had gene and this was said by one of those difficult cambridge men who would have found gene in a celestial angel something that bjornstjerne bjornson wrote to me when he was leaving america after a winter in cambridge comes nearer suggesting longfellow than all my talk the norsemen in the days of their stormy and reluctant conversion used always to speak of christ as the white christ and bjornson said in his letter give my love to the white mr longfellow  a good many years before longfellows death he began to be sleepless and he suffered greatly he said to me once that he felt as if he were going about with his heart in a kind of mist the whole night through he would not be aware of having slept but he would add with his heavenly patience i always get a good deal of rest from lying down so long i cannot say whether these conditions persisted or how much his insomnia had to do with his breaking health three or four years before the end came we left cambridge for a house farther in the country and i saw him less frequently than before he did not allow our meetings to cease he asked me to dinner from time to time as if to keep them up but it could not be with the old frequency once he made a point of coming to see us in our cottage on the hill west of cambridge but it was with an effort not visible in the days when he could end one of his brief walks at our house on concord avenue he never came but he left our house more luminous for his having been there once he came to supper there to meet garfield an old family friend of mine in ohio and though he was suffering from a heavy cold he would not scant us in his stay i had some very bad sherry which he drank with the serenity of a martyr and i shudder to this day to think what his kindness must have cost him he told his story of the clothesline ghost and garfield matched it with the story of an umbrella ghost who sheltered a friend of his through a midnight storm but was not cheerful company to his beneficiary who passed his hand through him at one point in the effort to take his arm  after the end of four years i came to cambridge to be treated for a long sickness which had nearly been my last and when i could get about i returned the visit longfellow had not failed to pay me but i did not find him and i never saw him again in life i went into boston to finish the winter of 18812 and from time to time i heard that the poet was failing in health as soon as i felt able to bear the horsecar journey i went out to cambridge to see him i had knocked once at his door the friendly door that had so often opened to his welcome and stood with the knocker in my hand when the door was suddenly set ajar and a maid showed her face wet with tears how is mr longfellow i palpitated and with a burst of grief she answered oh the poor gentleman has just departed i turned away as if from a helpless intrusion at a deathbed  at the services held in the house before the obsequies at the cemetery i saw the poet for the last time where          dead he lay among his books  in the library behind his study death seldom fails to bring serenity to all and i will not pretend that there was a peculiar peacefulness in longfellows noble mask as i saw it then it was calm and benign as it had been in life he could not have worn a gentler aspect in going out of the world than he had always worn in it he had not to wait for death to dignify it with the peace of god all who were left of his old cambridge were present and among those who had come farther was emerson he went up to the bier and with his arms crossed on his breast and his elbows held in either hand stood with his head pathetically fallen forward looking down at the dead face those who knew how his memory was a mere blank with faint gleams of recognition capriciously coming and going in it must have felt that he was struggling to remember who it was lay there before him and for me the electly simple words confessing his failure will always be pathetic with his remembered aspect the gentleman we have just been burying he said to the friend who had come with him was a sweet and beautiful soul but i forget his name  i had the privilege and honor of looking over the unprinted poems longfellow left behind him and of helping to decide which of them should be published  there were not many of them and some of these few were quite fragmentary i gave my voice for the publication of all that had any sort of completeness for in every one there was a touch of his exquisite art the grace of his most lovely spirit we have so far had two men only who felt the claim of their gift to the very best that the most patient skill could give its utterance one was hawthorne and the other was longfellow i shall not undertake to say which was the greater artist of these two but i am sure that every one who has studied it must feel with me that the art of longfellow held out to the end with no touch of decay in it and that it equalled the art of any other poet of his time it knew when to give itself and more and more it knew when to withhold itself  what longfellows place in literature will be i shall not offer to say that is times affair not mine but i am sure that with tennyson and browning he fully shared in the expression of an age which more completely than any former age got itself said by its poets     studies of lowell  i have already spoken of my earliest meetings with lowell at cambridge when i came to new england on a literary pilgrimage from the west in 1860 i saw him more and more after i went to live in cambridge in 1866 and i now wish to record what i knew of him during the years that passed between this date and that of his death if the portrait i shall try to paint does not seem a faithful likeness to others who knew him i shall only claim that so he looked to me at this moment and at that if i do not keep myself quite out of the picture what painter ever did     i  it was in the summer of 1865 that i came home from my consular post at venice and two weeks after i landed in boston i went out to see lowell at elmwood and give him an inkstand that i had brought him from italy the bronze lobster whose back opened and disclosed an inkpot and a sandbox was quite ugly but i thought it beautiful then and if lowell thought otherwise he never did anything to let me know it he put the thing in the middle of his writingtable he nearly always wrote on a pasteboard pad resting upon his knees and there it remained as long as i knew the placea matter of twentyfive years but in all that time i suppose the inkpot continued as dry as the sandbox  my visit was in the heat of august which is as fervid in cambridge as it can well be anywhere and i still have a sense of his study windows lifted to the summer night and the crickets and grasshoppers crying in at them from the lawns and the gardens outside other people went away from cambridge in the summer to the sea and to the mountains but lowell always stayed at elmwood in an impassioned love for his home and for his town i must have found him there in the afternoon and he must have made me sup with him dinner was at two oclock and then go with him for a long night of talk in his study he liked to have some one help him idle the time away and keep him as long as possible from his work and no doubt i was impersonally serving his turn in this way aside from any pleasure he might have had in my company as some one he had always been kind to and as a fresh arrival from the italy dear to us both  he lighted his pipe and from the depths of his easychair invited my shy youth to all the ease it was capable of in his presence it was not much i loved him and he gave me reason to think that he was fond of me but in lowell i was always conscious of an older and closer and stricter civilization than my own an unbroken tradition a more authoritative status his democracy was more of the head and mine more of the heart and his denied the equality which mine affirmed but his nature was so noble and his reason so tolerant that whenever in our long acquaintance i found it well to come to open rebellion as i more than once did he admitted my right of insurrection and never resented the outbreak i disliked to differ with him and perhaps he subtly felt this so much that he would not dislike me for doing it he even suffered being taxed with inconsistency and where he saw that he had not been quite just he would take punishment for his error with a contrition that was sometimes humorous and always touching  just then it was the dark hour before the dawn with italy and he was interested but not much encouraged by what i could tell him of the feeling in venice against the austrians he seemed to reserve a like scepticism concerning the fine things i was hoping for the italians in literature and he confessed an interest in the facts treated which in the retrospect i am aware was more tolerant than participant of my enthusiasm that was always lowells attitude towards the opinions of people he liked when he could not go their lengths with them and nothing was more characteristic of his affectionate nature and his just intelligence he was a man of the most strenuous convictions but he loved many sorts of people whose convictions he disagreed with and he suffered even prejudices counter to his own if they were not ignoble in the whimsicalities of others he delighted as much as in his own     ii  our associations with italy held over until the next day when after breakfast he went with me towards boston as far as the village for so he liked to speak of cambridge in the custom of his younger days when wide tracts of meadow separated harvard square from his lifelong home at elmwood we stood on the platform of the horsecar together and when i objected to his paying my fare in the american fashion he allowed that the italian usage of each paying for himself was the politer way he would not commit himself about my returning to venice for i had not given up my place yet and was away on leave but he intimated his distrust of the flattering conditions of life abroad he said it was charming to be treated da signore but he seemed to doubt whether it was well and in this as in all other things he showed his final fealty to the american ideal  it was that serious and great moment after the successful close of the civil war when the republican consciousness was more robust in us than ever before or since but i cannot recall any reference to the historical interest of the time in lowells talk it had been all about literature and about travel and now with the suggestion of the word village it began to be a little about his youth i have said before how reluctant he was to let his youth go from him and perhaps the touch with my juniority had made him realize how near he was to fifty and set him thinking of the past which had sorrows in it to age him beyond his years he would never speak of these though he often spoke of the past he told once of having been on a brief journey when he was six years old with his father and of driving up to the gate of elmwood in the evening and his father saying ah this is a pleasant place i wonder who lives herewhat little boy at another time he pointed out a certain window in his study and said he could see himself standing by it when he could only get his chin on the windowsill his memories of the house and of everything belonging to it were very tender but he could laugh over an escapade of his youth when he helped his fellowstudents pull down his fathers fences in the pure zeal of goodcomradeship     iii  my fortunes took me to new york and i spent most of the winter of 18656 writing in the office of the nation i contributed several sketches of italian travel to that paper and one of these brought me a precious letter from lowell he praised my sketch which he said he had read without the least notion who had written it and he wanted me to feel the full value of such an impersonal pleasure in it at the same time he did not fail to tell me that he disliked some pseudocynical verses of mine which he had read in another place and i believe it was then that he bade me sweat the heine out of me as men sweat the mercury out of their bones  when i was asked to be assistant editor of the atlantic monthly and came on to boston to talk the matter over with the publishers i went out to cambridge and consulted lowell he strongly urged me to take the position i thought myself hopefully placed in new york on the nation and at the same time he seemed to have it on his heart to say that he had recommended some one else for it never he owned having thought of me  he was most cordial but after i came to live in cambridge where the magazine was printed and i could more conveniently look over the proofs he did not call on me for more than a month and seemed quite to have forgotten me we met one night at mr nortons for one of the dante readings and he took no special notice of me till i happened to say something that offered him a chance to give me a little humorous snub i was speaking of a paper in the magazine on the claudian emissary and i demanded no doubt a little too airily something like who in the world ever heard of the claudian emissary you are in cambridge mr howells lowell answered and laughed at my confusion having put me down he seemed to soften towards me and at parting he said with a light of halfmocking tenderness in his beautiful eyes goodnight fellowtownsman i hardly knew we were fellowtownsmen i returned he liked that apparently and said he had been meaning to call upon me and that he was coming very soon  he was as good as his word and after that hardly a week of any kind of weather passed but he mounted the steps to the door of the ugly little house in which i lived two miles away from him and asked me to walk these walks continued i suppose until lowell went abroad for a winter in the early seventies they took us all over cambridge which he knew and loved every inch of and led us afield through the straggling unhandsome outskirts bedrabbled with squalid irish neighborhoods and fraying off into marshes and salt meadows he liked to indulge an excess of admiration for the local landscape and though i never heard him profess a preference for the charles river flats to the finest alpine scenery i could well believe he would do so under provocation of a fit listeners surprise he had always so much of the boy in him that he liked to tease the overserious or oversincere he liked to tease and he liked to mock especially his juniors if any touch of affectation or any little exuberance of manner gave him the chance when he once came to fetch me and the young mistress of the house entered with a certain excessive elasticity he sprang from his seat and minced towards her with a burlesque of her buoyant carriage which made her laugh when he had given us his heart in trust of ours he used us like a younger brother and sister or like his own children he included our children in his affection and he enjoyed our fondness for them as if it were something that had come back to him from his own youth i think he had also a sort of artistic a sort of ethical pleasure in it as being of the good tradition of the old honest simple material from which pleasing effects in literature and civilization were wrought he liked giving the children books and writing tricksy fancies in these where he masked as a fairy prince and as long as he lived he remembered his early kindness for them     iv  in those walks of ours i believe he did most of the talking and from his talk then and at other times there remains to me an impression of his growing conservatism i had in fact come into his life when it had spent its impulse towards positive reform and i was to be witness of its increasing tendency towards the negative sort he was quite past the storm and stress of his antislavery age with the close of the war which had broken for him all his ideals of inviolable peace he had reached the age of misgiving i do not mean that i ever heard him express doubt of what he had helped to do or regret for what he had done but i know that he viewed with critical anxiety what other men were doing with the accomplished facts his anxiety gave a cast of what one may call reluctance from the political situation and turned him back towards those civic and social defences which he had once seemed willing to abandon i do not mean that he lost faith in democracy this faith he constantly then and signally afterwards affirmed but he certainly had no longer any faith in insubordination as a means of grace he preached a quite socratic reverence for law as law and i remember that once when i had got back from canada in the usual disgust for the american customhouse and spoke lightly of smuggling as not an evil in itself and perhaps even a right under our vexatious tariff he would not have it but held that the illegality of the act made it a moral of fence this was not the logic that would have justified the attitude of the antislavery men towards the fugitive slave act but it was in accord with lowells feeling about john brown whom he honored while always condemning his violation of law and it was in the line of all his later thinking in this he wished you to agree with him or at least he wished to make you but he did not wish you to be more of his mind than he was himself in one of those squalid irish neighborhoods i confessed a grudge a mean and cruel grudge i now think it for the increasing presence of that race among us but this did not please him and i am sure that whatever misgiving he had as to the future of america he would not have had it less than it had been the refuge and opportunity of the poor of any race or color yet he would not have had it this alone there was a line in his poem on agassiz which he left out of the printed version at the fervent entreaty of his friends as saying too bitterly his disappointment with his country writing at the distance of europe and with america in the perspective which the alien environment clouded he spoke of her as the land of broken promise it was a splendid reproach but perhaps too dramatic to bear the full test of analysis and yet it had the truth in it and might i think have usefully stood to the end of making people think undoubtedly it expressed his sense of the case and in the same measure it would now express that of many who love their country most among us it is well to hold ones country to her promises and if there are any who think she is forgetting them it is their duty to say so even to the point of bitter accusation i do not suppose it was the common man of lincolns dream that lowell thought america was unfaithful to though as i have suggested he could be tender of the common mans hopes in her but he was impeaching in that blotted line her sincerity with the uncommon man the man who had expected of her a constancy to the ideals of her youth end to the high martyrmoods of the war which had given an unguarded and bewildering freedom to a race of slaves he was thinking of the shame of our municipal corruptions the debased quality of our national statesmanship the decadence of our whole civic tone rather than of the increasing disabilities of the hardworking poor though his heart when he thought of them was with them too as it was in the time when the slave would not let him sleep  he spoke very rarely of those times perhaps because their political and social associations were so knit up with the saddest and tenderest personal memories which it was still anguish to touch not only was he                    not of the race         that hawk their sorrows in the market place  but so far as my witness went he shrank from mention of them i do not remember hearing him speak of the young wife who influenced him so potently at the most vital moment and turned him from his whole scholarly and aristocratic tradition to an impassioned championship of the oppressed and he never spoke of the children he had lost i recall but one allusion to the days when he was fighting the antislavery battle along the whole line and this was with a humorous relish of his irish servants disgust in having to wait upon a negro whom he had asked to his table  he was rather severe in his notions of the subordination his domestics owed him they were to do as they were bid and yet he had a tenderness for such as had been any time with him which was wounded when once a hired man long in his employ greedily overreached him in a certain transaction he complained of that with a simple grief for the mans indelicacy after so many favors from him rather than with any resentment his hauteur towards his dependents was theoretic his actual behavior was of the gentle consideration common among americans of good breeding and that recreant hired man had no doubt never been suffered to exceed him in shows of mutual politeness often when the maid was about weightier matters he came and opened his door to me himself welcoming me with the smile that was like no other sometimes he said siete il benvenuto or used some other italian phrase which put me at ease with him in the region where we were most at home together  looking back i must confess that i do not see what it was he found to make him wish for my company which he presently insisted upon having once a week at dinner after the meal we turned into his study where we sat before a wood fire in winter and he smoked and talked he smoked a pipe which was always needing tobacco or going out so that i have the figure of him before my eyes constantly getting out of his deep chair to rekindle it from the fire with a paper lighter he was often out of his chair to get a book from the shelves that lined the walls either for a passage which he wished to read or for some disputed point which he wished to settle if i had caused the dispute he enjoyed putting me in the wrong if he could not he sometimes whimsically persisted in his error in defiance of all authority but mostly he had such reverence for the truth that he would not question it even in jest  if i dropped in upon him in the afternoon i was apt to find him reading the old french poets or the plays of calderon or the divina commedia which he magnanimously supposed me much better acquainted with than i was because i knew some passages of it by heart one day i came in quoting          io son cantava io son dolce sirena         che i marinai in mezzo al mar dismago  he stared at me in a rapture with the matchless music and then uttered all his adoration and despair in one word damn he said and no more i believe he instantly proposed a walk that day as if his study walls with all their vistas into the great literatures cramped his soul liberated to a sense of ineffable beauty of the verse of the somma poeta but commonly be preferred to have me sit down with him there among the mute witnesses of the larger part of his life as i have suggested in my own case it did not matter much whether you brought anything to the feast or not if he liked you he liked being with you not for what he got but for what he gave he was fond of one man whom i recall as the most silent man i ever met i never heard him say anything not even a dull thing but lowell delighted in him and would have you believe that he was full of quaint humor     v  while lowell lived there was a superstition which has perhaps survived him that he was an indolent man wasting himself in barren studies and minor efforts instead of devoting his great powers to some monumental work worthy of them if the robust body of literature both poetry and prose which lives after him does not yet correct this vain delusion the time will come when it must and in the meantime the delusion cannot vex him now i think it did vex him then and that he even shared it and tried at times to meet such shadowy claim as it had one of the things that people urged upon him was to write some sort of story and it is known how he attempted this in verse it is less known that he attempted it in prose and that he went so far as to write the first chapter of a novel he read this to me and though i praised it then i have a feeling now that if he had finished the novel it would have been a failure but i shall never finish it he sighed as if he felt irremediable defects in it and laid the manuscript away to turn and light his pipe it was a rather oldfashioned study of a whimsical character and it did not arrive anywhere so far as it went but i believe that it might have been different with a yankee story in verse such as we have fragmentarily in the nooning and fitzadams story still his gift was essentially lyrical and meditative with the universal new england tendency to allegory he was wholly undramatic in the actuation of the characters which he imagined so dramatically he liked to deal with his subject at first hand to indulge through himself all the whim and fancy which the more dramatic talent indulges through its personages  he enjoyed writing such a poem as the cathedral which is not of his best but which is more immediately himself in all his moods than some better poems he read it to me soon after it was written and in the long walk which we went hard upon the reading our way led us through the port far towards east cambridge where he wished to show me a tupelotree of his acquaintance because i said i had never seen one his talk was still of the poem which he was greatly in conceit of later his satisfaction with it received a check from the reserves of other friends concerning some whimsical lines which seemed to them too great a drop from the higher moods of the piece their reluctance nettled him perhaps he agreed with them but he would not change the lines and they stand as he first wrote them in fact most of his lines stand as he first wrote them he would often change them in revision and then in a second revision go back to the first version  he was very sensitive to criticism especially from those he valued through his head or heart he would try to hide his hurt and he would not let you speak of it as though your sympathy unmanned him but you could see that he suffered this notably happened in my remembrance from a review in a journal which he greatly esteemed and once when in a notice of my own i had put one little thorny point among the flowers he confessed a puncture from it he praised the criticism hardily but i knew that he winced under my recognition of the didactic quality which he had not quite guarded himself against in the poetry otherwise praised he liked your liking and he openly rejoiced in it and i suppose he made himself believe that in trying his verse with his friends he was testing it but i do not believe that he was and i do not think he ever corrected his judgment by theirs however he suffered from it  in any matter that concerned literary morals he was more than eager to profit by another eye one summer he sent me for the magazine a poem which when i read it i trembled to find in motive almost exactly like one we had lately printed by another contributor there was nothing for it but to call his attention to the resemblance and i went over to elmwood with the two poems he was not at home and i was obliged to leave the poems i suppose with some sort of note for the next mornings post brought me a delicious letter from him all one cry of confession the most complete the most ample he did not trouble himself to say that his poem was an unconscious reproduction of the other that was for every reason unnecessary but he had at once rewritten it upon wholly different lines and i do not think any reader was reminded of mrs akerss among the laurels by lowells footpath he was not only much more sensitive of others rights than his own but in spite of a certain severity in him he was most tenderly regardful of their sensibilities when he had imagined them he did not always imagine them     vi  at this period between the years 1866 and 1874 when he unwillingly went abroad for a twelvemonth lowell was seen in very few cambridge houses and in still fewer boston houses he was not an unsocial man but he was most distinctly not a society man he loved chiefly the companionship of books and of men who loved books but of women generally he had an amusing diffidence he revered them and honored them but he would rather not have had them about this is oversaying it of course but the truth is in what i say there was never a more devoted husband and he was content to let his devotion to the sex end with that he especially could not abide difference of opinion in women he valued their taste their wit their humor but he would have none of their reason i was by one day when he was arguing a point with one of his nieces and after it had gone on for some time and the impartial witness must have owned that she was getting the better of him he closed the controversy by giving her a great kiss with the words you are a very good girl my dear and practically putting her out of the room as to women of the flirtatious type he did not dislike them no man perhaps does but he feared them and he said that with them there was but one way and that was to run  i have a notion that at this period lowell was more freely and fully himself than at any other the passions and impulses of his younger manhood had mellowed the sorrows of that time had softened he could blamelessly live to himself in his affections and his sobered ideals his was always a duteous life but he had pretty well given up making man over in his own image as we all wish some time to do and then no longer wish it he fulfilled his obligations to his fellowmen as these sought him out but he had ceased to seek them he loved his friends and their love but he had apparently no desire to enlarge their circle it was that hour of civic suspense in which public men seemed still actuated by unselfish aims and one not essentially a politician might contentedly wait to see what would come of their doing their best at any rate without occasionally withholding open criticism or acclaim lowell waited among his books for the wounds of the war to heal themselves and the nation to begin her healthfuller and nobler life with slavery gone what might not one expect of american democracy  his life at elmwood was of an entire simplicity in the old colonial mansion in which he was born he dwelt in the embowering leafage amid the quiet of lawns and gardenplots broken by few noises ruder than those from the elms and the syringas where       the oriole clattered and the catbird sang  from the tracks on brattle street came the drowsy tinkle of horsecar bells and sometimes a funeral trailed its black length past the corner of his grounds and lost itself from sight under the shadows of the willows that hid mount auburn from his study windows in the winter the deep new england snows kept their purity in the stretch of meadow behind the house which a double row of pines guarded in a domestic privacy all was of a modest dignity within and without the house which lowell loved but did not imagine of a manorial presence and he could not conceal his annoyance with an overenthusiastic account of his home in which the simple chiselling of some panels was vaunted as rich woodcarving there was a graceful staircase and a good wide hall from which the diningroom and drawingroom opened by opposite doors behind the last in the southwest corner of the house was his study  there literally he lived during the six or seven years in which i knew him after my coming to cambridge summer and winter he sat there among his books seldom stirring abroad by day except for a walk and by night yet more rarely he went to the monthly midday dinner of the saturday club in boston he was very constant at the fortnightly meetings of his whistclub because he loved the old friends who formed it he came always to the dante suppers at longfellows and he was familiarly in and out at mr nortons of course but otherwise he kept to his study except for some rare and almost unwilling absences upon university lecturing at johns hopkins or at cornell  for four years i did not take any summer outing from cambridge myself and my associations with elmwood and with lowell are more of summer than of winter weather meetings but often we went our walks through the snows trudging along between the horsecar tracks which enclosed the only wellbrokenout paths in that simple old cambridge i date one memorable expression of his from such a walk when as we were passing longfellows house in midstreet he came as near the declaration of his religious faith as he ever did in my presence he was speaking of the new testament and he said the truth was in it but they had covered it up with their hagiology though he had been bred a unitarian and had more and more liberated himself from all creeds he humorously affected an abiding belief in hell and similarly contended for the eternal punishment of the wicked he was of a religious nature and he was very reverent of other peoples religious feelings he expressed a special tolerance for my own inherited faith no doubt because mrs lowell was also a swedenborgian but i do not think he was interested in it and i suspect that all religious formulations bored him in his earlier poems are many intimations and affirmations of belief in an overruling providence and especially in the god who declares vengeance his and will repay men for their evil deeds and will right the weak against the strong i think he never quite lost this though when in the last years of his life i asked him if he believed there was a moral government of the universe he answered gravely and with a sort of pain the scale was so vast and we saw such a little part of it  as to tine notion of a life after death i never had any direct or indirect expression from him but i incline to the opinion that his hold upon this weakened with his years as it is sadly apt to do with men who have read much and thought much they have apparently exhausted their potentialities of psychological life mystical lowell was as every poet must be but i do not think he liked mystery one morning he told me that when he came home the night before he had seen the doppelganger of one of his household though as he joked he was not in a state to see double  he then said he used often to see peoples doppelganger at another time as to ghosts he said he was like coleridge he had seen too many of em lest any weaker brethren should be caused to offend by the restricted oath which i have reported him using in a moment of transport it may be best to note here that i never heard him use any other imprecation and this one seldom  any grossness of speech was inconceivable of him now and then but only very rarely the human nature of some story unmeet for ladies was too much for his sense of humor and overcame him with amusement which he was willing to impart and did impart but so that mainly the human nature of it reached you in this he was like the other great cambridge men though he was opener than the others to contact with the commoner life he keenly delighted in every native and novel turn of phrase and he would not undervalue a vital word or a notion picked up out of the road even if it had some dirt sticking to it  he kept as close to the common life as a man of his patrician instincts and cloistered habits could i could go to him with any new find about it and be sure of delighting him after i began making my involuntary and all but unconscious studies of yankee character especially in the country he was always glad to talk them over with me still when i had discovered a new accent or turn of speech in the fields he had cultivated i was aware of a subtle grudge mingling with his pleasure but this was after all less envy than a fine regret  at the time i speak of there was certainly nothing in lowells dress or bearing that would have kept the common life aloof from him if that life were not always too proud to make advances to any one in this retrospect i see him in the sack coat and rough suit which he wore upon all outdoor occasions with heavy shoes and a round hat i never saw him with a high hat on till he came home after his diplomatic stay in london then he had become rather rigorously correct in his costume and as conventional as he had formerly been indifferent in both epochs he was apt to be gloved and the strong broad hands which left the sensation of their vigor for some time after they had clasped yours were notably white at the earlier period he still wore his auburn hair somewhat long it was darker than his beard which was branching and full and more strawcolored than auburn as were his thick eyebrows neither hair nor beard was then touched with gray as i now remember when he uncovered his straight wide white forehead showed itself one of the most beautiful that could be his eyes were gay with humor and alert with all intelligence he had an enchanting smile a laugh that was full of friendly joyousness and a voice that was exquisite music everything about him expressed his strenuous physical condition he would not wear an overcoat in the coldest cambridge weather at all times he moved vigorously and walked with a quick step lifting his feet well from the ground     vii  it gives me a pleasure which i am afraid i cannot impart to linger in this effort to materialize his presence from the fading memories of the past i am afraid i can as little impart a due sense of what he spiritually was to my knowledge it avails nothing for me to say that i think no man of my years and desert had ever so true and constant a friend he was both younger and older than i by insomuch as he was a poet through and through and had been out of college before i was born but he had already come to the age of selfdistrust when a man likes to take counsel with his juniors as with his elders and fancies he can correct his perspective by the test of their fresher vision besides lowell was most simply and pathetically reluctant to part with youth and was willing to cling to it wherever he found it he could not in any wise bear to be leftout when mr bret harte came to cambridge and the talk was all of the brilliant characterpoems with which he had then first dazzled the world lowell casually said with a most touching however ungrounded sense of obsolescence he could remember when the biglow papers were all the talk i need not declare that there was nothing ungenerous in that he was only too ready to hand down his laurels to a younger man but he wished to do it himself through the modesty that is always a quality of such a nature he was magnanimously sensitive to the appearance of fading interest he could not take it otherwise than as a proof of his fading power i had a curious hint of this when one year in making up the prospectus of the magazine for the next i omitted his name because i had nothing special to promise from him and because i was half ashamed to be always flourishing it in the eyes of the public i see that you have dropped me this year he wrote and i could see that it had hurt and i knew that he was glad to believe the truth when i told him  he did not care so much for popularity as for the praise of his friends if he liked you he wished you not only to like what he wrote but to say so he was himself most cordial in his recognition of the things that pleased him what happened to me from him happened to others and i am only describing his common habit when i say that nothing i did to his liking failed to bring me a spoken or oftener a written acknowledgment this continued to the latest years of his life when the effort even to give such pleasure must have cost him a physical pang  he was of a very catholic taste and he was apt to be carried away by a little touch of life or humor and to overvalue the piece in which he found it but mainly his judgments of letters and men were just one of the dangers of scholarship was a peculiar danger in the cambridge keeping but lowell was almost as averse as longfellow from contempt he could snub and pitilessly where he thought there was presumption and apparently sometimes merely because he was in the mood but i cannot remember ever to have heard him sneer he was often wonderfully patient of tiresome people and sometimes celestially insensible to vulgarity in spite of his reserve he really wished people to like him he was keenly alive to neighborly goodwill or illwill and when there was a question of widening elmwood avenue by taking part of his grounds he was keenly hurt by hearing that some one who lived near him had said he hoped the city would cut down lowells elms his english elms which his father had planted and with which he was himself almost one blood     viii  in the period of which i am speaking lowell was constantly writing and pretty constantly printing though still the superstition held that he was an idle man to this time belongs the publication of some of his finest poems if not their inception there were cases in which their inception dated far back even to ten or twenty years he wrote his poems at a heat and the manuscript which came to me for the magazine was usually the first draft very little corrected but if the cold fit took him quickly it might hold him so fast that he would leave the poem in abeyance till he could slowly live back to a liking for it  the most of his best prose belongs to the time between 1866 and 1874 and to this time we owe the several volumes of essays and criticisms called among my books and my study windows he wished to name these more soberly but at the urgence of his publishers he gave them titles which they thought would be attractive to the public though he felt that they took from the dignity of his work he was not a good business man in a literary way he submitted to others judgment in all such matters i doubt if he ever put a price upon anything he sold and i dare say he was usually surprised at the largeness of the price paid him but sometimes if his need was for a larger sum he thought it too little without reference to former payments this happened with a long poem in the atlantic which i had urged the countingroom authorities to deal handsomely with him for i did not know how many hundred they gave him and when i met him i ventured to express the hope that the publishers had done their part he held up four fingers quattro he said in italian and then added with a disappointment which he tried to smile away i thought they might have made it cinque  between me and me i thought quattro very well but probably lowell had in mind some end which cinque would have fitted better it was pretty sure to be an unselfish end a pleasure to some one dear to him a gift that he had wished to make long afterwards when i had been the means of getting him cinque for a poem onetenth the length he spoke of the payment to me it came very handily i had been wanting to give a watch  i do not believe at any time lowell was able to deal with money       like wealthy men not knowing what they give  more probably he felt a sacredness in the money got by literature which the literary man never quite rids him self of even when he is not a poet and which made him wish to dedicate it to something finer than the every day uses he lived very quietly but he had by no means more than he needed to live upon and at that time he had pecuniary losses he was writing hard and was doing full work in his harvard professorship and he was so far dependent upon his salary that he felt its absence for the year he went abroad i do not know quite how to express my sense of something unworldly of something almost womanlike in his relation to money  he was not only generous of money but he was generous of himself when he thought he could be of use or merely of encouragement he came all the way into boston to hear certain lectures of mine on the italian poets which he could not have found either edifying or amusing that he might testify his interest in me and show other people that they were worth coming to he would go carefully over a poem with me word by word and criticise every turn of phrase and after all be magnanimously tolerant of my sticking to phrasings that he disliked in a certain line       the silvern chords of the piano trembled  he objected to silvern why not silver i alleged leathern golden and like adjectives in defence of my word but still he found an affectation in it and suffered it to stand with extreme reluctance another line of another piece       and what she would would rather that she would not  he would by no means suffer he said that the stress falling on the last word made it publicschool english and he mocked it with the answer a maid had lately given him when he asked if the master of the house was at home she said no sir he is not when she ought to have said no sir he isnt he was appeased when i came back the next day with the stanza amended so that the verse could read       and what she would would rather she would not so  but i fancy he never quite forgave my word silvern yet he professed not to have prejudices in such matters but to use any word that would serve his turn without wincing and he certainly did use and defend words as undisprivacied and disnatured that made others wince  he was otherwise such a stickler for the best diction that he would not have had me use slovenly vernacular even in the dialogue in my stories my characters must not say they wanted to do so and so but wished and the like in a copy of one of my books which i found him reading i saw he had corrected my erring western woulds and shoulds as he grew old he was less and less able to restrain himself from setting people right to their faces once in the vast area of my ignorance he specified my small acquaintance with a certain period of english poetry saying youre rather shady there old fellow but he would not have had me too learned holding that he had himself been hurt for literature by his scholarship  his patience in analyzing my work with me might have been the easy effort of his habit of teaching and his willingness to give himself and his own was no doubt more signally attested in his asking a brother man of letters who wished to work up a subject in the college library to stay a fortnight in his house and to share his study his beloved study with him this must truly have cost him dear as any author of fixed habits will understand happily the man of letters was a good fellow and knew how to prize the favordone him but if he had been otherwise it would have been the same to lowell he not only endured but did many things for the weaker brethren which were amusing enough to one in the secret of his inward revolt yet in these things he was considerate also of the editor whom he might have made the sharer of his selfsacrifice and he seldom offered me manuscripts for others the only real burden of the kind that he put upon me was the diary of a virginian who had travelled in new england during the early thirties and had set down his impressions of men and manners there it began charmingly and went on very well under lowells discreet pruning but after a while he seemed to fall in love with the character of the diarist so much that he could not bear to cut anything    ix  he had a great tenderness for the broken and ruined south whose sins he felt that he had had his share in visiting upon her and he was willing to do what he could to ease her sorrows in the case of any particular southerner he could not help looking askance upon the dramatic shows of retribution which some of the northern politicians were working but with all his misgivings he continued to act with the republican party until after the election of hayes he was away from the country during the garfield campaign he was in fact one of the massachusetts electors chosen by the republican majority in 1816 and in that most painful hour when there was question of the policy and justice of counting hayes in for the presidency it was suggested by some of lowells friends that he should use the original right of the electors under the constitution and vote for tilden whom one vote would have chosen president over hayes after he had cast his vote for hayes he quietly referred to the matter one day in the moment of lighting his pipe with perhaps the faintest trace of indignation in his tone he said that whatever the first intent of the constitution was usage had made the presidential electors strictly the instruments of the party which chose them and that for him to have voted for tilden when he had been chosen to vote for hayes would havebeen an act of bad faith  he would have resumed for me all the old kindness of our relations before the recent year of his absence but this had inevitably worked a little estrangement he had at least lost the habit of me and that says much in such matters he was not so perfectly at rest in the cambridge environment in certain indefinable ways it did not so entirely suffice him though he would have been then and always the last to allow this i imagine his friends realized more than he that certain delicate but vital filaments of attachment had frayed and parted in alien air and left him heartloose as he had not been before  i do not know whether it crossed his mind after the election of hayes that he might be offered some place abroad but it certainly crossed the minds of some of his friends and i could not feel that i was acting for myself alone when i used a family connection with the president very early in his term to let him know that i believed lowell would accept a diplomatic mission i could assure him that i was writing wholly without lowells privity or authority and i got back such a letter as i could wish in its delicate sense of the situation the president said that he had already thought of offering lowell something and he gave me the pleasure a pleasure beyond any other i could imagine of asking lowell whether he would accept the mission to austria i lost no time carrying his letter to elmwood where i found lowell over his coffee at dinner he saw me at the threshold and called to me through the open door to come in and i handed him the letter and sat down at table while he ran it through when he had read it he gave a quick ah and threw it over the length of the table to mrs lowell she read it in a smiling and loyal reticence as if she would not say one word of all she might wish to say in urging his acceptance though i could see that she was intensely eager for it the whole situation was of a perfect new england character in its tacit significance after lowell had taken his coffee we turned into his study without further allusion to the matter  a day or two later he came to my house to say that he could not accept the austrian mission and to ask me to tell the president so for him and make his acknowledgments which he would also write himself he remained talking a little while of other things and when he rose to go he said with a sigh of vague reluctance i should like to see a play of calderon as if it had nothing to do with any wish of his that could still be fulfilled upon this hint i acted and in due time it was found in washington that the gentleman who had been offered the spanish mission would as lief go to austria and lowell was sent to madrid     x  when we met in london some years later he came almost every afternoon to my lodging and the story of our oldtime cambridge walks began again in london phrases there were not the vacant lots and outlying fields of his native place but we made shift with the vast simple parks and we walked on the grass as we could not have done in an american park and were glad to feel the earth under our feet i said how much it was like those earlier tramps and that pleased him for he wished whenever a thing delighted him to find a cambridge quality in it  but he was in love with everything english and was determined i should be so too beginning with the english weather which in summer cannot be overpraised he carried of course an umbrella but he would not put it up in the light showers that caught us at times saying that the english rain never wetted you the thick short turf delighted him he would scarcely allow that the trees were the worse for foliage blighted by a vile easterly storm in the spring of that year the tender air the delicate veils that the moisture in it cast about all objects at the least remove the soft colors of the flowers the dull blue of the low sky showing through the rifts of the dirty white clouds the hovering pall of london smoke were all dear to him and he was anxious that i should not lose anything of their charm  he was anxious that i should not miss the value of anything in england and while he volunteered that the aristocracy had the corruptions of aristocracies everywhere he insisted upon my respectful interest in it because it was so historical perhaps there was a touch of irony in this demand but it is certain that he was very happy in england he had come of the age when a man likes smooth warm keeping in which he need make no struggle for his comfort disciplined and obsequious service society perfectly ascertained within the larger society which we call civilization and in an alien environment for which he was in no wise responsible he could have these without a pang of the selfreproach which at home makes a man unhappy amidst his luxuries when he considers their cost to others he had a position which forbade thought of unfairness in the conditions he must not wake because of the slave it was his duty to sleep besides at that time lowell needed all the rest he could get for he had lately passed through trials such as break the strength of men and how them with premature age he was living alone in his little house in lowndes square and mrs lowell was in the country slowly recovering from the effects of the terrible typhus which she had barely survived in madrid he was yet so near the anguish of that experience that he told me he had still in his nerves the expectation of a certain agonized cry from her which used to rend them but he said he had adjusted himself to this and he went on to speak with a patience which was more affecting in him than in men of more phlegmatic temperament of how we were able to adjust ourselves to all our trials and to the constant presence of pain he said he was never free of a certain distress which was often a sharp pang in one of his shoulders but his physique had established such relations with it that though he was never unconscious of it he was able to endure it without a recognition of it as suffering  he seemed to me however very well and at his age of sixtythree i could not see that he was less alert and vigorous than he was when i first knew him in cambridge he had the same brisk light step and though his beard was well whitened and his auburn hair had grown ashen through the red his face had the freshness and his eyes the clearness of a young mans i suppose the novelty of his life kept him from thinking about his years or perhaps in contact with those great insenescent englishmen he could not feel himself old at any rate he did not once speak of age as he used to do ten years earlier and i then half through my forties was still you young dog to him it was a bright and cheerful renewal of the early kindliness between us on which indeed there had never been a shadow except such as distance throws he wished apparently to do everything he could to assure us of his personal interest and we were amused to find him nervously apprehensive of any purpose such as was far from us to profit by him officially he betrayed a distinct relief when he found we were not going to come upon him even for admissions to the houses of parliament which we were to see by means of an english acquaintance he had not perhaps found some other fellowcitizens so considerate he dreaded the halfduties of his place like presentations to the queen and complained of the cheap ambitions he had to gratify in that way  he was so eager to have me like england in every way and seemed so fond of the english that i thought it best to ask him whether he minded my quoting in a paper about lexington which i was just then going to print in a london magazine some humorous lines of his expressing the mounting satisfaction of an imaginary yankee storyteller who has the old fight terminate in lord percys coming       to hammer stone for life in concord jail  it had occurred to me that it might possibly embarrass him to have this patriotic picture presented to a public which could not take our fourth of july pleasure in it and i offered to suppress it as i did afterwards quite for literary reasons he said no let it stand and let them make the worst of it and i fancy that much of his success with a people who are not gingerly with other peoples sensibilities came from the frankness with which he trampled on their prejudice when he chose he said he always told them when there was question of such things that the best society he had ever known was in cambridge massachusetts he contended that the best english was spoken there and so it was when he spoke it  we were in london out of the season and he was sorry that he could not have me meet some titles who he declared had found pleasure in my books when we returned from italy in the following june he was prompt to do me this honor i dare say he wished me to feel it to its last implication and i did my best but there was nothing in the evening i enjoyed so much as his coming up to mrs lowell at the close when there was only a title or two left and saying to her as he would have said to her at elmwood where she would have personally planned it fanny that was a fine dinner you gave us of course this was in a tender burlesque but it remains the supreme impression of what seemed to me a cloudlessly happy period for lowell his wife was quite recovered of her long suffering and was again at the head of his house sharing in his pleasures and enjoying his successes for his sake successes so great that people spoke of him seriously as an addition to society in london where one man more or less seemed like a drop in the sea she was a woman perfectly of the new england type and tradition almost repellantly shy at first and almost glacially cold with new acquaintance but afterwards very sweet and cordial she was of a dark beauty with a regular face of the spanish outline lowell was of an ideal manner towards her and of an admiration which delicately travestied itself and which she knew how to receive with smiling irony after her death which occurred while he was still in england he never spoke of her to me though before that he used to be always bringing her name in with a young loverlike fondness     xi  in the hurry of the london season i did not see so much of lowell on our second sojourn as on our first but once when we were alone in his study there was a return to the terms of the old meetings in cambridge he smoked his pipe and sat by his fire and philosophized and but for the great london sea swirling outside and bursting through our shelter and dashing him with notes that must be instantly answered it was a very fair image of the past he wanted to tell me about his coachman whom he had got at on his human side with great liking and amusement and there was a patient gentleness in his manner with the footman who had to keep coming in upon him with those notes which was like the echo of his young faith in the equality of men but he always distinguished between the simple unconscious equality of the ordinary american and its assumption by a foreigner he said he did not mind such an americans coming into his house with his hat on but if a german or englishman did it he wanted to knock it off he was apt to be rather punctilious in his shows of deference towards others and at one time he practised removing his own hat when he went into shops in cambridge it must have mystified the cambridge salesmen and i doubt if he kept it up  with reference to the doctrine of his young poetry the fierce and the tender humanity of his storm and stress period i fancy a kind of baffle in lowell which i should not perhaps find it easy to prove i never knew him by word or hint to renounce this doctrine but he could not come to seventy years without having seen many high hopes fade and known many inspired prophecies fail when we have done our best to make the world over we are apt to be dismayed by finding it in much the old shape as he said of the moral government of the universe the scale is so vast and a little difference a little change for the better is scarcely perceptible to the eager consciousness of the wholesale reformer but with whatever sense of disappointment of doubt as to his own deeds for truer freedom and for better conditions i believe his sympathy was still with those who had some heart for hoping and striving i am sure that though he did not agree with me in some of my own later notions for the redemption of the race he did not like me the less but rather the more because to my own great surprise i confess i had now and then the courage of my convictions both literary and social  he was probably most at odds with me in regard to my theories of fiction though he persisted in declaring his pleasure in my own fiction he was in fact by nature and tradition thoroughly romantic and he could not or would not suffer realism in any but a friend he steadfastly refused even to read the russian masters to his immense loss as i tried to persuade him and even among the modern spaniards for whom he might have had a sort of personal kindness from his love of cervantes he chose one for his praise the least worthy of it and bore me down with his heavier metal in argument when i opposed to alarcons factitiousness the delightful genuineness of valdes ibsen with all the norwegians he put far from him he would no more know them than the russians the french naturalists he abhorred i thought him all wrong but you do not try improving your elders when they have come to three score and ten years and i would rather have had his affection unbroken by our difference of opinion than a perfect agreement where he even imagined that this difference could work me harm he was anxious to have me know that he meant me none and he was at the trouble to write me a letter when a boston paper had perverted its report of what he said in a public lecture to my disadvantage and to assure me that he had not me in mind when once he had given his liking he could not bear that any shadow of change should seem to have come upon him he had a most beautiful and endearing ideal of friendship he desired to affirm it and to reaffirm it as often as occasion offered and if occasion did not offer he made occasion it did not matter what you said or did that contraried him if he thought he had essentially divined you you were still the same and on his part he was by no means exacting of equal demonstration but seemed not even to wish it     xii  after he was replaced at london by a minister more immediately representative of the democratic administration he came home he made a brave show of not caring to have remained away but in truth he had become very fond of england where he had made so many friends and where the distinction he had in that comfortably padded environment was so agreeable to him  it would have been like him to have secretly hoped that the new president might keep him in london but he never betrayed any ignoble disappointment and he would not join in any blame of him at our first meeting after he came home he spoke of the movement which had made mr cleveland president and said he supposed that if he had been here he should have been in it all his friends were he added a little helplessly but he seemed not to dislike my saying i knew one of his friends who was not in fact as i have told he never disliked a plump differenceunless he disliked the differer  for several years he went back to england every summer and it was not until he took up his abode at elmwood again that he spent a whole year at home one winter he passed at his sisters home in boston but mostly he lived with his daughter at southborough i have heard a story of his going to elmwood soon after his return in 1885 and sitting down in his old study where he declared with tears that the place was full of ghosts but four or five years later it was well for family reasons that he should live there and about the same time it happened that i had taken a house for the summer in his neighborhood he came to see me and to assure me in all tacit forms of his sympathy in a sorrow for which there could be no help but it was not possible that the old intimate relations should be resumed the affection was there as much on his side as on mine i believe but he was now an old man and i was an elderly man and we could not without insincerity approach each other in the things that had drawn us together in earlier and happier years his course was run my own in which he had taken such a generous pleasure could scarcely move his jaded interest his life so far as it remained to him had renewed itself in other air the later friendships beyond seas sufficed him and were without the pang without the effort that must attend the knitting up of frayed ties here  he could never have been anything but american if he had tried and he certainly never tried but he certainly did not return to the outward simplicities of his life as i first knew it there was no more roundhatandsackcoat business for him he wore a frock and a high hat and whatever else was rather like london than cambridge i do not know but drab gaiters sometimes added to the effect of a gentleman of the old school which he now produced upon the witness some fastidiousnesses showed themselves in him which were not so surprising he complained of the american lower class manner the conductor and cabman would be kind to you but they would not be respectful and he could not see the fun of this in the old way early in our acquaintance he rather stupified me by saying i like you because you dont put your hands on me and i heard of his consenting to some sort of reception in those last years yes if they wont shake hands  ever since his visit to rome in 1875 he had let his heavy mustache grow long till it dropped below the corners of his beard which was now almost white his face had lost the ruddy hue so characteristic of him i fancy he was then ailing with premonitions of the disorder which a few years later proved mortal but he still bore himself with sufficient vigor and he walked the distance between his house and mine though once when i missed his visit the family reported that after he came in he sat a long time with scarcely a word as if too weary to talk that winter i went into boston to live and i saw him only at infrequent intervals when i could go out to elmwood at such times i found him sitting in the room which was formerly the drawingroom but which had been joined with his study by taking away the partitions beside the heavy mass of the old colonial chimney he told me that when he was a newborn babe the nurse had carried him round this chimney for luck and now in front of the same hearth the white old man stretched himself in an easychair with his writingpad on his knees and his books on the table at his elbow and was willing to be entreated not to rise i remember the sun used to come in at the eastern windows full pour and bathe the air in its warmth  he always hailed me gayly and if i found him with letters newly come from england as i sometimes did he glowed and sparkled with fresh life he wanted to read passages from those letters he wanted to talk about their writers and to make me feel their worth and charm as he did he still dreamed of going back to england the next summer but that was not to be one day he received me not less gayly than usual but with a certain excitement and began to tell me about an odd experience he had had not at all painful but which had very much mystified him he had since seen the doctor and the doctor had assured him that there was nothing alarming in what had happened and in recalling this assurance he began to look at the humorous aspects of the case and to make some jokes about it he wished to talk of it as men do of their maladies and very fully and i gave him such proof of my interest as even inviting him to talk of it would convey in spite of the doctors assurance and his joyful acceptance of it i doubt if at the bottom of his heart there was not the stir of an uneasy misgiving but he had not for a long time shown himself so cheerful  it was the beginning of the end he recovered and relapsed and recovered again but never for long late in the spring i came out and he had me stay to dinner which was somehow as it used to be at two oclock and after dinner we went out on his lawn he got a longhandled spud and tried to grub up some dandelions which he found in his turf but after a moment or two he threw it down and put his hand upon his back with a groan i did not see him again till i came out to take leave of him before going away for the summer and then i found him sitting on the little porch in a western corner of his house with a volume of scott closed upon his finger there were some other people and our meeting was with the constraint of their presence it was natural in nothing so much as his saying very significantly to me as if he knew of my heresies concerning scott and would have me know he did not approve of them that there was nothing he now found so much pleasure in as scotts novels another friend equally heretical was by but neither of us attempted to gainsay him lowell talked very little but he told of having been a walk to beaver brook and of having wished to jump from one stone to another in the stream and of having had to give it up he said without completing the sentence if it had come to that with him then he fell silent again and with some vain talk of seeing him when i came back in the fall i went away sick at heart i was not to see him again and i shall not look upon his like  i am aware that i have here shown him from this point and from that in a series of sketches which perhaps collectively impart but do not assemble his personality in one impression he did not indeed make one impression upon me but a thousand impressions which i should seek in vain to embody in a single presentment what i have cloudily before me is the vision of a very lofty and simple soul perplexed and as it were surprised and even dismayed at the complexity of the effects from motives so single in it but escaping always to a clear expression of what was noblest and loveliest in itself at the supreme moments in the divine exigencies i believe neither in heroes nor in saints but i believe in great and good men for i have known them and among such men lowell was of the richest nature i have known his nature was not always serene or pellucid it was sometimes roiled by the currents that counter and cross in all of us but it was without the least alloy of insincerity and it was never darkened by the shadow of a selfish fear his genius was an instrument that responded in affluent harmony to the power that made him a humorist and that made him a poet and appointed him rarely to be quite either alone     cambridge neighbors  being the wholly literary spirit i was when i went to make my home in cambridge i do not see how i could well have been more content if i had found myself in the elysian fields with an agreeable eternity before me at twentynine indeed one is practically immortal and at that age time had for me the effect of an eternity in which i had nothing to do but to read books and dream of writing them in the overflow of endless hours from my work with the manuscripts critical notices and proofs of the atlantic monthly as for the social environment i should have been puzzled if given my choice among the elect of all the ages to find poets and scholars more to my mind than those still in the flesh at cambridge in the early afternoon of the nineteenth century they are now nearly all dead and i can speak of them in the freedom which is deaths doubtful favor to the survivor but if they were still alive i could say little to their offence unless their modesty was hurt with my praise     i  one of the first and truest of our cambridge friends was that exquisite intelligence who in a world where so many people are grotesquely miscalled was most fitly named for no man ever kept here more perfectly and purely the heart of such as the kingdom of heaven is of than francis j child he was then in his prime and i like to recall the outward image which expressed the inner man as happily as his name he was of low stature and of an inclination which never became stoutness but what you most saw when you saw him was his face of consummate refinement very regular with eyes always glassed by goldrimmed spectacles a straight short most sensitive nose and a beautiful mouth with the sweetest smile mouth ever wore and that was as wise and shrewd as it was sweet in a time when every other man was more or less bearded he was clean shaven and of a delightful freshness of coloring which his thick sunny hair clustering upon his head in close rings admirably set off i believe he never became gray and the last time i saw him though he was broken then with years and pain his face had still the brightness of his inextinguishable youth  it is well known how great was professor childs scholarship in the branches of his harvard work and how especially how uniquely effective it was in the study of english and scottish balladry to which he gave so many years of his life he was a poet in his nature and he wrought with passion as well as knowledge in the achievement of as monumental a task as any american has performed but he might have been indefinitely less than he was in any intellectual wise and yet been precious to those who knew him for the gentleness and the goodness which in him were protected from misconception by a final dignity as delicate and as inviolable as that of longfellow himself  we were still much less than a year from our life in venice when he came to see us in cambridge and in the italian interest which then commended us to so many fine spirits among our neighbors we found ourselves at the beginning of a lifelong friendship with him i was known to him only by my letters from venice which afterwards became venetian life and by a bit of devotional verse which he had asked to include in a collection he was making but he immediately gave us the freedom of his heart which after wards was never withdrawn in due time he imagined a homeschool to which our little one was asked and she had her first lessons with his own daughter under his roof these things drew us closer together and he was willing to be still nearer to me in any time of trouble at one such time when the shadow which must some time darken every door hovered at ours he had the strength to make me face it and try to realize while it was still there that it was not cruel and not evil it passed for that time but the sense of his help remained and in my own case i can testify of the potent tenderness which all who knew him must have known in him but in bearing my witness i feel accused almost as if he were present by his fastidious reluctance from any recognition of his helpfulness when this came in the form of gratitude taking credit to itself in a pose which reflected honor upon him as the architect of greatness he was delightfully impatient of it and he was most amusingly dramatic in reproducing the consciousness of certain ineffectual alumni who used to overwhelm him at commencement solemnities with some such pompous acknowledgment as professor child all that i have become sir i owe to your influence in my college career he did with delicious mockery the oldfashioned intellectual poseurs among the students who used to walk the groves of harvard with bent head and the left arm crossing the back while the other lodged its hand in the breast of the high buttoned frockcoat and i could fancy that his classes in college did not form the sunniest exposure for young folly and vanity i know that he was intolerant of any manner of insincerity and no flattery could take him off his guard i have seen him meet this with a cutting phrase of rejection and no man was more apt at snubbing the patronage that offers itself at times to all men but mostly he wished to do people pleasure and he seemed always to be studying how to do it as for need i am sure that worthy and unworthy want had alike the way to his heart  children were always his friends and they repaid with adoration the affection which he divided with them and with his flowers i recall him in no moments so characteristic as those he spent in making the little ones laugh out of their hearts at his drolling some festive evening in his house and those he gave to sharing with you his joy in his gardening this i believe began with violets and it went on to roses which he grew in a splendor and profusion impossible to any but a true lover with a genuine gift for them like lowell he spent his summers in cambridge and in the afternoon you could find him digging or pruning among his roses with an ardor which few caprices of the weather could interrupt he would lift himself from their ranks which he scarcely overtopped as you came up the footway to his door and peer purblindly across at you if he knew you at once he traversed the nodding and swaying bushes to give you the hand free of the trowel or knife or if you got indoors unseen by him he would come in holding towards you some exquisite blossom that weighed down the tip of its long stem with a succession of hospitable obeisances  he graced with unaffected poetry a life of as hard study of as hard work and as varied achievement as any i have known or read of and he played with gifts and acquirements such as in no great measure have made reputations he had a rare and lovely humor which could amuse itself both in english and italian with such an airy burletta as il pesceballo he wrote it in metastasian italian and lowell put it in libretto english he had a critical sense as sound as it was subtle in all literature and whatever he wrote he imbued with the charm of a style finely personal to himself his learning in the line of his harvard teaching included an early english scholarship unrivalled in his time and his researches in ballad literature left no corner of it untouched i fancy this part of his study was peculiarly pleasant to him for he loved simple and natural things and the beauty which he found nearest life at least he scorned the pedantic affectations of literary superiority and he used to quote with joyous laughter the swelling exclamation of an italian critic who proposed to leave the summits of polite learning for a moment with the cry scendiamo fra il popolo let us go down among the people     ii  of course it was only so hard worked a man who could take thought and trouble for another he once took thought for me at a time when it was very important to me and when he took the trouble to secure for me an engagement to deliver that course of lowell lectures in boston which i have said lowell had the courage to go in town to hear i do not remember whether professor child was equal to so much but he would have been if it were necessary and i rather rejoice now in the belief that he did not seek quite that martyrdom  he had done more than enough for me but he had done only what he was always willing to do for others in the form of a favor to himself he brought into my fife the great happiness of intimately knowing hjalmar hjorth boyesen whom he had found one summer day among the shelves in the harvard library and found to be a poet and an intending novelist i do not remember now just how this fact imparted itself to the professor but literature is of easily cultivated confidence in youth and possibly the revelation was spontaneous at any rate as a susceptible young editor i was asked to meet my potential contributor at the professors two oclock dinner and when we came to coffee in the study boyesen took from the pocket nearest his heart a chapter of gunnar and read it to us  perhaps the good professor who brought us together had plotted to have both novel and novelist make their impression at once upon the youthful subeditor but at any rate they did not fail of an effect i believe it was that chapter where gunnar and ragnhild dance and sing a stev together for i associate with that far happy time the rich mellow tones of the poets voice in the poets verse these were most characteristic of him and it is as if i might put my ear against the ethereal wall beyond which he is rapt and hear them yet  our meeting was on a lovely afternoon of summer and the odor of the professors roses stole in at the open windows and became part of the gentle event boyesen walked home with me and for a fortnight after i think we parted only to dream of the literature which we poured out upon each other in every waking moment i had just learned to know bjornsons stories and boyesen told me of his poetry and of his drama which in even measure embodied the great norse literary movement and filled me with the wonder and delight of that noble revolt against convention that brave return to nature and the springs of poetry in the heart and the speech of the common people literature was boyesens religion more than the swedenborgian philosophy in which we had both been spiritually nurtured and at every step of our mounting friendship we found ourselves on common ground in our worship of it i was a decade his senior but at thirtyfive i was not yet so stricken in years as not to be able fully to rejoice in the ardor which fused his whole being in an incandescent poetic mass i have known no man who loved poetry more generously and passionately and i think he was above all things a poet his work took the shape of scholarship fiction criticism but poetry gave it all a touch of grace and beauty some years after this first meeting of ours i remember a pathetic moment with him when i asked him why he had not written any verse of late and he answered as if still in sad astonishment at the fact that he had found life was not all poetry in those earlier days i believe he really thought it was  perhaps it really is and certainly in the course of a life that stretched almost to half a century boyesen learned more and more to see the poetry of the everyday world at least as the material of art he did battle valiantly for that belief in many polemics which i suppose gave people a sufficiently false notion of him and he showed his faith by works in fiction which better illustrated his motive gunnar stands at the beginning of these works and at the farthest remove from it in matter and method stands the mammon of unrighteousness the lovely idyl won him fame and friendship and the great novel added neither to him though he had put the experience and the observation of his ripened life into it whether it is too late or too early for it to win the place in literature which it merits i do not know but it always seemed to me the very spite of fate that it should have failed of popular effect yet i must own that it has so failed and i own this without bitterness towards gunnar which embalmed the spirit of his youth as the mammon of unrighteousness embodied the thought of his manhood     iii  it was my pleasure my privilege to bring gunnar before the public as editor of the atlantic monthly and to second the author in many a struggle with the strange idiom he had cast the story in the proofs went back and forth between us till the author had profited by every hint and suggestion of the editor he was quick to profit by any hint and he never made the same mistake twice he lived his english as fast as he learned it the right word became part of him and he put away the wrong word with instant and final rejection he had not learned american english without learning newspaper english but if one touched a phrase of it in his work he felt in his nerves which are the ultimate arbiters in such matters its difference from true american and true english it was wonderful how apt and how elect his diction was in those days it seemed as if his thought clothed itself in the fittest phrase without his choosing in his poetry he had extraordinary good fortune from the first his mind had an apparent affinity with what was most native most racy in our speech and i have just been looking over gunnar and marvelling anew at the felicity and the beauty of his phrasing  i do not know whether those who read his books stop much to consider how rare his achievement was in the mere means of expression our speech is rather more hospitable than most and yet i can remember but five other writers born to different languages who have handled english with anything like his mastery two italians ruffini the novelist and gallenga the journalist two germans carl schurz and carl hillebrand and the dutch novelist maarten maartens have some of them equalled but none of them surpassed him yet he was a man grown when he began to speak and to write english though i believe he studied it somewhat in norway before he came to america what english he knew he learned the use of here and in the measure of its idiomatic vigor we may be proud of it as americans  he had least of his native grace i think in his criticism and yet as a critic he had qualities of rare temperance acuteness and knowledge he had very decided convictions in literary art one kind of thing he believed was good and all other kinds less good down to what was bad but he was not a bigot and he made allowances for artinerror his hand fell heavy only upon those heretics who not merely denied the faith but pretended that artifice was better than nature that decoration was more than structure that makebelieve was something you could live by as you live by truth he was not strongest however in damnatory criticism his spirit was too large too generous to dwell in that and it rose rather to its full height in his appreciations of the great authors whom he loved and whom he commented from the plenitude of his scholarship as well as from his delighted sense of their grandeur here he was almost as fine as in his poetry and only less fine than in his more fortunate essays in fiction  after gunnar he was a long while in striking another note so true he did not strike it again till he wrote the mammon of unrighteousness and after that he was sometimes of a wandering and uncertain touch there are certain stories of his which i cannot read without a painful sense of their inequality not only to his talent but to his knowledge of human nature and of american character he understood our character quite as well as he understood our language but at times he seemed not to do so i think these were the times when he was overworked and ought to have been resting instead of writing in such fatigue one loses command of alien words alien situations and in estimating boyesens achievements we must never forget that he was born strange to our language and to our life in gunnar he handled the one with grace and charm in his great novel he handled both with masterly strength i call the mammon of unrighteousness a great novel and i am quite willing to say that i know few novels by born americans that surpass it in dealing with american types and conditions it has the vast horizon of the masterpieces of fictions its meanings are not for its characters alone but for every reader of it when you close the book the story is not at an end  i have a pang in praising it for i remember that my praise cannot please him any more but it was a book worthy the powers which could have given us yet greater things if they had not been spent on lesser things boyesen could toil terribly but for his fame he did not always toil wisely though he gave himself as utterly in his unwise work as in his best it was always the best he could do several years after our first meeting in cambridge he went to live in new york a city where money counts for more and goes for less than in any other city of the world and he could not resist the temptation to write more and more when he should have written less and less he never wrote anything that was not worth reading but he wrote too much for one who was giving himself with all his conscience to his academic work in the university honored by his gifts and his attainments and was lecturing far and near in the vacations which should have been days and weeks and months of leisure the wonder is that even such a stock of health as his could stand the strain so long but he had no vices and his only excesses were in the direction of the work which he loved so well when a man adds to his achievements every year we are apt to forget the things he has already done and i think it well to remind the reader that boyesen who died at fortyeight had written besides articles reviews and lectures unnumbered four volumes of scholarly criticism on german and scandinavian literature a volume of literary and social essays a popular history of norway a volume of poems twelve volumes of fiction and four books for boys  boyesens energies were inexhaustible he was not content to be merely a scholar merely an author he wished to be an active citizen to take his part in honest politics and to live for his day in things that most men of letters shun his experience in them helped him to know american life better and to appreciate it more justly both in its good and its evil and as a matter of fact he knew us very well his acquaintance with us had been wide and varied beyond that of most of our literary men and touched many aspects of our civilization which remain unknown to most americans when he died he had been a journalist in chicago and a teacher in ohio he had been a professor in cornell university and a literary free lance in new york and everywhere his eyes and ears had kept themselves open as a teacher he learned to know the more fortunate or the more ambitious of our youth and as a lecturer his knowledge was continually extending itself among all ages and classes of americans  he was through and through a norseman but he was none the less a very american between norsk and yankee there is an affinity of spirit more intimate than the ties of race both have the commonsense view of life both are unsentimental when boyesen told me that among the norwegians men never kissed each other as the germans and the frenchmen and the italians do i perceived that we stood upon common ground when he explained the democratic character of society in norway i could well understand how he should find us a little behind his own countrymen in the practice if not the theory of equality though they lived under a king and we under a president but he was proud of his american citizenship he knew all that it meant at its best for humanity he divined that the true expression of america was not civic not social but domestic almost and that the people in the simplest homes or those who remained in the tradition of a simple home life were the true americans as yet whatever the future americans might be  when i first knew him he was chafing with the impatience of youth and ambition at what he thought his exile in the west there was to be sure a difference between urbana ohio and cambridge massachusetts and he realized the difference in the extreme and perhaps beyond it i tried to make him believe that if a man had one or two friends anywhere who loved letters and sympathized with him in his literary attempts it was incentive enough but of course he wished to be in the centres of literature as we all do and he never was content until he had set his face and his foot eastward it was a great step for him from the swedenborgian school at urbana to the young university at ithaca and i remember his exultation in making it but he could not rest there and in a few years he resigned his professorship and came to new york where he entered highheartedly upon the struggle with fortune which ended in his appointment in columbia  new york is a mart and not a capital in literature as well as in other things and doubtless he increasingly felt this i know that there came a time when he no longer thought the west must be exile for a literary man and his latest visits to its summer schools as a lecturer impressed him with the genuineness of the interest felt there in culture of all kinds he spoke of this with a due sense of what was pathetic as well as what was grotesque in some of its manifestations and i think that in reconciling himself to our popular crudeness for the sake of our popular earnestness he completed his naturalization in the only sense in which our citizenship is worth having  i do not wish to imply that he forgot his native land or ceased to love it proudly and tenderly he kept for norway the fondness which the man sitting at his own hearth feels for the home of his boyhood he was of good family his people were people of substance and condition and he could have had an easier life there than here he could have won even wider fame and doubtless if he had remained in norway he would have been one of that group of great norwegians who have given their little land renown surpassed by that of no other in the modern republic of letters the name of boyesen would have been set with the names of bjornson of ibsen of kielland and of lie but when once he had seen america at the wish of his father who had visited the united states before him he thought only of becoming an american when i first knew him he was full of the poetry of his motherland his talk was of fjords and glaciers of firs and birches of hulders and nixies of housemen and gaardsmen but he was glad to be here and i think he never regretted that he had cast his lot with us always of course he had the deepest interest in his country and countrymen he stood the friend of every norwegian who came to him in want or trouble and they came to him freely and frequently he sympathized strongly with norway in her quarrel with sweden and her wish for equality as well as autonomy and though he did not go all lengths with the national party he was decided in his feeling that sweden was unjust to her sister kingdom and strenuous for the principles of the norwegian leaders  but as i have said poetry was what his ardent spirit mainly meditated in that hour when i first knew him in cambridge before we had either of us grown old and sad if not wise he overflowed with it and he talked as little as he dreamed of anything else in the vast halfsummer we spent together he was constantly at my house where in an absence of my family i was living bachelor and where we sat indoors and talked or sauntered outdoors and talked with our heads in a cloud of fancies not unmixed with the mosquitoes of cambridge if i could have back the fancies i would be willing to have the mosquitoes with them he looked the poetry he lived his eyes were the blue of sunlit fjords his brown silken hair was thick on the crown which it later abandoned to a scholarly baldness his soft red lips half hid a boyish pout in the youthful beard and mustache he was short of stature but of a stalwart breadth of frame and his voice was of a peculiar and endearing quality indescribably mellow and tender when he read his verse  i have hardly the right to dwell so long upon him here for he was only a sojourner in cambridge but the memory of that early intimacy is too much for my sense of proportion as i have hinted our intimacy was renewed afterwards when i too came to live in new york where as long as he was in this dolce lome he hardly let a week go by without passing a long evening with me our talk was still of literature and life but more of life than of literature and we seldom spoke of those old times i still found him true to the ideals which had clarified themselves to both of us as the duty of unswerving fealty to the real thing in whatever we did this we felt as we had felt it long before to be the sole source of beauty and of art and we warmed ourselves at each others hearts in our devotion to it amidst a misunderstanding environment which we did not characterize by so mild an epithet boyesen indeed outrealisted me in the polemics of our aesthetics and sometimes when an unbeliever was by i willingly left to my friend the affirmation of our faith not without some quaking at his unsparing strenuousness in disciplining the heretic but now that ardent and active soul is elsewhere and i have ceased even to expect the ring which making itself heard at the late hour of his coming i knew always to be his and not anothers that mechanical expectation of those who will come no more is something terrible but when even that ceases we know the irreparability of our loss and begin to realize how much of ourselves they have taken with them     iv  it was some years before the boyesen summer which was the fourth or fifth of our life in cambridge that i made the acquaintance of a man very much my senior who remains one of the vividest personalities in my recollection i speak of him in this order perhaps because of an obscure association with boyesen through their religious faith which was also mine but henry james was incommensurably more swedenborgian than either of us he lived and thought and felt swedenborg with an entirety and intensity far beyond the mere assent of other men he did not do this in any stupidly exclusive way but in the most luminously inclusive way with a constant reference of these vain mundane shadows to the spiritual realities from which they project his piety which sometimes expressed itself in terms of alarming originality and freedom was too large for any ecclesiastical limits and one may learn from the books which record it how absolutely individual his interpretations of swedenborg were clarifications they cannot be called and in that other world whose substantial verity was the inspiration of his life here the two sages may by this time have met and agreed to differ as to some points in the doctrine of the seer in such a case i cannot imagine the apostle giving way and i do not say he would be wrong to insist but i think he might now be willing to allow that the exegetic pages which sentence by sentence were so brilliantly suggestive had sometimes a collective opacity which the most resolute vision could not penetrate he put into this dark wisdom the most brilliant intelligence ever brought to the service of his mystical faith he lighted it up with flashes of the keenest wit and bathed it in the glow of a lambent humor so that it is truly wonderful to me how it should remain so unintelligible but i have only tried to read certain of his books and perhaps if i had persisted in the effort i might have found them all as clear at last as the one which seems to me the clearest and is certainly most encouragingly suggestive i mean the one called society the redeemed form of man  he had his whole being in his belief it had not only liberated him from the bonds of the calvinistic theology in which his youth was trammelled but it had secured him against the conscious ethicism of the prevailing unitarian doctrine which supremely worshipped conduct and it had colored his vocabulary to such strange effects that he spoke of moral men with abhorrence as more hopelessly lost than sinners any one whose sphere tempted him to recognition of the foibles of others he called the devil but in spite of his perception of such diabolism he was rather fond of yielding to it for he had a most trenchant tongue i myself once fell under his condemnation as the devil by having too plainly shared his joy in his characterization of certain fellowmen perhaps a group of bostonians from whom he had just parted and whose reciprocal pleasure of themselves he presented in the image of simmering in their own fat and putting a nice brown on each other  swedenborg himself he did not spare as a man he thought that very likely his life had those lapses in it which some of his followers deny and he regarded him on the aesthetical side as essentially commonplace and as probably chosen for his prophetic function just because of his imaginative nullity his tremendous revelations could be the more distinctly and unmistakably inscribed upon an intelligence of that sort which alone could render again a strictly literal report of them  as to some other sorts of believers who thought they had a special apprehension of the truth he had no mercy upon them if they betrayed however innocently any selfcomplacency in their possession i went one evening to call upon him with a dear old shaker elder who had the misfortune to say that his people believed themselves to be living the angelic life james fastened upon him with the suggestion that according to swedenborg the most celestial angels were unconscious of their own perfection and that if the shakers felt they were of angelic condition they were probably the sport of the hells i was very glad to get my poor old friend off alive and to find that he was not even aware of being cut asunder i did not invite him to shake himself  with spiritualists james had little or no sympathy he was not so impatient of them as the swedenborgians commonly are and he probably acknowledged a measure of verity in the spiritistic phenomena but he seemed rather incurious concerning them and he must have regarded them as superfluities of naughtiness mostly as emanations from the hells his powerful and penetrating intellect interested itself with all social and civil facts through his religion he was essentially religious but he was very consciously a citizen with most decided opinions upon political questions my own darkness as to anything like social reform was then so dense that i cannot now be clear as to his feeling in such matters but i have the impression that it was far more radical than i could understand he was of a very merciful mind regarding things often held in pitiless condemnation but of charity as it is commonly understood he had misgivings he would never have turned away from him that asketh but he spoke with regret of some of his benefactions in the past large gifts of money to individuals which he now thought had done more harm than good  i never knew him to judge men by the society scale he was most human in his relations with others and was in correspondence with all sorts of people seeking light and help he answered their letters and tried to instruct them and no one was so low or weak but he or she could reach him on his or her own level though he had his humorous perception of their foibles and disabilities and he had that keen sense of the grotesque which often goes with the kindliest nature he told of his dining early in life next a fellowman from cape cod at the astor house where such a man could seldom have found himself when they were served with meat this neighbor asked if he would mind his putting his fat on jamess plate he disliked fat james said that he considered the request and seeing no good reason against it consented  he could be cruel with his tongue when he fancied insincerity or pretence and then cruelly sorry for the hurt he gave he was indeed tremulously sensitive not only for himself but for others and would offer atonement far beyond the measure of the offence he supposed himself to have given  at all times he thought originally in words of delightful originality which painted a fact with the greatest vividness of a person who had a nervous twitching of the face and who wished to call up a friend to them he said he spasmed to the fellow across the room and introduced him his written style had traits of the same bold adventurousness but it was his speech which was most captivating as i write of him i see him before me his white bearded face with a kindly intensity which at first glance seemed fierce the mouth humorously shaping the mustache the eyes vague behind the glasses his sensitive hand gripping the stick on which he rested his weight to ease it from the artificial limb he wore     v  the goethean face and figure of louis agassiz were in those days to be seen in the shady walks of cambridge to which for me they lent a weimarish quality in the degree that in weimar itself a few years ago i felt a quality of cambridge agassiz of course was swiss and latin and not teutonic but he was of the continental european civilization and was widely different from the other cambridge men in everything but love of the place he is always an europaen said lowell one day in distinguishing concerning him and for any one who had tasted the flavor of the life beyond the ocean and the channel this had its charm yet he was extremely fond of his adoptive compatriots and no alien born had a truer or tenderer sense of new england character i have an idea that no one else of his day could have got so much money for science out of the general court of massachusetts and i have heard him speak with the wisest and warmest appreciation of the hard material from which he was able to extract this treasure the legislators who voted appropriations for his museum and his other scientific objects were not usually lawyers or professional men with the perspectives of a liberal education but were hardfisted farmers who had a grip of the states money as if it were their own and yet gave it with intelligent munificence they understood that he did not want it for himself and had no interested aim in getting it they knew that as he once said he had no time to make money and wished to use it solely for the advancement of learning and with this understanding they were ready to help him generously he compared their liberality with that of kings and princes when these patronized science with a recognition of the superior plebeian generosity it was on the veranda of his summer house at nahant while he lay in the hammock talking of this that i heard him refer also to the offer which napoleon iii had made him inviting him upon certain splendid conditions to come to paris after he had established himself in cambridge he said that he had not come to america without going over every such possibility in his own mind and deciding beforehand against it he was a republican by nationality and by preference and was entirely satisfied with his position and environment in new england  outside of his scientific circle in cambridge he was more friends with longfellow than with any one else i believe and longfellow told me how after the doctors had condemned agassiz to inaction on account of his failing health he had broken down in his friends study and wept like an europaer and lamented i shall never finish my work some papers which he had begun to write for the magazine in contravention of the darwinian theory or part of it which it is known agassiz did not accept remained part of the work which he never finished after his death i wished professor jeffries wyman to write of him in the atlantic but he excused himself on account of his many labors and then he voluntarily spoke of agassizs methods which he agreed with rather than his theories being himself thoroughly darwinian i think he said agassiz was the first to imagine establishing a fact not from a single example but from examples indefinitely repeated if it was a question of something about robins for instance he would have a hundred robins examined before he would receive an appearance as a fact  of course no preconception or prepossession of his own was suffered to bar his way to the final truth he was seeking and he joyously renounced even a conclusion if he found it mistaken i do not know whether mrs agassiz has put into her interesting life of him a delightful story which she told me about him he came to her beaming one day and demanded you know i have always held such and such an opinion about a certain group of fossil fishes yes yes well i have just been readings new book and he has shown me that there isnt the least truth in my theory and he burst into a laugh of unalloyed pleasure in relinquishing his error  i could touch science at cambridge only on its literary and social side of course and my meetings with agassiz were not many i recall a dinner at his house to mr bret harte when the poet came on from california and agassiz approached him over the coffee through their mutual scientific interest in the last meeting of the geological society upon the stanislow he quoted to the author some passages from the poem recording the final proceedings of this body which had particularly pleased him and i think mr harte was as much amused at finding himself thus in touch with the savant as agassiz could ever have been with that delicious poem  agassiz lived at one end of quincy street and james almost at the other end with an interval between them which but poorly typified their difference of temperament the one was all philosophical and the other all scientific and yet towards the close of his life agassiz may be said to have led that movement towards the new position of science in matters of mystery which is now characteristic of it he was ancestrally of the swiss brahminical caste as so many of his friends in cambridge were of the brahminical caste of new england and perhaps it was the line of ancestral pasteurs which at last drew him back or on to the affirmation of an unformulated faith of his own at any rate before most other savants would say that they had souls of their own he became by opening a summer school of science with prayer nearly as consolatory to the unscientific who wished to believe they had souls as mr john fiske himself though mr fiske as the archapostle of darwinism had arrived at nearly the same point by such a very different road     vi  mr fiske had been our neighbor in our first cambridge home and when we went to live in berkeley street he followed with his family and placed himself across the way in a house which i already knew as the home of richard henry dana the author of two years before the mast like nearly all the other cambridge men of my acquaintance dana was very much my senior and like the rest he welcomed my literary promise as cordially as if it were performance with no suggestion of the condescension which was said to be his attitude towards many of his fellowmen i never saw anything of this in fact and i suppose he may have been a blend of those patrician qualities and democratic principles which made lowell anomalous even to himself he is part of the antislavery history of his time and he gave to the oppressed his strenuous help both as a man and a politician his gifts and learning in the law were freely at their service he never lost his interest in those white slaves whose brutal bondage he remembered as bound with them in his two years before the mast and any luckless seaman with a case or cause might count upon his friendship as surely as the black slaves of the south he was able to temper his indignation for their oppression with a humorous perception of what was droll in its agents and circumstances and i wish i could recall all that he said once about seaetiquette on merchant vessels where the chief mate might no more speak to the captain at table without being addressed by him than a subject might put a question to his sovereign he was amusing in his stories of the pacific trade in which he said it was very noble to deal in furs from the northwest and very ignoble to deal in hides along the mexican and south american coasts every ships master wished naturally to be in the furcarrying trade and in one of danas instances two vessels encounter in midocean and exchange the usual parley as to their respective ports of departure and destination the final demand comes through the trumpet what cargo and the captain so challenged yields to temptation and roars back furs a moment of hesitation elapses and then the questioner pursues here and there a horn  there were other distinctions of which seafaring men of other days were keenly sensible and dana dramatized the meeting of a great swelling east indiaman with a little atlantic trader which has hailed her she shouts back through her captains trumpet that she is from calcutta and laden with silks spices and other orient treasures and in her turn she requires like answer from the sail which has presumed to enter into parley with her what cargo the trader confesses to a mixed cargo for boston and to the final question her master replies in meek apology only from liverpool sir and scuttles down the horizon as swiftly as possible  dana was not of the cambridge men whose calling was in cambridge he was a lawyer in active practice and he went every day to boston one was apt to meet him in those horsecars which formerly tinkled back and forth between the two cities and which were often so full of ones acquaintance that they had all the social elements of an afternoon tea they were abusively overcrowded at times of course and one might easily see a prime literary celebrity swaying from a strap or hanging uneasily by the handrail to the lower steps of the back platform i do not mean that i ever happened to see the author of two years before the mast in either fact but in his celebrity he had every qualification for the illustration of my point his book probably carried the american name farther and wider than any american books except those of irving and cooper at a day when our writers were very little known and our literature was the only infant industry not fostered against foreign ravage but expressly left to harden and strengthen itself as it best might in a heartless neglect even at home the book was delightful and i remember it from a reading of thirty years ago as of the stuff that classics are made of i venture no conjecture as to its present popularity but of all books relating to the sea i think it is the best the author when i knew him was still richard henry dana jr his father the aged poet who first established the name in the public recognition being alive though past literary activity it was distinctively a literary race and in the actual generation it has given proofs of its continued literary vitality in the romance of espiritu santo by the youngest daughter of the dana i knew     vii  there could be no stronger contrast to him in origin education and character than a man who lived at the same time in cambridge and who produced a book which in its final fidelity to life is not unworthy to be named with two years before the mast ralph keeler wrote the vagabond adventures which he had lived i have it on my heart to name him in the presence of our great literary men not only because i had an affection for him tenderer than i then knew but because i believe his book is worthier of more remembrance than it seems to enjoy i was reading it only the other day and i found it delightful and much better than i imagined when i accepted for the atlantic the several papers which it is made up of i am not sure but it belongs to the great literature in that fidelity to life which i have spoken of and which the author brought himself to practise with such difficulty and under so much stress from his editor he really wanted to fake it at times but he was docile at last and did it so honestly that it tells the history of his strange career in much better terms than it can be given again he had been as he claimed a cruel uncles ward in his early orphanhood and while yet almost a child he had run away from home to fulfil his hearts desire of becoming a clogdancer in a troupe of negro minstrels but it was first his fate to be cabinboy and bootblack on a lake steamboat and meet with many squalid adventures scarcely to be matched outside of a spanish picaresque novel when he did become a dancer and even a danseuse of the sort he aspired to be the fruition of his hopes was so little what he imagined that he was very willing to leave the floating palace on the mississippi in which his troupe voyaged and exhibited and enter the college of the jesuit fathers at cape girardeau in missouri they were very good to him and in their charge he picked up a good deal more latin if not less greek than another strolling player who also took to literature from college keeler went to europe and then to california whence he wrote me that he was coming on to boston with the manuscript of a novel which he wished me to read for the magazine i reported against it to my chief but nothing could shake keelers faith in it until he had printed it at his own cost and known it fail instantly and decisively he had come to cambridge to see it through the press and he remained there four or five years with certain brief absences then during the cuban insurrection of the early seventies he accepted the invitation of a new york paper to go to cuba as its correspondent  dont go keeler i entreated him when he came to tell me of his intention theyll garrote you down there  well he said with the air of being pleasantly interested by the coincidence as he stood on my study hearth with his feet wide apart in a fashion he had and gayly flirted his hand in the air thats what aldrich says and hes agreed to write my biography on condition that i make a last dying speech when they bring me out on the plaza to do it if i had taken the advice of my friend t b aldrich author of marjorie daw and other people i should not now be in this place  he went and he did not come back he was not indeed garroted as his friends had promised but he was probably assassinated on the steamer by which he sailed from santiago for he never arrived in havana and was never heard of again  i now realize that i loved him though i did as little to show it as men commonly do if i am to meet somewhere else the friends who are no longer here i should like to meet ralph keeler and i would take some chances of meeting in a happy place a soul which had by no means kept itself unspotted but which in all its consciousness of error cheerfully trusted that the almighty was not going to scoop any of us the faith worded so grotesquely could not have been more simply or humbly affirmed and no man i think could have been more helplessly sincere he had nothing of that false selfrespect which forbids a man to own himself wrong promptly and utterly when need is and in fact he owned to some things in his checkered past which would hardly allow him any sort of selfrespect he had always an essential gaiety not to be damped by any discipline and a docility which expressed itself in cheerful compliance why do you use bias for opinion i demanded in going over a proof with him oh because im such an asssuch a biass  he had a philosophy which he liked to impress with a vivid touch on his listeners shoulder put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it its the only one youve got or ever will have this light and joyous creature could not but be a pariah among our brahmins and i need not say that i never met him in any of the great cambridge houses i am not sure that he was a persona grata to every one in my own for keeler was framed rather for mens liking and mr aldrich and i had our subtleties as to whether his mind about women was not so chinese as somewhat to infect his manner keeler was too really modest to be of any rebellious mind towards the society which ignored him and of too sweet a cheerfulness to be greatly vexed by it he lived on in the house of a suave old actor who oddly made his home in cambridge and he continued of a harmless bohemianism in his daily walk which included lunches at boston restaurants as often as he could get you to let him give them you if you were of his acquaintance on a sunday he would appear coming out of the postoffice usually at the hour when all cultivated cambridge was coming for its letters and wave a glad hand in air and shout a blithe salutation to the friend he had marked for his companion in a morning stroll the stroll was commonly over the flats towards brighton i do not know why except perhaps that it was out of the beat of the better element and the talk was mainly of literature in which he was doing less than he meant to do and which he seemed never able quite to feel was not a branch of the show business and might not be legitimately worked by like advertising though he truly loved and honored it  i suppose it was not altogether a happy life and keeler had his moments of amusing depression which showed their shadows in his smiling face he was of a slight figure and low stature with hands and feet of almost womanish littleness he was very blonde and his restless eyes were blue he wore his yellow beard in whiskers only which he pulled nervously but perhaps did not get to droop so much as he wished     viii  keeler was a native of ohio and there lived at cambridge when i first came there an indianian more accepted by literary society who was of real quality as a poet forceythe willson whose poem of the old sergeant doctor holmes used to read publicly in the closing year of the civil war was of a western altitude of figure and of an extraordinary beauty of face in an oriental sort he had large dark eyes with clouded whites his full silken beard was of a flashing persian blackness he was excessively nervous to such an extreme that when i first met him at longfellows he could not hold himself still in his chair i think this was an effect of shyness in him as well as physical for afterwards when i went to find him in his own house he was much more at ease  he preferred to receive me in the dim large hall after opening his door to me himself and we sat down there and talked i remember of supernatural things he was much interested in spiritualism and he had several stories to tell of his own experience in such matters but none was so good as one which i had at second hand from lowell who thought it almost the best ghost story he had ever heard the spirit of willsons father appeared to him and stood before him willson was accustomed to apparitions and so he said simply wont you sit down father the phantom put out his hand to lay hold of a chairback as some people do in taking a seat and his shadowy arm passed through the framework ah he said i forgot that i was not substance  i do not know whether the old sergeant is ever read now it has probably passed with other great memories of the great war and i am afraid none of willsons other verse is remembered but he was then a distinct literary figure and not to be left out of the count of our poets i did not see him again shortly afterwards i heard that he had left cambridge with signs of consumption which must have run a rapid course for a very little later came the news of his death     ix  the most devoted cantabrigian after lowell whom i knew would perhaps have contended that if he had stayed with us willson might have lived for john holmes affirmed a faith in the virtues of the place which ascribed almost an aseptic character to its air and when he once listened to my own complaints of an obstinate cold he cheered himself if not me with the declaration well one thing mr howells cambridge never let a man keep a cold yet  if he had said it was better to live in cambridge with a cold than elsewhere without one i should have believed him as it was cambridge bore him out in his assertion though she took her own time to do it  lowell had talked to me of him before i met him celebrating his peculiar humor with that affection which was not always so discriminating and holmes was one of the first cambridge men i knew i knew him first in the charming old colonial house in which his famous brother and he were born it was demolished long before i left cambridge but in memory it still stands on the ground since occupied by the hemenway gymnasium and shows for me through that bulk a phantom frame of continental buff in the shadow of elms that are shadows themselves the genius loci was limping about the pleasant mansion with the rheumatism which then expressed itself to his friends in a resolute smile but which now insists upon being an essential trait of the fulllength presence to my mind a short stout figure helped out with a cane and a grizzled head with features formed to win the heart rather than the eye of the beholder  in one of his own eyes there was a cast of such winning humor and geniality that it took the liking more than any beauty could have done and the sweetest shy laugh in the world went with this cast  i long wished to get him to write something for the magazine and at last i prevailed with him to review a history of cambridge which had come out  he did it charmingly of course for he loved more to speak of cambridge than anything else he held his native town in an idolatry which was not blind but which was none the less devoted because he was aware of her droll points and her weak points he always celebrated these as so many virtues and i think it was my own passion for her that first commended me to him i was not her son but he felt that this was my misfortune more than my fault and he seemed more and more to forgive it after we had got upon the terms of editor and contributor we met oftener than before though i do not now remember that i ever persuaded him to write again for me once he gave me something and then took it back with a selfdistrust of it which i could not overcome  when the holmes house was taken down he went to live with an old domestic in a small house on the street amusingly called appian way he had certain rooms of her and his own table but he would not allow that he was ever anything but a lodger in the place where he continued till he died in the process of time he came so far to trust his experience of me that he formed the habit of giving me an annual supper some days before this event he would appear in my study and with divers delicate and tentative approaches nearly always of the same tenor he would say that he should like to ask my family to an oyster supper with him but you know he would explain i havent a house of my own to ask you to and i should like to give you the supper here when i had agreed to this suggestion with due gravity he would inquire our engagements and then say as if a great load were off his mind well then i will send up a few oysters tomorrow or whatever day we had fixed on and after a little more talk to take the strangeness out of the affair would go his way on the day appointed the fishman would come with several gallons of oysters which he reported mr holmes had asked him to bring and in the evening the giver of the feast would reappear with a lank oilcloth bag sagged by some bottles of wine there was always a bottle of red wine and sometimes a bottle of champagne and he had taken the precaution to send some crackers beforehand so that the supper should be as entirely of his own giving as possible he was forced to let us do the cooking and to supply the coldslaw and perhaps he indemnified himself for putting us to these charges and for the use of our linen and silver by the vast superfluity of his oysters with which we remained inundated for days he did not care to eat many himself but seemed content to fancy doing us a pleasure and i have known few greater ones in life than in the hospitality that so oddly played the host to us at our own table     x  it must have seemed incomprehensible to such a cantabrigian that we should ever have been willing to leave cambridge and in fact i do not well understand it myself but if he resented it he never showed his resentment as often as i happened to meet him after our defection he used me with unabated kindness and sparkled into some gaiety too ethereal for remembrance the last time i met him was at lowells funeral when i drove home with him and curtis and child and in the revulsion from the stress of that saddest event had our laugh as people do in the presence of death at something droll we remembered of the friend we mourned  my nearest literary neighbor when we lived in sacramento street was the rev dr john g palfrey the historian of new england whose chimneytops amid the pinetops i could see from my study window when the leaves were off the little grove of oaks between us he was one of the first of my acquaintances not suffering the great disparity of our ages to count against me but tactfully and sweetly adjusting himself to my youth in the friendly intercourse which he invited he was a most gentle and kindly old man with still an interest in liberal things which lasted till the infirmities of age secluded him from the world and all its interests as is known he had been in his prime one of the foremost of the new england antislavery men and he had fought the good fight with a heavy heart for a brother long settled in louisiana who sided with the south and who after the civil war found himself disfranchised in this temporary disability he came north to visit doctor palfrey upon the doctors insistence though at first he would have nothing to do with him and refused even to answer his letters of course the doctor said i was not going to stand that from my mothers son and i simply kept on writing so he prevailed but the fiery old gentleman from louisiana was reconciled to nothing in the north but his brother and when he came to return my visit he quickly touched upon his cause of quarrel with us i cant vote he declared but my coachman can and i dont know how im to get the suffrage unless my physician paints me all over with the iodine hes using for my rheumatic side  doctor palfrey was most distinctly of the brahminical caste and was long an eminent unitarian minister but at the time i began to know him he had long quitted the pulpit he was so far of civic or public character as to be postmaster at boston when we were first neighbors but this officiality was probably so little in keeping with his nature that it was like a return to his truer self when he ceased to hold the place and gave his time altogether to his history it is a work which will hardly be superseded in the interest of those who value thorough research and temperate expression it is very just and without endeavor for picture or drama it is to me very attractive much that has to be recorded of new england lacks charm but he gave form and dignity and presence to the memories of the past and the finer moments of that great story he gave with the simplicity that was their best setting it seems to me such an apology in the old sense as new england might have written for herself and in fact doctor palfrey was a personification of new england in one of the best and truest kinds he was refined in the essential gentleness of his heart without being refined away he kept the faith of her puritan tradition though he no longer kept the puritan faith and his defence of the puritan severity with the witches and quakers was as impartial as it was efficient in positing the puritans as of their time and rather better and not worse than other people of the same time he was himself a most tolerant man and his tolerance was never weak or fond it stopped well short of condoning error which he condemned when he preferred to leave it to its own punishment personally he was without any flavor of harshness his mind was as gentle as his manner which was one of the gentlest i have ever known  of as gentle make but of more pensive temper with unexpected bursts of lyrical gaiety was christopher pearse cranch the poet whom i had known in new york long before he came to live in cambridge he could not only play and sing most amusing songs but he wrote very good poems and painted pictures perhaps not so good i always liked his venetian pictures for their poetic unsentimentalized veracity and i printed as well as liked many of his poems during the time that i knew him more than his due share of troubles and sorrows accumulated themselves on his fine head which the years had whitened and gave a droop to the beautiful whitebearded face but he had the artist soul and the poet heart and no doubt he could take refuge in these from the cares that shadowed his visage my acquaintance with him in cambridge renewed itself upon the very terms of its beginning in new york we met at longfellows table where he lifted up his voice in the yankee folksong on springfield mountain there did dwell which he gave with a perfectly killing mockgravity     xi  at cambridge the best society was better it seems to me than even that of the neighboring capital it would be rather hard to prove this and i must ask the reader to take my word for it if he wishes to believe it the great interests in that pleasant world which i think does not present itself to my memory in a false iridiscence were the intellectual interests and all other interests were lost in these to such as did not seek them too insistently  people held themselves high they held themselves personally aloof from people not duly assayed their civilization was still puritan though their belief had long ceased to be so they had weights and measure stamped in an earlier time a time surer of itself than ours by which they rated the merit of all comers and rejected such as did not bear the test these standards were their own and they were satisfied with them most americans have no standards of their own but these are not satisfied even with other peoples and so our society is in a state of tolerant and tremulous misgiving  family counted in cambridge without doubt as it counts in new england everywhere but family alone did not mean position and the want of family did not mean the want of it money still less than family commanded one could be openly poor in cambridge without open shame or shame at all for no one was very rich there and no one was proud of his riches  i do not wonder that turguenieff thought the conditions ideal as boyesen portrayed them to him and i look back at my own life there with wonder at my good fortune i was sensible and i still am sensible this had its alloys i was young and unknown and was making my way and i had to suffer some of the penalties of these disadvantages but i do not believe that anywhere else in this illcontrived economy where it is vainly imagined that the material struggle forms a high incentive and inspiration would my penalties have been so light on the other hand the good that was done me i could never repay if i lived all over again for others the life that i have so long lived for myself at times when i had experienced from those elect spirits with whom i was associated some act of friendship as signal as it was delicate i used to ask myself how i could ever do anything unhandsome or ungenerous towards any one again and i had a bad conscience the next time i did it  the air of the cambridge that i knew was sufficiently cool to be bracing but what was of good import in me flourished in it the life of the place had its lateral limitations sometimes its lights failed to detect excellent things that lay beyond it but upward it opened illimitably i speak of it frankly because that life as i witnessed it is now almost wholly of the past cambridge is still the home of much that is good and fine in our literature one realizes this if one names colonel thomas wentworth higginson mr john fiske mr william james mr horace e scudder not to name any others but the first had not yet come back to live in his birthplace at the time i have been writing of and the rest had not yet their actual prominence one in deed among so many absent is still present there whom from time to time i have hitherto named without offering him the recognition which i should have known an infringement of his preferences but the literary cambridge of thirty years ago could not be clearly imagined or justly estimated without taking into account the creative sympathy of a man whose contributions to our literature only partially represent what he has constantly done for the humanities i am sure that after the easy heroes of the day are long forgot and the noisy fames of the strenuous life shall dwindle to their essential insignificance before those of the gentle life we shall all see in charles eliot norton the eminent scholar who left the quiet of his books to become our chief citizen at the moment when he warned his countrymen of the ignominy and disaster of doing wrong     a belated guest  it is doubtful whether the survivor of any order of things finds compensation in the privilege however undisputed by his contemporaries of recording his memories of it this is in the first two or three instances a pleasure it is sweet to sit down in the shade or by the fire and recall names looks and tones from the past and if the absences thus entreated to become presences are those of famous people they lend to the fond historian a little of their lustre in which he basks for the time with an agreeable sense of celebrity but another time comes and comes very soon when the pensive pleasure changes to the pain of duty and the precious privilege converts itself into a grievous obligation you are unable to choose your company among those immortal shades if one why not another where all seem to have a right to such gleams of this dolce lome as your reminiscences can shed upon them then they gather so rapidly as the years pass in these pale realms that one if one continues to survive is in danger of wearing out such welcome great or small as met ones recollections in the first two or three instances if one does ones duty by each people begin to say and not without reason in a world so hurried and wearied as this ah here he is again with his recollections well but if the recollections by some magical goodfortune chance to concern such a contemporary of his as say bret harte shall not he be partially justified or at least excused     i  my recollections of bret harte begin with the arrest on the atlantic shore of that progress of his from the pacific slope which in the simple days of 1871 was like the progress of a prince in the universal attention and interest which met and followed it he was indeed a prince a fairy prince in whom every lover of his novel and enchanting art felt a patriotic property for his promise and performance in those earliest tales of the luck of roaring camp and tennessees partner and maggles and the outcasts of poker flat were the earnests of an american literature to come if it is still to come in great measure that is not hartes fault for he kept on writing those stories in one form or another as long as he lived he wrote them first and last in the spirit of dickens which no man of his time could quite help doing but he wrote them from the life of bret harte on the soil and in the air of the newest kind of new world and their freshness took the soul of his fellowcountrymen not only with joy but with pride such as the europeans who adored him much longer could never know in him  when the adventurous young editor who had proposed being his host for cambridge and the boston neighborhood while harte was still in san francisco and had not yet begun his princely progress eastward read of the honors that attended his coming from point to point his courage fell as if he had perhaps committed himself in too great an enterprise who was he indeed that he should think of making this          dear son of memory great heir of fame  his guest especially when he heard that in chicago harte failed of attending a banquet of honor because the givers of it had not sent a carriage to fetch him to it as the alleged use was in san francisco whether true or not and it was probably not true in just that form it must have been this rumor which determined his host to drive into boston for him with the handsomest hack which the livery of cambridge afforded and not trust to the horsecar and the local expressman to get him and his baggage out as he would have done with a less portentous guest however it was he instantly lost all fear when they met at the station and harte pressed forward with his cordial handclasp as if he were not even a fairy prince and with that voice and laugh which were surely the most winning in the world he was then as always a child of extreme fashion as to his clothes and the cut of his beard which he wore in a mustache and the drooping sidewhiskers of the day and his jovial physiognomy was as winning as his voice with its straight nose and fascinating thrust of the under lip its fine eyes and good forehead then thickly crowned with the black hair which grew early white while his mustache remained dark the most enviable and consoling effect possible in the universal mortal necessity of either aging or dying he was as one could not help seeing thickly pitted but after the first glance one forgot this so that a lady who met him for the first time could say to him mr harte arent you afraid to go about in the cars so recklessly when there is this scare about smallpox no madam he could answer in that rich note of his with an irony touched by pseudopathos i bear a charmed life  the drive out from boston was not too long for getting on terms of personal friendship with the family which just filled the hack the two boys intensely interested in the novelties of a new england city and suburb and the father and mother continually exchanging admiration of such aspects of nature as presented themselves in the leafless sidewalk trees and patches of park and lawn they found everything so fine so refined after the gigantic coarseness of california where the natural forms were so vast that one could not get on companionable terms with them their host heard them without misgiving for the world of romance which harte had built up among those huge forms and with a subtle perception that this was no excursion of theirs to the east but a lifelong exodus from the exile which he presently understood they must always have felt california to be it is different now when people are every day being born in california and must begin to feel it home from the first breath but it is notable that none of the californians of that great early day have gone back to live amid the scenes which inspired and prospered them  before they came in sight of the editors humble roof he had mocked himself to his guest for his trepidations and harte with burlesque magnanimity had consented to be for that occasion only something less formidable than he had loomed afar he accepted with joy the theory of passing a week in the home of virtuous poverty and the week began as delightfully as it went on from first to last cambridge amused him as much as it charmed him by that air of academic distinction which was stranger to him even than the refined trees and grass it has already been told how after a list of the local celebrities had been recited to him he said why you couldnt stand on your front porch and fire off your revolver without bringing down a two volumer and no doubt the pleasure he had in it was the effect of its contrast with the wild california he had known and perhaps when he had not altogether known it had invented     ii  cambridge began very promptly to show him those hospitalities which he could value and continued the fable of his fairy princeliness in the curiosity of those humbler admirers who could not hope to be his hosts or his fellowguests at dinner or luncheon pretty presences in the tiebacks of the period were seen to flit before the home of virtuous poverty hungering for any chance sight of him which his outgoings or incomings might give the chances were better with the outgoings than with the incomings for these were apt to be so hurried in the final result of his constitutional delays as to have the rapidity of the homing pigeons flight and to afford hardly a glimpse to the quickest eye it cannot harm him or any one now to own that harte was nearly always late for those luncheons and dinners which he was always going out to and it needed the anxieties and energies of both families to get him into his clothes and then into the carriage where a good deal of final buttoning must have been done in order that he might not arrive so very late he was the only one concerned who was quite unconcerned his patience with his delays was inexhaustible he arrived at the expected houses smiling serenely jovial radiating a bland gaiety from his whole person and ready to ignore any discomfort he might have occasioned  of course people were glad to have him on his own terms and it may be truly said that it was worth while to have him on any terms there never was a more charming companion an easier or more delightful guest  it was not from what he said for he was not much of a talker and almost nothing of a storyteller but he could now and then drop the fittest word and with a glance or smile of friendly intelligence express the appreciation of anothers fit word which goes far to establish for a man the character of boon humorist it must be said of him that if he took the honors easily that were paid him he took them modestly and never by word or look invited them or implied that he expected them it was fine to see him humorously accepting the humorous attribution of scientific sympathies from agassiz in compliment of his famous epic describing the incidents that broke up the society upon the stanislow it was a little fearsome to hear him frankly owning to lowell his dislike for something overliterary in the phrasing of certain verses of the cathedral but lowell could stand that sort of thing from a man who could say the sort of things that harte said to him of that delicious line picturing the bobolink as he       runs down a brook of laughter in the air  this harte told him was the line he liked best of all his lines and lowell smoked well content with the praise yet they were not men to get on easily together lowell having limitations in directions where harte had none afterward in london they did not meet often or willingly lowell owned the brilliancy and uncommonness of hartes gift while he sumptuously surfeited his passion of finding everybody more or less a jew by finding that harte was at least half a jew on his fathers side he had long contended for the hebraicism of his name  with all his appreciation of the literary eminences whom fields used to class together as the old saints harte had a spice of irreverence that enabled him to take them more ironically than they might have liked and to see the fun of a minor literary mans relation to them emersons smoking amused him as a jovian selfindulgence divinely out of character with so supreme a god and he shamelessly burlesqued it telling how emerson at concord had proposed having a wet night with him over a glass of sherry and had urged the scant wine upon his young friend with a hospitable gesture of his cigar but this was long after the cambridge episode in which longfellow alone escaped the corrosive touch of his subtle irreverence or more strictly speaking had only the effect of his reverence that gentle and exquisitely modest dignity of longfellows he honored with as much veneration as it was in him to bestow and he had that sense of longfellows beautiful and perfected art which is almost a test of a critics own fineness     iii  as for hartes talk it was mostly ironical not to the extreme of satire but tempered to an agreeable coolness even for the things he admired he did not apparently care to hear himself praised but he could very accurately and perfectly mark his discernment of excellence in others he was at times a keen observer of nature and again not apparently something was said before him and lowell of the beauty of his description of a rabbit startled with fear among the ferns and lifting its head with the pulsation of its frightened heart visibly shaking it then the talk turned on the graphic homeliness of dantes noticing how the dogs skin moves upon it and harte spoke of the exquisite shudder with which a horse tries to rid itself of a fly  but once again when an azalea was shown to him as the sort of bush that sandy drunkenly slept under in the idyl of iced gulch he asked why is that an azalea to be sure this might have been less from his ignorance or indifference concerning the quality of the bush he had sent sandy to sleep under than from his willingness to make a mock of an azalea in a very small pot so disproportionate to uses which an azalea of californian size could easily lend itself to  you never could be sure of harte he could only by chance be caught in earnest about anything or anybody except for those slight recognitions of literary traits in his talk with lowell nothing remained from his conversation but the general criticism he passed upon his brilliant fellowhebrew heine as rather scorbutic he preferred to talk about the little matters of common incident and experience he amused himself with such things as the mystification of the postman of whom he asked his way to phillips avenue where he adventurously supposed his host to be living why the postman said there is no phillips avenue in cambridge theres phillips place well harte assented phillips place will do but there is a phillips avenue he entered eagerly into the canvass of the distinctions and celebrities asked to meet him at the reception made for him but he had even a greater pleasure in compassionating his host for the vast disparity between the caterers china and plated ware and the simplicities and humilities of the home of virtuous poverty and he spluttered with delight at the sight of the lofty epergnes set up and down the suppertable when he was brought in to note the preparations made in his honor those monumental structures were an inexhaustible joy to him he walked round and round the room and viewed them in different perspectives so as to get the full effect of the towering forms that dwarfed it so  he was a tease as many a sweet and fine wit is apt to be but his teasing was of the quality of a caress so much kindness went with it he lamented as an irreparable loss his having missed seeing that night an absentminded brother in literature who came in rubber shoes and forgetfully wore them throughout the evening that hospitable soul of ralph keeler who had known him in california but had trembled for their acquaintance when he read of all the honors that might well have spoiled harte for the friends of his simpler days rejoiced in the unchanged cordiality of his nature when they met and presently gave him one of those restaurant lunches in boston which he was always sumptuously providing out of his destitution harte was the life of a time which was perhaps less a feast of reason than a flow of soul the truth is there was nothing but careless stories carelessly told and jokes and laughing and a great deal of mere laughing without the jokes the whole as unlike the ideal of a literary symposium as well might be but there was present one who met with that pleasant boston company for the first time and to whom harte attributed a superstition of boston seriousness not realized then and there look at him he said from time to time this is the dream of his life and then shouted and choked with fun at the difference between the occasion and the expectation he would have imagined in his commensals mind at a dinner long after in london where several of the commensals of that time met again with other literary friends of a like age and stature harte laid his arms well along their shoulders as they formed in a halfcircle before him and screamed out in mocking mirth at the bulbous favor to which the slim shapes of the earlier date had come the sight was not less a rapture to him that he was himself the prey of the same practical joke from the passing years the hair which the years had wholly swept from some of those thoughtful brows or left spindling autumnal spears or few or none to shake against the cold had whitened to a wintry snow on his while his mustache had kept its youthful black he looks one of his friends said to another as they walked home together like a french marquis of the ancien regime yes the other assented thoughtfully or like an american actor made up for the part  the saying closely fitted the outward fact but was of a subtle injustice in its implication of anything histrionic in hartes nature never was any man less a poseur he made simply and helplessly known what he was at any and every moment and he would join the witness very cheerfully in enjoying whatever was amusing in the disadvantage to himself in the course of events which were in his case so very human it came about on a subsequent visit of his to boston that an impatient creditor decided to right himself out of the proceeds of the lecture which was to be given and had the law corporeally present at the house of the friend where harte dined and in the anteroom at the lecturehall and on the platform where the lecture was delivered with beautiful aplomb and untroubled charm he was indeed the only one privy to the laws presence who was not the least affected by it so that when his host of an earlier time ventured to suggest well harte this is the old literary tradition this is the fleet business over again he joyously smote his thigh and crowed out yes the fleet no doubt he tasted all the delicate humor of the situation and his pleasure in it was quite unaffected  if his temperament was not adapted to the harsh conditions of the elder american world it might very well be that his temperament was not altogether in the wrong if it disabled him for certain experiences of life it was the source of what was most delightful in his personality and perhaps most beautiful in his talent it enabled him to do such things as he did without being at all anguished for the things he did not do and indeed could not his talent was not a facile gift he owned that he often went day after day to his desk and sat down before that yellow postoffice paper on which he liked to write his literature in that exquisitely refined script of his without being able to inscribe a line it may be owned for him that though he came to the east at thirtyfour which ought to have been the very prime of his powers he seemed to have arrived after the age of observation was past for him he saw nothing aright either in newport where he went to live or in new york where he sojourned or on those lecturing tours which took him about the whole country or if he saw it aright he could not report it aright or would not after repeated and almost invariable failures to deal with the novel characters and circumstances which he encountered he left off trying and frankly went back to the semimythical california he had half discovered half created and wrote bret harte over and over as long as he lived this whether he did it from instinct or from reason was the best thing he could do and it went as nearly as might be to satisfy the insatiable english fancy for the wild america no longer to be found on our map  it is imaginable of harte that this temperament defended him from any bitterness in the disappointment he may have shared with that simple american public which in the early eighteenseventies expected any and everything of him in fiction and drama the long breath was not his he could not write a novel though he produced the like of one or two and his plays were too bad for the stage or else too good for it at any rate they could not keep it even when they got it and they denoted the fatigue or the indifference of their author in being dramatizations of his longer or shorter fictions and not originally dramatic efforts the direction in which his originality lasted longest and most strikingly affirmed his power was in the direction of his verse  whatever minds there may be about hartes fiction finally there can hardly be more than one mind about his poetry he was indeed a poet whether he wrote what drolly called itself dialect or wrote language he was a poet of a fine and fresh touch it must be allowed him that in prose as well he had the inventive gift but he had it in verse far more importantly there are lines phrases turns in his poems characterizations and pictures which will remain as enduringly as anything american if that is not saying altogether too little for them in poetry he rose to all the occasions he made for himself though he could not rise to the occasions made for him and so far failed in the demands he acceded to for a phi beta kappa poem as to come to that august harvard occasion with a jingle so trivial so out of keeping so inadequate that his enemies if he ever truly had any must have suffered from it almost as much as his friends he himself did not suffer from his failure from having read before the most elect assembly of the country a poem which would hardly have served the careless needs of an informal dinner after the speaking had begun he took the whole disastrous business lightly gayly leniently kindly as that golden temperament of his enabled him to take all the good or bad of life  the first year of his eastern sojourn was salaried in a sum which took the souls of all his young contemporaries with wonder if no baser passion in the days when dollars were of so much farther flight than now but its net result in a literary return to his publishers was one story and two or three poems they had not profited much by his book which it will doubtless amaze a time of fifty thousand editions selling before their publication to learn had sold only thirtyfive hundred in the sixth month of its career as harte himself       with sick and scornful looks averse  confided to his cambridge host after his first interview with the boston countingroom it was the volume which contained the luck of roaring camp and the other early tales which made him a continental and then an all but a worldwide fame stories that had been talked over and laughed over and cried over all up and down the land that had been received with acclaim by criticism almost as boisterous as their popularity and recognized as the promise of greater things than any done before in their kind came to no more than this pitiful figure over the booksellers counters it argued much for the publishers that in spite of this stupefying result they were willing they were eager to pay him ten thousand dollars for whatever however much or little he chose to write in a year their offer was made in boston after some offers mortifyingly mean and others insultingly vague had been made in new york  it was not his fault that their venture proved of such slight return in literary material harte was in the midst of new and alien conditionssee a corollary in m froude who visited the us for a few months and then published a comprehensive analysis of the nation and its people twains rebuttal mr froudes progress would have been a propos for harte in cambridge dwand he had always his temperament against him as well as the reluctant if not the niggard nature of his muse he would no doubt have been only too glad to do more than he did for the money but actually if not literally he could not do more when it came to literature all the gay improvidence of life forsook him and he became a stern rigorous exacting selfmaster who spared himself nothing to achieve the perfection at which he aimed he was of the order of literary men like goldsmith and de quincey and sterne and steele in his relations with the outer world but in his relations with the inner world he was one of the most duteous and exemplary citizens there was nothing of his easygoing hilarity in that world there he was of a puritanic severity and of a conscience that forgave him no pang other california writers have testified to the fidelity with which he did his work as editor he made himself not merely the arbiter but the inspiration of his contributors and in a region where literature had hardly yet replaced the wild sagebrush of frontier journalism he made the sandlots of san francisco to blossom as the rose and created a literary periodical of the first class on the borders of civilization  it is useless to wonder now what would have been his future if the publisher of the overland monthly had been of imagination or capital enough to meet the demand which harte dimly intimated to his cambridge host as the condition of his remaining in california publishers men with sufficient capital are of a greatly varying gift in the regions of prophecy and he of the overland monthly was not to be blamed if he could not foresee his account in paying harte ten thousand a year to continue editing the magazine he did according to his lights and harte came to the east and then went to england where his last twentyfive years were passed in cultivating the wild plant of his pacific slope discovery it was always the same plant leaf and flower and fruit but it perennially pleased the constant english world and thence the european world though it presently failed of much delighting these fastidious states probably he would have done something else if he could he did not keep on doing the wild miningcamp thing because it was the easiest but because it was for him the only possible thing very likely he might have preferred not doing anything     iv  the joyous visit of a week which has been here so poorly recovered from the past came to an end and the host went with his guest to the station in as much vehicular magnificence as had marked his going to meet him there harte was no longer the alarming portent of the earlier time but an experience of unalloyed delight you must love a person whose worst troublegiving was made somehow a favor by his own unconsciousness of the trouble and it was a most flattering triumph to have got him in time or only a little late to so many luncheons and dinners if only now he could be got to the train in time the victory would be complete the happiness of the visit without a flaw success seemed to crown the fondest hope in this respect the train had not yet left the station there stood the parlorcar which harte had seats in and he was followed aboard for those last words in which people try to linger out pleasures they have known together in this case the sweetest of the pleasures had been sitting up late after those dinners and talking them over and then degenerating from that talk into the mere giggle and making giggle which charles lamb found the best thing in life it had come to this as the host and guest sat together for those parting moments when harte suddenly started up in the discovery of having forgotten to get some cigars they rushed out of the train together and after a wild descent upon the cigarcounter of the restaurant harte rushed back to his car but by this time the train was already moving with that deceitful slowness of the departing train and harte had to clamber up the steps of the rearmost platform his host clambered after to make sure that he was aboard which done he dropped to the ground while harte drew out of the station blandly smiling and waving his hand with a cigar in it in picturesque farewell from the platform  then his host realized that he had dropped to the ground barely in time to escape being crushed against the side of the archway that sharply descended beside the steps of the train and he went and sat down in that handsomest hack and was for a moment deathly sick at the danger that had not realized itself to him in season to be sure he was able long after to adapt the incident to the exigencies of fiction and to have a character not otherwise to be conveniently disposed of actually crushed to death between a moving train and such an archway  besides he had then and always afterward the immense supercompensation of the memories of that visit from one of the most charming personalities in the world       in lifes morning march when his bosom was young  and when infinitely less would have sated him now death has come to join its vague conjectures to the broken expectations of life and that blithe spirit is elsewhere but nothing can take from him who remains the witchery of that most winning presence still it looks smiling from the platform of the car and casts a farewell of mock heartbreak from it still a gay laugh comes across the abysm of the years that are now numbered and out of somewhere the hearers sense is rapt with the mellow cordial of a voice that was like no other  this last paragraph reminds one again that as with holmes a great poet writes the best prose dw     my mark twain     i  it was in the little office of james t fields over the bookstore of ticknor  fields at 124 tremont street boston that i first met my friend of now fortyfour years samuel l clemens mr fields was then the editor of the atlantic monthly and i was his proud and glad assistant with a pretty free hand as to manuscripts and an unmanacled command of the booknotices at the end of the magazine i wrote nearly all of them myself and in 1869 i had written rather a long notice of a book just winning its way to universal favor in this review i had intimated my reservations concerning the innocents abroad but i had the luck if not the sense to recognize that it was such fun as we had not had before i forget just what i said in praise of it and it does not matter it is enough that i praised it enough to satisfy the author he now signified as much and he stamped his gratitude into my memory with a story wonderfully allegorizing the situation which the mock modesty of print forbids my repeating here throughout my long acquaintance with him his graphic touch was always allowing itself a freedom which i cannot bring my fainter pencil to illustrate he had the southwestern the lincolnian the elizabethan breadth of parlance which i suppose one ought not to call coarse without calling ones self prudish and i was often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion i could not bear to burn them and i could not after the first reading quite bear to look at them i shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that in it he was shakespearian or if his ghost will not suffer me the word then he was baconian  at the time of our first meeting which must have been well toward the winter clemens as i must call him instead of mark twain which seemed always somehow to mask him from my personal sense was wearing a sealskin coat with the fur out in the satisfaction of a caprice or the love of strong effect which he was apt to indulge through life i do not know what droll comment was in fieldss mind with respect to this garment but probably he felt that here was an original who was not to be brought to any bostonian book in the judgment of his vivid qualities with his crest of dense red hair and the wide sweep of his flaming mustache clemens was not discordantly clothed in that sealskin coat which afterward in spite of his own warmth in it sent the cold chills through me when i once accompanied it down broadway and shared the immense publicity it won him he had always a relish for personal effect which expressed itself in the white suit of complete serge which he wore in his last years and in the oxford gown which he put on for every possible occasion and said he would like to wear all the time that was not vanity in him but a keen feeling for costume which the severity of our modern tailoring forbids men though it flatters women to every excess in it yet he also enjoyed the shock the offence the pang which it gave the sensibilities of others then there were times he played these pranks for pure fun and for the pleasure of the witness once i remember seeing him come into his drawingroom at hartford in a pair of white cowskin slippers with the hair out and do a crippled colored uncle to the joy of all beholders or i must not say all for i remember also the dismay of mrs clemens and her low despairing cry of oh youth that was her name for him among their friends and it fitted him as no other would though i fancied with her it was a shrinking from his baptismal samuel or the vernacular sam of his earlier companionships he was a youth to the end of his days the heart of a boy with the head of a sage the heart of a good boy or a bad boy but always a wilful boy and wilfulest to show himself out at every time for just the boy he was     ii  there is a gap in my recollections of clemens which i think is of a year or two for the next thing i remember of him is meeting him at a lunch in boston given us by that genius of hospitality the tragically destined ralph keeler author of one of the most unjustly forgotten books vagabond adventures a true bit of picaresque autobiography keeler never had any money to the general knowledge and he never borrowed and he could not have had credit at the restaurant where he invited us to feast at his expense there was t b aldrich there was j t fields much the oldest of our company who had just freed himself from the trammels of the publishing business and was feeling his freedom in every word there was bret harte who had lately come east in his princely progress from california and there was clemens nothing remains to me of the happy time but a sense of idle and aimless and joyful talkplay beginning and ending nowhere of eager laughter of countless good stories from fields of a heatlightning shimmer of wit from aldrich of an occasional concentration of our joint mockeries upon our host who took it gladly and amid the discourse so little improving but so full of good fellowship bret hartes fleeting dramatization of clemenss mental attitude toward a symposium of boston illuminates why fellows he spluttered this is the dream of marks life and i remember the glance from under clemenss feathery eyebrows which betrayed his enjoyment of the fun we had beefsteak with mushrooms which in recognition of their shape aldrich hailed as shoepegs and to crown the feast we had an omelette souse which the waiter brought in as flat as a pancake amid our shouts of congratulations to poor keeler who took them with appreciative submission it was in every way what a boston literary lunch ought not to have been in the popular ideal which harte attributed to clemens  our next meeting was at hartford or rather at springfield where clemens greeted us on the way to hartford aldrich was going on to be his guest and i was going to be charles dudley warners but clemens had come part way to welcome us both in the good fellowship of that cordial neighborhood we had two such days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round there was constant running in and out of friendly houses where the lively hosts and guests called one another by their christian names or nicknames and no such vain ceremony as knocking or ringing at doors clemens was then building the stately mansion in which he satisfied his love of magnificence as if it had been another sealskin coat and he was at the crest of the prosperity which enabled him to humor every whim or extravagance the house was the design of that most original artist edward potter who once when hard pressed by incompetent curiosity for the name of his style in a certain church proposed that it should be called the english violet order of architecture and this house was so absolutely suited to the owners humor that i suppose there never was another house like it but its character must be for recognition farther along in these reminiscences the vividest impression which clemens gave us two ravenous young boston authors was of the satisfying the surfeiting nature of subscription publication an army of agents was overrunning the country with the prospectuses of his books and delivering them by the scores of thousands in completed sale of the innocents abroad he said it sells right along just like the bible and roughing it was swiftly following without perhaps ever quite overtaking it in popularity but he lectured aldrich and me on the folly of that mode of publication in the trade which we had thought it the highest success to achieve a chance in anything but subscription publication is printing for private circulation he maintained and he so won upon our greed and hope that on the way back to boston we planned the joint authorship of a volume adapted to subscription publication we got a very good name for it as we believed in memorable murders and we never got farther with it but by the time we reached boston we were rolling in wealth so deep that we could hardly walk home in the frugal fashion by which we still thought it best to spare car fare carriage fare we did not dream of even in that opulence     iii  the visits to hartford which had begun with this affluence continued without actual increase of riches for me but now i went alone and in warners european and egyptian absences i formed the habit of going to clemens by this time he was in his new house where he used to give me a royal chamber on the ground floor and come in at night after i had gone to bed to take off the burglar alarm so that the family should not be roused if anybody tried to get in at my window this would be after we had sat up late he smoking the last of his innumerable cigars and soothing his tense nerves with a mild hot scotch while we both talked and talked and talked of everything in the heavens and on the earth and the waters under the earth after two days of this talk i would come away hollow realizing myself best in the image of one of those locustshells which you find sticking to the bark of trees at the end of summer once after some such bout of brains we went down to new york together and sat facing each other in the pullman smoker without passing a syllable till we had occasion to say well were there then with our installation in a now vanished hotel the old brunswick to be specific the talk began again with the inspiration of the novel environment and went on and on we wished to be asleep but we could not stop and he lounged through the rooms in the long nightgown which he always wore in preference to the pajamas which he despised and told the story of his life the inexhaustible the fairy the arabian nights story which i could never tire of even when it began to be told over again or at times he would reason high         of providence foreknowledge will and fate         fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute  walking up and down and halting now and then with a fine toss and slant of his shaggy head as some bold thought or splendid joke struck him  he was in those days a constant attendant at the church of his great friend the rev joseph h twichell and at least tacitly far from the entire negation he came to at last i should say he had hardly yet examined the grounds of his passive acceptance of his wifes belief for it was hers and not his and he held it unscanned in the beautiful and tender loyalty to her which was the most moving quality of his most faithful soul i make bold to speak of the love between them because without it i could not make him known to others as he was known to me it was a greater part of him than the love of most men for their wives and she merited all the worship he could give her all the devotion all the implicit obedience by her surpassing force and beauty of character she was in a way the loveliest person i have ever seen the gentlest the kindest without a touch of weakness she united wonderful tact with wonderful truth and clemens not only accepted her rule implicitly but he rejoiced he gloried in it i am not sure that he noticed all her goodness in the actions that made it a heavenly vision to others he so had the habit of her goodness but if there was any forlorn and helpless creature in the room mrs clemens was somehow promptly at his side or hers she was always seeking occasion of kindness to those in her household or out of it she loved to let her heart go beyond the reach of her hand and imagined the whole hard and suffering world with compassion for its structural as well as incidental wrongs i suppose she had her ladyhood limitations her female fears of etiquette and convention but she did not let them hamper the wild and splendid generosity with which clemens rebelled against the social stupidities and cruelties she had been a lifelong invalid when he met her and he liked to tell the beautiful story of their courtship to each new friend whom he found capable of feeling its beauty or worthy of hearing it naturally her father had hesitated to give her into the keeping of the young strange westerner who had risen up out of the unknown with his giant reputation of burlesque humorist and demanded guaranties demanded proofs he asked me clemens would say if i couldnt give him the names of people who knew me in california and when it was time to hear from them i heard from him well mr clemens he said nobody seems to have a very good word for you i hadnt referred him to people that i thought were going to whitewash me i thought it was all up with me but i was disappointed so i guess i shall have to back you myself  whether this made him faithfuler to the trust put in him i cannot say but probably not it was always in him to be faithful to any trust and in proportion as a trust of his own was betrayed he was ruthlessly and implacably resentful but i wish now to speak of the happiness of that household in hartford which responded so perfectly to the ideals of the mother when the three daughters so lovely and so gifted were yet little children there had been a boy and yes i killed him clemens once said with the unsparing selfblame in which he would wreak an unavailing regret he meant that he had taken the child out imprudently and the child had taken the cold which he died of but it was by no means certain this was through its fathers imprudence i never heard him speak of his son except that once but no doubt in his deep heart his loss was irreparably present he was a very tender father and delighted in the minds of his children but he was wise enough to leave their training altogether to the wisdom of their mother he left them to that in everything keeping for himself the pleasure of teaching them little scenes of drama learning languages with them and leading them in singing they came to the table with their parents and could have set him an example in behavior when in moments of intense excitement he used to leave his place and walk up and down the room flying his napkin and talking and talking  it was after his first english sojourn that i used to visit him and he was then full of praise of everything english the english personal independence and public spirit and hospitality and truth he liked to tell stories in proof of their virtues but he was not blind to the defects of their virtues their submissive acceptance of caste their callousness with strangers their bluntness with one another mrs clemens had been in a way to suffer socially more than he and she praised the english less she had sat after dinner with ladies who snubbed and ignored one another and left her to find her own amusement in the absence of the attention with which americans perhaps cloy their guests but which she could not help preferring in their successive sojourns among them i believe he came to like the english less and she more the fine delight of his first acceptance among them did not renew itself till his oxford degree was given him then it made his cup run over and he was glad the whole world should see it  his wife would not chill the ardor of his early anglomania and in this as in everything she wished to humor him to the utmost no one could have realized more than she his essential fineness his innate nobleness marriages are what the parties to them alone really know them to be but from the outside i should say that this marriage was one of the most perfect it lasted in his absolute devotion to the day of her death that delayed long in cruel suffering and that left one side of him in lasting night from florence there came to me heartbreaking letters from him about the torture she was undergoing and at last a letter saying she was dead with the simplehearted cry i wish i was with livy i do not know why i have left saying till now that she was a very beautiful woman classically regular in features with black hair smooth over her forehead and with tenderly peering myopia eyes always behind glasses and a smile of angelic kindness but this kindness went with a sense of humor which qualified her to appreciate the selflawed genius of a man who will be remembered with the great humorists of all time with cervantes with swift or with any others worthy his company none of them was his equal in humanity     iv  clemens had appointed himself with the architects connivance a luxurious study over the library in his new house but as his children grew older this study with its carved and cushioned armchairs was given over to them for a schoolroom and he took the room above his stable which had been intended for his coachman there we used to talk together when we were not walking and talking together until he discovered that he could make a more commodious use of the billiardroom at the top of his house for the purposes of literature and friendship it was pretty cold up there in the early spring and late fall weather with which i chiefly associate the place but by lighting up all the gasburners and kindling a reluctant fire on the hearth we could keep it well above freezing clemens could also push the balls about and without rivalry from me who could no more play billiards than smoke could win endless games of pool while he carried points of argument against imaginable differers in opinion here he wrote many of his tales and sketches and for anything i know some of his books i particularly remember his reading me here his first rough sketch of captain stormfields visit to heaven with the real name of the captain whom i knew already from his many stories about him  we had a peculiar pleasure in looking off from the high windows on the pretty hartford landscape and down from them into the tops of the trees clothing the hillside by which his house stood we agreed that there was a novel charm in trees seen from such a vantage far surpassing that of the farther scenery he had not been a country boy for nothing rather he had been a country boy or still better a village boy for everything that nature can offer the young of our species and no aspect of her was lost on him we were natives of the same vast mississippi valley and missouri was not so far from ohio but that we were akin in our first knowledges of woods and fields as we were in our early parlance i had outgrown the use of mine through my greater bookishness but i gladly recognized the phrases which he employed for their lasting juiciness and the longremembered savor they had on his mental palate  i have elsewhere sufficiently spoken of his unsophisticated use of words of the diction which forms the backbone of his manly style if i mention my own greater bookishness by which i mean his less quantitative reading it is to give myself better occasion to note that he was always reading some vital book it might be some outoftheway book but it had the root of the human matter in it a volume of great trials one of the supreme autobiographies a signal passage of history a narrative of travel a story of captivity which gave him life at firsthand as i remember he did not care much for fiction and in that sort he had certain distinct loathings there were certain authors whose names he seemed not so much to pronounce as to spew out of his mouth goldsmith was one of these but his prime abhorrence was my dear and honored prime favorite jane austen he once said to me i suppose after he had been reading some of my unsparing praises of heri am always praising her you seem to think that woman could write and he forbore withering me with his scorn apparently because we had been friends so long and he more pitied than hated me for my bad taste he seemed not to have any preferences among novelists or at least i never heard him express any he used to read the modern novels i praised in or out of print but i do not think he much liked reading fiction as for plays he detested the theatre and said he would as lief do a sum as follow a plot on the stage he could not or did not give any reasons for his literary abhorrences and perhaps he really had none but he could have said very distinctly if he had needed why he liked the books he did i was away at the time of his great browning passion and i know of it chiefly from hearsay but at the time tolstoy was doing what could be done to make me over clemens wrote that man seems to have been to you what browning was to me i do not know that he had other favorites among the poets but he had favorite poems which he liked to read to you and he read of course splendidly i have forgotten what piece of john hays it was that he liked so much but i remembered how he fiercely revelled in the vengefulness of william morriss sir guy of the dolorous blast and how he especially exalted in the lines which tell of the supposed speakers joy in slaying the murderer of his brother         i am threescore years and ten         and my hair is nigh turned gray         but i am glad to think of the moment when         i took his life away  generally i fancy his pleasure in poetry was not great and i do not believe he cared much for the conventionally accepted masterpieces of literature he liked to find out good things and great things for himself sometimes he would discover these in a masterpiece new to him alone and then if you brought his ignorance home to him he enjoyed it and enjoyed it the more the more you rubbed it in  of all the literary men i have known he was the most unliterary in his make and manner i do not know whether he had any acquaintance with latin but i believe not the least german he knew pretty well and italian enough late in life to have fun with it but he used english in all its alien derivations as if it were native to his own air as if it had come up out of american out of missourian ground his style was what we know for good and for bad but his manner if i may difference the two was as entirely his own as if no one had ever written before i have noted before this how he was not enslaved to the consecutiveness in writing which the rest of us try to keep chained to that is he wrote as he thought and as all men think without sequence without an eye to what went before or should come after if something beyond or beside what he was saying occurred to him he invited it into his page and made it as much at home there as the nature of it would suffer him then when he was through with the welcoming of this casual and unexpected guest he would go back to the company he was entertaining and keep on with what he had been talking about he observed this manner in the construction of his sentences and the arrangement of his chapters and the ordering or disordering of his compilationsnowhere is this characteristic better found than in twains autobiography it was not a style it was unselfconscious thought dwi helped him with a library of humor which he once edited and when i had done my work according to tradition with authors times and topics carefully studied in due sequence he tore it all apart and chucked the pieces in wherever the fancy for them took him at the moment he was right we were not making a textbook but a book for the pleasure rather than the instruction of the reader and he did not see why the principle on which he built his travels and reminiscences and tales and novels should not apply to it and i do not now see either though at the time it confounded me on minor points he was beyond any author i have known without favorite phrases or pet words he utterly despised the avoidance of repetitions out of fear of tautology if a word served his turn better than a substitute he would use it as many times in a page as he chose     v  at that time i had become editor of the atlantic monthly and i had allegiances belonging to the conduct of what was and still remains the most scrupulously cultivated of our periodicals when clemens began to write for it he came willingly under its rules for with all his wilfulness there never was a more biddable man in things you could show him a reason for he never made the least of that trouble which so abounds for the hapless editor from narrowerminded contributors if you wanted a thing changed very good he changed it if you suggested that a word or a sentence or a paragraph had better be struck out very good he struck it out his proofsheets came back each a veritable mush of concession as emerson says now and then he would try a little stronger language than the atlantic had stomach for and once when i sent him a proof i made him observe that i had left out the profanity he wrote back mrs clemens opened that proof and lit into the room with danger in her eye what profanity you see when i read the manuscript to her i skipped that it was part of his joke to pretend a violence in that gentlest creature which the more amusingly realized the situation to their friends  i was always very glad of him and proud of him as a contributor but i must not claim the whole merit or the first merit of having him write for us it was the publisher the late h o houghton who felt the incongruity of his absence from the leading periodical of the country and was always urging me to get him to write i will take the credit of being eager for him but it is to the publishers credit that he tried so far as the modest traditions of the atlantic would permit to meet the expectations in pay which the colossal profits of clemenss books might naturally have bred in him whether he was really able to do this he never knew from clemens himself but probably twenty dollars a page did not surfeit the author of books that sold right along just like the bible  we had several short contributions from clemens first all of capital quality and then we had the series of papers which went mainly to the making of his great book life on the mississippi upon the whole i have the notion that clemens thought this his greatest book and he was supported in his opinion by that of the portier in his hotel at vienna and that of the german emperor who as he told me with equal respect for the preference of each united in thinking it his best with such farsundered social poles approaching in its favor he apparently found himself without standing for opposition at any rate the papers won instant appreciation from his editor and publisher and from the readers of their periodical which they expected to prosper beyond precedent in its circulation but those were days of simpler acceptance of the popular rights of newspapers than these are when magazines strictly guard their vested interests against them the new york times and the st louis democrat profited by the advance copies of the magazine sent them to reprint the papers month by month together they covered nearly the whole reading territory of the union and the terms of their daily publication enabled them to anticipate the magazine in its own restricted field its subscription list was not enlarged in the slightest measure and the atlantic monthly languished on the newsstands as undesired as ever     vi  it was among my later visits to hartford that we began to talk up the notion of collaborating a play but we did not arrive at any clear intention and it was a telegram out of the clear sky that one day summoned me from boston to help with a continuation of colonel sellers i had been a witness of the high joy of clemens in the prodigious triumph of the first colonel sellers which had been dramatized from the novel of the gilded age this was the joint work of clemens and charles dudley warner and the story had been put upon the stage by some one in utah whom clemens first brought to book in the courts for violation of his copyright and then indemnified for such rights as his adaptation of the book had given him the structure of the play as john t raymond gave it was substantially the work of this unknown dramatist clemens never pretended to me at any rate that he had the least hand in it he frankly owned that he was incapable of dramatization yet the vital part was his for the characters in the play were his as the book embodied them and the success which it won with the public was justly his this he shared equally with the actor following the company with an agent who counted out the authors share of the gate money and sent him a note of the amount every day by postal card the postals used to come about dinnertime and clemens would read them aloud to us in wild triumph  one hundred and fifty dollarstwo hundred dollarsthree hundred dollars were the gay figures which they bore and which he flaunted in the air before he sat down at table or rose from it to brandish and then flinging his napkin into his chair walked up and down to exult in  byandby the popularity of the play waned and the time came when he sickened of the whole affair and withdrew his agent and took whatever gain from it the actor apportioned him he was apt to have these sudden surceases following upon the intensities of his earlier interest though he seemed always to have the notion of making something more of colonel sellers but when i arrived in hartford in answer to his summons i found him with no definite idea of what he wanted to do with him i represented that we must have some sort of plan and he agreed that we should both jot down a scenario overnight and compare our respective schemes the next morning as the author of a large number of little plays which have been privately presented throughout the united states and in parts of the united kingdom without ever getting upon the public stage except for the noble ends of charity and then promptly getting off it i felt authorized to make him observe that his scheme was as nearly nothing as chaos could be he agreed hilariously with me and was willing to let it stand in proof of his entire dramatic inability at the same time he liked my plot very much which ultimated sellers according to clemenss intention as a man crazed by his own inventions and by his superstition that he was the rightful heir to an english earldom the exuberant nature of sellers and the vast range of his imagination served our purpose in other ways clemens made him a spiritualist whose specialty in the occult was materialization he became on impulse an ardent temperance reformer and he headed a procession of temperance ladies after disinterestedly testing the deleterious effects of liquor upon himself until he could not walk straight always he wore a marvellous fireextinguisher strapped on his back to give proof in any emergency of the effectiveness of his invention in that way  we had a jubilant fortnight in working the particulars of these things out it was not possible for clemens to write like anybody else but i could very easily write like clemens and we took the play scene and scene about quite secure of coming out in temperamental agreement the characters remained for the most part his and i varied them only to make them more like his than if possible he could several years after when i looked over a copy of the play i could not always tell my work from his i only knew that i had done certain scenes we would work all day long at our several tasks and then at night before dinner read them over to each other no dramatists ever got greater joy out of their creations and when i reflect that the public never had the chance of sharing our joy i pity the public from a full heart i still believe that the play was immensely funny i still believe that if it could once have got behind the footlights it would have continued to pack the house before them for an indefinite succession of nights but this may be my fondness  at any rate it was not to be raymond had identified himself with sellers in the playgoing imagination and whether consciously or unconsciously we constantly worked with raymond in our minds but before this time bitter displeasures had risen between clemens and raymond and clemens was determined that raymond should never have the play he first offered it to several other actors who eagerly caught it only to give it back with the despairing renunciation that is a raymond play we tried managers with it but their only question was whether they could get raymond to do it in the mean time raymond had provided himself with a play for the wintera very good play by demarest lloyd and he was in no hurry for ours perhaps he did not really care for it perhaps he knew when he heard of it that it must come to him in the end in the end it did from my hand for clemens would not meet him i found him in a mood of sweet reasonableness perhaps the more softened by one of those lunches which our publisher the hospitable james r osgood was always bringing people together over in boston he said that he could not do the play that winter but he was sure that he should like it and he had no doubt he would do it the next winter so i gave him the manuscript in spite of clemenss charges for his suspicions and rancors were such that he would not have had me leave it for a moment in the actors hands but it seemed a conclusion that involved success and fortune for us in due time but i do not remember how long after raymond declared himself delighted with the piece he entered into a satisfactory agreement for it and at the beginning of the next season he started with it to buffalo where he was to give a first production at rochester he paused long enough to return it with the explanation that a friend had noted to him the fact that colonel sellers in the play was a lunatic and insanity was so serious a thing that it could not be represented on the stage without outraging the sensibilities of the audience or words to that effect we were too far off to allege hamlet to the contrary or king lear or to instance the delight which generations of readers throughout the world had taken in the mad freaks of don quixote whatever were the real reasons of raymond for rejecting the play we had to be content with those he gave and to set about getting it into other hands in this effort we failed even more signally than before if that were possible at last a clever and charming elocutionist who had long wished to get himself on the stage heard of it and asked to see it we would have shown it to any one by this time and we very willingly showed it to him he came to hartford and did some scenes from it for us i must say he did them very well quite as well as raymond could have done them in whose manner he did them but now late toward spring the question was where he could get an engagement with the play and we ended by hiring a theatre in new york for a week of trial performances  clemens came on with me to boston where we were going to make some changes in the piece and where we made them to our satisfaction but not to the effect of that high rapture which we had in the first draft he went back to hartford and then the cold fit came upon me and in visions of the night in slumberings upon the bed ghastly forms of failure appalled me and when i rose in the morning i wrote him here is a play which every manager has put outofdoors and which every actor known to us has refused and now we go and give it to an elocutioner we are fools whether clemens agreed with me or not in my conclusion he agreed with me in my premises and we promptly bought our play off the stage at a cost of seven hundred dollars which we shared between us but clemens was never a man to give up i relinquished gratis all right and title i had in the play and he paid its entire expenses for a week of onenight stands in the country it never came to new york and yet i think now that if it had come it would have succeeded so hard does the faith of the unsuccessful dramatist in his work die     vii  there is an incident of this time so characteristic of both men that i will yield to the temptation of giving it here after i had gone to hartford in response to clemenss telegram matthew arnold arrived in boston and one of my family called on his to explain why i was not at home to receive his introduction i had gone to see mark twain oh but he doesnt like that sort of thing does he he likes mr clemens very much my representative answered and he thinks him one of the greatest men he ever knew i was still clemenss guest at hartford when arnold came there to lecture and one night we went to meet him at a reception while his hand laxly held mine in greeting i saw his eyes fixed intensely on the other side of the room whowho in the world is that i looked and said oh that is mark twain i do not remember just how their instant encounter was contrived by arnolds wish but i have the impression that they were not parted for long during the evening and the next night arnold as if still under the glamour of that potent presence was at clemenss house i cannot say how they got on or what they made of each other if clemens ever spoke of arnold i do not recall what he said but arnold had shown a sense of him from which the incredulous sniff of the polite world now so universally exploded had already perished it might well have done so with his first dramatic vision of that prodigious head clemens was then hard upon fifty and he had kept as he did to the end the slender figure of his youth but the ashes of the burntout years were beginning to gray the fires of that splendid shock of red hair which he held to the height of a stature apparently greater than it was and tilted from side to side in his undulating walk he glimmered at you from the narrow slits of fine bluegreenish eyes under branching brows which with age grew more and more like a sort of plumage and he was apt to smile into your face with a subtle but amiable perception and yet with a sort of remote absence you were all there for him but he was not all there for you     viii  i shall not try to give chronological order to my recollections of him but since i am just now with him in hartford i will speak of him in association with the place once when i came on from cambridge he followed me to my room to see that the water was not frozen in my bath or something of the kind for it was very cold weather and then hospitably lingered not to lose time in banalities i began at once from the thread of thought in my mind i wonder why we hate the past so and he responded from the depths of his own consciousness its so damned humiliating which is what any man would say of his past if he were honest but honest men are few when it comes to themselves clemens was one of the few and the first of them among all the people i have known i have known i suppose men as truthful but not so promptly so absolutely so positively so almost aggressively truthful he could lie of course and did to save others from grief or harm he was not stupidly truthful but his first impulse was to say out the thing and everything that was in him to those who can understand it will not be contradictory of his sense of humiliation from the past that he was not ashamed for anything he ever did to the point of wishing to hide it he could be and he was bitterly sorry for his errors which he had enough of in his life but he was not ashamed in that mean way what he had done he owned to good bad or indifferent and if it was bad he was rather amused than troubled as to the effect in your mind he would not obtrude the fact upon you but if it were in the way of personal history he would not dream of withholding it far less of hiding it  he was the readiest of men to allow an error if he were found in it in one of our walks about hartford when he was in the first fine flush of his agnosticism he declared that christianity had done nothing to improve morals and conditions and that the world under the highest pagan civilization was as well off as it was under the highest christian influences i happened to be fresh from the reading of charles loring braces gesta christi or history of humane progress and i could offer him abundant proofs that he was wrong he did not like that evidently but he instantly gave way saying he had not known those things later he was more tolerant in his denials of christianity but just then he was feeling his freedom from it and rejoicing in having broken what he felt to have been the shackles of belief worn so long he greatly admired robert ingersoll whom he called an angelic orator and regarded as an evangel of a new gospelthe gospel of free thought he took the warmest interest in the newspaper controversy raging at the time as to the existence of a hell when the noes carried the day i suppose that no enemy of perdition was more pleased he still loved his old friend and pastor mr twichell but he no longer went to hear him preach his sage and beautiful sermons and was i think thereby the greater loser long before that i had asked him if he went regularly to church and he groaned out oh yes i go it most kills me but i go and i did not need his telling me to understand that he went because his wife wished it he did tell me after they both ceased to go that it had finally come to her saying well if you are to be lost i want to be lost with you he could accept that willingness for supreme sacrifice and exult in it because of the supreme truth as he saw it after they had both ceased to be formal christians she was still grieved by his denial of immortality so grieved that he resolved upon one of those heroic lies which for loves sake he held above even the truth and he went to her saying that he had been thinking the whole matter over and now he was convinced that the soul did live after death it was too late her keen vision pierced through his ruse as it did when he brought the doctor who had diagnosticated her case as organic disease of the heart and after making him go over the facts of it again with her made him declare it merely functional  to make an end of these records as to clemenss beliefs so far as i knew them i should say that he never went back to anything like faith in the christian theology or in the notion of life after death or in a conscious divinity it is best to be honest in this matter he would have hated anything else and i do not believe that the truth in it can hurt any one at one period he argued that there must have been a cause a conscious source of things that the universe could not have come by chance i have heard also that in his last hours or moments he said or his dearest ones hoped he had said something about meeting again but the expression of which they could not be certain was of the vaguest and it was perhaps addressed to their tenderness out of his tenderness all his expressions to me were of a courageous renunciation of any hope of living again or elsewhere seeing those he had lost he suffered terribly in their loss and he was not fool enough to try ignoring his grief he knew that for this there were but two medicines that it would wear itself out with the years and that meanwhile there was nothing for it but those respites in which the mourner forgets himself in slumber i remember that in a black hour of my own when i was called down to see him as he thought from sleep he said with an infinite an exquisite compassion oh did i wake you did i wake you nothing more but the look the voice were everything and while i live they cannot pass from my sense     ix  he was the most caressing of men in his pity but he had the fine instinct which would have pleased lowell of never putting his hands on youfine delicate hands with taper fingers and pink nails like a girls and sensitively quivering in moments of emotion he did not paw you with them to show his affection as so many of us americans are apt to do among the halfdozen or halfhundred personalities that each of us becomes i should say that clemenss central and final personality was something exquisite his casual acquaintance might know him perhaps from his fierce intensity his wild pleasure in shocking people with his ribaldries and profanities or from the mere need of loosing his rebellious spirit in that way as anything but exquisite and yet that was what in the last analysis he was they might come away loathing or hating him but one could not know him well without realizing him the most serious the most humane the most conscientious of men he was southwestern and born amid the oppression of a race that had no rights as against ours but i never saw a man more regardful of negroes he had a yellow butler when i first began to know him because he said he could not bear to order a white man about but the terms of his ordering george were those of the softest entreaty which command ever wore he loved to rely upon george who was such a broken reed in some things though so stanch in others and the fervent republican in politics that clemens then liked him to be he could interpret clemenss meaning to the public without conveying his mood and could render his roughest answer smooth to the person denied his presence his general instructions were that this presence was to be denied all but personal friends but the soft heart of george was sometimes touched by importunity and once he came up into the billiardroom saying that mr smith wished to see clemens upon inquiry mr smith developed no ties of friendship and clemens said you go and tell mr smith that i wouldnt come down to see the twelve apostles george turned from the threshold where he had kept himself and framed a paraphrase of this message which apparently sent mr smith away content with himself and all the rest of the world  the part of him that was western in his southwestern origin clemens kept to the end but he was the most desouthernized southerner i ever knew no man more perfectly sensed and more entirely abhorred slavery and no one has ever poured such scorn upon the secondhand walterscotticized pseudochivalry of the southern ideal he held himself responsible for the wrong which the white race had done the black race in slavery and he explained in paying the way of a negro student through yale that he was doing it as his part of the reparation due from every white to every black man he said he had never seen this student nor ever wished to see him or know his name it was quite enough that he was a negro about that time a colored cadet was expelled from west point for some point of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and there was the usual shabby philosophy in a portion of the press to the effect that a negro could never feel the claim of honor the man was fifteen parts white but oh yes clemens said with bitter irony it was that one part black that undid him it made him a nigger and incapable of being a gentleman it was to blame for the whole thing the fifteen parts white were guiltless  clemens was entirely satisfied with the result of the civil war and he was eager to have its facts and meanings brought out at once in history he ridiculed the notion held by many that it was not yet time to philosophize the events of the great struggle that we must wait till its passions had cooled and the clouds of strife had cleared away he maintained that the time would never come when we should see its motives and men and deeds more clearly and that now now was the hour to ascertain them in lasting verity picturesquely and dramatically he portrayed the imbecility of deferring the inquiry at any point to the distance of future years when inevitably the facts would begin to put on fable  he had powers of sarcasm and a relentless rancor in his contempt which those who knew him best appreciated most the late noah brooks who had been in california at the beginning of clemenss career and had witnessed the effect of his ridicule before he had learned to temper it once said to me that he would rather have any one else in the world down on him than mark twain but as clemens grew older he grew more merciful not to the wrong but to the men who were in it the wrong was often the source of his wildest drolling he considered it in such hopelessness of ever doing it justice that his despair broke in laughter     x  i go back to that house in hartford where i was so often a happy guest with tenderness for each of its endearing aspects over the chimney in the library which had been cured of smoking by so much art and science clemens had written in perennial brass the words of emerson the ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it and he gave his guests a welcome of the simplest and sweetest cordiality but i must not go aside to them from my recollections of him which will be of sufficient garrulity if i give them as fully as i wish the windows of the library looked northward from the hillside above which the house stood and over the little valley with the stream in it and they showed the leaves of the trees that almost brushed them as in a claude lorraine glass to the eastward the diningroom opened amply and to the south there was a wide hall where the voices of friends made themselves heard as they entered without ceremony and answered his joyous hail at the west was a little semicircular conservatory of a pattern invented by mrs harriet beecher stowe and adopted in most of the houses of her kindly neighborhood the plants were set in the ground and the flowering vines climbed up the sides and overhung the roof above the silent spray of a fountain companied by callas and other waterloving lilies there while we breakfasted patrick came in from the barn and sprinkled the pretty bower which poured out its responsive perfume in the delicate accents of its varied blossoms breakfast was clemenss best meal and he sat longer at his steak and coffee than at the courses of his dinner luncheon was nothing to him unless as might happen he made it his dinner and reserved the later repast as the occasion of walking up and down the room and discoursing at large on anything that came into his head like most good talkers he liked other people to have their say he did not talk them down he stopped instantly at anothers remark and gladly or politely heard him through he even made believe to find suggestion or inspiration in what was said his children came to the table as i have told and after dinner he was apt to join his fine tenor to their trebles in singing  fully half our meetings were at my house in cambridge where he made himself as much at home as in hartford he would come ostensibly to stay at the parker house in boston and take a room where he would light the gas and leave it burning after dressing while he drove out to cambridge and stayed two or three days with us once i suppose it was after a lecture he came in evening dress and passed twentyfour hours with us in that guise wearing an overcoat to hide it when we went for a walk sometimes he wore the slippers which he preferred to shoes at home and if it was muddy as it was wont to be in cambridge he would put a pair of rubbers over them for our rambles he liked the lawlessness and our delight in allowing it and he rejoiced in the confession of his hostess after we had once almost worn ourselves out in our pleasure with the intense talk with the stories and the laughing that his coming almost killed her but it was worth it  in those days he was troubled with sleeplessness or rather with reluctant sleepiness and he had various specifics for promoting it at first it had been champagne just before going to bed and we provided that but later he appeared from boston with four bottles of lagerbeer under his arms lagerbeer he said now was the only thing to make you go to sleep and we provided that still later on a visit i paid him at hartford i learned that hot scotch was the only soporific worth considering and scotchwhiskey duly found its place on our sideboard one day very long afterward i asked him if he were still taking hot scotch to make him sleep he said he was not taking anything for a while he had found going to bed on the bathroom floor a soporific then one night he went to rest in his own bed at ten oclock and had gone promptly to sleep without anything he had done the like with the like effect ever since of course it amused him there were few experiences of life grave or gay which did not amuse him even when they wronged him  he came on to cambridge in april 1875 to go with me to the centennial ceremonies at concord in celebration of the battle of the minute men with the british troops a hundred years before we both had special invitations including passage from boston but i said why bother to go into boston when we could just as well take the train for concord at the cambridge station he equally decided that it would be absurd so we breakfasted deliberately and then walked to the station reasoning of many things as usual when the train stopped we found it packed inside and out people stood dense on the platforms of the cars to our startled eyes they seemed to project from the windows and unless memory betrays me they lay strewn upon the roofs like brakemen slain at the post of duty  whether this was really so or not it is certain that the train presented an impenetrable front even to our imagination and we left it to go its way without the slightest effort to board we remounted the fameworn steps of porters station and began exploring north cambridge for some means of transportation overland to concord for we were that far on the road by which the british went and came on the day of the battle the liverymen whom we appealed to received us some with compassion some with derision but in either mood convinced us that we could not have hired a cat to attempt our conveyance much less a horse or vehicle of any description it was a raw windy day very unlike the exceptionally hot april day when the routed redcoats pursued by the colonials fled panting back to boston with their tongues hanging out like dogs but we could not take due comfort in the vision of their discomfiture we could almost envy them for they had at least got to concord a swift procession of coaches carriages and buggies all going to concord passed us inert and helpless on the sidewalk in the peculiarly cold mud of north cambridge we began to wonder if we might not stop one of them and bribe it to take us but we had not the courage to try and clemens seized the opportunity to begin suffering with an acute indigestion which gave his humor a very dismal cast i felt keenly the shame of defeat and the guilt of responsibility for our failure and when a gay party of students came toward us on the top of a tally ho luxuriously empty inside we felt that our chance had come and our last chance he said that if i would stop them and tell them who i was they would gladly perhaps proudly give us passage i contended that if with his far vaster renown he would approach them our success would be assured while we stood lost in this contest of civilities the coach passed us with gay notes blown from the horns of the students and then clemens started in pursuit encouraged with shouts from the merry party who could not imagine who was trying to run them down to a rivalry in speed the unequal match could end only in one way and i am glad i cannot recall what he said when he came back to me since then i have often wondered at the grief which would have wrung those blithe young hearts if they could have known that they might have had the company of mark twain to concord that day and did not  we hung about unavailingly in the bitter wind a while longer and then slowly very slowly made our way home we wished to pass as much time as possible in order to give probability to the deceit we intended to practise for we could not bear to own ourselves baffled in our boasted wisdom of taking the train at porters station and had agreed to say that we had been to concord and got back even after coming home to my house we felt that our statement would be wanting in verisimilitude without further delay and we crept quietly into my library and made up a roaring fire on the hearth and thawed ourselves out in the heat of it before we regained our courage for the undertaking with all these precautions we failed for when our statement was imparted to the proposed victim she instantly pronounced it unreliable and we were left with it on our hands intact i think the humor of this situation was finally a greater pleasure to clemens than an actual visit to concord would have been only a few weeks before his death he laughed our defeat over with one of my family in bermuda and exulted in our prompt detection     xi  from our joint experience in failing i argue that clemenss affection for me must have been great to enable him to condone in me the final defection which was apt to be the end of our enterprises i have fancied that i presented to him a surface of such entire trustworthiness that he could not imagine the depths of unreliability beneath it and that never realizing it he always broke through with fresh surprise but unimpaired faith he liked beyond all things to push an affair to the bitter end and the end was never too bitter unless it brought grief or harm to another once in a telegraph office at a railway station he was treated with such insolent neglect by the young lady in charge who was preoccupied in a flirtation with a gentleman friend that emulous of the public spirit which he admired in the english he told her he should report her to her superiors and probably to her astonishment he did so he went back to hartford and in due time the poor girl came to me in terror and in tears for i had abetted clemens in his action and had joined my name to his in his appeal to the authorities she was threatened with dismissal unless she made full apology to him and brought back assurance of its acceptance i felt able to give this and of course he eagerly approved i think he telegraphed his approval another time some years afterward we sat down together in places near the end of a car and a brakeman came in looking for his official notebook clemens found that he had sat down upon it and handed it to him the man scolded him very abusively and came back again and again still scolding him for having no more sense than to sit down on a notebook the patience of clemens in bearing it was so angelic that i saw fit to comment i suppose you will report this fellow yes he answered slowly and sadly thats what i should have done once but now i remember that he gets twenty dollars a month  nothing could have been wiser nothing tenderer and his humanity was not for humanity alone he abhorred the dull and savage joy of the sportsman in a lucky shot an unerring aim and once when i met him in the country he had just been sickened by the success of a gunner in bringing down a blackbird and he described the poor stricken glossy thing how it lay throbbing its life out on the grass with such pity as he might have given a wounded child i find this a fit place to say that his mind and soul were with those who do the hard work of the world in fear of those who give them a chance for their livelihoods and underpay them all they can he never went so far in socialism as i have gone if he went that way at all but he was fascinated with looking backward and had bellamy to visit him and from the first he had a luminous vision of organized labor as the only present help for workingmen he would show that side with such clearness and such force that you could not say anything in hopeful contradiction he saw with that relentless insight of his that with unions was the workingmans only present hope of standing up like a man against money and the power of it there was a time when i was afraid that his eyes were a little holden from the truth but in the very last talk i heard from him i found that i was wrong and that this great humorist was as great a humanist as ever i wish that all the workfolk could know this and could know him their friend in life as he was in literature as he was in such a glorious gospel of equality as the connecticut yankee in king arthurs court     xii  whether i will or no i must let things come into my story thoughtwise as he would have let them for i cannot remember them in their order one night while we were giving a party he suddenly stormed in with a friend of his and mine mr twichell and immediately began to eat and drink of our supper for they had come straight to our house from walking to boston or so great a part of the way as to be ahungered and athirst i can see him now as he stood up in the midst of our friends with his head thrown back and in his hand a dish of those escalloped oysters without which no party in cambridge was really a party exulting in the tale of his adventure which had abounded in the most original characters and amusing incidents at every mile of their progress they had broken their journey with a nights rest and they had helped themselves lavishly out by rail in the last half but still it had been a mighty walk to do in two days clemens was a great walker in those years and was always telling of his tramps with mr twichell to talcotts tower ten miles out of hartford as he walked of course he talked and of course he smoked whenever he had been a few days with us the whole house had to be aired for he smoked all over it from breakfast to bedtime he always went to bed with a cigar in his mouth and sometimes mindful of my fire insurance i went up and took it away still burning after he had fallen asleep i do not know how much a man may smoke and live but apparently he smoked as much as a man could for he smoked incessantly  he did not care much to meet people as i fancied and we were greedy of him for ourselves he was precious to us and i would not have exposed him to the critical edge of that cambridge acquaintance which might not have appreciated him at say his transatlantic value in america his popularity was as instant as it was vast but it must be acknowledged that for a much longer time here than in england polite learning hesitated his praise in england rank fashion and culture rejoiced in him lord mayors lord chief justices and magnates of many kinds were his hosts he was desired in country houses and his bold genius captivated the favor of periodicals which spurned the rest of our nation but in his own country it was different in proportion as people thought themselves refined they questioned that quality which all recognize in him now but which was then the inspired knowledge of the simplehearted multitude i went with him to see longfellow but i do not think longfellow made much of him and lowell made less he stopped as if with the long semitic curve of clemenss nose which in the indulgence of his passion for finding every one more or less a jew he pronounced unmistakably racial it was two of my most fastidious cambridge friends who accepted him with the english the european entiretynamely charles eliot norton and professor francis j child norton was then newly back from a long sojourn abroad and his judgments were delocalized he met clemens as if they had both been in england and rejoiced in his bold freedom from environment and in the rich variety and boundless reach of his talk child was of a personal liberty as great in its fastidious way as that of clemens himself and though he knew him only at second hand he exulted in the most audacious instance of his grotesquery as i shall have to tell byandby almost solely i cannot say just why clemens seemed not to hit the favor of our community of scribes and scholars as bret harte had done when he came on from california and swept them before him disrupting their dinners and delaying their lunches with impunity but it is certain he did not and i had better say so  i am surprised to find from the bibliographical authorities that it was so late as 1875 when he came with the manuscript of tom sawyer and asked me to read it as a friend and critic and not as an editor i have an impression that this was at mrs clemenss instance in his own uncertainty about printing it she trusted me i can say with a satisfaction few things now give me to be her husbands true and cordial adviser and i was so i believe i never failed him in this part though in so many of our enterprises and projects i was false as water through my temperamental love of backing out of any undertaking i believe this never ceased to astonish him and it has always astonished me it appears to me quite out of character though it is certain that an undertaking when i have entered upon it holds me rather than i it but however this immaterial matter may be i am glad to remember that i thoroughly liked tom sawyer and said so with every possible amplification very likely i also made my suggestions for its improvement i could not have been a real critic without that and i have no doubt they were gratefully accepted and i hope never acted upon i went with him to the horsecar station in harvard square as my frequent wont was and put him aboard a car with his ms in his hand stayed and reassured so far as i counted concerning it i do not know what his misgivings were perhaps they were his wifes misgivings for she wished him to be known not only for the wild and boundless humor that was in him but for the beauty and tenderness and natural piety and she would not have had him judged by a too close fidelity to the rude conditions of tom sawyers life this is the meaning that i read into the fact of his coming to me with those doubts     xiii  clemens had then and for many years the habit of writing to me about what he was doing and still more of what he was experiencing nothing struck his imagination in or out of the daily routine but he wished to write me of it and he wrote with the greatest fulness and a lavish dramatization sometimes to the length of twenty or forty pages so that i have now perhaps fifteen hundred pages of his letters they will no doubt some day be published but i am not even referring to them in these records which i think had best come to the reader with an old mans falterings and uncertainties with his frequent absences and my own abroad and the intrusion of calamitous cares the rich tide of his letters was more and more interrupted at times it almost ceased and then it would come again a torrent in the very last weeks of his life he burst forth and though too weak himself to write he dictated his rage with me for recommending to him a certain author whose truthfulness he could not deny but whom he hated for his truthfulness to sordid and ugly conditions at heart clemens was romantic and he would have had the world of fiction stately and handsome and whatever the real world was not but he was not romanticistic and he was too helplessly an artist not to wish his own work to show life as he had seen it i was preparing to rap him back for these letters when i read that he had got home to die he would have liked the rapping back  he liked coming to boston especially for those luncheons and dinners in which the fertile hospitality of our publisher osgood abounded he dwelt equidistant from boston and new york and he had special friends in new york but he said he much preferred coming to boston of late years he never went there and he had lost the habit of it long before he came home from europe to live in new york at these feasts which were often of afterdinnerspeaking measure he could always be trusted for something of amazing delightfulness once when osgood could think of no other occasion for a dinner he gave himself a birthday dinner and asked his friends and authors the beautiful and splendid trooperlike blaring was there and i recall how in the long rambling speech in which clemens went round the table hitting every head at it and especially visiting osgood with thanks for his ingenious pretext for our entertainment he congratulated blaring upon his engineering genius and his hypnotic control of municipal governments he said that if there was a plan for draining a city at a cost of a million by seeking the level of the water in the downhill course of the sewers blaring would come with a plan to drain that town uphill at twice the cost and carry it through the common council without opposition it is hard to say whether the time was gladder at these dinners or at the small lunches at which osgood and aldrich and i foregathered with him and talked the afternoon away till well toward the winter twilight  he was a great figure and the principal figure at one of the first of the now wornout authors readings which was held in the boston museum to aid a longfellow memorial it was the late george parsons lathrop everybody seems to be late in these sad days who imagined the reading but when it came to a price for seats i can always claim the glory of fixing it at five dollars the price if not the occasion proved irresistible and the museum was packed from the floor to the topmost gallery norton presided and when it came clemenss turn to read he introduced him with such exquisite praises as he best knew how to give but before he closed he fell a prey to one of those lapses of tact which are the peculiar peril of people of the greatest tact he was reminded of darwins delight in mark twain and how when he came from his long days exhausting study and sank into bed at midnight he took up a volume of mark twain whose books he always kept on a table beside him and whatever had been his tormenting problem or excess of toil he felt secure of a good nights rest from it a sort of blank ensued which clemens filled in the only possible way he said he should always be glad that he had contributed to the repose of that great man whom science owed so much and then without waiting for the joy in every breast to burst forth he began to read it was curious to watch his triumph with the house his carefully studied effects would reach the first rows in the orchestra first and ripple in laughter back to the standees against the wall and then with a fine resurgence come again to the rear orchestra seats and so rise from gallery to gallery till it fell back a cataract of applause from the topmost rows of seats he was such a practised speaker that he knew all the stops of that simple instrument man and there is no doubt that these results were accurately intended from his unerring knowledge he was the most consummate public performer i ever saw and it was an incomparable pleasure to hear him lecture on the platform he was the great and finished actor which he probably would not have been on the stage he was fond of private theatricals and liked to play in them with his children and their friends in dramatizations of such stories of his as the prince and the pauper but i never saw him in any of these scenes when he read his manuscript to you it was with a thorough however involuntary recognition of its dramatic qualities he held that an actor added fully half to the character the author created with my own hurried and halfhearted reading of passages which i wished to try on him from unprinted chapters say out of the undiscovered country or a modern instance he said frankly that my reading could spoil anything he was realistic but he was essentially histrionic and he was rightly so what we have strongly conceived we ought to make others strongly imagine and we ought to use every genuine art to that end     xiv  there came a time when the lecturing which had been the joy of his prime became his loathing loathing unutterable and when he renounced it with indescribable violence yet he was always hankering for those fleshpots whose savor lingered on his palate and filled his nostrils after his withdrawal from the platform the authors readings when they had won their brief popularity abounded in suggestion for him reading from ones book was not so bad as giving a lecture written for a lectures purpose and he was willing at last to compromise he had a magnificent scheme for touring the country with aldrich and mr g w cable and myself in a private car with a cook of our own and every facility for living on the fat of the land we should read only four times a week in an entertainment that should not last more than an hour and a half he would be the impresario and would guarantee us others at least seventyfive dollars a day and pay every expense of the enterprise which he provisionally called the circus himself but aldrich and i were now no longer in those earlier thirties when we so cheerfully imagined memorable murders for subscription publication we both abhorred public appearances and at any rate i was going to europe for a year so the plan fell through except as regarded mr cable who in his way was as fine a performer as clemens and could both read and sing the matter of his books on a far less stupendous scale they two made the rounds of the great lecturing circuit together but i believe a famous lecturemanager had charge of them and travelled with them  he was a most sanguine man a most amiable person and such a believer in fortune that clemens used to say of him as he said of one of his early publishers that you could rely upon fifty per cent of everything he promised i myself many years later became a follower of this hopeful prophet and i can testify that in my case at least he was able to keep ninetynine and even a hundred per cent of his word it was i who was much nearer failing of mine for i promptly began to lose sleep from the nervous stress of my lecturing and from the gratifying but killing receptions afterward and i was truly in that state from insomnia which clemens recognized in the brief letter i got from him in the western city after half a dozen wakeful nights he sardonically congratulated me on having gone into the lecture field and then he said i know where you are now you are in hell  it was this perdition which he reentered when he undertook that roundtheworld lecturing tour for the payment of the debts left to him by the bankruptcy of his firm in the publishing business it was not purely perdition for him or rather it was perdition for only onehalf of him the authorhalf for the actorhalf it was paradise the author who takes up lecturing without the ability to give histrionic support to the literary reputation which he brings to the crude test of his readers eyes and ears invokes a peril and a misery unknown to the lecturer who has made his first public from the platform clemens was victorious on the platform from the beginning and it would be folly to pretend that he did not exult in his triumphs there but i suppose with the wearing nerves of middle life he hated more and more the personal swarming of interest upon him and all the inevitable clatter of the thing yet he faced it and he labored round our tiresome globe that he might pay the uttermost farthing of debts which he had not knowingly contracted the debts of his partners who had meant well and done ill not because they were evil but because they were unwise and as unfit for their work as he was pay what thou owest that is right even when thou owest it by the error of others and even when thou owest it to a bank which had not lent it from love of thee but in the hard line of business and thy need  clemenss behavior in this matter redounded to his glory among the nations of the whole earth and especially in this nation so wrapped in commerce and so little used to honor among its many thieves he had behaved like walter scott as millions rejoiced to know who had not known how walter scott had behaved till they knew it was like clemens no doubt it will be put to his credit in the books of the recording angel but what the judge of all the earth will say of it at the last day there is no telling i should not be surprised if he accounted it of less merit than some other things that clemens did and was less than his abhorrence of the spanish war and the destruction of the southafrican republics and our deceit of the filipinos and his hate of slavery and his payment of his portion of our races debt to the race of the colored student whom he saw through college and his support of a poor artist for three years in paris and his loan of opportunity to the youth who became the most brilliant of our actordramatists and his eager pardon of the thoughtless girl who was near paying the penalty of her impertinence with the loss of her place and his remembering that the insolent brakeman got so few dollars a month and his sympathy for workingmen standing up to money in their unions and even his pity for the wounded bird throbbing out its little life on the grass for the pleasure of the cruel fool who shot it these and the thousand other charities and beneficences in which he abounded openly or secretly may avail him more than the discharge of his firms liabilities with the judge of all the earth who surely will do right but whose measures and criterions no man knows and i least of all men  he made no great show of sympathy with people in their anxieties but it never failed and at a time when i lay sick for many weeks his letters were of comfort to those who feared i might not rise again his hand was out in help for those who needed help and in kindness for those who needed kindness there remains in my mind the dreary sense of a long long drive to the uttermost bounds of the south end at boston where he went to call upon some obscure person whose claim stretched in a lengthening chain from his early days in missouria most inadequate person in whose vacuity the gloom of the dull day deepened till it was almost too deep for tears he bore the ordeal with grim heroism and silently smoked away the sense of it as we drove back to cambridge in his slippered feet sombrely musing sombrely swearing but he knew he had done the right the kind thing and he was content he came the whole way from hartford to go with me to a friendless play of mine which alessandro salvini was giving in a series of matinees to houses never enlarging themselves beyond the count of the brave two hundred who sat it through and he stayed my fainting spirit with a cheer beyond flagons joining me in my joke at the misery of it and carrying the fun farther  before that he had come to witness the aesthetic suicide of anna dickinson who had been a flaming light of the political platform in the war days and had been left by them consuming in a hapless ambition for the theatre the poor girl had had a play written especially for her and as anne boleyn she ranted and exhorted through the five acts drawing ever nearer the utter defeat of the anticlimax we could hardly look at each other for pity clemens sitting there in the box he had taken with his shaggy head out over the corner and his slippered feet curled under him he either went to a place in his slippers or he carried them with him and put them on as soon as he could put off his boots when it was so that we could not longer follow her failure and live he began to talk of the absolute close of her career which the thing was and how probably she had no conception that it was the end he philosophized the mercifulness of the fact and of the ignorance of most of us when mortally sick or fatally wounded we think it is not the end because we have never ended before and we do not see how we can end some can push by the awful hour and live again but for anna dickinson there could be and was no such palingenesis of course we got that solemn joy out of reading her fate aright which is the compensation of the wise spectator in witnessing the inexorable doom of others     xv  when messrs houghton  mifflin became owners of the atlantic monthly mr houghton fancied having some breakfasts and dinners which should bring the publisher and the editor face to face with the contributors who were bidden from far and near of course the subtle fiend of advertising who has now grown so unblushing bold lurked under the covers at these banquets and the junior partner and the young editor had their joint and separate fine anguishes of misgiving as to the taste and the principle of them but they were really very simplehearted and honestly meant hospitalities and they prospered as they ought and gave great pleasure and no pain i forget some of the emergent occasions but i am sure of a birthday dinner most unexpectedly accepted by whittier and a birthday luncheon to mrs stowe and i think a birthday dinner to longfellow but the passing years have left me in the dark as to the pretext of that supper at which clemens made his awful speech and came so near being the death of us all at the breakfasts and luncheons we had the pleasure of our lady contributors company but that night there were only men and because of our great strength we survived  i suppose the year was about 1879 but here the almanac is unimportant and i can only say that it was after clemens had become a very valued contributor of the magazine where he found himself to his own great explicit satisfaction he had jubilantly accepted our invitation and had promised a speech which it appeared afterward he had prepared with unusual care and confidence it was his custom always to think out his speeches mentally wording them and then memorizing them by a peculiar system of mnemonics which he had invented on the dinnertable a certain succession of knife spoon saltcellar and butterplate symbolized a train of ideas and on the billiardtable a ball a cue and a piece of chalk served the same purpose with a diagram of these printed on the brain he had full command of the phrases which his excogitation had attached to them and which embodied the ideas in perfect form he believed he had been particularly fortunate in his notion for the speech of that evening and he had worked it out in joyous selfreliance it was the notion of three tramps three deadbeats visiting a california miningcamp and imposing themselves upon the innocent miners as respectively ralph waldo emerson henry wadsworth longfellow and oliver wendell holmes the humor of the conception must prosper or must fail according to the mood of the hearer but clemens felt sure of compelling this to sympathy and he looked forward to an unparalleled triumph  but there were two things that he had not taken into account one was the species of religious veneration in which these men were held by those nearest them a thing that i should not be able to realize to people remote from them in time and place they were men of extraordinary dignity of the thing called presence for want of some clearer word so that no one could well approach them in a personally light or trifling spirit i do not suppose that anybody more truly valued them or more piously loved them than clemens himself but the intoxication of his fancy carried him beyond the bounds of that regard and emboldened him to the other thing which he had not taken into accountnamely the immense hazard of working his fancy out before their faces and expecting them to enter into the delight of it if neither emerson nor longfellow nor holmes had been there the scheme might possibly have carried but even this is doubtful for those who so devoutly honored them would have overcome their horror with difficulty and perhaps would not have overcome it at all  the publisher with a modesty very ungrateful to me had abdicated his office of host and i was the hapless president fulfilling the abhorred function of calling people to their feet and making them speak when i came to clemens i introduced him with the cordial admiring i had for him as one of my greatest contributors and dearest friends here i said in sum was a humorist who never left you hanging your head for having enjoyed his joke and then the amazing mistake the bewildering blunder the cruel catastrophe was upon us i believe that after the scope of the burlesque made itself clear there was no one there including the burlesquer himself who was not smitten with a desolating dismay there fell a silence weighing many tons to the square inch which deepened from moment to moment and was broken only by the hysterical and bloodcurdling laughter of a single guest whose name shall not be handed down to infamy nobody knew whether to look at the speaker or down at his plate i chose my plate as the least affliction and so i do not know how clemens looked except when i stole a glance at him and saw him standing solitary amid his appalled and appalling listeners with his joke dead on his hands from a first glance at the great three whom his jest had made its theme i was aware of longfellow sitting upright and regarding the humorist with an air of pensive puzzle of holmes busily writing on his menu with a wellfeigned effect of preoccupation and of emerson holding his elbows and listening with a sort of jovian oblivion of this nether world in that lapse of memory which saved him in those later years from so much bother clemens must have dragged his joke to the climax and left it there but i cannot say this from any sense of the fact of what happened afterward at the table where the immense the wholly innocent the truly unimagined affront was offered i have no longer the least remembrance i next remember being in a room of the hotel where clemens was not to sleep but to toss in despair and charles dudley warners saying in the gloom well mark youre a funny fellow it was as well as anything else he could have said but clemens seemed unable to accept the tribute  i stayed the night with him and the next morning after a haggard breakfast we drove about and he made some purchases of bricabrac for his house in hartford with a soul as far away from bricabrac as ever the soul of man was he went home by an early train and he lost no time in writing back to the three divine personalities which he had so involuntarily seemed to flout they all wrote back to him making it as light for him as they could i have heard that emerson was a good deal mystified and in his sublime forgetfulness asked who was this gentleman who appeared to think he had offered him some sort of annoyance but i am not sure that this is accurate what i am sure of is that longfellow a few days after in my study stopped before a photograph of clemens and said ah he is a wag and nothing more holmes told me with deep emotion such as a brother humorist might well feel that he had not lost an instant in replying to clemenss letter and assuring him that there had not been the least offence and entreating him never to think of the matter again he said that he was a fool but he was gods fool holmes quoted from the letter with a true sense of the pathos and the humor of the selfabasement  to me clemens wrote a week later it doesnt get any better it burns like fire but now i understand that it was not shame that burnt but rage for a blunder which he had so incredibly committed that to have conceived of those men the most dignified in our literature our civilization as impersonable by three hoboes and then to have imagined that he could ask them personally to enjoy the monstrous travesty was a break he saw too late for which there was no repair yet the time came and not so very long afterward when some mention was made of the incident as a mistake and he said with all his fierceness but i dont admit that it was a mistake and it was not so in the minds of all witnesses at second hand the morning after the dreadful dinner there came a glowing note from professor child who had read the newspaper report of it praising clemenss burlesque as the richest piece of humor in the world and betraying no sense of incongruity in its perpetration in the presence of its victims i think it must always have ground in clemenss soul that he was the prey of circumstances and that if he had some more favoring occasion he could retrieve his loss in it by giving the thing the right setting not more than two or three years ago he came to try me as to trying it again at a meeting of newspaper men in washington i had to own my fears while i alleged childs note on the other hand but in the end he did not try it with the newspaper men i do not know whether he has ever printed it or not but since the thing happened i have often wondered how much offence there really was in it i am not sure but the horror of the spectators read more indignation into the subjects of the hapless drolling than they felt but it must have been difficult for them to bear it with equanimity to be sure they were not themselves mocked the joke was of course beside them nevertheless their personality was trifled with and i could only end by reflecting that if i had been in their place i should not have liked it myself clemens would have liked it himself for he had the heart for that sort of wild play and he so loved a joke that even if it took the form of a liberty and was yet a good joke he would have loved it but perhaps this burlesque was not a good joke     xvi  clemens was oftenest at my house in cambridge but he was also sometimes at my house in belmont when after a year in europe we went to live in boston he was more rarely with us we could never be long together without something out of the common happening and one day something far out of the common happened which fortunately refused the nature of absolute tragedy while remaining rather the saddest sort of comedy we were looking out of my library window on that view of the charles which i was so proud of sharing with my allbutnextdoor neighbor doctor holmes when another friend who was with us called out with curiously impersonal interest oh see that woman getting into the water this would have excited curiosity and alarmed anxiety far less lively than ours and clemens and i rushed downstairs and out through my basement and back gate at the same time a coachman came out of a stable next door and grappled by the shoulders a woman who was somewhat deliberately getting down the steps to the water over the face of the embankment before we could reach them he had pulled her up to the driveway and stood holding her there while she crazily grieved at her rescue as soon as he saw us he went back into his stable and left us with the poor wild creature on our hands she was not very young and not very pretty and we could not have flattered ourselves with the notion of anything romantic in her suicidal mania but we could take her on the broad human level and on this we proposed to escort her up beacon street till we could give her into the keeping of one of those kindly policemen whom our neighborhood knew naturally there was no policeman known to us or unknown the whole way to the public garden we had to circumvent our charge in her present design of drowning herself and walk her past the streets crossing beacon to the river at these points it needed considerable reasoning to overcome her wish and some active manoeuvring in both of us to enforce our arguments nobody else appeared to be interested and though we did not court publicity in the performance of the duty so strangely laid upon us still it was rather disappointing to be so entirely ignored  there are some four or five crossings to the river between 302 beacon street and the public garden and the suggestions at our command were pretty well exhausted by the time we reached it still the expected policeman was nowhere in sight but a brilliant thought occurred to clemens he asked me where the nearest police station was and when i told him he started off at his highest speed leaving me in sole charge of our hapless ward all my powers of suasion were now taxed to the utmost and i began attracting attention as a short stout gentleman in early middle life endeavoring to distrain a respectable female of her personal liberty when his accomplice had abandoned him to his wicked design after a much longer time than i thought i should have taken to get a policeman from the station clemens reappeared in easy conversation with an officer who had probably realized that he was in the company of mark twain and was in no hurry to end the interview he took possession of our captive and we saw her no more i now wonder that with our joint instinct for failure we ever got rid of her but i am sure we did and few things in life have given me greater relief when we got back to my house we found the friend we had left there quite unruffled and not much concerned to know the facts of our adventure my impression is that he had been taking a nap on my lounge he appeared refreshed and even gay but if i am inexact in these details he is alive to refute me     xvii  a little after this clemens went abroad with his family and lived several years in germany his letters still came but at longer intervals and the thread of our intimate relations was inevitably broken he would write me when something i had written pleased him or when something signal occurred to him or some political or social outrage stirred him to wrath and he wished to free his mind in pious profanity during this sojourn he came near dying of pneumonia in berlin and he had slight relapses from it after coming home in berlin also he had the honor of dining with the german emperor at the table of a cousin married to a high officer of the court clemens was a man to enjoy such a distinction he knew how to take it as a delegated recognition from the german people but as coming from a rather cockahoop sovereign who had as yet only his sovereignty to value himself upon he was not very proud of it he expressed a quiet disdain of the event as between the imperiality and himself on whom it was supposed to confer such glory crowning his life with the topmost leaf of laurel he was in the same mood in his account of an english dinner many years before where there was a little scotch lord present to whom the english tacitly referred clemenss talk and laughed when the lord laughed and were grave when he failed to smile of all the men i have known he was the farthest from a snob though he valued recognition and liked the flattery of the fashionable fair when it came in his way he would not go out of his way for it but like most able and brilliant men he loved the minds of women their wit their agile cleverness their sensitive perception their humorous appreciation the saucy things they would say and their pretty temerarious defiances he had of course the keenest sense of what was truly dignified and truly undignified in people but he was not really interested in what we call society affairs they scarcely existed for him though his books witness how he abhorred the dreadful fools who through some chance of birth or wealth hold themselves different from other men  commonly he did not keep things to himself especially dislikes and condemnations upon most current events he had strong opinions and he uttered them strongly after a while he was silent in them but if you tried him you found him in them still he was tremendously worked up by a certain famous trial as most of us were who lived in the time of it he believed the accused guilty but when we met some months after it was over and i tempted him to speak his mind upon it he would only say the man had suffered enough as if the man had expiated his wrong and he was not going to do anything to renew his penalty i found that very curious very delicate his continued blame could not come to the sufferers knowledge but he felt it his duty to forbear it  he was apt to wear himself out in the vehemence of his resentments or he had so spent himself in uttering them that he had literally nothing more to say you could offer clemens offences that would anger other men and he did not mind he would account for them from human nature but if he thought you had in any way played him false you were anathema and maranatha forever yet not forever perhaps for by andby after years he would be silent there were two men half a generation apart in their succession whom he thought equally atrocious in their treason to him and of whom he used to talk terrifyingly even after they were out of the world he went farther than heine who said that he forgave his enemies but not till they were dead clemens did not forgive his dead enemies their death seemed to deepen their crimes like a base evasion or a cowardly attempt to escape he pursued them to the grave he would like to dig them up and take vengeance upon their clay so he said but no doubt he would not have hurt them if he had had them living before him he was generous without stint he trusted without measure but where his generosity was abused or his trust betrayed he was a fire of vengeance a consuming flame of suspicion that no sprinkling of cool patience from others could quench it had to burn itself out he was eagerly and lavishly hospitable but if a man seemed willing to batten on him or in any way to lie down upon him clemens despised him unutterably in his frenzies of resentment or suspicion he would not and doubtless could not listen to reason but if between the paroxysms he were confronted with the facts he would own them no matter how much they told against him at one period he fancied that a certain newspaper was hounding him with biting censure and poisonous paragraphs and he was filling himself up with wrath to be duly discharged on the editors head later he wrote me with a humorous joy in his mistake that warner had advised him to have the paper watched for these injuries he had done so and how many mentions of him did i reckon he had found in three months just two and they were rather indifferent than unfriendly so the paper was acquitted and the editors life was spared the wretch never knew how near he was to losing it with incredible preliminaries of obloquy and a subsequent devotion to lasting infamy  his memory for favors was as good as for injuries and he liked to return your friendliness with as loud a band of music as could be bought or bribed for the occasion all that you had to do was to signify that you wanted his help when my father was consul at toronto during arthurs administration he fancied that his place was in danger and he appealed to me in turn i appealed to clemens bethinking myself of his friendship with grant and grants friendship with arthur i asked him to write to grant in my fathers behalf but no he answered me i must come to hartford and we would go on to new york together and see grant personally this was before and long before clemens became grants publisher and splendid benefactor but the men liked each other as such men could not help doing clemens made the appointment and we went to find grant in his business office that place where his business innocence was afterward so betrayed he was very simple and very cordial and i was instantly the more at home with him because his voice was the soft rounded ohio river accent to which my years were earliest used from my steamboating uncles my earliest heroes when i stated my business he merely said oh no that must not be he would write to mr arthur and he did so that day and my father lived to lay down his office when he tired of it with no urgence from above  it is not irrelevant to clemens to say that grant seemed to like finding himself in company with two literary men one of whom at least he could make sure of and unlike that silent man he was reputed he talked constantly and so far as he might he talked literature at least he talked of john phoenix that delightfulest of the early pacific slope humorists whom he had known under his real name of george h derby when they were fellowcadets at west point it was mighty pretty as pepys would say to see the delicate deference clemens paid our plain hero and the manly respect with which he listened while grant talked his luncheon was brought in from some unassuming restaurant near by and he asked us to join him in the baked beans and coffee which were served us in a little room out of the office with about the same circumstance as at a railroad refreshmentcounter the baked beans and coffee were of about the railroadrefreshment quality but eating them with grant was like sitting down to baked beans and coffee with julius caesar or alexander or some other great plutarchan captain one of the highest satisfactions of clemenss often supremely satisfactory life was his relation to grant it was his proud joy to tell how he found grant about to sign a contract for his book on certainly very good terms and said to him that he would himself publish the book and give him a percentage three times as large he said grant seemed to doubt whether he could honorably withdraw from the negotiation at that point but clemens overbore his scruples and it was his unparalleled privilege his princely pleasure to pay the author a far larger check for his work than had ever been paid to an author before he valued even more than this splendid opportunity the sacred moments in which their business brought him into the presence of the slowly dying heroically living man whom he was so befriending and he told me in words which surely lost none of their simple pathos through his report how grant described his suffering  the prosperity of this venture was the beginning of clemenss adversity for it led to excesses of enterprise which were forms of dissipation the young sculptor who had come back to him from paris modelled a small bust of grant which clemens multiplied in great numbers to his great loss and the success of grants book tempted him to launch on publishing seas where his bark presently foundered the first and greatest of his disasters was the life of pope leo xiii which he came to tell me of when he had imagined it in a sort of delirious exultation he had no words in which to paint the magnificence of the project or to forecast its colossal success it would have a currency bounded only by the number of catholics in christendom it would be translated into every language which was anywhere written or printed it would be circulated literally in every country of the globe and clemenss book agents would carry the prospectuses and then the bound copies of the work to the ends of the whole earth not only would every catholic buy it but every catholic must as he was a good catholic as he hoped to be saved it was a magnificent scheme and it captivated me as it had captivated clemens it dazzled us both and neither of us saw the fatal defect in it we did not consider how often catholics could not read how often when they could they might not wish to read the event proved that whether they could read or not the immeasurable majority did not wish to read the life of the pope though it was written by a dignitary of the church and issued to the world with every sanction from the vatican the failure was incredible to clemens his sanguine soul was utterly confounded and soon a silence fell upon it where it had been so exuberantly jubilant     xix  the occasions which brought us to new york together were not nearly so frequent as those which united us in boston but there was a dinner given him by a friend which remains memorable from the fatuity of two men present so different in everything but their fatuity one was the sweet old comedian billy florence who was urging the unsuccessful dramatist across the table to write him a play about oliver cromwell and giving the reasons why he thought himself peculiarly fitted to portray the character of cromwell the other was a modestly millioned rich man who was then only beginning to amass the moneys afterward heaped so high and was still in the condition to be flattered by the condescension of a yet greater millionaire his contribution to our gaiety was the verbatim report of a call he had made upon william h vanderbilt whom he had found just about starting out of town with his trunks actually in the front hall but who had stayed to receive the narrator he had in fact sat down on one of the trunks and talked with the easiest friendliness and quite we were given to infer like an ordinary human being clemens often kept on with some thread of the talk when we came away from a dinner but now he was silent as if high sorrowful and cloyed and it was not till well afterward that i found he had noted the facts from the bitterness with which he mocked the rich man and the pity he expressed for the actor  he had begun before that to amass those evidences against mankind which eventuated with him in his theory of what he called the damned human race this was not an expression of piety but of the kind contempt to which he was driven by our follies and iniquities as he had observed them in himself as well as in others it was as mild a misanthropy probably as ever caressed the objects of its malediction but i believe it was about the year 1900 that his sense of our perdition became insupportable and broke out in a mixed abhorrence and amusement which spared no occasion so that i could quite understand why mrs clemens should have found some compensation when kept to her room by sickness in the reflection that now she should not hear so much about the damned human race he told of that with the same wild joy that he told of overhearing her repetition of one of his most inclusive profanities and her explanation that she meant him to hear it so that he might know how it sounded the contrast of the lurid blasphemy with her heavenly whiteness should have been enough to cure any one less grounded than he in what must be owned was as fixed a habit as smoking with him when i first knew him he rarely vented his fury in that sort and i fancy he was under a promise to her which he kept sacred till the wear and tear of his nerves with advancing years disabled him then it would be like him to struggle with himself till he could struggle no longer and to ask his promise back and it would be like her to give it back his profanity was the heritage of his boyhood and young manhood in social conditions and under the duress of exigencies in which everybody swore about as impersonally as he smoked it is best to recognize the fact of it and i do so the more readily because i cannot suppose the recording angel really minded it much more than that guardian angel of his it probably grieved them about equally but they could equally forgive it nothing came of his pose regarding the damned human race except his invention of the human race luncheon club this was confined to four persons who were never all got together and it soon perished of their indifference  in the earlier days that i have more specially in mind one of the questions that we used to debate a good deal was whether every human motive was not selfish we inquired as to every impulse the noblest the holiest in effect and he found them in the last analysis of selfish origin pretty nearly the whole time of a certain railroad run from new york to hartford was taken up with the scrutiny of the selfsacrifice of a mother for her child of the abandon of the lover who dies in saving his mistress from fire or flood of the heros courage in the field and the martyrs at the stake each he found springing from the unconscious love of self and the dread of the greater pain which the selfsacrificer would suffer inforbearing the sacrifice if we had any time left from this inquiry that day he must have devoted it to a high regret that napoleon did not carry out his purpose of invading england for then he would have destroyed the feudal aristocracy or reformed the lords as it might be called now he thought that would have been an incalculable blessing to the english people and the world clemens was always beautifully and unfalteringly a republican none of his occasional misgivings for america implicated a return to monarchy yet he felt passionately the splendor of the english monarchy and there was a time when he gloried in that figurative poetry by which the king was phrased as the majesty of england he rolled the words deepthroatedly out and exulted in their beauty as if it were beyond any other glory of the world he read or read at english history a great deal and one of the byproducts of his restless invention was a game of english kings like the game of authors for children i do not know whether he ever perfected this but i am quite sure it was not put upon the market very likely he brought it to a practicable stage and then tired of it as he was apt to do in the ultimation of his vehement undertakings     xx  he satisfied the impassioned demand of his nature for incessant activities of every kind by taking a personal as well as a pecuniary interest in the inventions of others at one moment the damned human race was almost to be redeemed by a process of founding brass without air bubbles in it if this could once be accomplished as i understood or misunderstood brass could be used in artprinting to a degree hitherto impossible i dare say i have got it wrong but i am not mistaken as to clemenss enthusiasm for the process and his heavy losses in paying its way to ultimate failure he was simultaneously absorbed in the perfection of a typesetting machine which he was paying the inventor a salary to bring to a perfection so expensive that it was practically impracticable we were both printers by trade and i could take the same interest in this wonderful piece of mechanism that he could and it was so truly wonderful that it did everything but walk and talk its ingenious creator was so bent upon realizing the highest ideal in it that he produced a machine of quite unimpeachable efficiency but it was so costly when finished that it could not be made for less than twenty thousand dollars if the parts were made by hand this sum was prohibitive of its introduction unless the requisite capital could be found for making the parts by machinery and clemens spent many months in vainly trying to get this money together in the mean time simpler machines had been invented and the market filled and his investment of three hundred thousand dollars in the beautiful miracle remained permanent but not profitable i once went with him to witness its performance and it did seem to me the last word in its way but it had been spoken too exquisitely too fastidiously i never heard him devote the inventor to the infernal gods as he was apt to do with the geniuses he lost money by and so i think he did not regard him as a traitor  in these things and in his other schemes for the subiti guadagni of the speculator and the sudden making of splendid names for the benefactors of our species clemens satisfied the colonel sellers nature in himself from which he drew the picture of that wild and lovable figure and perhaps made as good use of his money as he could he did not care much for money in itself but he luxuriated in the lavish use of it and he was as generous with it as ever a man was he liked giving it but he commonly wearied of giving it himself and wherever he lived he established an almoner whom he fully trusted to keep his left hand ignorant of what his right hand was doing i believe he felt no finality in charity but did it because in its provisional way it was the only thing a man could do i never heard him go really into any sociological inquiry and i have a feeling that that sort of thing baffled and dispirited him no one can read the connecticut yankee and not be aware of the length and breadth of his sympathies with poverty but apparently he had not thought out any scheme for righting the economic wrongs we abound in i cannot remember our ever getting quite down to a discussion of the matter we came very near it once in the day of the vast wave of emotion sent over the world by looking backward and again when we were all so troubled by the great coal strike in pennsylvania in considering that he seemed to be for the time doubtful of the justice of the workingmans cause at all other times he seemed to know that whatever wrongs the workingman committed work was always in the right  when clemens returned to america with his family after lecturing round the world i again saw him in new york where i so often saw him while he was shaping himself for that heroic enterprise he would come to me and talk sorrowfully over his financial ruin and picture it to himself as the stuff of some unhappy dream which after long prosperity had culminated the wrong way it was very melancholy very touching but the sorrow to which he had come home from his long journey had not that forlorn bewilderment in it he was looking wonderfully well and when i wanted the name of his elixir he said it was plasmon he was apt for a man who had put faith so decidedly away from him to take it back and pin it to some superstition usually of a hygienic sort once when he was well on in years he came to new york without glasses and announced that he and all his family so astigmatic and myopic and oldsighted had so to speak burned their spectacles behind them upon the instruction of some sage who had found out that they were a delusion the next time he came he wore spectacles freely almost ostentatiously and i heard from others that the whole clemens family had been near losing their eyesight by the miracle worked in their behalf now i was not surprised to learn that the damned human race was to be saved by plasmon if anything and that my first duty was to visit the plasmon agency with him and procure enough plasmon to secure my family against the ills it was heir to for evermore i did not immediately understand that plasmon was one of the investments which he had made from the substance of things hoped for and in the destiny of a disastrous disappointment but after paying off the creditors of his late publishing firm he had to do something with his money and it was not his fault if he did not make a fortune out of plasmon     xxi  for a time it was a question whether he should not go back with his family to their old home in hartford perhaps the fathers and mothers hearts drew them there all the more strongly because of the grief written ineffaceably over it but for the younger ones it was no longer the measure of the world it was easier for all to stay on indefinitely in new york which is a sojourn without circumstance and equally the home of exile and of indecision the clemenses took a pleasant spacious house at riverdale on the hudson and there i began to see them again on something like the sweet old terms they lived far more unpretentiously than they used and i think with a notion of economy which they had never very successfully practised i recall that at the end of a certain year in hartford when they had been saving and paying cash for everything clemens wrote reminding me of their avowed experiment and asking me to guess how many bills they had at new years he hastened to say that a horsecar would not have held them at riverdale they kept no carriage and there was a snowy night when i drove up to their handsome old mansion in the station carryall which was crusted with mud as from the going down of the deluge after transporting noah and his family from the ark to whatever point they decided to settle at provisionally but the good talk the rich talk the talk that could never suffer poverty of mind or soul was there and we jubilantly found ourselves again in our middle youth it was the mighty moment when clemens was building his engines of war for the destruction of christian science which superstition nobody and he least of all expected to destroy it would not be easy to say whether in his talk of it his disgust for the illiterate twaddle of mrs eddys book or his admiration of her genius for organization was the greater he believed that as a religious machine the christian science church was as perfect as the roman church and destined to be more formidable in its control of the minds of men he looked for its spread over the whole of christendom and throughout the winter he spent at riverdale he was ready to meet all listeners more than halfway with his convictions of its powerful grasp of the average human desire to get something for nothing the vacuous vulgarity of its texts was a perpetual joy to him while he bowed with serious respect to the sagacity which built so securely upon the everlasting rock of human credulity and folly  an interesting phase of his psychology in this business was not only his admiration for the masterly policy of the christian science hierarchy but his willingness to allow the miracles of its healers to be tried on his friends and family if they wished it he had a tender heart for the whole generation of empirics as well as the newer sorts of scientitians but he seemed to base his faith in them largely upon the failure of the regulars rather than upon their own successes which also he believed in he was recurrently but not insistently desirous that you should try their strange magics when you were going to try the familiar medicines     xxii  the order of my acquaintance or call it intimacy with clemens was this our first meeting in boston my visits to him in hartford his visits to me in cambridge in belmont and in boston our briefer and less frequent meetings in paris and new york all with repeated interruptions through my absences in europe and his sojourns in london berlin vienna and florence and his flights to the many ends and odds and ends of the earth i will not try to follow the events if they were not rather the subjective experiences of those different periods and points of time which i must not fail to make include his summer at york harbor and his divers residences in new york on tenth street and on fifth avenue at riverdale and at stormfield which his daughter has told me he loved best of all his houses and hoped to make his home for long years  not much remains to me of the week or so that we had together in paris early in the summer of 1904 the first thing i got at my bankers was a cable message announcing that my father was stricken with paralysis but urging my stay for further intelligence and i went about till the final summons came with my head in a mist of care and dread clemens was very kind and brotherly through it all he was living greatly to his mind in one of those arcaded little hotels in the rue de rivoli and he was free from all household duties to range with me we drove together to make calls of digestion at many houses where he had got indigestion through his reluctance from their hospitality for he hated dining out but as he explained his wife wanted him to make these visits and he did it as he did everything she wanted at one place some suburban villa he could get no answer to his ring and he hove his cards over the gate just as it opened and he had the shame of explaining in his unexplanatory french to the man picking them up he was excruciatingly helpless with his cabmen but by very cordially smiling and casting himself on the drivers mercy he always managed to get where he wanted the family was on the verge of their many moves and he was doing some small errands he said that the others did the main things and left him to do what the cat might  it was with that return upon the buoyant billow of plasmon renewed in look and limb that clemenss universally pervasive popularity began in his own country he had hitherto been more intelligently accepted or more largely imagined in europe and i suppose it was my sense of this that inspired the stupidity of my saying to him when we came to consider the state of polite learning among us you mustnt expect people to keep it up here as they do in england but it appeared that his countrymen were only wanting the chance and they kept it up in honor of him past all precedent one does not go into a catalogue of dinners receptions meetings speeches and the like when there are more vital things to speak of he loved these obvious joys and he eagerly strove with the occasions they gave him for the brilliancy which seemed so exhaustless and was so exhausting his friends saw that he was wearing himself out and it was not because of mrs clemenss health alone that they were glad to have him take refuge at riverdale the family lived there two happy hopeless years and then it was ordered that they should change for his wifes sake to some less exacting climate clemens was not eager to go to florence but his imagination was taken as it would have been in the oldyoung days by the notion of packing his furniture into flexible steel cages from his house in hartford and unpacking it from them untouched at his villa in fiesole he got what pleasure any man could out of that triumph of mind over matter but the shadow was creeping up his life one sunny afternoon we sat on the grass before the mansion after his wife had begun to get well enough for removal and we looked up toward a balcony where byandby that lovely presence made itself visible as if it had stooped there from a cloud a hand frailly waved a handkerchief clemens ran over the lawn toward it calling tenderly what what as if it might be an asking for him instead of the greeting it really was for me it was the last time i saw her if indeed i can be said to have seen her then and long afterward when i said how beautiful we all thought her how good how wise how wonderfully perfect in every relation of life he cried out in a breaking voice oh why didnt you ever tell her she thought you didnt like her what a pang it was then not to have told her but how could we have told her his unreason endeared him to me more than all his wisdom  to that riverdale sojourn belong my impressions of his most violent antichristian science rages which began with the postponement of his book and softened into acceptance of the delay till he had wellnigh forgotten his wrath when it come out there was also one of those joint episodes of ours which strangely enough did not eventuate in entire failure as most of our joint episodes did he wrote furiously to me of a wrong which had been done to one of the most helpless and one of the most helped of our literary brethren asking me to join with him in recovering the money paid over by that brothers publisher to a false friend who had withheld it and would not give any account of it our hapless brother had appealed to clemens as he had to me with the facts but not asking our help probably because he knew he need not ask and clemens enclosed to me a very takingbythethroat message which he proposed sending to the false friend for once i had some sense and answered that this would never do for we had really no power in the matter and i contrived a letter to the recreant so softly diplomatic that i shall always think of it with pride when my honesties no longer give me satisfaction saying that this incident had come to our knowledge and suggesting that we felt sure he would not finally wish to withhold the money nothing more practically than that but that was enough there came promptly back a letter of justification covering a very substantial check which we hilariously forwarded to our beneficiary but the helpless man who was so used to being helped did not answer with the gladness i at least expected of him he acknowledged the check as he would any ordinary payment and then he made us observe that there was still a large sum due him out of the moneys withheld at this point i proposed to clemens that we should let the nonchalant victim collect the remnant himself clouds of sorrow had gathered about the bowed head of the delinquent since we began on him and my fickle sympathies were turning his way from the victim who was really to blame for leaving his affairs so unguardedly to him in the first place clemens made some sort of grit assent and we dropped the matter he was more used to ingratitude from those he helped than i was who found being lain down upon not so amusing as he found my revolt he reckoned i was right he said and after that i think we never recurred to the incident it was not ingratitude that he ever minded it was treachery that really maddened him past forgiveness     xxiii  during the summer he spent at york harbor i was only forty minutes away at kittery point and we saw each other often but this was before the last time at riverdale he had a wide low cottage in a pine grove overlooking york river and we used to sit at a corner of the veranda farthest away from mrs clemenss window where we could read our manuscripts to each other and tell our stories and laugh our hearts out without disturbing her at first she had been about the house and there was one gentle afternoon when she made tea for us in the parlor but that was the last time i spoke with her after that it was really a question of how soonest and easiest she could be got back to riverdale but of course there were specious delays in which she seemed no worse and seemed a little better and clemens could work at a novel he had begun he had taken a room in the house of a friend and neighbor a fisherman and boatman there was a table where he could write and a bed where he could lie down and read and there unless my memory has played me one of those constructive tricks that peoples memories indulge in he read me the first chapters of an admirable story the scene was laid in a missouri town and the characters such as he had known in boyhood but as often as i tried to make him own it he denied having written any such story it is possible that i dreamed it but i hope the ms will yet be found upon reflection i cannot believe that i dreamed it and i cannot believe that it was an effect of that sort of pseudomnemonics which i have mentioned the characters in the novel are too clearly outlined in my recollection together with some critical reservations of my own concerning them not only does he seem to have read me those first chapters but to have talked them over with me and outlined the whole story  i cannot say whether or not he believed that his wife would recover he fought the fear of her death to the end for her life was far more largely his than the lives of most mens wives are theirs for his own life i believe he would never have much cared if i may trust a saying of one who was so absolutely without pose as he was he said that he never saw a dead man whom he did not envy for having had it over and being done with it life had always amused him and in the resurgence of its interests after his sorrow had ebbed away he was again deeply interested in the world and in the human race which though damned abounded in subjects of curious inquiry when the time came for his wifes removal from york harbor i went with him to boston where he wished to look up the best means of her conveyance to new york the inquiry absorbed him the sort of invalid car he could get how she could be carried to the village station how the car could be detached from the eastern train at boston and carried round to the southern train on the other side of the city and then how it could be attached to the hudson river train at new york and left at riverdale there was no particular of the business which he did not scrutinize and master not only with his poignant concern for her welfare but with his strong curiosity as to how these unusual things were done with the usual means with the inertness that grows upon an aging man he had been used to delegating more and more things but of that thing i perceived that he would not delegate the least detail  he had meant never to go abroad again but when it came time to go he did not look forward to returning he expected to live in florence always after that they were used to the life and they had been happy there some years earlier before he went with his wife for the cure of nauheim but when he came home again it was for good and all it was natural that he should wish to live in new york where they had already had a pleasant year in tenth street i used to see him there in an upper room looking south over a quiet open space of back yards where we fought our battles in behalf of the filipinos and the boers and he carried on his campaign against the missionaries in china he had not yet formed his habit of lying for whole days in bed and reading and writing there yet he was a good deal in bed from weakness i suppose and for the mere comfort of it  my perspectives are not very clear and in the foreshortening of events which always takes place in our review of the past i may not always time things aright but i believe it was not until he had taken his house at 21 fifth avenue that he began to talk to me of writing his autobiography he meant that it should be a perfectly veracious record of his life and period for the first time in literature there should be a true history of a man and a true presentation of the men the man had known as we talked it over the scheme enlarged itself in our riotous fancy we said it should be not only a book it should be a library not only a library but a literature it should make good the worlds loss through omars barbarity at alexandria there was no image so grotesque so extravagant that we did not play with it and the work so far as he carried it was really done on a colossal scale but one day he said that as to veracity it was a failure he had begun to lie and that if no man ever yet told the truth about himself it was because no man ever could how far he had carried his autobiography i cannot say he dictated the matter several hours each day and the public has already seen long passages from it and can judge probably of the make and matter of the whole from these it is immensely inclusive and it observes no order or sequence whether now after his death it will be published soon or late i have no means of knowing once or twice he said in a vague way that it was not to be published for twenty years so that the discomfort of publicity might be minimized for all the survivors suddenly he told me he was not working at it but i did not understand whether he had finished it or merely dropped it i never asked  we lived in the same city but for old men rather far apart he at tenth street and i at seventieth and with our colds and other disabilities we did not see each other often he expected me to come to him and i would not without some return of my visits but we never ceased to be friends and good friends so far as i know i joked him once as to how i was going to come out in his autobiography and he gave me some sort of joking reassurance there was one incident however that brought us very frequently and actively together he came one sunday afternoon to have me call with him on maxim gorky who was staying at a hotel a few streets above mine we were both interested in gorky clemens rather more as a revolutionist and i as a realist though i too wished the russian tsar ill and the novelist well in his mission to the russian sympathizers in this republic but i had lived through the episode of kossuths visit to us and his vain endeavor to raise funds for the hungarian cause in 1851 when we were a younger and nobler nation than now with hearts if not hands opener to the oppressed of europe the oppressed of america the four or five millions of slaves we did not count i did not believe that gorky could get the money for the cause of freedom in russia which he had come to get as i told a valued friend of his and mine i did not believe he could get twentyfive hundred dollars and i think now i set the figure too high i had already refused to sign the sort of general appeal his friends were making to our principles and pockets because i felt it so wholly idle and when the paper was produced in gorkys presence and clemens put his name to it i still refused the next day gorky was expelled from his hotel with the woman who was not his wife but who i am bound to say did not look as if she were not at least to me who am however not versed in those aspects of human nature  i might have escaped unnoted but clemenss familiar head gave us away to the reporters waiting at the elevators mouth for all who went to see gorky as it was a hunt of interviewers ensued for us severally and jointly i could remain aloof in my hotel apartment returning answer to such guardians of the public right to know everything that i had nothing to say of gorkys domestic affairs for the public interest had now strayed far from the revolution and centred entirely upon these but with clemens it was different he lived in a house with a street door kept by a single butler and he was constantly rung for i forget how long the siege lasted but long enough for us to have fun with it that was the moment of the great vesuvian eruption and we figured ourselves in easy reach of a volcano which was every now and then blowing a cone off as the telegraphic phrase was the roof of the great market in naples had just broken in under its load of ashes and cinders and crashed hundreds of people and we asked each other if we were not sorry we had not been there where the pressure would have been far less terrific than it was with us in fifth avenue the forbidden butler came up with a message that there were some gentlemen below who wanted to see clemens  how many he demanded  five the butler faltered  reporters  the butler feigned uncertainty  what would you do he asked me  i wouldnt see them i said and then clemens went directly down to them how or by what means he appeased their voracity i cannot say but i fancy it was by the confession of the exact truth which was harmless enough they went away joyfully and he came back in radiant satisfaction with having seen them of course he was right and i wrong and he was right as to the point at issue between gorky and those who had helplessly treated him with such cruel ignominy in america it is not the convention for men to live openly in hotels with women who are not their wives gorky had violated this convention and he had to pay the penalty and concerning the destruction of his efficiency as an emissary of the revolution his blunder was worse than a crime     xxiv  to the period of clemenss residence in fifth avenue belongs his efflorescence in white serge he was always rather aggressively indifferent about dress and at a very early date in our acquaintance aldrich and i attempted his reform by clubbing to buy him a cravat but he would not put away his stiff little black bow and until he imagined the suit of white serge he wore always a suit of black serge truly deplorable in the cut of the sagging frock after his measure had once been taken he refused to make his clothes the occasion of personal interviews with his tailor he sent the stuff by the kind elderly woman who had been in the service of the family from the earliest days of his marriage and accepted the result without criticism but the white serge was an inspiration which few men would have had the courage to act upon the first time i saw him wear it was at the authors hearing before the congressional committee on copyright in washington nothing could have been more dramatic than the gesture with which he flung off his long loose overcoat and stood forth in white from his feet to the crown of his silvery head it was a magnificent coup and he dearly loved a coup but the magnificent speech which he made tearing to shreds the venerable farrago of nonsense about nonproperty in ideas which had formed the basis of all copyright legislation made you forget even his spectacularity  it is well known how proud he was of his oxford gown not merely because it symbolized the honor in which he was held by the highest literary body in the world but because it was so rich and so beautiful the red and the lavender of the cloth flattered his eyes as the silken black of the same degree of doctor of letters given him years before at yale could not do his frank defiant happiness in it mixed with a due sense of burlesque was something that those lacking his poetsoul could never imagine they accounted it vain weak but that would not have mattered to him if he had known it in his london sojourn he had formed the tophat habit and for a while he lounged splendidly up and down fifth avenue in that society emblem but he seemed to tire of it and to return kindly to the soft hat of his southwestern tradition  he disliked clubs i dont know whether he belonged to any in new york but i never met him in one as i have told he himself had formed the human race club but as he never could get it together it hardly counted there was to have been a meeting of it the time of my only visit to stormfield in april of last year but of three who were to have come i alone came we got on very well without the absentees after finding them in the wrong as usual and the visit was like those i used to have with him so many years before in hartford but there was not the old ferment of subjects many things had been discussed and put away for good but we had our old fondness for nature and for each other who were so differently parts of it he showed his absolute content with his house and that was the greater pleasure for me because it was my son who designed it the architect had been so fortunate as to be able to plan it where a natural avenue of savins the closeknit slender cypresslike cedars of new england led away from the rear of the villa to the little level of a pergola meant some day to be wreathed and roofed with vines but in the early spring days all the landscape was in the beautiful nakedness of the northern winter it opened in the surpassing loveliness of wooded and meadowed uplands under skies that were the first days blue and the last gray over a rainy and then a snowy floor we walked up and down up and down between the villa terrace and the pergola and talked with the melancholy amusement the sad tolerance of age for the sort of men and things that used to excite us or enrage us now we were far past turbulence or anger once we took a walk together across the yellow pastures to a chasmal creek on his grounds where the ice still knit the clayey banks together like crystal mosses and the stream far down clashed through and over the stones and the shards of ice clemens pointed out the scenery he had bought to give himself elbowroom and showed me the lot he was going to have me build on the next day we came again with the geologist he had asked up to stormfield to analyze its rocks truly he loved the place though he had been so weary of change and so indifferent to it that he never saw it till he came to live in it he left it all to the architect whom he had known from a child in the intimacy which bound our families together though we bodily lived far enough apart i loved his little ones and he was sweet to mine and was their delightedin and wonderedat friend once and once again and yet again and again the black shadow that shall never be lifted where it falls fell in his house and in mine during the forty years and more that we were friends and endeared us the more to each other     xxv  my visit at stormfield came to an end with tender relucting on his part and on mine every morning before i dressed i heard him sounding my name through the house for the fun of it and i know for the fondness and if i looked out of my door there he was in his long nightgown swaying up and down the corridor and wagging his great white head like a boy that leaves his bed and comes out in the hope of frolic with some one the last morning a soft sugarsnow had fallen and was falling and i drove through it down to the station in the carriage which had been given him by his wifes father when they were first married and been kept all those intervening years in honorable retirement for this final use its springs had not grown yielding with time it had rather the stiffness and severity of age but for him it must have swung low like the sweet chariot of the negro spiritual which i heard him sing with such fervor when those wonderful hymns of the slaves began to make their way northward go down daniel was one in which i can hear his quavering tenor now he was a lover of the things he liked and full of a passion for them which satisfied itself in reading them matchlessly aloud no one could read uncle remus like him his voice echoed the voices of the negro nurses who told his childhood the wonderful tales i remember especially his rapture with mr cables old creole days and the thrilling force with which he gave the forbidding of the lepers brother when the citys survey ran the course of an avenue through the cottage where the leper lived in hiding strit must not pass  out of a nature rich and fertile beyond any i have known the material given him by the mystery that makes a man and then leaves him to make himself over he wrought a character of high nobility upon a foundation of clear and solid truth at the last day he will not have to confess anything for all his life was the free knowledge of any one who would ask him of it the searcher of hearts will not bring him to shame at that day for he did not try to hide any of the things for which he was often so bitterly sorry he knew where the responsibility lay and he took a mans share of it bravely but not the less fearlessly he left the rest of the answer to the god who had imagined men  it is in vain that i try to give a notion of the intensity with which he pierced to the heart of life and the breadth of vision with which he compassed the whole world and tried for the reason of things and then left trying we had other meetings insignificantly sad and brief but the last time i saw him alive was made memorable to me by the kind clear judicial sense with which he explained and justified the laborunions as the sole present help of the weak against the strong  next i saw him dead lying in his coffin amid those flowers with which we garland our despair in that pitiless hour after the voice of his old friend twichell had been lifted in the prayer which it wailed through in brokenhearted supplication i looked a moment at the face i knew so well and it was patient with the patience i had so often seen in it something of puzzle a great silent dignity an assent to what must be from the
