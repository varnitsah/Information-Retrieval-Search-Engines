70159383	the kentons   by william dean howells     i  the kentons were not rich but they were certainly richer than the average in the pleasant county town of the middle west where they had spent nearly their whole married life as their circumstances had grown easier they had mellowed more and more in the keeping of their comfortable home until they hated to leave it even for the short outings which their children made them take to niagara or the upper lakes in the hot weather they believed that they could not be so well anywhere as in the great square brick house which still kept its four acres about it in the heart of the growing town where the trees they had planted with their own hands topped it on three aides and a spacious garden opened southward behind it to the summer wind kenton had his library where he transacted by day such law business as he had retained in his own hands but at night he liked to go to his wifes room and sit with her there they left the parlors and piazzas to their girls where they could hear them laughing with the young fellows who came to make the morning calls long since disused in the centres of fashion or the evening calls scarcely more authorized by the great world she sewed and he read his paper in her satisfactory silence or they played checkers together she did not like him to win and when she found herself unable to bear the prospect of defeat she refused to let him make the move that threatened the safety of her men sometimes he laughed at her and sometimes he scolded but they were very good comrades as elderly married people are apt to be they had long ago quarrelled out their serious differences which mostly arose from such differences of temperament as had first drawn them together they criticised each other to their children from time to time but they atoned for this defection by complaining of the children to each other and they united in giving way to them on all points concerning their happiness not to say their pleasure  they had both been teachers in their youth before he went into the war and they had not married until he had settled himself in the practice of the law after he left the army he was then a man of thirty and five years older than she five children were born to them but the second son died when he was yet a babe in his mothers arms and there was an interval of six years between the first boy and the first girl their eldest son was already married and settled next them in a house which was brick like their own but not square and had grounds so much less ample that he got most of his vegetables from their garden he had grown naturally into a share of his fathers law practice and he had taken it all over when renton was elected to the bench he made a show of giving it back after the judge retired but by that time kenton was well on in the fifties the practice itself had changed and had become mainly the legal business of a large corporation in this form it was distasteful to him he kept the affairs of some of his old clients in his hands but he gave much of his time which he saved his selfrespect by calling his leisure to a history of his regiment inthe war  in his later life he had reverted to many of the preoccupations of his youth and he believed that tuskingum enjoyed the best climate on the whole in the union that its people of mingled virginian pennsylvanian and connecticut origin with little recent admixture of foreign strains were of the purest american stock and spoke the best english in the world they enjoyed obviously the greatest sum of happiness and had incontestibly the lowest death rate and divorce rate in the state the growth of the place was normal and healthy it had increased only to five thousand during the time he had known it which was almost an ideal figure for a countytown there was a higher average of intelligence than in any other place of its size and a wider and evener diffusion of prosperity its record in the civil war was less brilliant perhaps than that of some other localities but it was fully up to the general ohio level which was the highwater mark of the national achievement in the greatest war of the greatest people under the sun it was kentons pride and glory that he had been a part of the finest army known in history he believed that the men who made history ought to write it and in his first commemorationday oration he urged his companions in arms to set down everything they could remember of their soldiering and to save the letters they had written home so that they might each contribute to a collective autobiography of the regiment it was only in this way he held that the intensely personal character of the struggle could be recorded he had felt his way to the fact that every battle is essentially episodical very campaign a sum of fortuities and it was not strange that he should suppose with his want of perspective that this universal fact was purely national and american his zeal made him the repository of a vast mass of material which he could not have refused to keep for the soldiers who brought it to him more or less in a humorous indulgence of his whim but he even offered to receive it and in a community where everything took the complexion of a joke he came to be affectionately regarded as a crank on that point the shabbily aging veterans whom he pursued to their workbenches and cornfields for the documents of the regimental history liked to ask the colonel if he had brought his gun they always give him the title with which he had been breveted at the close of the war but he was known to the younger generation of his fellowcitizens as the judge his wife called him mr kenton in the presence of strangers and sometimes to himself but to his children she called him poppa as they did  the steadygoing eldest son who had succeeded to his fathers affairs without giving him the sense of dispossession loyally accepted the popular belief that he would never be the man his father was he joined with his mother in a respect for kentons theory of the regimental history which was none the less sincere because it was unconsciously a little sceptical of the outcome and the eldest daughter was of their party the youngest said frankly that she had no use for any history but she said the same of nearly everything which had not directly or indirectly to do with dancing in this regulation she had use for parties and picnics for buggyrides and sleighrides for calls from young men and visits to and from other girls for concerts for plays for circuses and church sociables for everything but lectures and she devoted herself to her pleasures without the shadow of chaperonage which was indeed a thing still unheard of in tuskingum  in the expansion which no one else ventured or perhaps wished to set bounds to she came under the criticism of her younger brother who upon the rare occasions when he deigned to mingle in the family affairs drew their mothers notice to his sisters excesses in carryingon and required some action that should keep her from bringing the name of kenton to disgrace from being himself a boy of very slovenly and lawless life he had suddenly at the age of fourteen caught himself up from the street reformed his dress and conduct and confined himself in his large room at the top of the house where on the pursuits to which he gave his spare time the friends who frequented his society and the literature which nourished his darkling spirit might fitly have been written mystery the sister whom he reprobated was only two years his elder but since that difference in a girl accounts for a great deal it apparently authorized her to take him more lightly than he was able to take himself she said that he was in love and she achieved an importance with him through his speechless rage and scorn which none of the rest of his family enjoyed with his father and mother he had a bearing of repressed superiority which a strenuous conscience kept from unmasking itself in open contempt when they failed to make his sister promise to behave herself sometimes he had lapses from his dignified gloom with his mother when for no reason that could be given he fell from his habitual majesty to the tender dependence of a little boy just as his voice broke from its nascent base to its earlier treble at moments when he least expected or wished such a thing to happen his stately but vague ideal of himself was supported by a stature beyond his years but this rendered it the more difficult for him to bear the humiliation of his sudden collapses and made him at other times the easier prey of lotties ridicule he got on best or at least most evenly with his eldest sister she took him seriously perhaps because she took all life so and she was able to interpret him to his father when his intolerable dignity forbade a common understanding between them when he got so far beyond his depth that he did not know what he meant himself as sometimes happened she gently found him a safe footing nearer shore  kentons theory was that he did not distinguish among his children he said that he did not suppose they were the best children in the world but they suited him and he would not have known how to change them for the better he saw no harm in the behavior of lottie when it most shocked her brother he liked her to have a good time but it flattered his nerves to have ellen about him lottie was a great deal more accomplished he allowed that she could play and sing and she had social gifts far beyond her sister but he easily proved to his wife that nelly knew ten times as much  nelly read a great deal she kept up with all the magazines and knew all the books in his library he believed that she was a fine german scholar and in fact she had taken up that language after leaving school when if she had been better advised than she could have been in tuskingum she would have kept on with her french she started the first book club in the place and she helped her father do the intellectual honors of the house to the eastern lecturers who always stayed with the judge when they came to tuskingum she was faithfully present at the moments which her sister shunned in derision when her father explained to them respectively his theory of regimental history and would just as he said show them a few of the documents he had collected he made ellen show them she knew where to put her hand on the most characteristic and illustrative and lottie offered to bet what one dared that ellen would marry some of those lecturers yet she was literary enough  she boasted that she was not literary herself and had no use for any one who was and it could not have been her culture that drew the most cultivated young man in tuskingum to her ellen was really more beautiful lottie was merely very pretty but she had charm for them and ellen who had their honor and friendship had no charm for them no one seemed drawn to her as they were drawn to her sister till a man came who was not one of the most cultivated in tuskingum and then it was doubtful whether she was not first drawn to him she was too transparent to hide her feeling from her father and mother who saw with even more grief than shame that she could not hide it from the man himself whom they thought so unworthy of it  he had suddenly arrived in tuskingum from one of the villages of the county where he had been teaching school and had found something to do as reporter on the tuskingum intelligencer which he was instinctively characterizing with the spirit of the new journalism and was pushing as hardily forward on the lines of personality as if he had dropped down to it from the height of a new york or chicago sunday edition the judge said with something less than his habitual honesty that he did not mind his being a reporter but he minded his being light and shallow he minded his being flippant and mocking he minded his bringing his cigarettes and banjo into the house at his second visit he did not mind his push the fellow had his way to make and he had to push but he did mind his being all push and his having come out of the country with as little simplicity as if he had passed his whole life in the city he had no modesty and he had no reverence he had no reverence for ellen herself and the poor girl seemed to like him for that  he was all the more offensive to the judge because he was himself to blame for their acquaintance which began when one day the fellow had called after him in the street and then followed down the shady sidewalk beside him to his hour wanting to know what this was he had heard about his history and pleading for more light upon his plan in it at the gate he made a flourish of opening and shutting it for the judge and walking up the path to his door he kept his hand on the judges shoulder most offensively but in spite of this kenton had the weakness to ask him in and to call ellen to get him the most illustrative documents of the history  the interview that resulted in the intelligencer was the least evil that came of this error kenton was amazed and then consoled and then afflicted that ellen was not disgusted with it and in his conferences with his wife he fumed and fretted at his own culpable folly and tried to get back of the time he had committed it in that illusion which people have with trouble that it could somehow be got rid of if it could fairly be got back of till the time came when his wife could no longer share his unrest in this futile endeavor  she said one night when they had talked late and long that cant be helped now and the question is what are we going to do to stop it  the judge evaded the point in saying the devil of it is that all the nice fellows are afraid of her they respect her too much and the very thing which ought to disgust her with this chap is what gives him his power over her i dont know what we are going to do but we must break it off somehow  we might take her with us somewhere mrs kenton suggested  run away from the fellow i think i see myself no we have got to stay and face the thing right here but i wont have him about the house any more understand that hes not to be let in and ellen mustnt see him you tell her i said so or no i will speak to her myself his wife said that he was welcome to do that but he did not quite do it he certainly spoke to his daughter about her lover and he satisfied himself that there was yet nothing explicit between them but she was so much less frank and open with him than she had always been before that he was wounded as well as baffled by her reserve he could not get her to own that she really cared for the fellow but man as he was and old man as he was he could not help perceiving that she lived in a fond dream of him  he went from her to her mother if he was only onehalf the man she thinks he ishe ended his report in a hopeless sigh  you want to give in to her his wife pitilessly interpreted well perhaps that would be the best thing after all  no no it wouldnt sarah it would be the easiest for both of us i admit but it would be the worst thing for her weve got to let it run along for a while yet if we give him rope enough he may hang himself theres that chance we cant go away and we cant shut her up and we cant turn him out of the house we must trust her to find him out for herself  shell never do that said the mother lottie says ellen thinks hes just perfect he cheers her up and takes her out of herself weve always acted with her as if we thought she was different from other girls and he behaves to her as if she was just like all of them just as silly and just as weak and it pleases her and flatters her she likes it  oh lord groaned the father i suppose she does  this was bad enough it was a blow to his pride in ellen but there was something that hurt him still worse when the fellow had made sure of her he apparently felt himself so safe in her fondness that he did not urge his suit with her his content with her tacit acceptance gave the bitterness of shame to the promise kenton and his wife had made each other never to cross any of their children in love they were ready now to keep that promise for ellen if he asked it of them rather than answer for her lifelong disappointment if they denied him but whatever he meant finally to do he did not ask it he used his footing in their house chiefly as a basis for flirtations beyond it he began to share his devotions to ellen with her girl friends and not with her girl friends alone it did not come to scandal but it certainly came to gossip about him and a silly young wife and kenton heard of it with a torment of doubt whether ellen knew of it and what she would do he would wait for her to do herself whatever was to be done he was never certain how much she had heard of the gossip when she came to her mother and said with the gentle eagerness she had didnt poppa talk once of going south this winter  he talked of going to new york the mother answered with a throb of hope  well the girl returned patiently and mrs kenton read in her passivity an eagerness to be gone from sorrow that she would not suffer to be seen and interpreted her to her father in such wise that he could not hesitate     ii  if such a thing could be mercifully ordered the order of this event had certainly been merciful but it was a cruel wrench that tore kenton from the home where he had struck such deep root when he actually came to leave the place his going had a ghastly unreality which was heightened by his sense of the common reluctance no one wanted to go so far as he could make out not even ellen herself when he tried to make her say she wished it lottie was in open revolt and animated her young men to a share in the insurrection her older brother was kindly and helpfully acquiescent but he was so far from advising the move that kenton had regularly to convince himself that richard approved it by making him say that it was only for the winter and that it was the best way of helping ellen get rid of that fellow all this did not enable kenton to meet the problems of his younger son who required him to tell what he was to do with his dog and his pigeons and to declare at once how he was to dispose of the cocoons he had amassed so as not to endanger the future of the moths and butterflies involved in them the boy was so fertile in difficulties and so importunate for their solution that he had to be crushed into silence by his father who ached in a helpless sympathy with his reluctance  kenton came heavily upon the courage of his wife who was urging forward their departure with so much energy that he obscurely accused her of being the cause of it and could only be convinced of her innocence when she offered to give the whole thing up if he said so when he would not say so she carried the affair through to the bitter end and she did not spare him some pangs which she perhaps need not have shared with him but people are seldom man and wife for half their lives without wishing to impart their sufferings as well as their pleasures to each other and mrs kenton if she was no worse was no better than other wives in pressing to her husbands lips the cup that was not altogether sweet to her own she went about the house the night before closing it to see that everything was in a state to be left and then she came to kenton in his library where he had been burning some papers and getting others ready to give in charge to his son and sat down by his cold hearth with him and wrung his soul with the tale of the last things she had been doing when she had made him bear it all she began to turn the bright side of the affair to him she praised the sense and strength of ellen in the course the girl had taken with herself and asked him if he really thought they could have done less for her than they were doing she reminded him that they were not running away from the fellow as she had once thought they must but ellen was renouncing him and putting him out of her sight till she could put him out of her mind she did not pretend that the girl had done this yet but it was everything that she wished to do it and saw that it was best then she kissed him on his gray head and left him alone to the first ecstasy of his homesickness  it was better when they once got to new york and were settled in an apartment of an oldfashioned downtown hotel they thought themselves very cramped in it and they were but little easier when they found that the apartments over and under them were apparently thought spacious for families of twice their numbers it was the very quietest place in the whole city but kenton was used to the stillness of tuskingum where since people no longer kept hens the nights were stiller than in the country itself and for a week he slept badly otherwise as soon as they got used to living in six rooms instead of seventeen they were really very comfortable  he could see that his wife was glad of the release from housekeeping and she was growing gayer and seemed to be growing younger in the inspiration of the great goodnatured town they had first come to new york on their wedding journey but since that visit she had always let him go alone on his business errands to the east these had grown less and less frequent and he had not seen new york for ten or twelve years he could have waited as much longer but he liked her pleasure in the place and with the homesickness always lurking at his heart he went about with her to the amusements which she frequented as she said to help ellen take her mind off herself at the play and the opera he sat thinking of the silent lonely house at tuakingum dark among its leafless maples and the life that was no more in it than if they had all died out of it and he could not keep down a certain resentment senseless and cruel as if the poor girl were somehow to blame for their exile when he betrayed this feeling to his wife as he sometimes must she scolded him for it and then offered if he really thought anything like that to go back to tuskingum at once and it ended in his having to own himself wrong and humbly promise that he never would let the child dream how he felt unless he really wished to kill her he was obliged to carry his selfpunishment so far as to take lottie very sharply to task when she broke out in hot rebellion and declared that it was all ellens fault she was not afraid of killing her sister and though she did not say it to her she said it of her that anybody else could have got rid of that fellow without turning the whole family out of house and home  lottie in fact was not having a bit good time in new york which she did not find equal in any way to tuskingum for fun she hated the dull propriety of the hotel where nobody got acquainted and every one was as afraid as death of every one else and in her desolation she was thrown back upon the society of her brother boyne they became friends in their common dislike of new york and pending some chance of bringing each other under condemnation they lamented their banishment from tuskingum together but even boyne contrived to make the heavy time pass more lightly than she in the lessons he had with a tutor and the studies of the city which he carried on when the skating was not good in central park he spent most of his afternoons and evenings at the vaudeville theatres none of the dime museums escaped his research and he conversed with freaks and monsters of all sorts upon terms of friendly confidence he reported their different theories of themselves to his family with the same simplehearted interest that he criticised the song and dance artists of the vaudeville theatres he became an innocent but by no means uncritical connoisseur of their attractions and he surprised with the constancy and variety of his experience in them a gentleman who sat next him one night boyne thought him a person of cultivation and consulted him upon the opinion he had formed that there was not so much harm in such places as people said the gentleman distinguished in saying that he thought you would not find more harm in them if you did not bring it with you than you would in the legitimate theatres and in the hope of further wisdom from him boyne followed him out of the theatre and helped him on with his overcoat the gentleman walked home to his hotel with him and professed a pleasure in his acquaintance which he said he trusted they might sometime renew  all at once the kentons began to be acquainted in the hotel as often happens with people after they have long ridden up and down in the elevator together in bonds of apparently perpetual strangeness from one friendly family their acquaintance spread to others until they were almost without knowing it suddenly and simultaneously on smiling and then on speaking terms with the people of every permanent table in the diningroom lottie and boyne burst the chains of the unnatural kindness which bound them and resumed their old relations of reciprocal censure he found a fellow of his own age in the apartment below who had the same country traditions and was engaged in a like inspection of the city and she discovered two girls on another floor who said they received on saturdays and wanted her to receive with them they made a tea for her and asked some real new yorkers and such a round of pleasant little events began for her that boyne was forced to call his mothers attention to the way charlotte was going on with the young men whom she met and frankly asked to call upon her without knowing anything about them you could not do that in new york he said  but by this time new york had gone to mrs kentons head too and she was less fitted to deal with lottie than at home whether she had succeeded or not in helping ellen take her mind off herself she had certainly freed her own from introspection in a dream of things which had seemed impossible before she was in that moment of a womans life which has a certain pathos for the intelligent witness when having reared her children and outgrown the more incessant cares of her motherhood she sometimes reverts to her girlish impulses and ideals and confronts the remaining opportunities of life with a joyful hope unknown to our heavier and sullener sex in its later years it is this peculiar power of rejuvenescence which perhaps makes so many women outlive their husbands who at the same age regard this world as an accomplished fact mrs kenton had kept up their reading long after kenton found himself too busy or too tired for it and when he came from his office at night and fell asleep over the book she wished him to hear she continued it herself and told him about it when ellen began to show the same taste they read together and the mother was not jealous when the father betrayed that he was much prouder of his daughters culture than his wifes she had her own misgivings that she was not so modern as ellen and she accepted her judgment in the case of some authors whom she did not like so well  she now went about not only to all the places where she could make ellens amusement serve as an excuse but to others when she could not coax or compel the melancholy girl she was as constant at matinees of one kind as boyne at another sort she went to the exhibitions of pictures and got herself up in schools of painting she frequented galleries public and private and got asked to studio teas she went to meetings and conferences of aesthetic interest and she paid an easy way to parlor lectures expressive of the vague but profound ferment in womens souls from these her presence in intellectual clubs was a simple and natural transition she met and talked with interesting people and now and then she got introduced to literary people once in a bookstore she stood next to a gentleman leaning over the same counter whom a salesman addressed by the name of a popular author and she remained staring at him breathless till he left the place when she bragged of the prodigious experience at home her husband defied her to say how it differed from meeting the lecturers who had been their guests in tuskingum and she answered that none of them compared with this author and besides a lion in his own haunts was very different from a lion going round the country on exhibition kenton thought that was pretty good and owned that she had got him there  he laughed at her to the children but all the same she believed that she was living in an atmosphere of culture and with every breath she was sensible of an intellectual expansion she found herself in the enjoyment of so wide and varied a sympathy with interests hitherto strange to her experience that she could not easily make people believe she had never been to europe nearly every one she met had been several times and took it for granted that she knew the continent as well as they themselves  she denied it with increasing shame she tried to make kenton understand how she felt and she might have gone further if she had not seen how homesick he was for tuskingum she did her best to coax him and scold him into a share of the pleasure they were all beginning to have in new york she made him own that ellen herself was beginning to be gayer she convinced him that his business was not suffering in his absence and that he was the better from the complete rest he was having she defied him to say then what was the matter with him and she bitterly reproached herself in the event for not having known that it was not homesickness alone that was the trouble when he was not going about with her or doing something to amuse the children he went upon long lonely walks and came home silent and fagged he had given up smoking and he did not care to sit about in the office of the hotel where other old fellows passed the time over their papers and cigars in the heat of the glowing grates they looked too much like himself with their air of unrecognized consequence and of personal loss in an alien environment he knew from their dress and bearing that they were country people and it wounded him in a tender place to realize that they had each left behind him in his own town an authority and a respect which they could not enjoy in new york nobody called them judge or general or doctor or squire nobody cared who they were or what they thought kenton did not care himself but when he missed one of them he envied him for then he knew that he had gone back to the soft warm keeping of his own neighborhood and resumed the intelligent regard of a community he had grown up with there were men in new york whom kenton had met in former years and whom he had sometimes fancied looking up but he did not let them know he was in town and then he was hurt that they ignored him he kept away from places where he was likely to meet them he thought that it must have come to them that he was spending the winter in new york and as bitterly as his nature would suffer he resented the indifference of the ohio society to the presence of an ohio man of his local distinction he had not the habit of clubs and when one of the pleasant younger fellows whom he met in the hotel offered to put him up at one he shrank from the courtesy shyly and almost dryly he had outlived the period of active curiosity and he did not explore the city as he world once have done he had no resorts out of the hotel except the basements of the secondhand bookdealers he haunted these and picked up copies of war histories and biographies which as fast as he read them he sent off to his son at tuskingum and had him put them away with the documents for the life of his regiment his wife could see with compassion if not sympathy that he was fondly strengthening by these means the ties that bound him to his home and she silently proposed to go back to it with him whenever he should say the word  he had a mechanical fidelity however to their agreement that they should stay till spring and he made no sign of going as the winter wore away to its end except to write out to tuskingum minute instructions for getting the garden ready he varied his visits to the bookstalls by conferences with seedsmen at their stores and his wife could see that he had as keen a satisfaction in despatching a rare find from one as from the other  she forbore to make him realize that the situation had not changed and that they would be taking their daughter back to the trouble the girl herself had wished to escape she was trusting with no definite hope for some chance of making him feel this while kenton was waiting with a kind of passionate patience for the term of his exile when he came in one day in april from one of his long walks and said he had been up to the park to see the blackbirds but he complained of being tired and he lay down on his bed he did not get up for dinner and then it was six weeks before he left his room  he could not remember that he had ever been sick so long before and he was so awed by his suffering which was severe but not serious that when his doctor said he thought a voyage to europe would be good for him he submitted too meekly for mrs kenton her heart smote her for her guilty joy in his sentence and she punished herself by asking if it would not do him more good to get back to the comfort and quiet of their own house she went to the length of saying that she believed his attack had been brought on more by homesickness than anything else but the doctor agreed rather with her wish than her word and held out that his melancholy was not the cause but the effect of his disorder then she took courage and began getting ready to go she did not flag even in the dark hours when kenton got back his courage with his returning strength and scoffed at the notion of europe and insisted that as soon as they were in tuskingum he should be all right again  she felt the ingratitude not to say the perfidy of his behavior and she fortified herself indignantly against it but it was not her constant purpose or the doctors inflexible opinion that prevailed with kenton at last a letter came one day for ellen which she showed to her mother and which her mother with her distress obscurely relieved by a sense of its powerful instrumentality brought to the girls father it was from that fellow as they always called him and it asked of the girl a hearing upon a certain point in which it had just come to his knowledge she had misjudged him he made no claim upon her and only urged his wish to right himself with her because she was the one person in the whole world after his mother for whose good opinion he cared with some tawdriness of sentiment the letter was well worded it was professedly written for the sole purpose of knowing whether when she came back to tuskingum she would see him and let him prove to her that he was not wholly unworthy of the kindness she had shown him when he was without other friends  what does she say the judge demanded  what do you suppose his wife retorted she thinks she ought to see him  very well then we will go to europe  not on my account mrs kenton consciously protested  no not on your account or mine either on nellys account where is she i want to talk with her  and i want to talk with you shes out with lottie and when she comes back i will tell her what you say but i want to know what you think first     iii  it was some time before they arrived at a common agreement as to what kenton thought and when they reached it they decided that they must leave the matter altogether to ellen as they had done before they would never force her to anything and if after all that her mother could say she still wished to see the fellow they would not deny her  when it came to this ellen was a long time silent so long a time that her mother was beginning restively to doubt whether she was going to speak at all then she drew a long silent breath i suppose i ought to despise myself momma for caring for him when hes never really said that he cared for me  no no her mother faltered  but i do i do she gave way piteously i cant help it he doesnt say so even now  no he doesnt it hurt her mother to own the fact that alone gave her hope  the girl was a long time silent again before she asked has poppa got the tickets  why he wouldnt ellen child till he knew how you felt her mother tenderly reproached her  hed better not wait the tears ran silently down ellens cheeks and her lips twitched a little between these words and the next she spoke as if it were still of her father but her mother understood if he ever does say so dont you speak a word to me momma and dont you let poppa  no indeed i wont her mother promised have we ever interfered ellen have we ever tried to control you  he would have said so if he hadnt seen that everybody was against him the mother bore without reply the ingratitude and injustice that she knew were from the childs pain and not from her will where is his letter give me his letter she nervously twitched it from her mothers hand and ran it into her pocket she turned away to go and put off her hat which she still wore from coming in with lottie but she stopped and looked over her shoulder at her mother im going to answer it and i dont want you ever to ask me what ive said will you  no i wont nelly  well then  the next night she went with boyne and lottie to the apartment overhead to spend their last evening with the young people there who were going into the country the next day she came back without the others who wished to stay a little longer as she said with a look of gay excitement in her eyes which her mother knew was not happiness mrs kenton had an impulse to sweep into her lap the lithograph plans of the steamer and the passage ticket which lay open on the table before herself and her husband but it was too late to hide them from ellen she saw them and caught up the ticket and read it and flung it down again oh i didnt think you would do it she burst out and she ran away to her room where they could hear her sobbing as they sat haggardly facing each other  well that settles it said benton at last with a hard gulp  oh i suppose so his wife assented  on his part now he had a genuine regret for her disappointment from the sad safety of the trouble that would keep them at home and on her part she could be glad of it if any sort of comfort could come out of it to him  till she says go he added weve got to stay  oh yes his wife responded the worst of it is we cant even go back to tuskingum he looked up suddenly at her and she saw that he had not thought of this she made tchk in sheer amaze at him  we wont cross that river till we come to it he said sullenly but halfashamed the next morning the situation had not changed overnight as they somehow both crazily hoped it might and at breakfast which they had at a table grown more remote from others with the thinning out of the winter guests of the hotel the father and mother sat down alone in silence which was scarcely broken till lottie and boyne joined them  wheres ellen the boy demanded  shes having her breakfast in her room mrs kenton answered  she says she dont want to eat anything lottie reported she made the man take it away again  the gloom deepened in the faces of the father and mother but neither spoke and boyne resumed the word again in a tone of philosophic speculation i dont see how im going to get along with those european breakfasts they say you cant get anything but cold meat or eggs and generally they dont expect to give you anything but bread and butter with your coffee i dont think thats the way to start the day do you poppa  kenton seemed not to have heard for he went on silently eating and the mother who had not been appealed to merely looked distractedly across the table at her children  mr plumpton says hes coming down to see us off said lottie smoothing her napkin in her lap do you know the time of day when the boat sails momma  yes her brother broke in and if i had been momma id have boxed your ears for the way you went on with him you fairly teased him to come the way lottie goes on with men is a shame momma  what time does the boat sail momma lottie blandly persisted i promised to let mr plumpton know  yes so as to get a chance to write to him said boyne i guess when he sees your spelling  momma do wake up what time does our steamer sail  a light of consciousness came into mrs rentons eyes at last and she sighed gently were not going lottie  not going why but weve got the tickets and ive told  your father has decided not to go for the present we may go later in the summer or perhaps in the fall  boyne looked at his fathers troubled face and said nothing but lottie was not stayed from the expression of her feelings by any illtimed consideration for what her fathers might be i just know she fired its something to do with that nasty bittridge hes been a bitter dose to this family as soon as i saw ellen have a letter i was sure it was from him and she ought to be ashamed if i had played the simpleton with such a fellow i guess you wouldnt have let me keep you from going to europe very much what is she going to do now marry him or doesnt he want her to  lottie said her mother and her father glanced up at her with a face that silenced her  when youve been half as good a girl as ellen has been in this whole matter he said darkly it will be time for you to complain of the way youve been treated  oh yes i know you like ellen the best said the girl defiantly  dont say such a thing lottie said her mother your father loves all his children alike and i wont have you talking so to him ellen has had a great deal to bear and she has behaved beautifully if we are not going to europe it is because we have decided that it is best not to go and i wish to hear nothing more from you about it  oh yes and a nice position it leaves me in when ive been taking goodbye of everybody well i hope to goodness you wont say anything about it till the plumptons get away i couldnt have the face to meet them if you did  it wont be necessary to say anything or you can say that weve merely postponed our sailing people are always doing that  its not to be a postponement said kenton so sternly that no one ventured to dispute him the children because they were afraid of him and their mother because she was suffering for him  at the steamship office however the authorities represented that it was now so near the date of his sailing that they could not allow him to relinquish his passages except at his own risk they would try to sell his ticket for him but they could not take it back and they could not promise to sell it there was reason in what they said but if there had been none they had the four hundred dollars which kenton had paid for his five berths and they had at least the advantage of him in the argument by that means he put the ticket back in his pocketbook without attempting to answer them and deferred his decision till he could advise with his wife who after he left the breakfasttable upon his errand to the steamship office had abandoned her children to their own devices and gone to scold ellen for not eating  she had not the heart to scold her when she found the girl lying face downward in the pillow with her thin arms thrown up through the coils and heaps of her looseflung hair she was so alight that her figure scarcely defined itself under the bedclothes the dark hair and the white outstretched arms seemed all there was of her she did not stir but her mother knew she was not sleeping ellen she said gently you neednt be troubled about our going to europe your father has gone down to the steamship office to give back his ticket  the girl flashed her face round with nervous quickness gone to give back his ticket  yes we decided it last night hes never really wanted to go and  but i dont wish poppa to give up his ticket said ellen he must get it again i shall die if i stay here momma we have got to go cant you understand that  mrs kenton did not know what to answer she had a strong superficial desire to shake her daughter as a naughty child which has vexed its mother but under this was a stir stronger pity for her as a woman which easily prevailed why but ellen dear we thought from what you said last night  but couldnt you see the girl reproached her and she began to cry and turned her face into the pillow again and lay sobbing  well said her mother after she had given her a little time you neednt be troubled your father can easily get the ticket again he can telephone down for it nothing has been done yet but didnt you really want to stay then  it isnt whether i want to stay or not ellen spoke into her pillow you know that you know that i have got to go you know that if i saw himoh why do you make me talk  yes i understand child then in the imperious necessity of blaming some one mrs kenton added you know how it is with your father he is always so precipitate and when he heard what you said last night it cut him to the heart he felt as if he were dragging you away and this morning he could hardly wait to get through his breakfast before he rushed down to the steamship office but now its all right again and if you want to go well go and your father will only be too glad  i dont want father to go against his will you said he never wanted to go to europe the girl had turned her face upon her mother again and fixed her with her tearful accusing eyes  the doctors say he ought to go he needs the change and i think we should all be the better far getting away  i shall not said ellen but if i dont  yes said her mother soothingly  you know that nothing has changed he hasnt changed and i havent if he was bad hes as bad as ever and im just as silly oh its like a drunkard i suppose they know its killing them but they cant give it up dont you think its very strange momma i dont see why i should be so it seems as if i had no character at all and i despise myself so do you believe i shall ever get over it sometimes i think the best thing for me would be to go into an asylum  oh yes dear youll get over it and forget it all as soon as you see othersother scenesand get interested  and you dont you dont think id better let him come and  ellen  ellen began to sob again and toss her head upon the pillow what shall i do what shall i do she wailed he hasnt ever done anything bad to me and if i can overlook hishis flirtingwith that horrid thing i dont know what the rest of you have got to say and he says he can explain everything why shouldnt i give him the chance momma i do think it is acting very cruel not to let him even say a word  you can see him if you wish ellen said her mother gravely your father and i have always said that and perhaps it would be the best thing after all  oh you say that because you think that if i did see him i should be so disgusted with him that id never want to speak to him again but what if i shouldnt  then we should wish you to do whatever you thought was for your happiness ellen we cant believe it would be for your good but if it would be for your happiness we are willing or if you dont think its for your happiness but only for his and you wish to do it still we shall be willing and you know that as far as your father and i are concerned there will never be a word of reproachnot a whisper  lottie would despise me and what would richard say  richard would never say anything to wound you dear and if you dont despise yourself you neednt mind lottie  but i should momma thats the worst of it i should despise myself and he would despise me too no if i see him i am going to do it because i am selfish and wicked and wish to have my own way no matter who is harmed by it oranything and im not going to have it put on any other ground i could see him she said as if to herself just once moreonly once moreand then if i didnt believe in him i could start right off to europe  her mother made no answer to this and ellen lay awhile apparently forgetful of her presence inwardly dramatizing a passionate scene of dismissal between herself and her false lover she roused herself from the reverie with a long sigh and her mother said wont you have some breakfast now ellen  yes and i will get up you neednt be troubled any more about me momma i will write to him not to come and poppa must go back and get his ticket again  not unless you are doing this of your own free will child i cant have you feeling that we are putting any pressure upon you  youre not im doing it of my own will if it isnt my free will that isnt your fault i wonder whose fault it is mine or what made me so silly and weak  you are not silly and weak said her mother fondly and she bent over the girl and would have kissed her but ellen averted her face with a piteous dont and mrs kenton went out and ordered her breakfast brought back  she did not go in to make her eat it as she would have done in the beginning of the girls trouble they had all learned how much better she was for being left to fight her battles with herself singlehanded mrs kenton waited in the parlor till her husband same in looking gloomy and tired he put his hat down and sank into a chair without speaking well she said  we have got to lose the price of the ticket if we give it back i thought i had better talk with you first said kenton and he explained the situation  then you had better simply have it put off till the next steamer i have been talking with ellen and she doesnt want to stay she wants to go his wife took advantage of kentons mute amaze in the nervous vagaries even of the women nearest him a man learns nothing from experience to put her own interpretation on the case which as it was creditable to the girls sense and principle he found acceptable if not imaginable and if you will take my advice she ended you will go quietly back to the steamship office and exchange your ticket for the next steamer or the one after that if you cant get good rooms and give ellen time to get over this before she leaves it will be much better for her to conquer herself than to run away for that would always give her a feeling of shame and if she decides before she goes it will strengthen her pride and selfrespect and there will be less dangerwhen we come back  do you think hes going to keep after her  how can i tell he will if he thinks its to his interest or he can make anybody miserable by it  kenton said nothing to this but after a while he suggested rather timorously as if it were something he could not expect her to approve and was himself half ashamed of i believe if i do put it off ill run out to tuskingum before we sail and look after a little matter of business that i dont think dick can attend to so well  his wife knew why he wanted to go and in her own mind she had already decided that if he should ever propose to go she should not gainsay him she had in fact been rather surprised that he had not proposed it before this and now she assented without taxing him with his real motive and bringing him to open disgrace before her she even went further in saying very well then you had better go i can get on very well here and i think it will leave ellen freer to act for herself if you are away and there are some things in the house that i want and that richard would be sure to send his wife to get if i asked him and i wont have her rummaging around in my closets i suppose you will want to go into the house  i suppose so said renton who had not let a day pass since he left his house without spending half his homesick time in it his wife suffered his affected indifference to go without exposure and trumped up a commission for him which would take him intimately into the house     iv  the piety of his son richard had maintained the place at tuskingum in perfect order outwardly and kentons heart ached with tender pain as he passed up the neatly kept walk from the gate between the blooming ranks of syringas and snowballs to his door and witnessed the faithful care that richards hired man had bestowed upon every detail the grass between the banks of roses and rhododendrons had been as scrupulously lawnmowered and as sedulously gardenhosed as if kenton himself had been there to look after its welfare or had tended the shrubbery as he used to do in earlier days with his own hand the oaks which he had planted shook out their glossy green in the morning gale and in the tuliptrees which had snowed their petals on the ground in wide circles defined by the reach of their branches he heard the squirrels barking a redbird from the woody depths behind the house mocked the catbirds in the quincetrees the june rose was red along the trellis of the veranda where lottie ought to be sitting to receive the morning calls of the young men who were sometimes quite as early as kentons present visit in their devotions and the sound of ellens piano played fitfully and absently in her fashion ought to be coming out irrespective of the hour it seemed to him that his wife must open the door as his steps and his sons made themselves heard on the walk between the box borders in their upper orchard and he faltered a little  look here father said his son detecting his hesitation why dont you let mary come in with you and help you find those things  no no said kenton sinking into one of the wooden seats that flanked the doorway i promised your mother that i would get them myself you know women dont like to have other women going through their houses  yes but mary his son urged  ah its just mary with her perfect housekeeping that your mother wouldnt like to have see the way she left things said kenton and he smiled at the notion of any one being housekeeper enough to find a flaw in his wifes my but this is pleasant he added he took off his hat and let the breeze play through the lank thin hair which was still black on his fine high forehead he was a very handsome old man with a delicate aquiline profile of the perfect roman type which is perhaps oftener found in america than ever it was in rome youve kept it very nice dick he said with a generalizing wave of his hat  well i couldnt tell whether you would be coming back or not and i thought i had better be ready for you  i wish we were said the old man and we shall be in the fall or the latter part of the summer but its better now that we should goon ellens account  oh youll enjoy it his son evaded him  you havent seen anything of him lately kenton suggested  he wasnt likely to let me see anything of him returned the son  no said the father well he rose to put the key into the door and his son stepped down from the little porch to the brick walk  mary will have dinner early father and when youve got through here youd better come over and lie down a while beforehand  kenton had been dropped at eight oclock from a sleeper on the great three and had refused breakfast at his sons house upon the plea that the porter had given him a southern cantaloupe and a cup of coffee on the train and he was no longer hungry  all right he said i wont be longer than i can help he had got the door open and was going to close it again  his son laughed better not shut it father it will let the fresh air in  oh all right said the old man  the son lingered about giving some orders to the hired man in the vegetable garden for an excuse in the hope that his father might change his mind and ask him to come into the house with him he felt it so forlorn for him to be going through those lifeless rooms alone when he looked round and saw his father holding the door ajar as if impatiently waiting for him to be gone he laughed and waved his hand to him all right father im going now but though he treated the matter so lightly with his father he said grimly to his wife as he passed her on their own porch on his way to his once i dont like to think of father being driven out of house and home this way  neither do i dick but it cant be helped can it  i think i could help it if i got my hands on that fellow once  no you couldnt dick its not he thats doing it its ellen you know that well enough and youve just got to stand it  yes i suppose so said richard kenton  of course my heart aches for your poor old father but so it would if ellen had some kind of awful sickness it is a kind of sickness and you cant fight it any more than if she really was sick  no said the husband dejectedly you just slip over there after a while mary if fathers gone too long will you i dont like to have him there alone  deed and deed i wont dick he wouldnt like it at all my spying round nothing can happen to him and i believe your mothers just made an excuse to send him after something so that he can be in there alone and realize that the house isnt home any more it will be easier for him to go to europe when he finds that out i believe in my heart that was her idea in not wanting me to find the things for him and im not going to meddle myself  with the fatuity of a man in such things and with the fatuity of age regarding all the things of the past kenton had thought in his homesickness of his house as he used to be in it and had never been able to picture it without the family life as he now walked through the empty rooms and up and down the stairs his pulse beat low as if in the presence of death everything was as they had left it when they went out of the house and it appeared to kenton that nothing had been touched there since though when he afterwards reported to his wife that there was not a speck of dust anywhere she knew that mary had been going through the house in their absence not once only but often and she felt a pang of grateful jealousy he got together the things that mrs kenton had pretended to want and after glancing in at the different rooms which seemed to be lying stealthily in wait for him with their emptiness and silence he went downstairs with the bundle he had made and turned into his library he had some thought of looking at the collections for his history but after pulling open one of the drawers in which they were stored he pushed it to again and sank listlessly into his leathercovered swivelchair which stood in its place before the wide writingtable and seemed to have had him in it before he sat down the table was bare except for the books and documents which he had sent home from time to time during the winter and which richard or his wife had neatly arranged there without breaking their wraps he let fall his bundle at his feet and sat staring at the ranks of books against the wall mechanically relating them to the different epochs of the past in which he or his wife or his children had been interested in them and aching with tender pain he had always supposed himself a happy and strong and successful man but what a dreary ruin his life had fallen into was it to be finally so helpless and powerless for with all the defences about him that a man can have he felt himself fatally vulnerable that he had fought so many years why at his age should he be going into exile away from everything that could make his days bright and sweet why could not he come back there where he was now more solitary than he could be anywhere else on earth and reanimate the dead body of his home with his old life he knew why in an immediate sort but his quest was for the cause behind the cause what had he done or left undone he had tried to be a just man and fulfil all his duties both to his family and to his neighbors he had wished to be kind and not to harm any one he reflected how as he had grown older the dread of doing any unkindness had grown upon him and how he had tried not to be proud but to walk meekly and humbly why should he be punished as he was stricken in a place so sacred that the effort to defend himself had seemed a kind of sacrilege he could not make it out and he was not aware of the tears of selfpity that stole slowly down his face though from time to time he wiped them away  he heard steps in the hall without advancing and pausing which must be those of his son coming back for him and with these advances and pauses giving him notice of his approach but he did not move and at first he did not look up when the steps arrived at the threshold of the room where he sat when he lifted his eyes at last he saw bittridge lounging in the doorway with one shoulder supported against the doorjamb his hands in his pockets and his hat pushed well back on his forehead in an instant all kentons humility and soft repining were gone well what is it he called  oh said bittridge coming forward he laughed and explained didnt know if you recognized me  i recognized you said kenton fiercely what is it you want  well i happened to be passing and i saw the door open and i thought maybe dick was here  it was on kentons tongue to say that it was a good thing for him dick was not there but partly the sense that this would be unbecoming bluster and partly the suffocating resentment of the fellows impudence limited his response to a formless gasp and bittridge went on but im glad to find you here judge i didnt know that you were in town family all well in new york he was not quelled by the silence of the judge on this point but as if he had not expected any definite reply to what might well pass for formal civility he now looked aslant into his breastpocket from which he drew a folded paper i just got hold of a document this morning that i think will interest you i was bringing it round to dicks wife for you the intolerable familiarity of all this was fast working kenton to a violent explosion but he contained himself and bittridge stepped forward to lay the paper on the table before him its the original roster of company c in your regiment and  take it away shouted kenton and take yourself away with it and he grasped the stick that shook in his hand  a wicked light came into bittridges eye as he drawled in lazy scorn oh i dont know then his truculence broke in a malicious amusement why judge whats the matter he put on a face of mock gravity and kenton knew with helpless fury that he was enjoying his vantage he could fall upon him and beat him with his stick leaving the situation otherwise undefined but a moments reflection convinced kenton that this would not do it made him sick to think of striking the fellow as if in that act he should be striking ellen too it did not occur to him that he could be physically worsted or that his vehement age would be no match for the others vigorous youth all he thought was that it would not avail except to make known to every one what none but her dearest could now conjecture bittridge could then publicly say and doubtless would say that he had never made love to ellen that if there had been any lovemaking it was all on her side and that he had only paid her the attentions which any young man might blamelessly pay a pretty girl this would be true to the facts in the case though it was true also that he had used every tacit art to make her believe him in love with her but how could this truth be urged and to whom so far the affair had been quite in the hands of ellens family and they had all acted for the best up to the present time they had given bittridge no grievance in making him feel that he was unwelcome in their house and they were quite within their rights in going away and making it impossible for him to see her again anywhere in tuskingum as for his seeing her in new york ellen had but to say that she did not wish it and that would end it now however by treating him rudely kenton was aware that he had bound himself to render bittridge some account of his behavior throughout if the fellow insisted upon it  i want nothing to do with you sir he said less violently but as he felt not more effectually you are in my house without my invitation and against my wish  i didnt expect to find you here i came in because i saw the door open and i thought i might see dick or his wife and give them this paper for you but im glad i found you and if you wont give me any reason for not wanting me here i can give it myself and i think i can make out a very good case for you kenton quivered in anticipation of some mention of ellen and bittridge smiled as if he understood but he went on to say i know that there were things happened after you first gave me the run of your house that might make you want to put up the bars againif they were true but they were not true and i can prove that by the best of all possible witnessesby uphill himself he stands shoulder to shoulder with me to make it hot for any one who couples his wifes name with mine  humph kenton could not help making this comment and bittridge being what he was could not help laughing  whats the use he asked recovering himself i dont pretend that i did right but you know there wasnt any harm in it and if there had been i should have got the worst of it honestly judge i couldnt tell you how much i prized being admitted to your house on the terms i was dont you think i could appreciate the kindness you all showed me before you took me up i was alone in tuskingum but you opened every door in the place for me you made it home to me and you wont believe it of course because youre prejudiced but i felt like a son and brother to you all i felt towards mrs kenton just as i do towards my own mother i lost the best friends i ever had when you turned against me dont you suppose ive seen the difference here in tuskingum of course the men pass the time of day with me when we meet but they dont look me up and there are more nearsighted girls in this town kenton could not keep the remote dawn of a smile out of his eyes and bittridge caught the faroff gleam and everybodys been away the whole winter not a soul at home anywhere and i had to take my chance of surprising mrs dick kenton when i saw your door open here he laughed forlornly as the gleam faded out of kentons eye again and the worst of it is that my own mother isnt at home to me figuratively speaking when i go over to see her at ballardsville she got wind of my misfortune somehow and when i made a clean breast of it to her she said she could never feel the same to me till i had made it all right with the kentons and when a mans own mother is down on him judge  bittridge left kenton to imagine the desperate case and in spite of his disbelief in the man and all he said kenton could not keep his hardness of heart towards him i dont know what youre after young man he began but if you expect me to receive you under my roof again  oh i dont judge i dont bittridge interposed all i want is to be able to tell my motheri dont care for anybody elsethat i saw you and you allowed me to say that i was truly sorry for the painif it was pain or annoyance anywaythat i had caused you and to go back to her with the hope of atoning for it sometime or somehow thats all  look here cried renton what have you written to my daughter for  wasnt that natural i prized her esteem more than i do yours even but did i ask her anything more than ive asked you i didnt expect her to answer me all i wanted was to have her believe that i wasnt as black as i was paintednot inside anyway you know well enoughanybody knowsthat i would rather have her think well of me than any one else in this world except my mother i havent got the gift of showing out whats good in me if there is any good but i believe miss ellen would want to think well of me if i gave her a chance if ever there was an angel on earth shes one i dont deny that i was hopeful of mercy from her because she cant think evil but i can lay my hand on my heart and say that i wasnt selfish in my hopes it seemed to me that it was her due to understand that a man whom she had allowed to be her friend wasnt altogether unworthy thats as near as i can come to putting into words the motive i had in writing to her i cant even begin to put into words the feeling i have towards her its as if she was something sacred  this was the feeling renton himself had towards his daughter and for the first time he found himself on common ground with the scapegrace who professed it and whose light mocking face so little enforced his profession if bittridge could have spoken in the dark his words might have carried a conviction of his sincerity but there in plain day confronting the father of ellen who had every wish to believe him true the effect was different deep within his wish to think the man honest kenton recoiled from him he vaguely perceived that it was because she could not think evil that this wretch had power upon her and he was sensible as he had not been before that she had no safety from him except in absence he did not know what to answer he could not repel him in open terms and still less could he meet him with any words that would allow him to resume his former relations with his family he said finally we will let matters stand we are going to europe in a week and i shall not see you again i will tell mrs kenton what you say  thank you judge and tell her that i appreciate your kindness more than i can say the judge rose from his chair and went towards the window which he had thrown open going to shut up let me help you with that window it seems to stick everything fast upstairs  ii think so kenton hesitated  ill just run up and look said bittridge and he took the stairs two at a time before kenton could protest when they came out into the hall together its all right he reported on his quick return ill just look round below here and he explored the groundfloor rooms in turn no you hadnt opened any other window he said glancing finally into the library shall i leave this paper on your table  yes leave it there said kenton helplessly and he let bittridge close the front door after him and lock it  i hope miss lottie is well he suggested in handing the key to kenton and boyne he added with the cordiality of an old family friend i hope boyne has got reconciled to new york a little he was rather anxious about his pigeons when he left i understand but i guess dicks man has looked after them id have offered to take charge of the cocoons myself if id had a chance he walked gayly chatting across the intervening lawn with kenton to his sons door where at sight of him bra richard kenton evanesced into the interior so obviously that bittridge could not offer to come in well i shall see you all when you come back in the fall judge and i hope youll have a pleasant voyage and a good time in europe  thank you said kenton briefly  remember me to the ladies and bittridge took off his hat with his left hand while he offered the judge his right well goodbye  kenton made what response he could and escaped indoors where his daughterinlaw appeared from the obscurity into which she had retired from bittridge well that follow does beat all how in the world did he find you father  he came into the house said the judge much abashed at his failure to deal adequately with bittridge he felt it the more in the presence of his sons wife i couldnt seem to get rid of him in any way short of kicking him out  no theres nothing equal to his impudence i do believe he would have come in here if he hadnt seen me first did you tell him when you were going back father because hed be at the train to see you off just as sure  no i didnt tell him said kenton feeling move shaken now from the interview with bittridge than he had realized before he was ashamed to let mary know that he had listened to bittridges justification which he now perceived was none and he would have liked to pretend that he had not silently condoned his offences but mary did not drive him to these deceptions by any further allusions to bittridge  well now you must go into the sittingroom and lie down on the lounge i promised dick to make you or would you rather go upstairs to your room  i think ill go to my room said kenton  he was asleep there on the bed when richard came home to dinner and looked softly in he decided not to wake him and mary said the sleep would do him more good than the dinner at table they talked him over and she told her husband what she knew of the mornings adventure  that was pretty tough for father said richard i wouldnt go into the house with him because i knew he wanted to have it to himself and then to think of that dirty hound skulking in well perhaps its for the best it will make it easier for father to go and leave the place and theyve got to go theyve got to put the atlantic ocean between ellen and that fellow  it does seem as if something might be done his wife rebelled  theyve done the best that could be done said richard and if that skunk hasnt got some sort of new hold upon father i shall be satisfied the worst of it is that it will be all over town in an hour that bittridge has made up with us i dont blame father he couldnt help it he never could be rude to anybody  i think ill try if i cant be rude to mr bittridge if he ever undertakes to show in my pretence that he has made it up with us said mary  richard tenderly found out from his fathers shamefaced reluctance later that no great mischief had been done but no precaution on his part availed to keep bittridge from demonstrating the good feeling between himself and the kentons when the judge started for new york the next afternoon he was there waiting to see him off and he all but took the adieus out of richards hands he got possession of the judges valise and pressed past the porter into the sleepingcar with it and remained lounging on the arm of the judges seat making conversation with him and richard till the train began to move then he ran outside and waved his hand to the judges window in farewell before all that leisure of tuskingum which haunted the arrival and departure of the trains  mary kenton was furious when her husband came home and reported the fact to her  how in the world did he find out when father was going  he must have come to all the through trains since he say him yesterday but i think even you would have been suited mary if you had seen his failure to walk off from the depot arminarm with me  i wouldnt have been suited with anything short of your knocking him down dick  oh that wouldnt have done said richard after a while he added patiently ellen is making a good deal of trouble for us  this was what mary was thinking herself and it was what she might have said but since dick had said it she was obliged to protest she isnt to blame for it  oh i know she isnt to blame     v  the father of the unhappy girl was of the same mixed mind as he rode sleeplessly back to new york in his berth and heard the noises of slumber all round him from time to time he groaned softly and turned from one cheek to the other every halfhour or so he let his windowcurtain fly up and lay watching the landscape fleeting past and then he pulled the curtain down again and tried to sleep after passing albany he dozed but at poughkeepsie a zealous porter called him by mistake and the rest of the way to new york he sat up in the smokingroom it seemed a long while since he had drowsed the thin nap had not rested him and the old face that showed itself in the glass with the frost of a two days beard on it was dryeyed and limply squared by the fall of the muscles at the corners of the chin  he wondered how he should justify to his wife the thing which he felt as accountable for having happened to him as if he could have prevented it it would not have happened of course if he had not gone to tuskingum and she could say that to him now it seemed to him that his going which had been so imperative before he went was altogether needless nothing but harm had come of it and it had been a selfish indulgence of a culpable weakness  it was a little better for kenton when he found himself with his family and they went down together to the breakfast which the mother had engaged the younger children to make as pleasant as they could for their father and not worry him with talk about tuskingum they had in fact got over their first season of homesickness and were postponing their longing for tuskingum till their return from europe when they would all go straight out there kenton ran the gauntlet of welcome from the black elevatorboys and bellboys and the headwaiter who went before him to pull out the judges chair with commanding frowns to his underlings to do the like for the rest of the family and as his own clumsy irish waiter stood behind his chair breathing heavily upon the judges head he gave his order for breakfast with a curious sense of having got home again from some strange place he satisfied boyne that his pigeons and poultry had been well cared for through the winter and he told lottie that he had not met much of anybody except dicks family before he recollected seeing half a dozen of her young men at differed times she was not very exacting about them and her mind seemed set upon europe or at least she talked of nothing else ellen was quiet as she always was but she smiled gently on her father and mrs kenton told him of the girls preparations for going and congratulated herself on their wisdom in having postponed their sailing in view of all they had to do and she made kenton feel that everything was in the best possible shape as soon as she got him alone in their own room she said well what is it poppa  then he had to tell her and she listened with ominous gravity she did not say that now he could see how much better it would have been if he had not gone but she made him say it for her and she would not let him take comfort in the notion of keeping the fact of his interview with bittridge from ellen it would be worse than useless he will write to her about it and then she will know that we have been concealing it  kenton was astonished at himself for not having thought of that and what are you going to do sarah  i am going to tell her said mrs kenton  why didnt poppa tell me before the girl perversely demanded as soon as her another had done so  ellen you are a naughty child i have a great mind not to have a word more to say to you your father hasnt been in the house an hour did you want him to speak before lottie and boyne  i dont see why he didnt tell me himself i know there is something you are keeping back i know there is some word  oh you poor girl said her mother melting into pity against all sense of duty have we ever tried to deceive you  no ellen sobbed with her face in her hands now i will tell you every word that passed said mrs kenton and she told as well as she could remember all that the judge had repeated from bittridge i dont say he isnt ashamed of himself she commented at the end he ought to be and of course he would be glad to be in with us again when we go back but that doesnt alter his character ellen still if you cant see that yourself i dont want to make you and if you would rather go home to tuskingum we will give up the trip to europe  its too late to do that now said the girl in cruel reproach  her mother closed her lips resolutely till she could say or you can write to him if you want to  i dont want to said ellen and she dragged herself up out of her chair and trailed slowly out of the room without looking at her mother  well the judge asked impatiently when he came in as soon after this as he decently could they observed forms with regard to talking about ellen which after all were rather for themselves than for her mrs kenton at least knew that the girl knew when they were talking about her  she took it as well as i expected  what is she going to do  she didnt say but i dont believe she will do anything  i wish i had taken our tickets for next saturday said kenton  well we must wait now said his wife if he doesnt write to her she wont write to him  has she ever answered that letter of his  no and i dont believe she will now  that night ellen came to her mother and said she need not be afraid of her writing to bittridge he hasnt changed if he was wrong by coming and saying those things to poppa and nothing has changed  that is the way i hoped you would see it ellen her mother looked wistfully at her but the girl left her without letting her satisfy the longing in the mothers heart to put her arms round her child and pull her head down upon her breast for a cry  kenton slept better that night than his wife who was kept awake by a formless foreboding for the week that followed she had the sense of literally pushing the hours away so that at times she found herself breathless as if from some heavy physical exertion at such times she was frantic with the wish to have the days gone and the day of their sailing come but she kept her impatience from her husband and children and especially from ellen the girl was passive enough she was almost willing and in the preparation for their voyage she did her share of the shopping and discussed the difficult points of this business with her mother and sister as if she had really been thinking about it all but her mother doubted if she had and made more of ellens sunken eyes and thin face than of her intelligent and attentive words it was these that she reported to her husband whom she kept from talking with ellen and otherwise quelled  let her alone she insisted one morning of the last week what can you do by speaking to her about it dont you see that she is making the best fight she can you will weaken her if you interfere its less than a week now and if you can only hold out i know she can  kenton groaned well i suppose youre right sarah but i dont like the idea of forcing her to go unless  then you had better write to that fellow and ask him to come and get her  this shut kentons mouth and he kept on with his shaving when he had finished he felt fresher if not stronger and he went down to breakfast which he had alone not only with reference to his own family but all the other guests of the hotel he was always so early that sometimes the diningroom was not open when this happened he used to go and buy a newspaper at the clerks desk for it was too early then for the newsstand to be open it happened so that morning and he got his paper without noticing the young man who was writing his name in the hotel register but who looked briskly up when the clerk bade kenton goodmorning by name  why judge he said and he put out a hand which kenton took with trembling reluctance and a dazed stare i thought you sailed last saturday  we sail next saturday said kenton  well well then i misunderstood said bittridge and he added why this is money found in the road how are all the family ive got my mother here with me brought her on for a kind of a little outing shell be the most surprised woman in new york when i tell her youre here yet we came to this hotel because we knew you had been here but we didnt suppose you were here well this is too good i saw dick friday but he didnt say anything about your sailing i suppose he thought i knew didnt you tell me you were going in a week that day in your house  perhaps i did kenton faltered out his eyes fixed on bittridges with a helpless fascination  well it dont matter so long as youre here mothers in the parlor waiting for me i wont risk taking you to her now judgeright off the train you know but i want to bring her to call on mrs kenton as soon after breakfast as youll let me she just idolizes mrs kenton from what ive told her about her our rooms ready he turned to the clerk and the clerk called front to a bellboy who ran up and took bittridges handbaggage and stood waiting to follow him into the parlor well you must excuse me now judge so long he said gayly and kenton crept feebly away to the diningroom  he must have eaten breakfast but he was not aware of doing so and the events of his leaving the table and going up in the elevator and finding himself in his wifes presence did not present themselves consecutively though they must all have successively occurred it did not seem to him that he could tell what he knew but he found himself doing it and her hearing it with strange quiet  very well she said i must tell ellen and if she wishes we must stay in and wait for their call  yes the judge mechanically consented  it was painful for mrs kenton to see how the girl flushed when she announced the fact of bittridges presence for she knew what a strife of hope and shame and pride there was in ellens heart at first she said that she did not wish to see him and then when mrs kenton would not say whether she had better see him or not she added vaguely if he has brought his mother  i think we must see them ellen you wouldnt wish to think you had been unkind and he might be hurt on his mothers account he seems really fond of her and perhaps  no there isnt any perhaps momma said the girl gratefully but i think we had better see them too i think we had better all see them  just as you please ellen if you prefer to meet them alone  i dont prefer that i want poppa to be there and lottie and boyne even  boyne objected when he was told that his presence was requested at this family rite and he would have excused himself if the invitation had been of the form that one might decline what do i want to see him for he puffed he never cared anything about me in tuskingum whats he want here anyway  i wish you to come in my son said his mother and that ended it  lottie was not so tractable very well momma she said but dont expect me to speak to him i have some little selfrespect if the rest of you havent am i going to shake hands with him i never took the least notice of him at home and im not going to here  bittridge decided the question of handshaking for her when they met he greeted her glooming brother with a jolly hello boyne and without waiting for the boys tardy response he said hello lottie to the girl and took her hand and kept it in his while he made an elaborate compliment to her good looks and her gain in weight she had come tardily as a proof that she would not have come in at all if she had not chosen to do so and mrs bittridge was already seated beside ellen on the sofa holding her hand and trying to keep her mobile inattentive eyes upon ellens face she was a little woman youthfully dressed but not dressed youthfully enough for the dry yellow hair which curled tightly in small rings on her skull like the wig of a ragdoll her restless eyes were round and deepset with the lids flung up out of sight she had a lax formless mouth and an anxious smile with which she constantly watched her son for his initiative while she recollected herself from time to time long enough to smooth ellens hand between her own and say oh i just think the world of clarence and i guess he thinks his mother is about right too and then did not heed what ellen answered  the girl said very little and it was bittridge who talked for all dominating the room with a large satisfied presence in which the judge sat withdrawn his forehead supported on his hand and his elbow on the table mrs kenton held herself upright with her hands crossed before her stealing a look now and then at her daughters averted face but keeping her eyes from mrs bittridge who whenever she caught mrs kentons glance said something to her about her clarence and how he used to write home to her at ballardsville about the kentons so that she felt acquainted with all of them her reminiscences were perfunctory mrs bittridge had voluntarily but one topic and that was herself either as she was included in the interest her son must inspire or as she included him in the interest she must inspire she said that now they had met at last she was not going to rest till the kentons had been over to ballardsville and made her a good long visit her son had some difficulty in making her realize that the kentons were going to europe then she laughed and said she kept forgetting and she did wish they were all coming back to tuskingum  if it is a merit to treat a fatuous mother with deference bittridge had that merit his deference was of the caressing and laughing sort which took the spectator into the joke of her peculiarities as something they would appreciate and enjoy with him she had been a kittenish and petted person in her youth perhaps and now she petted herself after she had long ceased to be a kitten what was respectable and what was pathetic in her was her wish to promote her sons fortunes with the kentons but she tried to do this from not a very clear understanding of her part apparently and little sense of the means for ellens sake rather than hers the father and mother received her overtures to their liking kindly they answered her patiently and mrs kenton even tried to lead the way for her to show herself at her best by talking of her journey on to new york and of the city and what she would see there to interest her lottie and boyne sternly aloof together in one of their momentary alliances listened to her replies with a silent contempt that almost included their mother kenton bore with the woman humbly and sadly  he was in fact rather bewildered with the situation for which he felt himself remotely if not immediately responsible bittridge was there among them not only on good terms but apparently in the character of a more than tolerated pretendant to ellens favor there were passages of time is which the father was not sure that the fellow was not engaged to his daughter though when these instants were gone he was aware that there had been no overt lovemaking between them and bittridge had never offered himself what was he doing there then the judge asked himself that without being able to answer himself so far as he could make out his wife and he were letting him see ellen and show her off to his mother mainly to disgust her with them both and because they were afraid that if they denied her to him it would be the worse for them through her suffering the judge was not accustomed to apply the tests by which people are found vulgar or not these were not of his simple world all that he felt about mrs bittridge was that she was a very foolish false person who was true in nothing but her admiration of her rascal of a son he did not think of bittridge as a rascal violently but helplessly and with a heart that melted in pity for ellen  he longed to have these people gone not so much because he was so unhappy in their presence as because he wished to learn ellens feeling about them from his wife she would know whether allen said anything to her or not but perhaps if mrs kenton had been asked to deliver her mind on this point at once she would have been a little puled all that she could see and she saw it with a sinking of the heart was that ellen looked more at peace than she had been since bittridge was last in their house at tuskingum her eyes covertly followed him as he sat talking or went about the room making himself at home among them as if he were welcome with every one he joked her more than the rest and accused her of having become a regular newyorker he said he supposed that when she came back from europe she would not know anybody in tuskingum and his mother playing with ellens fingers as if they had been the fringe of a tassel declared that she must not mind him for he carried on just so with everybody at the same time she ordered him to stop or she would go right out of the room  she gave no other sign of going and it was her son who had to make the movement for her at last she apparently did not know that it was her part to make it she said that now the kentons must come and return her call and be real neighborly just the same as if they were all at home together when her son shook hands with every one she did so too and she said to each well i wish you goodmorning and let him push her before him in high delight with the joke out of the room  when they were gone the kentons sat silent ellen with a rapt smile on her thin flushed face till lottie said you forgot to ask him if we might breathe poppa and paced out of the room in stately scorn followed by boyne who had apparently no words at the command of his dumb rage kenton wished to remain and he looked at his wife for instruction she frowned and he took this for a sign that he had better go and he went with a light sigh  he did not know what else to do with himself and he went down to the readingroom he found bittridge there smoking a cigar and the young man companionably offered to bestow one upon him but the judge stiffly refused saying he did not wish to smoke just then he noted that bittridge was still in his character of family favorite and his hand trembled as he passed it over the smooth knob of his stick while he sat waiting for the fellow to take himself away but bittridge had apparently no thought of going he was looking at the amusements for the evening in a paper he had bought and he wished to consult the judge as to which was the best theatre to go to that night he said he wanted to take his mother kenton professed not to know much about the new york theatres and then bittridge guessed he must get the clerk to tell him but still he did not part with the judge he sat down beside him and told him how glad he was to see his family looking so well especially miss ellen he could not remember ever seeing her so stronglooking he said that girl had captured his mother who was in love with pretty much the whole kenton family though  and bytheway he added i want to thank you and mrs kenton judge for the way you received my mother you made her feel that she was among friends she cant talk about anything else and i guess i shant have much trouble in making her stay in new york as long as youre here she was inclined to be homesick the fact is though i dont care to have it talked about yet and i wish you wouldnt say anything to dick about it when you write home i think of settling in new york ive been offered a show in the advertising department of one of the big dailiesim not at liberty to say whichand its a tossup whether i stay here or go to washington ive got a chance there too but its on the staff of a new enterprise and im not sure about it ive brought my mother along to let her have a look at both places though she doesnt know it and id rather you wouldnt speak of it before her im going to take her on to washington before we go back i want to have my mother with me judge its better for a fellow to have that homefeeling in a large place from the start it keeps him out of a lot of things and i dont pretend to be better than other people or not more superhuman if ive been able to keep out of scrapes its more because ive had my mother near me and i dont intend ever to be separated from her after this till i have a home of my own shes been the guidingstar of my life  kenton was unable to make any formal response and in fact he was so preoccupied with the question whether the fellow was more a fool or a fraud that he made no answer at all beyond a few inarticulate grumblings of assent these sufficed for bittridge apparently for he went on contentedly whenever ive been tempted to go a little wild the thought of how mother would feel has kept me on the track like nothing else would no judge there isnt anything in this world like a good mother except the right kind of a wife  kenton rose and said he believed he must go upstairs bittridge said all right ill see you later judge and swung easily off to advise with the clerk as to the best theatre     vi  kenton was so unhappy that he could not wait for his wife to come to him in their own room he broke in upon her and ellen in the parlor and at his coming the girl flitted out in the noiseless fashion which of late had made her father feel something ghostlike in her he was afraid she was growing to dislike him and trying to avoid him and now he presented himself quite humbly before his wife as if he had done wrong in coming he began with a sort of apology for interrupting but his wife said it was all right and she added we were not talking about anything in particular she was silent and then she added again sometimes i think ellen hasnt very fine perceptions after all she doesnt seem to feel about people as i supposed she would  you mean that she doesnt feel as you would suppose about those people  mrs kenton answered obliquely she thinks its a beautiful thing in him to be so devoted to his mother  humph and what does she think of his mother  she thinks she has very pretty hair  mrs kenton looked gravely down at the work she had in her hands and kenton did not know what to make of it all he decided that his wife must feel as he did a doubt of the childs sincerity with sense of her evasiveness more tolerant than his own yet he knew that if it came to a question of forcing ellen to do what was best for her or forbidding her to do what was worst his wife would have all the strength for the work and he none he asked her hopelessly enough do you think she still cares for him  i think she wishes to give him another trial i hope she will kenton was daunted and he showed it she has got to convince herself and we have got to let her she believes of course that hes here on her account and that flatters her why should she be so different from other girls mrs kenton demanded of the angry protest in her husbands eye  his spirit fell and he said i only wish she were more like them  well then she is just as headstrong and as silly when it comes to a thing like this our only hope is to let her have her own way  do you suppose he cares for her after all  mrs kenton was silent as if in exhaustive selfquestion then she answered no i dont in that way but he believes he can get her  then sarah i think we have a duty to the poor child you must tell her what you have told me  mrs kenton smiled rather bitterly in recognition of the fact that the performance of their common duty must fall wholly to her but she merely said there is no need of my telling her she knows it already  and she would take him in spite of knowing that he didnt really care for her  i dont say that she wouldnt own it to herself  and what are you going to do  nothing we must let things take their course  they had a great deal more talk that came to the same end they played their sad comedy he in the part of a father determined to save his child from herself and she in hers of resisting and withholding him it ended as it had so often ended beforehe yielded with more faith in her wisdom than she had herself  at luncheon the bittridges could not join the kentons or be asked to do so because the table held only four but they stopped on their way to their own table the mother to bridle and toss in affected reluctance while the son bragged how he had got the last two tickets to be had that night for the theatre where he was going to take his mother he seemed to think that the fact had a special claim on the judges interest and she to wish to find out whether mrs kenton approved of theatregoing she said she would not think of going in ballardsville but she supposed it was more rulable in new york  during the afternoon she called at the kenton apartment to consult the ladies about what she ought to wear she said she had nothing but a black barege along and would that do with the hat she had on she had worn it to let them see and now she turned her face from aide to side to give them the effect of the plumes that fell like a dishevelled featherduster round and over the crown mrs kenton could only say that it would do but she believed that it was the custom now for ladies to take their hats off in the theatre  mrs bittridge gave a hoarse laugh oh dear then ill have to fix my hair two ways i dont know what clarence will say  the mention of her sons name opened the way for her to talk of him in relation to herself and the rest of her stay passed in the celebration of his filial virtues which had been manifest from the earliest period she could not remember that she ever had to hit the child a lick she said or that he had ever made her shed a tear  when she went boyne gloomily inquired what makes her hair so much darker at the roots than it is at the points and his mother snubbed him promptly  you had no business to be here boyne i dont like boys hanging about where ladies are talking together and listening  this did not prevent lottie from answering directly for boyne and indirectly for ellen its because its begun to grow since the last bleach  it was easier to grapple with boyne than with lottie and mrs kenton was willing to allow her to leave the room with her brother unrebuked she was even willing to have had the veil lifted from mrs bittridges hair with a rude hand if it world help ellen  i dont want you to think momma said the girl that i didnt know about her hair or that i dont see how silly she is but its all the more to his credit if he can be so good to her and admire her would you like him better if he despised her  mrs kenton felt both the defiance and the secret shame from which it sprang in her daughters words and she waited for a moment before she answered i would like to be sure he didnt  if he does and if he hides it from her its the same as if he didnt its better but you all wish to dislike him  we dont wish to dislike him ellen goodness knows but i dont think he would care much whether we disliked him or not i am sure your poor father and i would be only too glad to like him  lottie wouldnt said ellen with a resentment her mother found pathetic it was so feeble and aimless  lottie doesnt matter she said she could not make out how nearly ellen was to sharing the common dislike or how far she would go in fortifying herself against it she kept with difficulty to her negative frankness and she let the girl leave the room with a fretful sigh as if provoked that her mother would not provoke her further there were moments when mrs kenton believed that ellen was sick of her love and that she would pluck it out of her heart herself if she were left alone she was then glad bittridge had come so that ellen might compare with the reality the counterfeit presentment she had kept in her fancy and she believed that if she could but leave him to do his worst it would be the best for ellen  in the evening directly after dinner bittridge sent up his name for mrs kenton the judge had remained to read his paper below and lottie and boyne had gone to some friends in another apartment it seemed to mrs kenton a piece of luck that she should be able to see him alone and she could not have said that she was unprepared for him to come in holding his theatretickets explanatorily in his hand or surprised when he began  mrs kenton my mothers got a bad headache and ive come to ask a favor of you she cant use her ticket for tonight and i want you to let miss ellen come with me will you  bittridge had constituted himself an old friend of the whole family from the renewal of their acquaintance and mrs kenton was now made aware of his being her peculiar favorite in spite of the instant repulsion she felt she was not averse to what he proposed her fear was that ellen would be so or that she could keep from influencing her to this test of her real feeling for bittridge i will ask her mr bittridge she said with a severity which was a preliminary of the impartiality she meant to use with ellen  well thats right he answered and while she went to the girls room he remained examining the details of the drawingroom decorations in easy security which mrs kenton justified on her return  ellen will be ready to go with you mr bittridge  well thats good said the young man and while he talked on she sat wondering at a nature which all modesty and deference seemed left out of though he had sometimes given evidence of his intellectual appreciation of these things he talked to mrs kenton not only as if they were in everywise equal but as if they were of the same age almost of the same sex  ellen came in cloaked and hatted with her delicate face excited in prospect of the adventure and her mother saw bittridge look at her with more tenderness than she had ever seen in him before ill take good care of her mrs kenton he said and for the first time she felt herself relent a little towards him  a minute after they were gone lottie bounced into the room followed by boyne  momma she shouted ellen isnt going to the theatre with that fellow  yes she is  and you let her momma without a chaperon  boynes face had mirrored the indignation in his sisters but at this unprecedented burst of conventionality he forgot their momentary alliance well youre a pretty one to talk about chaperons walking all over tuskingum with fellows at night and going buggyriding with everybody and out rowing and here fairly begging jim plumpton to come down to the steamer and see you off again  shut up lottie violently returned or ill tell momma how youve been behaving with rita plumpton yourself  well tell boyne defied her  oh it dont matter what a brat of a boy says or does anyway said lottie but i think ellen is disgracing the family everybody in the hotel is laughing at that wiggy old mrs bittridge with her wobbly eyes and they can see that hes just as green the plumptons have been laughing so about them and i told them that we had nothing to do with them at home and had fairly turned bittridge out of the house but he had impudence enough for anything and now to find ellen going off to the theatre with him alone  lottie began to cry with vexation as she whipped out of the room and boyne who felt himself drawn to her side again said very seriously well it aint the thing in new york you know momma and anybody can see what a jay bittridge is i think its too bad to let her  it isnt for you to criticise your mother boyne said mrs kenton but she was more shaken than she would allow her own traditions were so simple that the point of etiquette which her children had urged had not occurred to her the question whether ellen should go with bittridge at all being decided she would of course go in new york as she would go in tuskingum now mrs kenton perceived that she must not and she had her share of humiliation in the impression which his mother as her friend apparently was making with her childrens acquaintances in the hotel if they would think everybody in tuskingum was like her it would certainly be very unpleasant but she would not quite own this to herself still less to a fourteenyearold boy i think what your father and i decide to be right will be sufficient excuse for you with your friends  does father know it boyne asked most unexpectedly  having no other answer ready mrs kenton said you had better go to bed my son  well he grumbled as he left the room i dont know where all the pride of the kentons is gone to  in his sense of fallen greatness he attempted to join lottie in her room but she said go away nasty thing and boyne was obliged to seek his own room where he occupied himself with a contrivance he was inventing to enable you to close your door and turn off your gas by a system of pulleys without leaving your bed when you were tired of reading  mrs kenton waited for her husband in much less comfort and when he came and asked restlessly where are the children she first told him that lottie and boyne were in their rooms before she could bring herself to say that ellen had gone to the theatre with bittridge  it was some relief to have him take it in the dull way he did and to say nothing worse than did you think it was well to have her  you may be sure i didnt want her to but what would she have said if i had refused to let her go i can tell you it isnt an easy matter to manage her in this business and its very easy for you to criticise without taking the responsibility  im not criticising said kenton i know you have acted for the best  the children said mrs kenton wishing to be justified further think she ought to have had a chaperon i didnt think of that it isnt the custom at home but lottie was very saucy about it and i had to send boyne to bed i dont think our children are very much comfort to us  they are good children kenton said saidprovisionally  yes that is the worst of it if they were bad we wouldnt expect any comfort from them ellen is about perfect shes as near an angel as a child can be but she could hardly have given us more anxiety if she had been the worst girl in the world  thats true the father sadly assented  she didnt really want to go with him tonight ill say that for her and if i had said a single word against it she wouldnt have gone but all at once while she sat there trying to think how i could excuse her she began asking me what she should wear theres something strange about it rufus if i believed in hypnotism i should say she had gone because he willed her to go  i guess she went because she wanted to go because shes in love with him said kenton hopelessly  yes mrs kenton agreed i dont see how she can endure the sight of him hes handsome enough she added with a womans subjective logic and theres something fascinating about him hes very graceful and hes got a good figure  hes a hound said kenton exhaustively  oh yes hes a hound she sighed as if there could be no doubt on that point it dont seem right for him to be in the same room with ellen but its for her to say i feel more and more that we cant interfere without doing harm i suppose that if she were not so innocent herself she would realize what he was better but i do think he appreciates her innocence he shows more reverence for her than for any one else  how was it his mother didnt go asked kenton  she had a headache he said but i dont believe that he always intended to get ellen to go and thats another thing lottie was vexed about she says everybody is laughing at mrs bittridge and its mortifying to have people take her for a friend of ours  if there were nothing worse than that said kenton i guess we could live through it well i dont know how its going to all end  they sat talking sadly but finding a certain comfort in their mutual discouragement and in their knowledge that they were doing the best they could for their child whose freedom they must not infringe so far as to do what was absolutely best and the time passed not so heavily till her return this was announced by the mounting of the elevator to their landing and then by low rapid pleading in a mans voice outside kenton was about to open the door when there came the formless noise of what seemed a struggle and ellens voice rose in a muffed cry oh oh let me be go away i hate you kenton the door open and ellen burst in running to hide her face in her mothers breast where she sobbed out hehe kissed me like a terrified child more than an insulted woman through the open door came the clatter of bittridges feet as he ran downstairs     vii  when mrs kenton came from quieting the hysterical girl in her room she had the task almost as delicate and difficult of quieting her husband she had kept him by the most solemn and exhaustive entreaty from following bittridge downstairs and beating him with his stick and now she was answerable to him for his forbearance if you dont behave yourself rufus she had to say you will have some sort of stroke after all theres no harm done  no harm do you call it no harm for that hound to kiss ellen  he wouldnt have attempted it unless something had led up to it i suppose  sarah how can you speak so of that angel  oh that angel is a girl like the rest you kissed me before we were engaged  that was very different  i dont see how if your daughter is so sacred why wasnt her mother you men dont think your wives are sacred thats it  no no sarah its because i dont think of you as apart from myself that i cant think of you as i do of ellen i beg your pardon if i seemed to set her above you but when i kissed you we were very young and we lived in a simple day when such things meant no harm and i was very fond of you and you were the holiest thing in the world to me is ellen holy to that fellow  i know mrs kenton relented im not comparing him to you and there is a difference with ellen she isnt like other girls if it had been lottie  i shouldnt have liked it with lottie either said the major stiffly but if it had been lottie she would have boxed his ears for him instead of running to you lottie can take care of herself and i will take care of ellen when i see that scoundrel in the morning  what will you do an old man like you i can tell you its something youve just got to bear it if you dont want the scandal to fill the whole hotel its a very fortunate thing after all itll put an end to the whole affair  do you think so sarah if i believed that what does ellen say  nothing she wont say anythingjust cries and hides her face i believe she is ashamed of having made a scene before us but i know that shes so disgusted with him that she will never look at him again and if its brought her to that i should think his kissing her the greatest blessing in the world to us all yes ellen  mrs kenton hurried off at a faint call from the girls room and when she came again she sat down to a long discussion of the situation with her husband while she slowly took down her hair and prepared it for the night her conclusion which she made her husbands was that it was most fortunate they should be sailing so soon and that it was the greatest pity they were not sailing in the morning she wished him to sleep whether she slept herself or not and she put the most hopeful face possible upon the matter one thing you can rest assured of rufus and that is that its all over with ellen she may never speak to you about him and you mustnt ever mention him but she feels just as you could wish does that satisfy you some time i will tell you all she says  i dont care to hear said kenton all i want is for him to keep away from me i think if he spoke to me i should kill him  rufus  i cant help it sarah i feel outraged to the bottom of my soul i could kill him  mrs kenton turned her head and looked steadfastly at him over her shoulder if you strike him if you touch him mr kenton you will undo everything that the abominable wretch has done for ellen and you will close my mouth and tie my hands will you promise that under no provocation whatever will you do him the least harm i know ellen better than you do and i know that you will make her hate you unless  oh i will promise you neednt be afraid lord help me kenton groaned i wont touch him but dont expect me to speak to him  no i dont expect that he wont offer to speak to you  they slept and in the morning she stayed to breakfast with ellen in their apartment and let her husband go down with their younger children she could trust him now whatever form his further trial should take and he felt that he was pledging himself to her anew when bittridge came hilariously to meet him in the readingroom where he went for a paper after breakfast  ah judge said the young man gayly hello boyne he added to the boy who had come with his father lottie had gone directly upstairs from the breakfastroom i hope youre all well this morning play not too much for miss ellen  kenton looked him in the face without answering and then tried to get away from him but bittridge followed him up talking and ignoring his silence  it was a splendid piece judge you must take mrs kenton i know youll both like it i havent ever seen miss ellen so interested i hope the walk home didnt fatigue her i wanted to get a cab but she would walk the judge kept moving on with his head down he did not speak and bittridge was forced to notice his silence nothing the matter i hope with miss ellen judge  go away said the judge in a low voice fumbling the head of his stick  why whats up asked bittridge and he managed to get in front of kenton and stay him at a point where kenton could not escape it was a corner of the room to which the old man had aimlessly tended with no purpose but to avoid him  i wish you to let me alone sir said kenton at last i cant speak to you  i understand what you mean judge said bittridge with a grin all the more maddening because it seemed involuntary but i can explain everything i just want a few words with you its very important its life or death with me sir he said trying to look grave will you let me go to your rooms with you  kenton made no reply  bittridge began to laugh then lets sit down here or in the ladies parlor it wont take me two minutes to make everything right if you dont believe im in earnest i know you dont think i am but i can assure youwill you let me speak with you about miss ellen  still kenton did not answer shutting his lips tight and remembering his promise to his wife  bittridge laughed as if in amusement at what he had done judge let me say two words to you in private if you cant now tell me when you can were going back this evening mother and i are she isnt well and im not going to take her to washington i dont want to go leaving you with the idea that i wanted to insult miss ellen i care too much for her i want to see you and mrs kenton about it i do indeed and wont you let me see you somewhere  kenton looked away first to one side and then to another and seemed stifling  wont you speak to me wont you answer me see here id get down on my knees to you if it would do you any good where will you talk with me  nowhere shouted kenton will you go away or shall i strike you with my stick  oh i dont think said bittridge and suddenly in the wantonness of his baffled effrontery he raised his hand and rubbed the back of it in the old mans face  boyne kenton struck wildly at him and bittridge caught the boy by the arm and flung him to his knees on the marble floor the men reading in the armchairs about started to their feet a porter came running and took hold of bittridge do you want an officer judge kenton he panted  no no kenton answered choking and trembling dont arrest him i wish to go to my rooms thats all let him go dont do anything about it  ill help you judge said the porter take hold of this fellow he said to two other porters who came up take him to the desk and tell the clerk he struck judge kenton but the judge dont want him arrested  before kenton reached the elevator with boyne who was rubbing his knees and fighting back the tears he heard the clerks voice saying formally to the porters baggage out of 35 and 37 and adding as mechanically to bittridge your rooms are wanted get out of them at once  it seemed the gathering of neighborhood about kenton where he had felt himself so unfriended against the outrage done him and he felt the sweetness of being personally championed in a place where he had thought himself valued merely for the profit that was in him his eyes filled and his voice failed him in thanking the elevatorboy for running before him to ring the bell of his apartment     viii  the next day in tuskingum richard kenton found among the letters of his last mail one which he easily knew to be from his sister lottie by the tightly curledup handwriting and by the unliterary look of the slanted and huddled address of the envelope the only doubt he could have felt in opening it was from the unwonted length at which she had written him lottie usually practised a laconic brevity in her notes which were suited to the poverty of her written vocabulary rather than the affluence of her spoken word     dear dick her letter ran tripping and stumbling in its course    i have got to tell you about something that has just happened here    and you needent laugh at the speling or the way i tell it but just    pay attention to the thing itself if you please that disgusting    bittridge has been here with his horrid wiggy old mother and momma    let him take ellen to the theatre on the way home he tried to make    her promise she would marry him and at the door he kissed her they    had an awful night with her hiseterics and i heard momma going in    and out and trying to comfort her till daylight nearly in the    morning i went down with poppy and boyne to breakfast and after i    came up father went to the readingroom to get a paper and that    bittridge was there waiting for him and wanted to speak with him    about ellen poppa wouldent say a word to him and he kept    following poppa up to make him boyne says be wouldent take no for    an ansir and hung on and hungon till poppa threatened to hitt him    with his cane then he saw it was no use and he took his hand and    rubbed it in poppas face and boyne believes he was trying to pull    poppas nose boyne acted like i would have done he pounded    bittridge in the back but of course bittridge was too strong for    him and threw him on the floor and boyne scraped his knee so that    it bledd then the porters came up and caught bittridge and    wanted to send for a policeman but father wouldent let them and    the porters took bittridge to the desk and the clerk told him to get    out instantly and they left as soon as old wiggy could get her    things on i dont know where they went but he told poppa they    were going home today any way now dick i dont know what you    will want to do and i am not going to put you up to anything but i    know what i would do pretty well the first time bittridge showed    himself in tuskingum you can do just as you please and i dont    ask you to believe me if youre think im so exciteable that i cant    tell the truth i guess boyne will say the same much love to    mary your affectionate sister                           lottie     p severy word lottie says is true but i am not sure he meant    to pull his nose the reason why he threw me down so easily is i    have grown about a foot and i have not got up my strength boyne     this is strictly confidential they dont know we    are writing lattie   after reading this letter richard kenton tore it into small pieces so that there should not be even so much witness as it bore to facts that seemed to fill him with fury to the throat his fury was in agreement with his temperament the white kind and cold kind he was able to keep it to himself for that reason at supper his wife knew merely that he had something on his mind that he did not wish to talk of and experience had taught her that it would be useless to try making him speak  he slept upon his wrath and in the morning early at an hour when he knew there would be no loafers in the place he went to an outdated saddlers shop and asked the owner a veteran of his fathers regiment welks do you happen to have a cowhide among your antiquities  regular old style welks returned kind they make out of a cows hide and use on a mans  something of that sort said richard with a slight smile  the saddler said nothing more but rummaged among the riffraff on an upper shelf he got down with the tapering translucent wickedlooking thing in his hand i reckon thats what youre after squire  reckon it is welks said richard drawing it through his tubed left hand then he buttoned it under his coat and paid the quarter which welks said had always been the price of a cowhide even since he could remember and walked away towards the station  hows the old colonel welks called after him having forgotten to ask before  the colonels all right richard called back without looking round  he walked up and down in front of the station a local train came in from ballardsville at 815 and waited for the new york special and then returned to ballardsville richard had bought a ticket for that station and was going to take the train back but among the passengers who descended from it when it drew in was one who saved him the trouble of going  bittridge with his overcoat hanging on his arm advanced towards him with the rest and continued to advance in a sort of fascination after his neighbors with the instinct that something was about to happen parted on either side of richard and left the two men confronted richard did not speak but deliberately reached out his left hand which he caught securely into bittridges collar then he began to beat him with the cowhide wherever he could strike his writhing and twisting shape neither uttered a word and except for the whir of the cowhide in the air and the rasping sound of its arrest upon the body of bittridge the thing was done in perfect silence the witnesses stood well back in a daze from which they recovered when richard released bittridge with a twist of the hand that tore his collar loose and left his cravat dangling and tossed the frayed cowhide away and turned and walked homeward then one of them picked up bittridges hat and set it aslant on his head and others helped pull his collar together and tie his cravat  for the few moments that richard kenton remained in sight they scarcely found words coherent enough for question and when they did bittridge had nothing but confused answers to give to the effect that he did not know what it meant but he would find out he got into a hack and had himself driven to his hotel but he never made the inquiry which he threatened  in his own house richard kenton lay down awhile deadly sick and his wife had to bring him brandy before he could control his nerves sufficiently to speak then he told her what he had done and why and mary pulled off his shoes and put a hotwater bottle to his cold feet it was not exactly the treatment for a champion but mary kenton was not thinking of that and when richard said he still felt a little sick at the stomach she wanted him to try a drop of camphor in addition to the brandy she said he must not talk but she wished him so much to talk that she was glad when he began  it seemed to be something i had to do mary but i would give anything if i had not been obliged to do it  yes i know just how you feel dick and i think its pretty hard this has come on you i do think ellen might  it wasnt her fault mary you mustnt blame her shes had more to bear than all the rest of us mary looked stubbornly unconvinced and she was not moved apparently by what he went on to say the thing now is to keep what ive done from making more mischief for her  what do you mean dick you dont believe hell do anything about it do you  no im not afraid of that his mouth is shut but you cant tell how ellen will take it she may side with him now  dick if i thought ellen kenton could be such a fool as that  if shes in love with him shell take his part  but she cant be in love with him when she knows how he acted to your father  we cant be sure of that i know how he acted to father but at this minute i pity him so that i could take his part against father and i can understand how ellenanyway i must make a clean breast of it what day is this thursday and they sail saturday i must write  he lifted himself on his elbow and made as if to throw off the shawl she had spread upon him  no no i will write dick i will write to your mother what shall i say she whirled about and got the paper and ink out of her writingdesk and sat down near him to keep him from getting up and wrote the date and the address dear mother kenton which was the way she always began her letters to mrs kenton in order to distinguish her from her own mother now what shall i say  simply this answered richard that i knew of what had happened in new york and when i met him this morning i cowhided him ugh  well that wont do dick youve got to tell all about it your mother wont understand  then you write what you please and read it to me it makes me sick to think of it richard closed his eyes and mary wrote     dear mother kentoni am sitting by richard writing at his    request about what he has done he received a letter from new york    telling him of the bittridges performances there and how that    wretch had insulted and abused you all he bought a cowhide    meaning to go over to ballardsville and use it on him there but b    came over on the accommodation this morning and richard met him at    the station he did not attempt to resist for richard took him    quite by surprise now mother kenton you know that richard    doesnt approve of violence and the dear sweet soul is perfectly    brokendown by what he had to do but he had to do it and he    wishes you to know at once that he did it he dreads the effect    upon ellen and we must leave it to your judgment about telling her    of course sooner or later she must find it out you need not be    alarmed about richard he is just nauseated a little and he will    be all right as soon as his stomach is settled he thinks you ought    to have this letter before you sail and with affectionate goodbyes    to all in which dick joins                    your loving daughter                              mary kenton  there will that do  yes that is everything that can be said answered richard and mary kissed him gratefully before sealing her letter  i will put a special delivery on it she said and her precaution availed to have the letter delivered to mrs kenton the evening the family left the hotel when it was too late to make any change in their plans but in time to give her a bad night on the steamer in her doubt whether she ought to let the family go with this trouble behind them  but she would have had a bad night on the steamer in any case with the heat and noise and smell of the docks and the steamer sailed with her at six oclock the next morning with the doubt still open in her mind the judge had not been of the least use to her in helping solve it and she had not been able to bring herself to attack lottie for writing to richard she knew it was lottie who had made the mischief but she could not be sure that it was mischief till she knew its effect upon ellen the girl had been carried in the arms of one of the stewards from the carriage to her berth in lotties room and there she had lain through the night speechless and sleepless     ix  ellen did not move or manifest any consciousness when the steamer left her dock and moved out into the stream or take any note of the tumult that always attends a great liners departure at breakfasttime her mother came to her from one of the brief absences she made in the hope that at each turn she should find her in a different mood and asked if she would not have something to eat  im not hungry she answered when will it sail  why ellen we sailed two hours ago and the pilot has just left us  ellen lifted herself on her elbow and stared at her and you let me she said cruelly  ellen i will not have this cried her mother frantic at the reproach what do you mean by my letting you you knew that we were going to sail didnt you what else did you suppose we had come to the steamer for  i supposed you would let me stay if i wanted to but go away momma go away youre all against meyou and poppa and lottie and boyne oh dear oh dear she threw herself down in her berth and covered her face with the sheet sobbing while her mother stood by in an anguish of pity and anger she wanted to beat the girl she wanted to throw herself upon her and weep with her in the misery which she shared with her  lottie came to the door of the stateroom with an armload of longstemmed roses the gift of the young mr plumpton who had not had so much to be entreated to come down to the steamer and see her off as boyne had pretended momma she said i have got to leave these roses in here whether ellen likes it or not boyne wont have them in his room because he says the man thats with him would have a right to object and this is half my room anyway  mrs kenton frowned and shook her head but ellen answered from under the sheet i dont mind the roses lottie i wish youd stay with me a little while  lottie hesitated having in mind the breakfast for which the horn had just sounded but apparently she felt that one good turn deserved another and she answered all right i will nell momma you tell boyne to hurry and come to ellen as soon as hes done and then i will go dont let anybody take my place  i wish said ellen still from under the sheet that momma would have your breakfast sent here i dont want boyne  women apparently do not require any explanation of these swift vicissitudes in one another each knowing probably in herself the nerves from which they proceed mrs kenton promptly assented in spite of the sulky reluctance which lotties blue eyes looked at her she motioned her violently to silence and said yes i will ellen i will send breakfast for both of you  when she was gone ellen uncovered her face and asked lottie to dip a towel in water and give it to her as she bathed her eyes she said you dont care do you lottie  not very much said lottie unsparingly i can go to lunch i suppose  maybe ill go to lunch with you ellen suggested as if she were speaking of some one else  lottie wasted neither sympathy nor surprise on the question well maybe that would be the best thing why dont you come to breakfast  no i wont go to breakfast but you go  when lottie joined her family in the diningsaloon she carelessly explained that ellen had said she wanted to be alone before the young man who was the only other person besides the kentons at their table her mother could not question her with any hope that the bad would not be made worse and so she remained silent judge kenton sat with his eyes fixed on his plate where as yet the steward had put no breakfast for him boyne was supporting the dignity of the family in one of those moments of majesty from which he was so apt to lapse into childish dependence lottie offered him another alternative by absently laying hold of his napkin on the table  thats mine he said with husky gloom  she tossed it back to him with prompt disdain and a deeply eyelashed glance at a napkin on her right the young man who sat next it said with a smile perhaps thats yoursunless ive taken my neighbors  lottie gave him a stare and when she had sufficiently punished him for his temerity said rather sweetly oh thank you and took the napkin  i hope we shall all have use for them before long the young man ventured again  well i should think as much returned the girl and this was the beginning of a conversation which the young man shared successively with the judge and mrs kenton as opportunity offered he gave the judge his card across the table and when the judge had read on it rev hugh breckon he said that his name was kenton and he introduced the young man formally to his family mr breckon had a cleanshaven face with an habitual smile curving into the cheeks from under a long straight nose his chin had a slight whopperjaw twist that was charming his gay eyes were blue and a full vein came down his forehead between them from his smooth hair when he laughed which was often his color brightened  boyne was named last and then mr breckon said with a smile that showed all his white teeth oh yes mr boyne and i are friends alreadyever since we found ourselves roommates and but for us as lottie afterwards noted they might never have known boyne was rooming with him and could easily have made all sorts of insulting remarks about mr breckon in their ignorance  the possibility seemed to delight mr breckon he invited her to make all the insulting remarks she could think of any way and professed himself a loser so far as her real opinion was withheld from him by reason of his rashness in giving the facts away in the electrical progress of their acquaintance she had begun walking up and down the promenade with him after they came up from breakfast her mother had gone to ellen the judge had been made comfortable in his steamerchair and boyne had been sent about his business  i will try to think some up she promised him as soon as i have any real opinion of you and he asked her if he might consider that a beginning  she looked at him out of her indomitable blue eyes and said if it hadnt been for your card and the reverend on it i should have said you were an actor  well well said mr breckon with a laugh perhaps i am in a way i oughtnt to be of course but if a minister ever forces himself i suppose hes acting  i dont see said lottie instantly availing herself of the opening how you can get up and pray sunday after sunday whether you feel like it or not  the young man said with another laugh but not so gay well the case has its difficulties  or perhaps you just read prayers lottie sharply conjectured  no he returned i havent that advantageif you think it one im a sort of a unitarian very advanced too im afraid  is that a kind of universalist  notnot exactly theres an old jokeim not sure its very goodwhich distinguishes between the sects its said that the universalists think god is too good to damn them and the unitarians think they are too good to be damned lottie shrank a little from him ah he cried you think it sounds wicked well im sorry im not clerical enough to joke about serious things  he looked into her face with a pretended anxiety oh i dont know she said with a little scorn i guess if you can stand it i can  im not sure that i can im afraid its more in keeping with an actors profession than my own why he added as if to make a diversion should you have thought i was an actor  i suppose because you were cleanshaved and your pronunciation so englishy  is it perhaps i ought to be proud but im not an englishman i am a plain republican american may i ask if you are english  oh said lottie as if you thought such a thing were from ohio  mr breckon said ah lottie could not make out in just what sense  by this time they were leaning on the rail of the promenade looking over at what little was left of long island and she said abruptly i think i will go and see how my father is getting along  oh do take me with you miss kenton mr breckon entreated i am feeling very badly about that poor old joke i know you dont think well of me for it and i wish to report what ive been saying to your father and let him judge me ive heard that its hard to live up to ohio people when youre at your best and i do hope youll believe i have not been quite at my best will you let me come with you  lottie did not know whether he was making fun of her or not but she said oh its a free country and allowed him to go with her  his preface made the judge look rather grave but when he came to the joke kenton laughed and said it was not bad  oh but that isnt quite the point said mr breckon the question is whether i am good in repeating it to a young lady who was seeking serious instruction on a point of theology  i dont know what she would have done with the instruction if she had got it said the judge dryly and the young man ventured in her behalf  it would be difficult for any one to manage perhaps  perhaps kenton assented and lottie could see that he was thinking ellen would know what to do with it  she resented that and she was in the offence that girls feel when their elders make them the subject of comment with their contemporaries well ill leave you to discuss it alone im going to ellen she said the young man vainly following her a few paces with apologetic gurgles of laughter  thats right her father consented and then he seized the opening to speak about ellen my eldest daughter is something of an invalid but i hope we shall have her on deck before the voyage is over she is more interested in those matters than her sister  oh mr breckon interpolated in a note of sympathetic interest he could not well do more  it was enough for judge kenton who launched himself upon the celebration of ellens gifts and qualities with a simplehearted eagerness which he afterwards denied when his wife accused him of it but justified as wholly safe in view of mr breckons calling and his obvious delicacy of mind it was something that such a person would understand and kenton was sure that he had not unduly praised the girl a less besotted parent might have suspected that he had not deeply interested his listener who seemed glad of the diversion operated by boynes coming to growl upon his father mothers bringing ellen up  oh then i mustnt keep your chair said the minister and he rose promptly from the place he had taken beside the judge and got himself away to the other side of the ship before the judge could frame a fitting request for him to stay  if you had mrs kenton declared when he regretted this to her i dont know what i would have done its bad enough for him to hear you bragging about the child without being kept to help take care of her or keep her amused as you call it i will see that ellen is kept amused without calling upon strangers she intimated that if kenton did not act with more selfrestraint she should do little less than take ellen ashore and abandon him to the voyage alone under the intimidation he promised not to speak of ellen again  at luncheon where mr breckon again devoted himself to lottie he and ellen vied in ignoring each other after their introduction as far as words went the girl smiled once or twice at what he was saying to her sister and his glance kindled when it detected her smile he might be supposed to spare her his conversation in her own interest she looked so little able to cope with the exigencies of the talk he kept going  when he addressed her she answered as if she had not been listening and he turned back to lottie after luncheon he walked with her and their acquaintance made such a swift advance that she was able to ask him if he laughed that way with everybody  he laughed and then he begged her pardon if he had been rude  well i dont see what there is to laugh at so much when you ask me a thing i tell you just what i think and it seems to set you off in a perfect gale dont you expect people to say what they think  i think its beautiful said the young man going into the gale and ive got to expecting it of you at any rate butbut its always so surprising it isnt what you expect of people generally is it  i dont expect it of you said lottie  no asked mr breckon in another gale am i so uncandid  i dont know about uncandid but i should say you were slippery  at this extraordinary criticism the young man looked graver than he had yet been able to do since the beginning of their acquaintance he said presently i wish you would explain what you mean by slippery  youre as close as a trap  really  it makes me tired  if youre not too tired now i wish you would say how  oh you understand well enough youve got me to say what i think about all sorts of things and you havent expressed your opinion on a single solitary point  lottie looked fiercely out to sea turning her face so as to keep him from peering around into it in the way he had for that reason perhaps he did not try to do so he answered seriously i believe you are partly right im afraid i havent seemed quite fair couldnt you attribute my closeness to something besides my slipperiness he began to laugh again cant you imagine my being interested in your opinions so much more than my own that i didnt care to express mine  lottie said impatiently oh pshaw she had hesitated whether to say rats  but now he pursued if you will suggest some point on which i can give you an opinion i promise solemnly to do so but he was not very solemn as he spoke  well then i will she said dont you think its very strange to say the least for a minister to be always laughing so much  mr breckon gave a peal of delight and answered yes i certainly do he controlled himself so far as to say now i think ive been pretty open with you and i wish youd answer me a question will you  well i willone said lottie  it may be two or three but ill begin with one why do you think a minister ought to be more serious than other men  why well i should think youd know you wouldnt laugh at a funeral would you  ive been at some funerals where it would have been a relief to laugh and ive wanted to cry at some weddings but you think it wouldnt do  of course it wouldnt i should think youd know as much as that said lottie out of patience with him  but a minister isnt always marrying or burying people and in the intervals why shouldnt he be setting them an example of harmless cheerfulness  he ought to be thinking more about the other world i should say  well if he believes there is another world  why dont you she broke out on him  mr breckon ruled himself and continuedas strenuously and unquestionably as he ought he has greater reason than other men for gayety through his faith in a happier state of being than this thats one of the reasons i use against myself when i think of leaving off laughing now miss kenton he concluded for such a close and slippery nature i think ive been pretty frank and he looked round and down into her face with a burst of laughter that could be heard an the other side of the ship he refused to take up any serious topic after that and he returned to his former amusement of making her give herself away  that night lottie came to her room with an expression so decisive in her face that ellen following it with vague dark eyes as it showed itself in the glass at which her sister stood taking out the first dismantling hairpins before going to bed could not fail of something portentous in it  well said lottie with severe finality i havent got any use for that young man from this time out of all the tiresome people he certainly takes the cake you can have him ellen if you want him  whats the matter with him asked ellen with a voice in sympathy with the slow movement of her large eyes as she lay in her berth staring at lottie  theres everything the matter that oughtnt to be hes too trivial for anything i like a man thats serious about one thing in the universe at least and thats just what mr breckon isnt she went at such length into his disabilities that by the time she returned to the climax with which she started she was ready to clamber into the upper berth and as she snapped the electric button at its head she repeated hes trivial  isnt it getting rough asked ellen the ship seems to be tipping  yes it is said lottie crossly goodnight  if the rev mr breckon was making an early breakfast in the hope of sooner meeting lottie who had dismissed him the night before without encouraging him to believe that she wished ever to see him again he was destined to disappointment the deputation sent to breakfast by the paradoxical family whose acquaintance he had made on terms of each forbidding intimacy did not include the girl who had frankly provoked his confidence and severely snubbed it he had left her brother very seasick in their stateroom and her mother was reported by her father to be feeling the motion too much to venture out the judge was in fact the only person at table when breckon sat down but when he had accounted for his wifes absence and confessed that he did not believe either of his daughters was coming ellen gainsaid him by appearing and advancing quite steadily along the saloon to the place beside him it had not gone so far as this in the judges experience of a neurotic invalid without his learning to ask her no questions about herself he had always a hard task in refraining but he had grown able to refrain and now he merely looked unobtrusively glad to see her and asked her where lottie was  oh she doesnt want any breakfast she says is momma sick too wheres boyne  the judge reported as to her mother and mr breckon after the exchange of a silent salutation with the girl had a gleeful moment in describing boynes revolt at the stewards notion of gruel im glad to see you so well miss kenton he concluded  i suppose i will be sick too if it gets rougher she said and she turned from him to give a rather compendious order to the table steward  well youve got an appetite ellen her father ventured  i dont believe i will eat anything she checked him with a falling face  breckon came to the aid of the judge if youre not sick now i prophesy you wont be miss kenton it cant get much rougher without doing something uncommon  is it a storm she asked indifferently  its what they call half a gale i believe i dont know how they measure it  she smiled warily in response to his laugh and said to her father are you going up after breakfast poppa  why if you want to go ellen  oh i wasnt asking for that i am going back to lottie but i should think you would like the air wont it do you good  im all right said the judge cheered by her show of concern for some one else i suppose its rather wet on deck he referred himself to breckon  well not very if you keep to the leeward she doesnt seem a very wet boat  what is a wet boat ellen asked without lifting her sad eyes  well really im afraid its largely a superstition passengers like to believe that some boats are less liable to ship seasto run into wavesthan others but i fancy thats to give themselves the air of old travellers  she let the matter lapse so entirely that he supposed she had forgotten it in all its bearings when she asked have you been across many times  not manyfour or five  this is our first time she volunteered  i hope it wont be your last i know you will enjoy it she fell listless again and breckon imagined he had made a break not he added with an endeavor for lightness that i suppose youre going for pleasure altogether women nowadays are above that i understand they go abroad for arts sake and to study political economy and history and literature  my daughter the judge interposed will not do much in that way i hope  the girl bent her head over her plate and frowned  oh then said breckon i will believe that shes going for purely selfish enjoyment i should like to be justified in making that my object by a good example  ellen looked up and gave him a look that cut him short in his glad note the lifting of her eyelids was like the rise of the curtain upon some scene of tragedy which was all the more impressive because it seemed somehow mixed with shame this poor girl whom he had pitied as an invalid was a sufferer from some spiritual blight more pathetic than broken health he pulled his mind away from the conjecture that tempted it and went on one of the advantages of going over the fourth or fifth time is that youre relieved from a discoverers duties to europe ive got absolutely nothing before me now but at first i had to examine every object of interest on the continent and form an opinion about thousands of objects that had no interest for me i hope miss kenton will take warning from me  he had not addressed ellen directly and her father answered we have no definite plans as yet but we dont mean to overwork ourselves even if weve come for a rest i dont know he added but we had better spend our summer in england its easier getting about where you know the language  the judge seemed to refer his ideas to breckon for criticism and the young man felt authorized to say oh so many of them know the language everywhere now that its easy getting about in any country  yes i suppose so the judge vaguely deferred  which ellen demanded of the young man with a nervous suddenness do you think is the most interesting country  he found himself answering with equal promptness oh italy of course  can we go to italy poppa asked the girl  i shouldnt advise you to go there at once breckon intervened smiling youd find it pretty hot there now florence or rome or naplesyou cant think of them  we have it pretty hot in central ohio said the judge with latent pride in his home climate what sort of place is holland  oh delightful and the boat goes right on to rotterdam you know  yes we had arranged to leave it at boulogne but we could change do you think your mother would like holland the judge turned to his daughter  i think she would like italy better shes read more about it said the girl  rise of the dutch republic her father suggested  yes i know but shes read more about italy  oh well breckon yielded the italian lakes wouldnt be impossible and you might find venice fairly comfortable  we could go to italy then said the judge to his daughter if your mother prefers  breckon found the simplicity of this charming and he tasted a yet finer pleasure in the duplicity for he divined that the father was seeking only to let his daughter have her way in pretending to yield to her mothers preference  it was plain that the familys life centred as it ought about this sad sick girl the heart of whose mystery he perceived on reflection he had not the wish to pluck out he might come to know it but he would not try to know it if it offered itself he might even try not to know it he had sometimes found it more helpful with trouble to be ignorant of its cause  in the mean time he had seen that these kentons were sweet good people as he phrased their quality to himself he had come to terms of impersonal confidence the night before with boyne who had consulted him upon many more problems and predicaments of life than could have yet beset any boys experience probably with the wish to make provision for any possible contingency of the future the admirable principles which boyne evolved for his guidance from their conversation were formulated with a gravity which breckon could outwardly respect only by stifling his laughter in his pillow he rather liked the way lottie had tried to weigh him in her balance and found him as it were of an imponderable levity with his sense of being really very light at most times and with most people he was aware of having been particularly light with lottie of having been slippery of having so far as responding to her frankness was concerned been close he relished the unsparing honesty with which she had denounced him and though he did not yet know his outcast condition with relation to her he could not think of her without a smile of wholly disinterested liking he did not know as a man of earlier date would have known all that the little button in the judges lapel meant but he knew that it meant service in the civil war a struggle which he vaguely and impersonally revered though its details were of much the same dimness for him as those of the revolution and the war of 1812 the modest distrust which had grown upon the bold selfconfidence of kentons earlier manhood could not have been more tenderly and reverently imagined and breckons conjecture of things suffered for loves sake against sense and conviction in him were his further tribute to a character which existed of course mainly in this conjecture it appeared to him that kenton was held not only in the subjection to his wifes judgment which befalls and doubtless becomes a man after many years of marriage but that he was in the actual performance of more than common renunciation of his judgment in deference to the good woman she in turn to be sure offered herself a sacrifice to the whims of the sick girl whose worst whim was having no wish that could be ascertained and who now after two days of her mothers devotion was cast upon her own resources by the inconstant barometer it had become apparent that miss kenton was her fathers favorite in a special sense and that his partial affection for her was of much older date than her mothers not less charming than her fondness for her father was the openness with which she disabled his wisdom because of his partiality to her     x  when they left the breakfast table the first morning of the rough weather breckon offered to go on deck with miss kenton and put her where she could see the waves that had been her shapeless ambition dreamily expressed with reference to some time as they rose breckon asked why not now and he promised to place her chair on deck where she could enjoy the spectacle safe from any seas the boat might ship then she recoiled and she recoiled the further upon her fathers urgence at the foot of the gangway she looked wistfully up the reeling stairs and said that she saw her shawl and lotties among the others solemnly swaying from the top railing oh then breckon pressed her you could be made comfortable without the least trouble  i ought to go and see how lottie is getting along she murmured  her father said he would see for her and on this she explicitly renounced her ambition of going up you couldnt do anything she said coldly  if miss lottie is very seasick shes beyond all earthly aid breckon ventured shed better be left to the vain ministrations of the stewardess  ellen looked at him in apparent distrust of his piety if not of his wisdom i dont believe i could get up the stairs she said  well he admitted theyre not as steady as landgoing stairs her father discreetly kept silence and as no one offered to help her she began to climb the crazy steps with breckon close behind her in latent readiness for her fall  from the top she called down to the judge tell momma i will only stay a minute but later tucked into her chair on the lee of the bulkhead with breckon bracing himself against it beside her she showed no impatience to return are they never higher than that she required of him with her wan eyes critically on the infinite procession of the surges  they must be breckon answered if theres any truth in common report ive heard of their running mountains high perhaps they used rather low mountains to measure them by or the measurements may not have been very exact but common report never leaves much to the imagination  that was the way at niagara the girl assented and breckon obligingly regretted that he had never been there he thought it in good taste that she should not tell him he ought to go she merely said i was there once with poppa and did not press her advantage do they think she asked that its going to be a very long voyage  i havent been to the smokingroomthats where most of the thinking is done on such points the ships officers never seem to know about itsince the weather changed should you mind it greatly  i wouldnt care if it never ended said the girl with such a note of dire sincerity that breckon instantly changed his first mind as to her words implying a pose she took any deeper implication from them in adding i didnt know i should like being at sea  well if youre not seasick he assented there are not many pleasanter things in life  she suggested i suppose im not well enough to be seasick then she seemed to become aware of something provisional in his attendance and she said you mustnt stay on my account i can get down when i want to  do let me stay he entreated unless youd really rather not and as there was no chair immediately attainable he crouched on the deck beside hers  it makes me think she said and he perceived that she meant the sea of the coldwhite heavy plunging foam in the dream of fair women the words always seemed drenched  ah tennyson yes said breckon with a disposition to smile at the simpleheartedness of the literary allusion do young ladies read poetry much in ohio  i dont believe they do she answered do they anywhere  thats one of the things i should like to know is tennyson your favorite poet  i dont believe i have any said ellen i used to like whither and emerson aid longfellow too  used to dont you now  i dont read them so much now and she made a pause behind which he fancied her secret lurked but he shrank from knowing it if he might  youre all great readers in your family he suggested as a polite diversion  lottie isnt she answered dreamily she hates it  ah i referred more particularly to the others said breckon and he began to laugh and then checked himself your mother and the judgeand your brother  boyne reads about insects she admitted  he told me of his collection of cocoons he seems to be afraid it has suffered in his absence  im afraid it has said ellen and then remained silent  there the young man broke out pointing seaward thats rather a fine one doesnt that realize your idea of something mountains high unless your mountains are very high in ohio  it is grand and the gulf between but we havent any in our part its all level do you believe the tenth wave is larger than the rest  why the difficulty is to know which the tenth wave is or when to begin counting  yes said the girl and she added vaguely i suppose its like everything else in that we have to makebelieve before we can believe anything  something like an hypothesis certainly seems necessary breckon assented with a smile for the gravity of their discourse we shouldnt have the atomic theory without it she did not say anything and he decided that the atomic theory was beyond the range of her reading he tried to be more concrete we have to makebelieve in ourselves before we can believe dont we and then we sometimes find we are wrong he laughed but she asked with tragical seriousness  and what ought you to do when you find out you are mistaken in yourself  thats what im trying to decide he replied sometimes i feel like renouncing myself altogether but usually i give myself another chance i dare say if i hadnt been so forbearing i might have agreed with your sister about my unfitness for the ministry  with lottie  she thinks i laugh too much  i dont see why a minister shouldnt laugh if he feels like it and if theres something to laugh at  ah thats just the point is there ever anything to laugh at if we looked closely enough at things oughtnt we rather to cry he laughed in retreat from the serious proposition but it wouldnt do to try making each other cry instead of laugh would it i suppose your sister would rather have me cry  i dont believe lottie thought much about it said ellen and at this point mr breckon yielded to an impulse  i should think i had really been of some use if i had made you laugh miss kenton  me  you look as if you laughed with your whole heart when you did laugh  she glanced about and breckon decided that she had found him too personal i wonder if i could walk with the ship tipping so she asked  well not far said breckon with a provisional smile and then he was frightened from his irony by her flinging aside her wraps and starting to her feet before he could scramble to his own she had slid down the reeling promenade half to the guard over which she seemed about to plunge he hurled himself after her he could not have done otherwise and it was as much in a wild clutch for support as in a purpose to save her that he caught her in his arms and braced himself against the ships slant where are you going what are you trying to do he shouted  i wanted to go downstairs she protested clinging to him  you were nearer going overboard he retorted you shouldnt have tried he had not fully formulated his reproach when the ship righted herself with a counterroll and plunge and they were swung staggering back together against the bulkhead the door of the gangway was within reach and breckon laid hold of the rail beside it and put the girl within are you hurt he asked  no no im not hurt she panted sinking on the cushioned benching where usually rows of semiseasick people were lying  i thought you might have been bruised against the bulkhead he said are you sure youre not hurt that i cant get you anything from the steward i mean  only help me downstairs she answered im perfectly well and breckon was so willing on these terms to close the incident that he was not aware of the bruise on his own arm which afterwards declared itself in several primitive colors dont tell them she added i want to come up again  why certainly not he consented but boyne kenton who had been an involuntary witness of the fact from a point on the forward promenade where he had stationed himself to study the habits of the stormy petrel at a moment so favorable to the acquaintance of the petrel having left a seasick bed for the purpose was of another mind he had been alarmed and as it appeared in the private interview which he demanded of his mother he had been scandalized  it is bad enough the way lottie is always going on with fellows and now if ellen is going to begin  but boyne child mrs kenton argued in an equilibrium between the wish to laugh at her son and the wish to box his ears how could she help his catching her if he was to save her from pitching overboard  thats just it he will always think that she did it just so he would have to catch her  i dont believe any one would think that of ellen said mrs kenton gravely  momma you dont know what these eastern fellows are there are so few of them that theyre used to having girls throw themselves at them and they will think anything ministers and all you ought to talk to ellen and caution her of course she isnt like lottie but if lotties been behaving her way with mr breckon he must suppose the rest of the family is like her  boyne said his mother provisionally what sort of person is mr breckon  well i think hes kind of frivolous  do you boyne  i dont suppose he means any harm by it but i dont like to see a minister laugh so much i cant hardly get him to talk seriously about anything and i just know he makes fun of lottie i dont mean that he always makes fun with me he didnt that night at the vaudeville where i first saw him  what do you mean  dont you remember i told you about it last winter  and was mr breckon that gentleman  yes but he didnt know who i was when we met here  well upon my word boyne i think you might have told us before said his mother in not very definite vexation go along now  boyne stood talking to his mother with his hands which he had not grown to largely planted on the jambs of her stateroom door she was keeping her berth not so much because she was seasick as because it was the safest place in the unsteady ship to be in do you want me to send ellen to you  i will attend to ellen boyne his mother snubbed him how is lottie  i cant tell whether shes sick or not i went to see about her and she motioned me away and fairly screamed when i told her she ought to keep out in the air well i must be going up again myself or  before lunch boyne had experienced the alternative which he did not express although his theory and practice of keeping in the open air ought to have rendered him immune breckon saw his shock of hair and his large eyes like ellens in their present gloom looking out of it on the pillow of the upper berth when he went to their room to freshen himself for the luncheon and found boyne averse even to serious conversation he went to lunch without him none of the kentons were at table and he had made up his mind to lunch alone when ellen appeared and came wavering down the aisle to the table he stood up to help her but seeing how securely she stayed herself from chair to chair he sank down again  poppy is sick too now she replied as if to account for being alone  and youre none the worse for your little promenade the steward came to breckons left shoulder with a dish and after an effort to serve himself from it he said with a slight gasp the other side please ellen looked at him but did not speak and he made haste to say the doctor goes so far as to admit that its half a gale i dont know just what measure the first officer would have for it but i congratulate you on a very typical little storm miss kenton perfectly safe but very decided a great many people cross the atlantic without anything half as satisfactory there is either too much or too little of this sort of thing he went on talking about the weather and had got such a distance from the point of beginning that he had cause to repent being brought back to it when she asked  did the doctor think you were hurt  well perhaps i ought to be more ashamed than i am said breckon but i thought i had better make sure and its only a bruise  wont you let me help you she asked as another dish intervened at his right i hurt you  breckon laughed at her solemn face and voice if youll exonerate yourself first he answered i couldnt touch a morsel that conveyed confession of the least culpability on your part do you consent otherwise i pass this dish and really i want some  well she sadly consented and he allowed her to serve his plate  more yet please he said a lot  is that enough  well for the first helping and dont offer to cut it up for me my proud spirit draws the line at cutting up besides a fork will do the work with goulash  is that what it is she asked but not apparently because she cared to know  unless you prefer to naturalize it as stew it seems to have come in with the hungarian bands i suppose you have them in  tuskingum no it is too small but i heard them at a restaurant in new york where my brother took us  in the spirit of scientific investigation its strange how a common principle seems to pervade both the hungarian music and cookingthe same wandering airs and flavorswild vague lawless harmonies in both did you notice it  ellen shook her head the look of gloom which seemed to breckon habitual in it came back into her face and he had a fantastic temptation to see how far he could go with her sad consciousness before she should be aware that he was experimenting upon it he put this temptation from him and was in the enjoyment of a comfortable selfrighteousness when it returned in twofold power upon him with the coming of some cutlets which capriciously varied the repast  ah now miss kenton if you were to take pity on my helplessness  why certainly she possessed herself of his plate and began to cut up the meat for him am i making the bites too small she asked with an upward glance at him  well i dont know should you think so he returned with a smile that outmeasured the morsels on the plate before her  she met his laughing eyes with eyes that questioned his honesty at first sadly and then indignantly she dropped the knife and fork upon the plate and rose  oh miss kenton he penitently entreated  but she was down the slanting aisle and out of the reeling door before he could decide what to do     xi  it seemed to breckon that he had passed through one of those accessions of temperament one of those crises of natural man to put it in the terms of an older theology than he professed that might justify him in recurring to his original sense of his unfitness for his sacred calling as he would hardly ham called it he had allowed his levity to get the better of his sympathy and his love of teasing to overpower that love of helping which seemed to him his chief right and reason for being a minister to play a sort of poor practical joke upon that melancholy girl who was also so attractive was not merely unbecoming to him as a minister it was cruel it was vulgar it was ungentlemanly he could not say less than ungentlemanly for that seemed to give him the only pang that did him any good her absolute sincerity had made her such an easy prey that he ought to have shrunk from the shabby temptation in abhorrence  it is the privilege of a woman whether she wills it or not to put a man who is in the wrong concerning her much further in the wrong than he could be from his offence breckon did not know whether he was suffering more or less because he was suffering quite hopelessly but he was sure that he was suffering justly and he was rather glad if anything that he must go on suffering his first impulse had been to go at once to judge kenton and own his wrong and take the consequencesin fact invite them but breckon forbore for two reasons one that he had already appeared before the judge with the confession of having possibly made an unclerical joke to his younger daughter the other that the judge might not consider levity towards the elder so venial and though breckon wished to be both punished and pardoned in the final analysis perhaps he most wished to be pardoned without pardon he could see no way to repair the wrong he had done perhaps he wished even to retrieve himself in the girls eyes or wished for the chance of trying  ellen went away to her stateroom and sat down on the sofa opposite lottie and she lost herself in a muse in which she was found by the voice of the sufferer in the berth  if you havent got anything better to do than come in here and stare at me i wish you would go somewhere else and stare i can tell you it isnt any joke  i didnt know i was staring at you said ellen humbly  it would be enough to have you rising and sinking there without your staring at all if youre going to stay i wish youd lie down i dont see why youre so well anyway after getting us all to come on this wildgoose chase  i know i know ellen strickenly deprecated but im not going to stay i jest came for my things  is that giggling simpleton sick i hope he is  mr breckon ellen asked though she knew whom lottie meant no he isnt sick he was at lunch  was poppa  he was at breakfast  and momma  she and boyne are both in bed i dont know whether theyre very sick  well then ill just tell you what ellen kenton lottie sat up in accusal you were staring at something he said and the first thing we all know it will be another case of bittridge ellen winced but lottie had no pity you dont know it because you dont know anything and im not blaming you but if you let that simpletoni dont care if he is a ministergo round with you when your family are all sick abed youll be having the whole ship to look after you  be still lottie cried ellen you are awful and with a flaming face she escaped from the stateroom  she did not know where else to go and she beat along the sides of the corridor as far as the diningsaloon she had a dim notion of trying to go up into the musicroom above but a glance at the reeling steep of the stairs forbade with her wraps on her arm and her seacap in her hand she stood clinging to the railpost  breckon came out of the saloon oh miss kenton he humbly entreated dont try to go on deck its rougher than ever  i was going to the musicroom she faltered  let me help you then he said again they mounted the gangwaysteps but this time with his hand under her elbow and his arm alert as before in a suspended embrace against her falling  she had lost the initiative of her earlier adventure she could only submit herself to his guidance but he almost outdid her in meekness when he got her safely placed in a corner whence she could not be easily flung upon the floor you must have found it very stuffy below but indeed youd better not try going out  do you think it isnt safe here she asked  oh yes as long as you keep quiet may i get you something to read they seem to have a pretty good little library  they both glanced at the case of books from which the stewardlibrarian was setting them the example of reading a volume  no i dont want to read you musnt let me keep you from it  well one can read any time but one hasnt always the chance to say that one is ashamed dont pretend you dont understand miss kenton i didnt really mean anything the temptation to let you exaggerate my disability was too much for me say that you despise me it would be such a comfort  werent you hurt  a littlea little more than a little but not half so much as i deservednot to the point of not being able to cut up my meat am i forgiven ill promise to cut up all your meat for you at dinner ah im making it worse  oh no please dont speak of it  could you forbid my thinking of it too he did not wait for her to answer then here goes one two three and the thought is banished forever now what shall we speak of or think of we finished up the weather pretty thoroughly this morning and if you have not the weather and the ships run when youre at sea why you are at sea dont you think it would be a good plan when they stick those little flags into the chart to show how far weve come in the last twentyfour hours if theyd supply a topic for the day they might have topics inscribed on the flagsstandard topics that would serve for any voyage we might leave port with historysay personal history that would pave the way to a general acquaintance among the passengers then geography and if the world is really round and what keeps the sea from spilling then politics and the comparative advantages of monarchical and republican governments for international discussion then pathology and whether youre usually seasick and if there is any reliable remedy thenfor those who are still uppoetry and fiction whether women really like kipling and what kind of novels you prefer there ought to be about ten topics these boats are sometimes very slow cant you suggest something miss kenton there is no hurry weve got four to talk over for we must bring up the arrears you know and now well begin with personal history your sister doesnt approve of me does she  my sister ellen faltered and between the conscience to own the fact and the kindness to deny it she stopped altogether  i neednt have asked she told me so herself in almost as many words she said i was slippery and as close as a trap miss kenton i have the greatest wish to know whether i affect you as both slippery and close  i dont always know what lottie means  she means what she says and i feel that i am under condemnation till i reform i dont know how to stop being slippery but im determined to stop being close will you tell her that for me will you tell her that you never met an opener franker personof course except herselfand that so far from being light i seemed to you particularly heavy say that i did nothing but talk about myself and that when you wanted to talk about yourself you couldnt get in a word edgewise do try now miss kenton and see if you can i dont want you to invent a character for me quite  why theres nothing to say about me she began in compliance with his gayety and then she fell helpless from it  well then about tuskingum i should like to hear about tuskingum so much  i suppose we like it because weve always lived there you havent been much in the west have you  not as much as i hope to be he had found that western people were sometimes sensitive concerning their section and were prepared to resent complacent ignorance of it ive always thought it must be very interesting  it isnt said the girl at least not like the east i used to be provoked when the lecturers said anything like that but when youve been to new york you see what they mean  the lecturers he queried  they always stayed at our house when they lectured in tuskingum  ah oh yes said breckon grasping a situation of which he had heard something chiefly satirical of course and is your fatheris judge kenton literary excuse me  only in his history hes writing the history of his regiment or he gets the soldiers to write down all they can remember of the war and then he puts their stories together  how delightful said breckon and i suppose its a great pleasure to him  i dont believe it is said ellen poppa doesnt believe in war any more  indeed said breckon that is very interesting  sometimes when im helping him with it  ah i knew you must help him  and he comes to a place where there has been a dreadful slaughter it seems as if he felt worse about it than i did he isnt sure that it wasnt all wrong he thinks all war is wrong now  is hehas he become a follower of tolstoy  hes read him he says hes the only man that ever gave a true account of battles but he had thought it all out for himself before he read tolstoy about fighting do you think it is right to revenge an injury  why surely not said breckon rather startled  that is what we say the girl pursued but if some one had injured youabused your confidence andinsulted you what would you do  im not sure that i understand breckon began the inquiry was superficially impersonal but he reflected that women are never impersonal or the sons of women for that matter and he suspected an intimate ground his suspicions were confirmed when miss kenton said it seems easy enough to forgive anything thats done to yourself but if its done to some one else too have you the rightisnt it wrong to let it go  you think the question of justice might come in then perhaps it ought but what is justice and where does your duty begin to be divided he saw her following him with alarming intensity and he shrank from the responsibility before him what application might not she make of his words in the case whatever it was which he chose not to imagine to tell you the truth miss kenton im not very clear on that pointim not sure that im disinterested  disinterested  yes you know that i abused your confidence at luncheon and until i know whether the wrong involved any one else he looked at her with hovering laughter in his eyes which took wing at the reproach in hers but if we are to be serious  oh no she said it isnt a serious matter but in the helplessness of her sincerity she could not carry it off lightly or hide from him that she was disappointed  he tried to make talk about other things she responded vaguely and when she had given herself time she said she believed she would go to lottie she was quite sure she could get down the stairs alone he pursued her anxiously politely and at the head of her corridor took leave of her with a distinct sense of having merited his dismissal  i see what you mean lottie she said about mr breckon  lottie did not turn her head on the pillow has it taken you the whole day to find it out     xii  the father and the mother had witnessed with tempered satisfaction the interest which seemed to be growing up between ellen and the young minister by this time they had learned not to expect too much of any turn she might take she reverted to a mood as suddenly as she left it they could not quite make out breckon himself he was at least as great a puzzle to them as their own child was  it seems said mrs kenton in their first review of the affair after boyne had done a brothers duty in trying to bring ellen under their mothers censure that he was the gentleman who discussed the theatre with boyne at the vaudeville last winter boyne just casually mentioned it i was so provoked  i dont see what bearing the fact has the judge remarked  why boyne liked him very much that night but now he seems to feel very much as lottie does about him he thinks he laughs too much  i dont know that theres much harm in that said the judge and i shouldnt value boynes opinion of character very highly  i value any ones intuitionsespecially childrens  boynes in that middle state where he isnt quite a child and so is lottie for that matter  that is true their mother assented and we ought to be glad of anything that takes ellens mind off herself if i could only believe she was forgetting that wretch  does she ever speak of him  she never hints of him even but her mind may be full of him all the time  the judge laughed impatiently it strikes me that this young mr breckon hasnt much advantage of ellen in what lottie calls closeness  ellen has always been very reserved it would have been better for her if she hadnt oh i scarcely dare to hope anything rufus i feel that in everything of this kind we are very ignorant and inexperienced  inexperienced renton retorted i dont want any more experience of the kind ellen has given us  i dont mean that i meanthis mr breckon i cant tell what attracts him in the child she must appear very crude and uncultivated to him you neednt resent it so i know shes read a great deal and youve made her think herself intellectualbut the very simpleheartedness of the way she would show out her reading would make such a young man see that she wasnt like the girls he was used to they would hide their intellectuality if they had any its no use your trying to fight it mr kenton we are country people and he knows it  tuskingum isnt country the judge declared  it isnt city and we dont know anything about the world any of us oh i suppose we can read and write but we dont know the a b c of the things he knows he belongs to a kind of societyof peoplein new york that i had glimpses of in the winter but that i never imagined before they made me feel very belated and benightedas if i hadnt read or thought anything they didnt mean to but i couldnt help it and they couldnt  youyouve been frightened out of your propriety by what youve seen in new york said her husband  ive been frightened certainly and i wish you had been too i wish you wouldnt be so conceited about ellen it scares me to see you so poor sick thing her looks are all gone you must see that and she doesnt dress like the girls hes used to i know weve got her things in new york but she doesnt wear them like a newyorker i hope she isnt going in for more unhappiness  at the thought of this the judges crest fell do you believe shes getting interested in him he asked humbly  no no i dont say that but promise me you wont encourage her in it and dont for pitys sake brag about her to him  no i wont said the judge and he tacitly repented having done so  the weather had changed and when he went up from this interview with his wife in their stateroom he found a good many people strung convalescently along the promenade on their steamerchairs these so far as they were women were of such sick plainness that when he came to ellen his heart throbbed with a glad resentment of her mothers aspersion of her health and beauty she looked not only very well and very pretty but in a gay red cap and a trig jacket she looked to her fathers uncritical eyes very stylish the glow left his heart at eight of the empty seat beside her  where is lottie he asked though it was not lotties whereabouts that interested him  oh shes walking with mr breckon somewhere said ellen  then shes made up her mind to tolerate him has she the father asked more lightly than he felt  ellen smiled that wasnt anything very serious i guess at any rate shes walking with him  what book is that he asked of the volume she was tilting back and forth under her hand  she showed it one of his he brought it up to amuse me he said  while he was amusing himself with lottie thought the judge in his jealousy for her it is going the same old way well what he said aloud was and is it amusing you  i havent looked at it yet said the girl its amusing enough to watch the sea oh poppa i never thought i should care so much for it  and youre glad we came  i dont want to think about that i just want to know that im here she pressed his arm gently significantly where he sat provisionally in the chair beside her and he was afraid to speak lest he should scare away the hope her words gave him  he merely said well well and waited for her to speak further but her impulse had exhausted itself as if her spirit were like one of those weak forms of life which spend their strength in a quick run or flight and then rest to gather force for another wheres boyne he asked after waiting for her to speak  he was here a minute ago hes been talking with some of the deck passengers that are going home because they couldnt get on in america doesnt that seem pitiful poppa i always thought we had work enough for the whole world  perhaps these fellows didnt try very hard to find it said the judge  perhaps she assented  i shouldnt want you to get to thinking that its all like new york remember how comfortable everybody is in tuskingum  yes she said sadly how far off tuskingum seems  well dont forget about it and remember that wherever life is simplest and purest and kindest that is the highest civilization  how much like old times it seems to hear you talk that way poppa i should think i was in the library at home and i made you leave it she sighed  your mother was glad of any excuse and it will do us all good if we take it in the right way said the judge with a didactic severity that did not hide his pang from her  poor poppa she said  he went away saying that he was going to look lottie up his simple design was to send lottie to her mother so that breckon might come back to ellen but he did not own this to himself  lottie returned from another direction with boyne and ellen said poppas gone to look for you  has he asked lottie dropping decisively into her chair well theres one thing i wont call him poppa any more  what will you call him boyne demanded demurely  ill call him father it you want to know and im going to call momma mother im not going to have those english laughing at us and i wont say papa and mamma everybody that knows anything says father and mother now  boyne kept looking from one sister to another during lotties declaration and with his eyes on ellen he said its true ellen all the plumptons did he was very serious  ellen smiled im too old to change id rather seem queer in europe than when i get back to tuskingum  you wouldnt be queer there a great while said lottie theyll all be doing it in a week after i get home  upon the encouragement given him by ellen boyne seized the chance of being of the opposition yes he taunted lottie and you think theyll say woman and man for lady and gentleman i suppose  they will as soon as they know its the thing  well i know i wont said boyne i wont call momma a woman  it doesnt matter what you do boyne dear his sister serenely assured him  while he stood searching his mind for a suitable retort a young man not apparently many years his senior came round the corner of the musicroom and put himself conspicuously in view at a distance from the kentons  there he is now said boyne he wants to be introduced to lottie he referred the question to ellen but lottie answered for her  then why dont you introduce him  well i would if he was an american but you cant tell about these english he resumed the dignity he had lost in making the explanation to lottie and ignored her in turning again to ellen what do you think ellen  oh dont know about such things boyne she said shrinking from the responsibility  well upon my word cried lottie if ellen can talk by the hour with that precious mr breckon and stay up here along with him when everybody else is down below sick i dont think she can have a great deal to say about a halfgrown boy like that being introduced to me  hes as old as you are said boyne hotly  oh i saw him associating with you and i thought he was a boy too pardon me lottie turned from giving boyne his coupdegrace to plant a little stab in ellens breast to be sure now mr breckon has found those friends of his i suppose he wont want to flirt with ellen any more  ah ha ha boyne broke in lottie is mad because he stopped to speak to some ladies he knew women i suppose shed call them  well i shouldnt call him a gentleman anyway said lottie  the pretty smoothfaced freshfaced young fellow whom their varying debate had kept in abeyance looked round at them over his shoulder as he leaned on the rail and seemed to discover boyne for the first time he came promptly towards the kentons  now said lottie rapidly youll just have to  the young fellow touched his cap to the whole group but he ventured to address only boyne  every one seems to be about this morning he said with the cheery englishrising infection  yes answered boyne with such snubbing coldness that ellens heart was touched  its so pleasant she said after that dark weather  isnt it cried the young fellow gratefully one doesnt often get such sunshine as this at sea you know  my sister miss kenton mr pogis boyne solemnly intervened and miss lottie kenton  the pretty boy bowed to each in turn but he made no pretence of being there to talk with ellen have you been ill too he actively addressed himself to lottie  no just mad she said i wasnt very sick and that made it all the worse being down in a poky stateroom when i wanted to walk  and i suppose youve been making up for lost time this morning  not half said lottie  oh do finish the half with me  lottie instantly rose and flung her sister the wrap she had been holding ready to shed from the moment the young man had come up keep that for me nell are you good at catching she asked him  catching  yes people she explained and at a sudden twist of the ship she made a clutch at his shoulder  oh i think i can catch you  as they moved off together boyne said well upon my word but ellen did not say anything in comment on lottie after a while she asked who were the ladies that mr breckon met  i didnt hear their names they were somebody he hadnt seen before since the ship started they looked like a young lady and her mother it made lottie mad when he stopped to speak with them and she wouldnt wait till he could get through ran right away and made me come too     xiii  breckon had not seen the former interest between himself and ellen lapse to commonplace acquaintance without due sense of loss he suffered justly but he did not suffer passively or without several attempts to regain the higher ground in spite of these he was aware of being distinctly kept to the level which he accused himself of having chosen by a gentle acquiescence in his choice more fatal than snubbing the advances that he made across the table while he still met miss kenton alone there did not carry beyond the rack supporting her plate she talked on whatever subject he started with that angelic sincerity which now seemed so far from him but she started none herself she did not appeal to him for his opinion upon any question more psychological than the barometer and            in a tumultuous privacy of storm  he found himself as much estranged from her as if a fairweather crowd had surrounded them he did not believe that she resented the levity he had shown but he had reason to fear that she had finally accepted it as his normal mood and in her efforts to meet him in it as if he had no other he read a tolerance that was worse than contempt when he tried to make her think differently if that was what she thought of him he fancied her rising to the notion he wished to give her and then shrinking from it as if it must bring her the disappointment of some trivial joke  it was what he had taught her to expect of him and he had himself to blame now that he had thrown that precious chance away he might well have overvalued it she had certain provincialisms which he could not ignore she did not know the right use of will and shall and would and should and she pronounced the letter r with a hard midwestern twist her voice was weak and thin and she could not govern it from being at times a gasp and at times a drawl she did not dress with the authority of women who know more of their clothes than the people they buy them of she did not carry herself like a pretty girl she had not the definite stamp of youngladyism yet she was undoubtedly a lady in every instinct she wore with pensive grace the clothes which she had not subjected to her personal taste and if she did not carry herself like a pretty girl she had a beauty which touched and entreated  more and more breckon found himself studying her beautyher soft brown brows her gentle dark eyes a little sunken and with the lids pinched by suffering the cheeks somewhat thin but not colorless the long chin the clear forehead and the massed brown hair that seemed too heavy for the drooping neck it was not the modern athletic type it was rather of the earlier period when beauty was associated with the fragility despised by a tanned and golfing generation ellen kentons wrists were thin and her hands long and narrow as he looked at her across the racks during those two days of storm he had sometimes the wish to take her long narrow hands in his and beg her to believe that he was worthier her serious friendship than he had shown himself what he was sure of at all times now was that he wished to know the secret of that patient pathos of hers she was not merely or primarily an invalid her family had treated her as an invalid but except lottie whose rigor might have been meant sanatively they treated her more with the tenderness people use with a wounded spirit and breckon fancied moments of something like humility in her when she seemed to cower from his notice these were not so imaginable after her family took to their berths and left her alone with him but the touching mystery remained a sort of bewilderment as he guessed it a surprise such as a child might show at some incomprehensible harm it was this grief which he had refused not merely to knowhe still doubted his right to know itbut to share he had denied not only his curiosity but his sympathy and had exiled himself to a region where when her family came back with the fair weather he felt himself farther from her than before their acquaintance began  he had made an overture to its renewal in the book he lent her and then mrs rasmith and her daughter had appeared on deck and borne down upon him when he was walking with lottie kenton and trying to begin his selfretrieval through her she had left him but they had not and in the bonds of a prophet and his followers he found himself bound with them for much more conversation than he had often held with them ashore the parochial duties of an ethical teacher were not strenuous and breckon had not been made to feel them so definitely before mrs rasmith held that they now included promising to sit at her table for the rest of the voyage but her daughter succeeded in releasing him from the obligation and it was she who smilingly detached the clinging hold of the elder lady we mustnt keep mr breckon from his friends mother she said brightly and then he said he should like the pleasure of introducing them and both of the ladies declared that they would be delighted  he bowed himself off and half the shipslength away he was aware from meeting lottie with her little englishman that it was she and not ellen whom he was seeking as the couple paused in whirring past breckon long enough to let lottie make her hat fast against the wind he heard the englishman shout  i say that sister of yours is a fine girl isnt she  shes a pretty goodlooker lottie answered back whats the matter with her sister  oh i say her companion returned in a transport with her slangy pertness which breckon could not altogether refuse to share  he thought that he ought to condemn it and he did condemn mrs kenton for allowing it in one of her daughters when he came up to her sitting beside another whom he felt inexpressibly incapable of it mrs kenton could have answered his censure if she had known it that daughters like sons were not what their mothers but what their environments made them and that the same environment sometimes made them different as he saw she could have told him that lottie with her slangy pertness had the truest and best of the men she knew at her feet and that ellen with her meekness had been the prey of the commonest and cheapest spirit in her world and so left him to make an inference as creditable to his sex as he could but this bold defence was as far from the poor lady as any spoken reproach was from him her daughter had to check in her a mechanical offer to rise as if to give breckon her place the theory and practice of tuskingum being that their elders ought to leave young people alone together  dont go momma ellen whispered i dont want you to go  breckon when he arrived before them remained talking on foot and unlike lotties company he talked to the mother this had happened before from him but she had not got used to it and now she deprecated in everything but words his polite questions about her sufferings from the rough weather and his rejoicing that the worst was probably over she ventured the hope that it was so for she said that mr kenton had about decided to keep on to holland and it seemed to her that they had had enough of storms he said he was glad that they were going right on and then she modestly recurred to the earlier opinion he had given her husband that it would be better to spend the rest of the summer in holland than to go to italy as if she wished to conform herself in the wisdom of mr kentons decision he repeated his conviction and he said that if he were in their place he should go to the hague as soon as they had seen rotterdam and make it their headquarters for the exploration of the whole country  you cant realize how little it is you can get anywhere in an hour the difficulty is to keep inside of holland when you leave any given point i envy you going there  mrs kenton inferred that he was going to stop in france but if it were part of his closeness not to tell it was part of her pride not to ask she relented when he asked if he might get a map of his and prove the littleness of holland from it and in his absence she could not well avoid saying to ellen he seems very pleasant  yes why not the girl asked  i dont know lottie is so against him  he was very kind when you were all sick  well you ought to know better than lottie youve seen him so much more ellen was silent and her mother advanced cautiously i suppose he is very cultivated  how can i tell im not  why ellen i think you are very few girls have read so much  yes but he wouldnt care if i were cultivated ha is like all the rest he would like to joke and laugh well i think that is nice too and i wish i could do it but i never could and now i cant try i suppose he wonders what makes me such a dead weight on you all  you know youre not that ellen you musnt let yourself be morbid it hurts me to have you say such things  well i should like to tell him why and see what he would say  ellen  why not if he is a minister he must have thought about all kinds of things do you suppose he ever knew of a girl before who had been through what i have yes i would like to know what he would really say  i know what he ought to say if he knew he would say that no girl had ever behaved more angelically  do you think he would perhaps he would say that if i hadnt been so proud and sillyhere he comes shall we ask him  breckon approached with his map and her mother gasped thinking how terrible such a thing would be if it could be ellen smiled brightly up at him will you take my chair and then you can show momma your map i am going down and while he was still protesting she was gone  miss kenton seems so much better than she did the first day he said as he spread the map out on his knees and gave mrs kenton one end to hold  yes the mother assented as she bent over to look at it  she followed his explanation with a surface sense while her nether mind was full of the worry of the question which ellen had planted in it what would such a man think of what she had been through or rather how would he say to her the only things that in mrs kentons belief he could say how could the poor child ever be made to see it in the light of some mind not colored with her familys affection for her an immense an impossible longing possessed itself of the mothers heart which became the more insistent the more frantic it appeared she uttered yes and no and indeed to what he was saying but all the time she was rehearsing ellens story in her inner sense in the end she remembered so little what had actually passed that her dramatic reverie seemed the reality and when she left him she got herself down to her stateroom giddy with the shame and fear of her imaginary selfbetrayal she wished to test the enormity and yet not find it so monstrous by submitting the case to her husband and she could scarcely keep back her impatience at seeing ellen instead of her father  momma what have you been saying to mr breckon about me  nothing said mrs kenton aghast at first and then astonished to realize that she was speaking the simple truth he said how much better you were looking but i dont believe i spoke a single word we were looking at the map  very well ellen resumed i have been thinking it all over and now i have made up my mind  she paused and her mother asked tremulously about what ellen  you know momma i see all now you neednt be afraid that i care anything about him now and her mother knew that she meant bittridge or that i ever shall thats gone forever but its gone she added and her mother quaked inwardly to hear her reason because the wrong and the shame was all for mefor us thats why i can forgive it and forget if we had done anything the least thing in the world to revenge ourselves or to hurt him thendont you see momma  i think i see ellen  then i should have to keep thinking about it and what we had made him suffer and whether we hadnt given him some claim i dont wish ever to think of him again you and poppa were so patient and forbearing all through and i thank goodness now for everything you put up with only i wish i could have borne everything myself  you had enough to bear mrs kenton said in tender evasion  im glad that i had to bear so much for bearing it is what makes me free now she went up to her mother and kissed her and gazed into her face with joyful tearful looks that made her heart sink     xiv  mrs kenton did not rest till she had made sure from lottie and boyne that neither of them had dropped any hint to ellen of what happened to bittridge after his return to tuskingum she did not explain to them why she was so very anxious to know but only charged them the more solemnly not to let the secret which they had all been keeping from ellen escape them  they promised but lottie said shes got to know it some time and i should think the sooner the better  i will be judge of that lottie said her mother and boyne seized his chance of inculpating her with his friend mr pogis he said she was carrying on awfully with him already and an englishman could not understand and boyne hinted that he would presume upon her american freedom  well if he does ill get you to cowhide him boyne she retorted and left him fuming helplessly while she went to give the young englishman an opportunity of resuming the flirtation which her mother had interrupted  with her husband mrs kenton found it practicable to be more explicit i havent had such a load lifted off my heart since i dont know when it shows me what ive thought all along that ellen hasnt really cared anything for that miserable thing since he first began going with mrs uphill a year ago when he wrote that letter to her in new york she wanted to be sure she didnt and when he offered himself and misbehaved so to both of you she was afraid that she and you were somehow to blame now shes worked it out that no one else was wronged and she is satisfied its made her feel free as she says but oh dear me mrs kenton broke off i talk as if there was nothing to bind her and yet there is what poor richard did what would she say if she knew that i have been cautioning lottie and boyne but i know it will come out somehow do you think its wise to keep it from her hadnt we better tell her or shall we wait and see  kenton would not allow to her or to himself that his hopes ran with hers love is not business with a man as it is with a woman he feels it indecorous and indelicate to count upon it openly where she thinks it simply a chance of life to be considered like another all that kenton would say was i see no reason for telling her just yet she will have to know in due time but let her enjoy her freedom now  yes mrs kenton doubtfully assented  the judge was thoughtfully silent then he said few girls could have worked out her problem as ellen has think how differently lottie would have done it  lottie has her good points too said mrs kenton and of course i dont blame richard there are all kinds of girls and lottie means no more harm than ellen does shes the kind that cant help attracting but i always knew that ellen was attractive too if she would only find it out and i knew that as soon as anything worth while took up her mind she would never give that wretch another thought  kenton followed her devious ratiocinations to a conclusion which he could not grasp what do you mean sarah  if i only she explained in terms that did not explain felt as sure of him as i do about him  her husband looked densely at her bittridge  no mr breckon he is very nice rufus yes he is hes been showing me the map of holland and weve had a long talk he isnt the way we thoughtor i did he is not at all clerical or worldly and he appreciates ellen i dont suppose he cares so much for her being cultivated i suppose she doesnt seem so to him but he sees how wise she ishow good and he couldnt do that without being good himself rufus if we could only hope such a thing but of course there are thousands after him  there are not thousands of ellens after him said the judge before he could take time to protest and i dont want him to suppose that she is after him at all if he will only interest her and help her to keep her mind off herself its all i will ask of him i am not anxious to part with her now that shes all ours again  of course mrs kenton soothingly assented and i dont say that she dreams of him in any such way she cant help admiring his mind but what i mean is that when you see how he appreciates her you cant help wishing he could know just how wise and just how good she is it did seem to me as if i would give almost anything to have him know what she had been through with thatrapscallion  sarah  oh you may sarah me but i can tell you what mr kenton i believe that you could tell him every word of it and only make him appreciate her the more till you know that about ellen you dont know what a character she is i just ached to tell him  i dont understand you my dear said kenton but if you mean to tell him  why who could imagine doing such a thing dont you see that it is impossible such a thing would never have come into my head if it hadnt been for some morbid talk of ellens  of ellens  oh about wanting to disgust him by telling him why she was such a burden to us  she isnt a burden  i am saying what she said and it made me think that if such a person could only know the highminded way she had found to get out of her trouble i would like somebody who is capable of valuing her to value her in all her preciousness wouldnt you be glad if such a man as he is could know how and why she feels free at last  i dont think its necessary said kenton haughtily theres only one thing that could give him the right to know it and well wait for that first i thought you said that he was frivolous  boyne said that and lottie i took it for granted till i talked with him today he is lighthearted and gay he likes to laugh and joke but he can be very serious when he wants to  according to all precedent said the judge glumly such a man ought to be hanging round lottie everybody was that amounted to anything in tuskingum  oh in tuskingum and who were the men there that amounted to anything a lot of young lawyers and two students of medicine and some railroad clerks there wasnt one that would compare with mr breckon for a moment  all the more reason why he cant really care for ellen now see here sarah you know i dont interfere with you and the children but im afraid youre in a craze about this young fellow hes got these friends of his who have just turned up and well wait and see what he does with them i guess he appreciates the young lady as much as he does ellen  mrs kentons heart went down she doesnt compare with ellen she piteously declared  thats what we think he may think differently  mrs kenton was silenced but all the more she was determined to make sure that mr breckon was not interested in miss rasmith in any measure or manner detrimental to ellen as for miss rasmith herself mrs kenton would have had greater reason to be anxious about her behavior with boyne than mr breckon from the moment that the minister had made his two groups of friends acquainted the young lady had fixed upon boyne as that member of the kenton group who could best repay a more intimate friendship she was polite to them all but to boyne she was flattering and he was too little used to deference from ladies ten years his senior not to be very sensible of her worth in offering it to be unremittingly treated as a grownup person was an experience so dazzling that his vision was blinded to any possibilities in the behavior that formed it and before the day ended boyne had possessed miss rasmith of all that it was important for any fellowbeing to know of his character and history he opened his heart to eyes that had looked into others before his less for the sake of exploiting than of informing himself in the rare intelligence of miss rasmith he had found that serious patience with his problems which no one else not ellen herself had shown and after trying her sincerity the greater part of the day he put it to the supreme test one evening with a book which he had been reading boynes literature was largely entomological and zoological but this was a work of fiction treating of the fortunes of a young american adventurer who had turned his military education to account in the service of a german princess her highnesss dominions were not in any map of europe and perhaps it was her condition of political incognito that rendered her the more fittingly the prey of a passion for the american head of her armies boynes belief was that this character veiled a real identity and he wished to submit to miss rasmith the question whether in the exclusive circles of new york society any young millionaire was known to have taken service abroad after leaving west point he put it in the form of a scoffing incredulity which it was a comfort to have her take as if almost hurt by his doubt she said that such a thing might very well be and with rich american girls marrying all sorts of titles abroad it was not impossible for some brilliant young fellow to make his way to the steps of a throne boyne declared that she was laughing at him and she protested that it was the last thing she should think of doing she was too much afraid of him then he began to argue against the case supposed in the romance he proved from the book itself that the thing could not happen such a princess would not be allowed to marry the american no matter how rich he was she owned that she had not heard of just such an instance and he might think her very romantic and perhaps she was but if the princess was an absolute princess such as she was shown in that story she held that no power on earth could keep her from marrying the young american for herself she did not see though how the princess could be in love with that type of american if she had been in the princesss place she should have fancied something quite different she made boyne agree with her that eastern americans were all more or less europeanized and it stood to reason she held that a european princess would want something as uneuropean as possible if she was falling in love to please herself they had some contention upon the point that the princess would want a western american and then miss rasmith with a delicate audacity painted an heroic portrait of boyne himself which he could not recognize openly enough to disown but he perceived resemblances in it which went to his head when she demurely rose with a soft goodnight mr kenton i suppose i mustnt call you boyne  oh yes do he entreated imim not grown up yet you know  then it will be safe she sighed but i should never have thought of that i had got so absorbed in our argument you are so logical mr kentonboyne i meanthank you you must get it from your father how lovely your sister is  ellen  well no i meant the other one but miss kenton is beautiful too you must be so happy together all of you she added with a rueful smile theres only one of me goodnight  boyne did not know whether he ought not in humanity if not gallantry to say he would be a brother to her but while he stood considering she put out a hand to him so covered with rings that he was afraid she had hurt herself in pressing his so hard and had left him before he could decide  lottie walking the deck had not thought of bidding mr pogis goodnight she had asked him half a dozen times how late it was and when he answered had said as often that she knew better and she was going below in another minute but she stayed and the flow of her conversation supplied him with occasion for the remarks of which he seldom varied the formula when she said something too audacious for silent emotion he called out oh i say if she advanced an opinion too obviously acceptable or asked a question upon some point where it seemed to him there could not be two minds he was ready with the ironical note well rather at times she pressed her studies of his character and her observations on his manner and appearance so far that he was forced to protest you are so personal but these moments were rare for the most part oh i say and well rather perfectly covered the ground he did not generally mind her parody of his poverty of phrase but once after she had repeated well rather and oh i say steadily at everything he said for the whole round of the promenade they were making he intimated that there were occasions when in his belief a womans abuse of the freedom generously allowed her sex passed the point of words  and when it passes the point of words she taunted him what do you do  you will see he said if it ever does and lottie felt justified by her inference that he was threatening to kiss her in answering  and if i ever see i will box your ears  oh i say he retorted i should like to have you try  he had ideas of the rightful mastery of a man in all things which she promptly pronounced brutal and when he declared that his fathers conduct towards his wife and children was based upon these ideas she affirmed the superiority of her own fathers principles and behavior mr pogis was too declared an admirer of judge kenton to question his motives or method in anything and he could only generalize the americans spoil their women  well their women are worth it said lottie and after allowing the paradox time to penetrate his intelligence he cried out in a glad transport  oh i say  at the moment boynes intellectual seance with miss rasmith was coming to an end lottie had tacitly invited mr pogis to prolong the comparison of english and american family life by stopping in front of a couple of steamerchairs and confessing that she was tired to death they sat down and he told her about his mother whom although his fathers subordinate he seemed to be rather fonder of he had some elder brothers most of them in the colonies and he had himself been out to america looking at something his father had found for him in buffalo  you ought to come to tuskingum said lottie  is that a large place mr pogis asked as large as buffalo  well no lottie admitted but its a growing place and we have the best kind of times  what kind the young man easily consented to turn the commercial into a social inquiry  oh picnics and river parties and buggyrides and dances  im keen on dancing said mr pogis i hope theyll give us a dance on board will you put me down for the first dance  i dont care will you send me some flowers the steward must have some left in the refrigerator  well rather ill send you a spray if hes got enough  a spray whats a spray  oh i say my sister always wears one its a long chain of flowers reachin from your shoulder diagonally down to your waist  does your sister always have her sprays sent to her  well rather dont they send flowers to girls for dances in the states  well rather didnt i just ask you  this was very true and after a moment of baffle mr pogis said in generalization if you go with a young lady in a party to the theatre you send her a box of chocolates  only when you go to theatre i couldnt get enough then unless you asked me every night said lottie and while mr pogis was trying to choose between oh i say and something specific like i should like to ask you every night she added and what would happen if you sent a girl a spray for the theatre and chocolates for a dance wouldnt it jar her  now indeed there was nothing for him but to answer oh i say  well say then here comes boyne and i must go well boyne she called from the dark nook where she sat to her brother as he stumbled near with his eyes to the stars has the old lady retired  he gave himself away finely what old lady  well maybe at your age you dont consider her very old but i dont think a boy ought to sit up mooning at his grandmother all night i know miss rasmiths no relation if thats what youre going to say  oh i say mr pogis chuckled you are so personal  well rather said lottie punishing his presumption but i dont think its nice for a kid even if she isnt  kid boyne ground through his clenched teeth  by this time lottie was up out of her chair and beyond repartee in her flight down the gangway stairs she left the two youngsters confronted  what do you say to a lemonsquash asked mr pogis respecting his friends wounded dignity and ignoring lottie and her offence  i dont care if i do said boyne in gloomy acquiescence     xv  few witnesses of the fact that julia rasmith and her mother had found themselves on the same steamer with the rev hugh breckon would have been of such a simple mind as to think they were there by accident if they had also been witnesses of their earlier history the ladies could have urged that in returning from california only a few days before the amstel sailed and getting a stateroom which had been unexpectedly given up they had some claim to a charitable interpretation of their behavior but this plea could not have availed them with any connoisseur of women besides it had been a matter of notoriety among such of mr breckons variegated congregation as knew one another that mrs rasmith had set her heart on him it julia had not set her cap for him in that pied flock where every shade and dapple of doubt from heterodox jew to agnostic christian foregathered as it has been said in the misgiving of a blessed immortality the devotion of mrs rasmith to the minister had been almost a scandal nothing had saved the appearance from this character but mr breckons open acceptance of her flatteries and hospitalities this was so frank and the behavior of julia herself so judicious under the circumstances that envy and virtue were if not equally silenced equally baffled so far from pretending not to see her mothers manoeuvres julia invited public recognition of them in the way of joking which she kept within the limits of filial fondness she made fun of her mothers infatuation to breckon himself and warned him against the moment when her wiles might be too much for him before other people she did not hesitate to save him from her mother so that even those who believed her in the conspiracy owned that no girl could have managed with more cleverness in a situation where not every one would have refused to be placed in this situation julia rasmith had the service of a very clear head and as was believed by some a cool heart if she and her mother had joint designs upon the minister hers was the ambition and her mothers the affection that prompted them she was a long undulant girl of a mixed blondness that left you in doubt after you had left her whether her hair or her complexion were not of one tint but her features were good and there could be no question of her captivating laugh and her charming mouth which she was always pulling down with demure irony she was like her mother in her looks but her indolent droning temperament must have been from her father whose memory was lost in that antiquity which swallows up the record of so many widows husbands and who could not have left her what was left of her mothers money for none of it had ever been his it was still her mothers and it was supposed to be the daughters chief attraction there must therefore have been a good deal of it for those who were harshest with the minister did not believe that a little money would attract him not that they really thought him mercenary some of his people considered him gay to the verge of triviality but there were none that accused him of insincerity they would have liked a little more seriousness in him especially when they had not much of their own and would have had him make up in severity of behavior for what he lacked and what they wished him to lack in austerity of doctrine  the amstel had lost so much time in the rough weather of her first days out that she could not make it up with her oldfashioned single screw she was at best a tenday boat counting from sandy hook to boulogne and she had not been four days out when she promised to break her record for slowness three days later miss rasmith said to breckon as he took the chair which her mother agilely abandoned to him beside her the head steward says it will be a twelveday trip end our bedroom steward thinks more what is the consensus of opinion in the smokingroom where are you going mother are you planning to leave mr breckon and me alone again it isnt necessary we couldnt get away from each other if we tried and all we askwell i suppose age must be indulged in its little fancies she called after mrs rasmith  breckon took up the question she had asked him the odds are so heavily in favor of a fifteendays run that there are no takers  now you are joking again she said i thought a seavoyage might make you serious  it has been tried before besides its you that i want to be serious  what about besides i doubt it  about boyne  oh i thought you were going to say some one else  no i think that is very well settled  youll never persuade my mother said miss rasmith with a low comfortable laugh  but if you are satisfied  she will have to resign herself well perhaps but why do you wish me to be serious about boyne  i have no doubt he amuses you but that doesnt seem a very good reason why you should amuse yourself with him  no why not  well because the poor boy is in earnest and youre not exactlycontemporaries  why how old is boyne she asked with affected surprise  about fifteen i think said breckon gravely  and im but a very few months past thirty i dont see the great disparity but he is merely a brother to mean elder brotherand he gives me the best kind of advice  i dare say you need it but all the same i am afraid you are putting ideas into his head  well if he began it if he put them in mine first  she was evidently willing that he should go further and create the common ground between them that grows up when one gives a reproof and the other accepts it but breckon whether he thought that he had now done his duty and need say no more or because he was vexed with her left the subject  mrs rasmith says you are going to switzerland for the rest of the summer  yes to montreux are you going to spend it in paris  im going to paris to see i have had some thoughts of etretat i have cousins there  i wish that i could go to the seaside but this happens to be one of the summers when nothing but mountains can save my mothers life shall you get down to rome before you go back  i dont know if i sail from naples i shall probably pass through rome  you had better stop off we shall be there in november and they say rome is worth seeing she laughed demurely that is what boyne understands hes promised to use his influence with his family to let him run down to see us there if he cant get them all to come you might offer to personally conduct them  yes said breckon with the effect of cloture have you made many acquaintances an board  what two lone women you havent introduced us to any but the kentons but i dare say they are the best the judge is a dear and mrs kenton is everything that is motherly and matronly boyne says she is very well informed and knows all about the reigning families if he decides to marry into them she can be of great use in saving him from a mesalliance i cant say very much for miss lottie miss lottie seems to me distinctly of the minx type but that poor pale girl is adorable i wish she liked me  what makes you think she doesnt like you breckon asked  what women dont require anything to convince them that other women cant bear them they simply know it i wonder what has happened to her  why do you think anything has happened to her  why well girls dont have that air of melancholy absence for nothing she is brooding upon something you may be sure but you have had so many more opportunities than i do you mean that you havent suspected a tragical past far her  i dont know said breckon a little restively that i have allowed myself to speculate about her past  that is you oughtnt to have allowed yourself to do so well there i agree with you but a woman may do so without impertinence and i am sure that miss kenton has a story i have watched her and her face has told me everything but the story  breckon would not say that some such revelation had been made to him and in the absence of an answer from him miss rasmith asked is she cultivated too  too  like her mother  oh i should say she had read a good dial and shes bookish yes in a simplehearted kind of way  she asks you if you have read the book of the year and whether you dont think the heroine is a beautiful character  not quite so bad as that but if you care to be serious about her  oh i do  i doubt it then i should say that she seems to have grown up in a place where the interests are so material that a girl who was disposed to be thoughtful would be thrown back upon reading for her society more than in more intellectual centresif there are such things she has been so much with books that she does not feel odd in speaking of them as if they were the usual topics of conversation it gives her a certain quaintness  and that is what constitutes her charm  i didnt know that we were speaking of her charm  no that is true but i was thinking of it she fascinates me are they going to get off at boulogne  no they are going on to rotterdam  to be sure boyne told me and are you going on with them  i thought we talked of my going to paris breckon looked round at her and she made a gesture of deprecation  why of course how could i forget but im so much interested in miss kenton that i cant think of anything else  not even of miss rasmith  not even of miss rasmith i know that she has a history and that its a sad one she paused in ironical hesitation youve been so good as to caution me about her brotherand i never can be grateful enoughand that makes me almost free to suggest  she stopped again and he asked hardily what  oh nothing it isnt for me to remind my pastor my ghostly advisershe pulled down her mouth and glanced at him demurelyand i will only offer the generalization that a girl is never so much in danger of having her heart broken as when shes had it brokenoh are you leaving me she cried as breckon rose from his chair  well then send boyne to me she broke into a laugh as he faltered are you going to sit down again that is right and i wont talk any more about miss kenton  i dont mind talking of her said breckon perhaps it will even be well to do so if you are in earnest though it strikes me that you have rather renounced the right to criticise me  now is that logical it seems to me that in putting myself in the attitude of a final friend at the start and refusing to be anything more i leave established my right to criticise you on the firmest basis i cant possibly be suspected of interested motives besides youve just been criticizing me if you want a womans reason  well go on  why i had finished thats the amusing part i should have supposed that i could go on forever about miss kenton but i have nothing to go upon she has kept her secret very well and so have the rest of them you think i might have got it out of boyne perhaps i might but you know i have my little scruples i dont think it would be quite fair or quite nice  you are scrupulous and i give you credit for having been more delicate than ive been  you dont mean youve been trying to find it out  ah now im not sure about the superior delicacy  oh how good said miss rasmith what a pity you should be wasted in a calling that limits you so much  you call it limiting i didnt know but i had gone too far  not at all you know theres nothing i like so much as those little digs  i had forgotten then you wont mind my saying that this surveillance seems to me rather more than i have any right to from you  how exquisitely you put it who else could have told me to mind my own business so delightfully well it isnt my business i acknowledge that and i spoke only because i knew you would be sorry if you had gone too far i remembered our promise to be friends  she threw a touch of real feeling into her tone and he responded yes and i thank you for it though it isnt easy  she put out her hand to him and as he questioningly took it she pressed his with animation of course it isnt or it wouldnt be for any other man but dont you suppose i appreciate that supreme courage of yours there is nobody elsenobodywho could stand up to an impertinence and turn it to praise by such humility  dont go too far or i shall be turning your praise to impertinence by my humility youre quite right though about the main matter i neednt suppose anything so preposterous as you suggest to feel that people are best left alone to outlive their troubles unless they are of the most obvious kind  now if i thought i had done anything to stop you from offering that sort of helpfulness which makes you a blessing to everybody i should never forgive myself  nothing so dire as that i believe but if youve made me question the propriety of applying the blessing in all cases you have done a very good thing  miss rasmith was silent and apparently serious after a moment she said and i for my part promise to let poor little boyne alone  breckon laughed dont burlesque it besides i havent promised anything  that is very true said miss rasmith and she laughed too     xvi  in one of those dramatic reveries which we all hold with ourselves when fortune has pressingly placed us ellen kenton had imagined it possible for her to tell her story to the man who had so gently and truly tried to be her friend it was mostly in the way of explaining to him how she was unworthy of his friendship that the story was told and she fancied telling it without being scandalized at violating the conventions that should have kept her from even dreaming of such a thing it was all exalted to a plane where there was no question of fit or unfit in doing it but only the occasion and he would never hear of the unworthiness which she wished to ascribe to herself sometimes he mournfully left her when she persisted left her forever and sometimes he refused and retained with her in a sublime kindness a noble amity lofty and serene which did not seek to become anything else in this case she would break from her reveries with selfaccusing cries under her breath of silly silly oh how disgusting and if at that moment breckon were really coming up to sit by her she would blush to her hair and wish to run away and failing the force for this would sit cold and blank to his civilities and have to be skilfully and gradually talked back to selfrespect and selftolerance  the recurrence of these reveries and their consequence in her made it difficult for him to put in effect the promise he had given himself in miss rasmiths presence if ellen had been eager to welcome his coming it would have been very simple to keep away from her but as she appeared anxious to escape him and had to be entreated as it were to suffer his society something better than his curiosity was piqued though that was piqued too he believed that he saw her lapsing again into that morbid state from which he had seemed once able to save her and he could not help trying again he was the more bound to do so by the ironical observance of miss rasmith who had to be defied first and then propitiated certainly when she saw him apparently breaking faith with her she had a right to some sort of explanation but certainly also she had no right to a blind and unreasoning submission from him his embarrassment was heightened by her interest in miss kenton whom with an admirable show of now finding her safe from breckons attractions she was always wishing to study from his observation what was she really like the girl had a perfect fascination for her she envied him his opportunities of knowing her and his privileges of making that melancholy face light up with that heartbreaking smile and of banishing that delicious shyness with which she always seemed to meet him miss rasmith had noticed it how could she help noticing it  breckon wished to himself that she had been able to help noticing it or were more capable of minding her own business than she showed herself and his heart closed about ellen with a tenderness that was dangerously indignant at the same time he felt himself withheld by miss rasmiths witness from being all to the girl that he wished to be and that he now seemed to have been in those first days of storm while miss rasmith and her mother were still keeping their cabin he foresaw that it would end in miss rasmiths sympathetic nature not being able to withhold itself from ellens need of cheerful companionship and he was surprised as little as he was pleased one morning when he came to take the chair beside her to find miss rasmith in it talking and laughing to the girl who perversely showed herself amused miss rasmith made as if to offer him the seat but he had to go away disappointed after standing long enough before them to be aware that they were suspending some topic while he stayed  he naturally supposed the topic to be himself but it was not so or at least not directly so it was only himself as related to the scolding he had given miss rasmith for trifling with the innocence of boyne which she wished miss kenton to understand as the effect of a real affection for her brother she loved all boys and boyne was simply the most delightful creature in the world she went on to explain how delightful he was and showed a such an appreciation of the infantile sweetness mingled with the mature severity of boynes character that ellen could not help being pleased and won she told some little stories of boyne that threw a light also their home life in tuskingum and miss rasmith declared herself perfectly fascinated and wished that she could go and live in tuskingum she protested that she should not find it dull boyne alone would be entertainment enough and she figured a circumstance so idyllic from the hints she had gathered that ellens brow darkened in silent denial and miss rasmith felt herself as the children say in the game very hot in her proximity to the girls secret she would have liked to know it but whether she felt that she could know it when she liked enough or whether she should not be so safe with breckon in knowing it she veered suddenly away and said that she was so glad to have boynes family know the peculiar nature of her devotion which did not necessarily mean running away with him though it might come to that she supposed she was a little morbid about it from what mr breckon had been saying he had a conscience that would break the peace of a whole community though he was the greatest possible favorite not only with his own congregation which simply worshipped him but with the best society where he was in constant request  it was not her fault if she did not overdo these history but perhaps it was all true about the number of girls who were ready and willing to marry him it might even be true though she had no direct authority for saying it that he had made up his mind never to marry and that was the reason why he felt himself so safe in being the nicest sort of friend he was safe miss rasmith philosophized but whether other people were so safe was a different question there were girls who were said to be dying for him but of course those things were always said about a handsome young minister she had frankly taken him on his own ground from the beginning and she believed that this was what he liked at any rate they had agreed that they were never to be anything but the best of friends and they always had been  mrs kenton came and shyly took the chair on miss rasmiths other side and miss rasmith said they had been talking about mr breckon and she repeated what she had been saying to ellen mrs kenton assented more openly than ellen could to her praises but when she went away and her daughter sat passive without comment or apparent interest the mother drew a long involuntary sigh  do you like her ellen  she tries to be pleasant i think  do you think she really knows much about mr breckon  oh yes why not she belongs to his church  he doesnt seem to me like a person who would have a parcel of girls tagging after him  that is what they do in the east boyne says  i wish she would let boyne alone she is making a fool of the child hes round with her every moment i think she ought to be ashamed such an old thing  ellen chose to protest or thought it fair to do so i dont believe she is doing him any harm she just lets him talk out and everybody else checks him up so it was nice of her to come and talk with me when we had all been keeping away from her perhaps he sent her though she says they have always been such good friends because she wouldnt be anything else from the beginning  i dont see why she need have told you that  oh it was just to show he was run after i wonder if he thinks we are running after him momma i am tired of him i wish he wouldnt speak to me any more  why do you really dislike him ellen  no not dislike him but it tires me to have him trying to amuse me dont you understand  mrs kenton said yes she understood but she was clear only of the fact that ellen seemed flushed and weak at that moment she believed that it was miss rasmith and not mr breckon who was to blame but she said well you neednt worry about it long it will only be a day or two now till we get to boulogne and then he will leave us hadnt you better go down now and rest awhile in your berth i will bring your things  ellen rose pulling her wraps from her skirts to give them to her mother a voice from behind said between their meeting shoulders oh are you going down i was just coming to beg miss kenton to take a little walk with me and they looked round together and met breckons smiling face  im afraid mrs kenton began and then like a welltrained american mother she stopped and left the affair to her daughter  do you think you can get down with them momma the girl asked and somehow her mothers heart was lightened by her evasion not to call it uncandor it was at least not morbid it was at least like other girls and mrs kenton imparted what comfort there was in it to the judge when he asked where she had left ellen  not that its any use she sighed when she had seen him share it with a certain shamefacedness that woman has got her grip on him and she doesnt mean to let go  kenton understood miss rasmith by that woman but he would not allow himself to be so easily cast down this was one of the things that provoked mrs kenton with him when he had once taken hope he would not abandon it without reason i dont see any evidence of her having her grip on him ive noticed him and he doesnt seem attentive to her i should say he tried to avoid her he certainly doesnt avoid ellen  what are you thinking of rufus  what are you you know wed both be glad if he fancied her  well suppose we would i dont deny it he is one of the most agreeable gentlemen i ever saw one of the kindest and nicest  hes more than that said the judge ive been sounding him on various points and i dont see where hes wrong of course i dont know much about his religious persuasion if it is one but i think im a pretty fair judge of character and that young man has character he isnt a light person though he likes joking and laughing and he appreciates ellen  yes so do we and theres about as much prospect of his marrying her rufus its pretty hard shes just in the mood to be taken with him but she wont let herself because she knows its of no use that miss rasmith has been telling her how much he is run after and i could see that that settled it for ellen as plainly as if she said so more plainly for theres enough of the girl in her to make her say one thing when she means another she was just saying she was sick of him and never wanted to speak to him again when he came up and asked her to walk and she went with him instantly i knew what she meant she wasnt going to let him suppose that anything miss rasmith had said was going to change her  well then said the judge i dont see what youre scared at  im not scared but oh rufus it cant come to anything there isnt time an hysterical hope trembled in her asseveration of despair that made him smile  i guess if times all thats wanted  he is going to get off at boulogne  well we can get off there too  rufus if you dare to think of such a thing  i dont but europe isnt so big but what he can find us again if he wants to  ah if he wants to  ellen seemed to have let her mother take her languor below along with the shawls she had given her buttoned into a close jacket and skirted short for the sea she pushed against the breeze at breckons elbow with a vigor that made him look his surprise at her girllike she took it that something was wrong with her dress and ran herself over with an uneasy eye  then he explained i was just thinking how much you were like miss lottieif youll excuse my being so personal and it never struck me before  i didnt suppose we looked alike said ellen  no certainly i shouldnt have taken you for sisters and yet just now i felt that you were like her you seem so much stronger this morningperhaps its that the voyage is doing you good shall you be sorry to have it end  shall you thats the way lottie would answer  breckon laughed yes it is i shall be very sorry i should be willing to have it rough again it that would make it longer i liked its being rough we had it to ourselves he had not thought how that sounded but if it sounded particular she did not notice it  she merely said i was surprised not to be seasick too  and should you be willing to have it rough again  you wouldnt see anything more of your friends then  ah yes miss rasmith she is a great talker did you find her interesting  she was very interesting  yes what did she talk about  ellen realized the fact too late to withhold why about you  and was that what made her interesting  now what would lottie say to such a thing as that asked ellen gayly  something terribly cutting im afraid but dont you from you i dont want to believe i deserve it no matter what miss rasmith said me  oh she didnt say anything very bad unless you mind being a universal favorite  well it makes a man out rather silly  but you cant help that  now you remind me of miss lottie again  but i didnt mean that said ellen blushing and laughing i hope you wouldnt think i could be so pert  i wouldnt think anything that wasnt to your praise said breckon and a pause ensued after which the words he added seemed tame and flat i suspect miss rasmith has been idealizing the situation at any rate i shouldnt advise you to trust her report implicitly im at the head of a society you know ethical or sociological or altruistic whatever you choose to call it which hasnt any very definite object of worship and yet meets every sunday for a sort of worship and i have to be in the pulpit so you see  ellen said i think i understand with a temptation to smile at the ruefulness of his appeal  breckon laughed for her thats the mischief and the absurdity of it but it isnt so bad as it seems theyre really most of them hardheaded people and those that are not couldnt make a fool of a man that nature hadnt begun with still im not very well satisfied with my work among themthat is im not satisfied with myself he was talking soberly enough and he did not find that she was listening too seriously im going away to see whether i shall come back he looked at her to make sure that she had taken his meaning and seemed satisfied that she had im not sure that im fit for any sort of ministry and i may find the winter in england trying to find out i was at school in england you know  ellen confessed that she had not known that  yes i suppose thats what made me seem so englishy the first day to miss lottie as she called it but im straight enough american as far as parentage goes do you think you will be in englandlater  i dont know if poppa gets too homesick we will go back in the fall  miss kenton said the young man abruptly will you let me tell you how much i admire and revere your father  tears came into her eyes and her throat swelled but you dont know she begun and then she stopped  i have been wanting to submit something to his judgment but ive been afraid i might seem to be fishing for his favor  poppa wouldnt think anything that was unjust said ellen gravely  ah breckon laughed i suspect that i should rather have him unjust i wish youd tell me what he would think  but i dont know what it is she protested with a reflected smile  i was in hopes miss rasmith might have told you well it is simply this and you will see that im not quite the universal favorite shes been making you fancy me there is a rift in my lute a schism in my little society which is so little that i could not have supposed there was enough of it to break in two there are some who think their lecturerfor thats what i amount toought to be an older if not a graver man they are in the minority but theyre in the right im afraid and thats why i happen to be here telling you all this its a question of whether i ought to go back to new york or stay in london where theres been a faint call for me he saw the girl listening devoutly with that flattered look which a serious girl cannot keep out of her face when a man confides a serious matter to her i might safely promise to be older but could i keep my word if i promised to be graver thats the point if i were a calvinist i might hold fast by faith and fight it out with that or if i were a catholic i could cast myself upon the strength of the church and triumph in spite of temperament then it wouldnt matter whether i was grave or gay it might be even better if i were gay but he went on in terms which doubtless were not then for the first time formulated in his mind being merely the leader of a sort of forlorn hope in the divine goodness perhaps i have no right to be so cheerful  the note of a sad irony in his words appealed to such indignation for him in ellen as she never felt for herself but she only said i dont believe poppa could take that in the wrong way if you told him  breckon stared yes your father what would he say  i cant tell you but im sure he would know what you meant  and you he pursued what should you say  i i never thought about such a thing you mustnt ask me if youre serious and if youre not  but i am i am deeply serious i would like to know how the case strikes you i shall be so grateful if you will tell me  im sorry i cant mr breckon why dont you ask poppa  no i see now i shant be able i feel too much after telling you as if i had been posing the reality has gone out of it all and im ashamed  you mustnt be she said quietly and she added i suppose it would be like a kind of defeat if you didnt go back  i shouldnt care for the appearance of defeat he said courageously the great question is whether somebody else wouldnt be of more use in my place  nobody could be said she in a sort of impassioned absence and then coming to herself i mean they wouldnt think so i dont believe  then you advise  no no i cant i dont im not fit to have an opinion about such a thing it would be crazy but poppa  they were at the door of the gangway and she slipped within and left him his nerves tingled and there was a glow in his breast it was sweet to have surprised that praise from her though he could not have said why he should value the praise or a girl of her open ignorance and inexperience in everything that would have qualified her to judge him but he found himself valuing it supremely and wonderingly wishing to be worthy of it     xvii  ellen discovered her father with a book in a distant corner of the diningsaloon which he preferred to the deck or the library for his reading in such intervals as the stewards laying and cleaning the tables left him unmolested in it she advanced precipitately upon him and stood before him in an excitement which though he lifted his dazed eyes to it from his page he was not entirely aware of till afterwards then he realized that her cheeks were full of color and her eyes of light and that she panted as if she had been running when she spoke  poppa she said there is something that mr breckon wants to speak to youto ask you about he has asked me but i want you to see him for i think he had better tell you himself  while he still stared at her she was as suddenly gone as she had come and he remained with his book which the meaning had as suddenly left there was no meaning in her words except as he put it into them and after he had got it in he struggled with it in a sort of perfunctory incredulity it was not impossible it chiefly seemed so because it seemed too good to be true and the more he pondered it the more possible if not probable it became he could not be safe with it till he had submitted it to his wife and he went to her while he was sure of repeating ellens words without varying from them a syllable  to his astonishment mrs kenton was instantly convinced why of course she said it cant possibly mean anything else why should it be so very surprising the time hasnt been very long but theyve been together almost every moment and he was taken with her from the very beginningi could see that put on your other coat she said as she dusted the collar of the coat the judge was wearing hell be looking you up at once i cant say that its unexpected and she claimed a prescience in the matter which all her words had hitherto denied  kenton did not notice her inconsistency if it were not so exactly what i wished he said i dont know that i should be surprised at it myself sarah if i had been trying to imagine any one for ellen i couldnt have dreamed of a person better suited to her than this young man hes everything that i could wish him to be ive seen the pleasure and comfort she took in his way from the first moment he seemed to make her forgetdo you suppose she has forgotten that miserable wretch do you think  if she hadnt could she be letting him come to speak to you i dont believe she ever really cared for bittridgeor not after he began flirting with mrs uphill she had no shrinking from the names which kenton avoided with disgust the only question for you is to consider what you shall say to mr breckon  say to him why of course if ellen has made up her mind theres only one thing i can say  indeed there is he ought to know all about that disgusting bittridge business and you have got to tell him  sarah i couldnt it is too humiliating how would it do to refer him toyou could manage that part so much better i dont see how i could keep it from seeming an indelicate betrayal of the poor child  perhaps shes told him herself mrs kenton provisionally suggested  the judge eagerly caught at the notion do you think so it would be like her ellen would wish him to know everything  he stopped and his wife could see that he was trembling with excitement we must find out i will speak to ellen  andyou dont think id better have the talk with him first  certainly not  why rufus you were not going to look him up  no he hesitated but she could see that some such thing had been on his mind  surely she said you must be crazy but she had not the heart to blight his joy with sarcasm and perhaps no sarcasm would have blighted it  i merely wondered what i had better say in case he spoke to me before you saw ellenthats all sarah i couldnt have believed that anything could please me so much but it does seem as if it were the assurance of ellens happiness and she has deserved it poor child if ever there was a dutiful and loving daughterat least before that wretched affairshe was one  she has been a good girl mrs kenton stoically admitted  and they are very well matched ellen is a cultivated woman he never could have cause to blush for her either her mind or her manners in any circle of society she would do him credit under any and all circumstances if it were lottie  lottie is all right said her mother in resentment of his preference but she could not help smiling at it dont you be foolish about ellen i approve of mr breckon as much as you do but its her prettiness and sweetness thats taken his fancy and not her wisdom if shes got him  if shes got him  well you know what i mean im not saying she hasnt dear knows i dont want to i feel just as you do about it i think its the greatest piece of good fortune coming on top of all our trouble with her i couldnt have imagined such a thing  he was instantly appeased are you going to speak with ellen he radiantly inquired  i will see theres no especial hurry is there  only if he should happen to meet me  you can keep out of his way i reckon or you can put him off somehow  yes kenton returned doubtfully dont he added be too blunt with ellen you know she didnt say anything explicit to me  i think i will know how to manage mr kenton  yes of course sarah im not saying that  breckon did not apparently try to find the judge before lunch and at table he did not seem especially devoted to ellen in her fathers jealous eyes he joked lottie and exchanged those passages or repartee with her in which she did not mind using a bludgeon when she had not a rapier at hand it is doubtful if she was very sensible of the difference ellen sat by in passive content smiling now and then and boyne carried on a dignified conversation with mr pogis whom he had asked to lunch at his table and who listened with one ear to the vigorous retorts of lottie in her combat with breckon  the judge witnessed it all with a grave displeasure more and more painfully apparent to his wife she could see the impatience the gathering misgiving in his face and she perceived that she must not let this come to conscious dissatisfaction with breckon she knew her husband capable of indignation with trifling which would complicate the situation if it came to that she decided to speak with ellen as soon as possible and she meant to follow her to her stateroom when they left the table but fate assorted the pieces in the game differently boyne walked over to the place where miss rasmith was sitting with her mother lottie and mr pogis went off to practise duets together terrible fourhanded torments under which the piano presently clamored and ellen stood for a moment talked to by mr breckon who challenged her then for a walk on deck and with whom she went away smiling  mrs kenton appealed with the reflection of the girls happiness in her face to the frowning censure in her husbands but kenton spoke first what does he mean he demanded darkly if he is making a fool of her hell find that that game cant be played twice with impunity sarah i believe i should choke him  mr kenton she gasped and she trembled in fear of him even while she kept herself with difficulty from shaking him for his folly dont say such a thing cant you see that they want to talk it over if he hasnt spoken to you its because he wants to know how you took what she said seeing the effect of these arguments she pursued will you never have any sense i will speak to ellen the very minute i get her alone and you have just got to wait dont you suppose its hard for me too have i got nothing to bear  kenton went silently back to his book which he took with him to the readingroom where from time to time his wife came to him and reported that ellen and breckon were still walking up and down together or that they were sitting down talking or were forward looking over at the prow or were watching the deckpassengers dancing her husband received her successive advices with relaxing interest and when she had brought the last she was aware that the affair was entirely in her hands with all the responsibility after the gay parting between ellen and breckon which took place late in the afternoon she suffered an interval to elapse before she followed the girl down to her stateroom she found her lying in her berth with shining eyes and glad red cheeks she was smiling to herself  that is right ellen her mother said you need rest after your long tramp  im not tired we were sitting down a good deal i didnt think how late it was im ever so much better wheres lottie  off somewhere with that young englishman said mrs kenton as if that were of no sort of consequence ellen she added abruptly trying within a tremulous smile to hide her eagerness what is this that mr breckon wants to talk with your father about  mr breckon with poppa  yes certainly you told him this morning that mr breckon  oh oh yes said ellen as if recollecting something that had slipped her mind he wants poppa to advise him whether to go back to his congregation in new york or not  mrs kenton sat in the corner of the sofa next the door looking into the girls face on the pillow as she lay with her arms under her head tears of defeat and shame came into her eyes and she could not see the girls light nonchalance in adding  but he hasnt got up his courage yet he thinks hell ask him after dinner he says he doesnt want poppa to think hes posing i dont know what he means  mrs kenton did not speak at once her bitterest mortification was not for herself but for the simple and tender fathersoul which had been so tried already she did not know how he would bear it the disappointment and the cruel hurt to his pride but she wanted to fall on her knees in thankfulness that he had betrayed himself only to her  she started in sudden alarm with the thought where is he nowmr breckon  hes gone with boyne down into the baggageroom  mrs kenton sank back in her corner aware now that she would not have had the strength to go to her husband even to save him from the awful disgrace of giving himself away to breckon and was that all she faltered  all  that he wanted to speak to your father about  she must make irrefragably sure for kentons sake that she was not misunderstanding  why of course what else why momma what are you crying about  im not crying child just some foolishness of your fathers he understoodhe thought mrs kenton began to laugh hysterically but you know how ridiculous he is and he supposedno i wont tell you  it was not necessary the girls mind perhaps because it was imbued already with the subject had possessed itself of what filled her mothers she dropped from the elbow on which she had lifted herself and turned her face into the pillow with a long wail of shame     xviii  mrs kentons difficulties in setting her husband right were indefinitely heightened by the suspicion that the most unsuspicious of men fell into concerning breckon did breckon suppose that the matter could be turned off in that way he stupidly demanded and when he was extricated from this error by his wifes representation that breckon had not changed at all but had never told ellen that he wished to speak with him of anything but his returning to his society kenton still could not accept the fact he would have contended that at least the other matter must have been in breckons mind and when he was beaten from this position and convinced that the meaning they had taken from ellens words had never been in any mind but their own he fell into humiliation so abject that he could hide it only by the hauteur with which he carried himself towards breckon when they met at dinner he would scarcely speak to the young man ellen did not come to the table lottie and boyne and their friend mr pogis were dining with the rasmiths and mrs kenton had to be as she felt cringingly kind to breckon in explaining just the sort of temporary headache that kept her eldest daughter away he was more than ordinarily sympathetic and polite but he was manifestly bewildered by kentons behavior he refused an hilarious invitation from mrs rasmith when he rose from table to stop and have his coffee with her on his way out of the saloon his old adorer explained that she had ordered a small bottle of champagne in honor of its being the night before they were to get into boulogne and that he ought to sit down and help her keep the young people straight julia she brokenly syllabled with the gay beverage bubbling back into her throat was not the least use she was worse than any julia did not look it in the demure regard which she bent upon her amusing mother and breckon persisted in refusing he said he thought he might safely leave them to boyne and mrs rasmith said into her handkerchief oh yes boyne and pressed boynes sleeve with her knobbed and jewelled fingers  it was evident where most of the small bottle had gone but breckon was none the cheerfuller for the spectacle of mrs rasmith he could not have a moments doubt as to the sort of work he had been doing in new york if she were an effect of it and he turned his mind from the sad certainty back to the more important inquiry as to what offence his wish to advise with judge kenton could have conveyed ellen had told him in the afternoon that she had spoken with her father about it and she had not intimated any displeasure or reluctance on him but apparently he had decided not to suffer himself to be approached  it might be as well breckon had not been able to convince himself that his proposal to consult judge kenton was not a pose he had flashes of owning that it was contemplated merely as a means of ingratiating himself with ellen now as he found his way up and down among the empty steamerchairs he was aware at the bottom of his heart of not caring in the least for judge kentons repellent bearing except as it possibly or impossibly reflected some mood of hers he could not make out her not coming to dinner the headache was clearly an excuse for some reason she did not wish to see him he argued with the egotism of his condition  the logic of his conclusion was strengthened at breakfast by her continued absence and this time mrs kenton made no apologies for her the judge was a shade less severe or else breckon did not put himself so much in the way to be withheld as he had the night before boyne and lottie carried on a sort of muted scrap unrebuked by their mother who seemed too much distracted in some tacit trouble to mind them from time to time breckon found her eyes dwelling upon him wonderingly entreatingly she dropped them if she caught his and colored  in the afternoon it was early evident that they were approaching boulogne the hatch was opened and the sailors began getting up the baggage of the passengers who were going to disembark it seemed a long time for everybody till the steamer got in those going ashore sat on their handbaggage for an hour before the tug came up to take them off mr pogis was among them he had begun in the forenoon to mark the approaching separation between lottie and himself by intervals of unmistakable withdrawal another girl might have cared but lottie did not care for her failure to get a rise out of him by her mockingly varied oh i say and well rather in the growth of his dignified reserve mr pogis was indifferent to jeers by whatever tradition of what would or would not do he was controlled in relinquishing her acquaintance or whether it was in obedience to some imperative ideal or some fearful domestic influence subtly making itself felt from the coasts of his native island or some fine despair of equalling the imagined grandeur of lotties social state in tuskingum by anything he could show her in england it was certain that he was ending with lottie then and there at the same time he was carefully defining himself from the rasmiths with whom he must land he had his stateroom things put at an appreciable distance where he did not escape a final stab from lottie  oh do give me a rose out of that she entreated in travestied imploring as he stood looking at a withered bouquet which the steward had brought up with his rugs  im takin it home he explained coldly  and i want to take a rose back to new york i want to give it to a friend of mine there  mr pogis hesitated then he asked a man well rather said lottie  he answered nothing but looked definitively down at the flowers in his hand  oh i say lottie exulted  boyne remained fixed in fealty to the rasmiths with whom breckon was also talking as mrs kenton came up with the judge she explained how sorry her daughter ellen was at not being able to say goodbye she was still not at all well and the ladies received her excuses with polite patience mrs rasmith said she did not know what they should do without boyne and miss rasmith put her arm across his shoulders and pulled him up to her and implored oh give him to me mrs kenton  boyne stole an ashamed look at his mother and his father said with an unbending to breckon which must have been the effect of severe expostulation from mrs kenton i suppose you and the ladies will go to paris together  why no breckon said and he added with mounting confusion ii had arranged to keep on to rotterdam i was going to mention it  keep on to rotterdam mrs rasmiths eyes expressed the greatest astonishment  why of course mother said her daughter dont you know boyne told us  boyne after their parting seized the first chance of assuring his mother that he had not told miss rasmith that for he had not known it and he went so far in her condemnation to wonder how she could say such a thing his mother said it was not very nice and then suggested that perhaps she had heard it from some one else and thought it was he she acquitted him of complicity with miss rasmith in forbearing to contradict her and it seemed to her a fitting time to find out from boyne what she honestly could about the relation of the rasmiths to mr breckon it was very little beyond their supposition which every one else had shared that he was going to land with them at boulogne and he must have changed his mind very suddenly boyne had not heard the rasmiths speak of it miss rasmith never spoke of mr breckon at all but she seemed to want to talk of ellen she was always asking about her and what was the matter with her and how long she had been sick  boyne said his mother with a pang you didnt tell her anything about ellen  momma said the boy in such evident abhorrence of the idea that she rested tranquil concerning it she paid little attention to what boyne told her otherwise of the rasmiths her own horizon were so limited that she could not have brought home to herself within them that wandering life the rasmiths led from climate to climate and sensation to sensation with no stay so long as the annually made in new york where they sometimes passed months enough to establish themselves in giving and taking tea in a circle of kindred nomads she conjectured as ignorantly as boyne himself that they were very rich and it would not have enlightened her to know that the mother was the widow of a california politician whom she had married in the sort of middle period following upon her less mortuary survival of miss rasmiths father whose name was not rasmith  what mrs kenton divined was that they had wanted to get breckon and that so far as concerned her own interest in him they had wanted to get him away from ellen in her innermost selfconfidences she did not permit herself the notion that ellen had any right to him but still it was a relief to have them off the ship and to have him left of all the witnesses of the fact she alone did not find it awkward breckon himself found it very awkward he did not wish to be with the rasmiths but he found it uncomfortable not being with them under the circumstances and he followed them ashore in tingling reveries of explanation and apology he had certainly meant to get off at boulogne and when he had suddenly and tardily made up his mind to keep on to rotterdam he had meant to tell them as soon as he had the labels on his baggage changed he had not meant to tell them why he had changed his mind and he did not tell them now in these tingling reveries he did not own the reason in his secret thoughts for it no longer seemed a reason it no longer seemed a cause he knew what the rasmiths would think but he could easily make that right with his conscience at least by parting with the kentons at rotterdam and leaving them to find their unconducted way to any point they chose beyond he separated himself uncomfortably from them when the tender had put off with her passengers and the ship had got under way again and went to the smokingroom while the judge returned to his book and mrs kenton abandoned lottie to her own devices and took boyne aside for her apparently fruitless inquiries  they were not really so fruitless but that at the end of them she could go with due authority to look up her husband she gently took his book from him and shut it up now mr kenton she began if you dont go right straight and find mr breckon and talk with him ii dont know what i will do you must talk to him  about ellen the judge frowned  no certainly not talk with him about anything that interests you be pleasant to him cant you see that hes going on to rotterdam on our account  then i wish he wasnt theres no use in it  no matter its polite in him and i want you to show him that you appreciate it  now see here sarah said the judge if you want him shown that we appreciate his politeness why dont you do it yourself  i because it would look as if you were afraid to it would look as if we meant something by it  well i am afraid and thats just what im afraid of i declare my heart comes into my mouth whenever i think what an escape we had i think of it whenever i look at him and i couldnt talk to him without having that in my mind all the time no women can manage those things better if you believe he is going along on our account so as to help us see holland and to keep us from getting into scrapes youre the one to make it up to him i dont care what you say to show him our gratitude i reckon we will get into all sorts of trouble if were left to ourselves but if you think hes stayed because he wants to be with ellen and  oh i dont know what i think and thats silly i cant talk to him im afraid itll seem as if we wanted to flatter him and goodness knows we dont want to or yes we do id give anything if it was true rufus do you suppose he did stay on her account my oh my if i could only think so wouldnt it be the best thing in the world for the poor child and for all of us i never saw anybody that i liked so much but its too good to be true  hes a nice fellow but i dont think hes any too good for ellen  im not saying he is the great thing is that hes good enough and gracious knows what will happen if she meets some other worthless fellow and gets befooled with him or if she doesnt take a fancy to some one and goes back to tuskingum without seeing any one else she likes there is that awful wretch and when she hears what dick did to himshes just wrongheaded enough to take up with him again to make amends to him oh dear oh dear i know lottie will let it out to her yet  the judge began threateningly you tell lottie from me  what said the girl herself who had seen her father and mother talking together in a remote corner of the musicroom and had stolen lightfootedly upon them just at this moment  lottie child said her mother undismayed at lotties arrival in her larger anxiety i wish you would try and be agreeable to mr breckon now that hes going on with us to holland i dont want him to think were avoiding him  why  oh because  because you want to get him for ellen  dont be impudent said her father you do as your mother bids you  be agreeable to that old breckon i think i see myself id sooner read im going to get a book now she left them as abruptly as she had come upon them and ran across to the bookcase where she remained two stepping and peering through the glass doors at the literature within in unaccustomed question concerning it  shes a case said the judge looking at her not only with relenting but with the pride in her sufficiency for all the exigencies of life which he could not feel in ellen she can take care of herself  oh yes mrs kenton sadly assented i dont think anybody will ever make a fool of lottie  its a great deal more likely to be the other way her father suggested  i think lottie is conscientious mrs kenton protested she wouldnt really fool with a man  no shes a good girl the judge owned  its girls like ellen who make the trouble and the care they are too good and you have to think some evil in this world well she rose and gave her husband back his book  do you know where boyne is  no do you want him to be pleasant to mr breckon  somebody has got to but it would be ridiculous if nobody but boyne was  she did not find boyne after no very exhaustive search and the boy was left to form his bearing towards breckon on the behavior of the rest of his family as this continued helplessly constrained both in his father and mother and voluntarily repellent in lottie boyne decided upon a blend of conduct which left breckon in greater and greater doubt of his wisdom in keeping on to rotterdam there was no good reason which he would have been willing to give himself from the beginning it had been an impulse suddenly coming upon him in the baggageroom where he had gone to get something out of his trunk and where he had decided to have the label of his baggage changed from the original destination at boulogne to the final port of the steamers arrival when this was once done he was sorry but he was ashamed to have the label changed back the most assignable motive for his act was his reluctance to go on to paris with the rasmiths or rather with mrs rasmith for with her daughter who was not a bad fellow one could always manage he was quite aware of being safely in his own hands against any design of mrs rasmiths but her machinations humiliated him for her he hated to see her going through her manoeuvres and he could not help grieving for her failures with a sort of impersonal sympathy all the more because he disliked her as little as he respected her  the motive which he did not assign to himself was that which probably prevailed with him though in the last analysis it was as selfish no doubt as the one he acknowledged ellen kenton still piqued his curiosity still touched his compassion he had so far from exhausted his wish or his power to befriend her to help her that he had still a wholly unsatisfied longing to console her especially when she drooped into that listless attitude she was apt to take with her face fallen and her hands let lie the back of one in the palm of the other in her lap it was possibly the vision of this following him to the baggageroom when he went to open his trunk that as much as anything decided him to have the label changed on his baggage but he did not own it then and still less did he own it now when he found himself quite on his own hands for his pains  he felt that for some reason the kentons were all avoiding him ellen indeed did not take part against him unless negatively for she had appeared neither at lunch nor at dinner as the vessel kept on its way after leaving boulogne and when he ventured to ask for her mrs kenton answered with embarrassment that she was not feeling very well he asked for her at lunch but not at dinner and when he had finished that meal he went on the promenadedeck and walked forlornly up and down feeling that he had been a fool  mrs kenton went below to her daughters room and found ellen there on the sofa with her book shut on her thumb at the place where the twilight had failed her  ellen dear her mother said arent you feeling well  yes im well enough said the girl sensible of a leading in the question why  oh nothing onlyonly i cant make your father behave naturally with mr breckon hes got his mind so full of that mistake we both came so near making that he cant think of anything else hes so sheepish about it that he can hardly speak to him or even look at him and i must confess that i dont do much better you know i dont like to put myself forward where your father is and if i did really i dont believe i could make up my mouth to say anything i did want lottie to be nice to him but lottie dislikes him so and even boynewell it wouldnt matter about boyne if he didnt seem to be carrying out a sort of family planboyne barely answers him when he speaks to him i dont know what he can think ellen was a good listener and mrs kenton having begun did not stop till she had emptied the bag i just know that he didnt get off at boulogne because he wanted to stay on with us and thought he could be useful to us at the hague and everywhere and here were acting as ungratefully why were not even commonly polite to him and i know he feels it i know that hes hurt  ellen rose and stood before the glass into which he asked of her mothers reflected face while she knotted a fallen coil of hair into its place where is he  i dont know he went on deck somewhere  ellen put on her hat and pinned it and put on her jacket and buttoned it then she started towards the door her mother made way for her faltering what are you going to do ellen  i am going to do right  dontcatch cold her mother called after her figure vanishing down the corridor but the warning couched in these terms had really no reference to the weather  the girls impulse was one of those effects of the weak will in her which were apt to leave her short of the fulfilment of a purpose it carried her as her as the promenade which she found empty and she went and leaned upon the rail and looked out over the sorrowful north sea which was washing darkly away towards where the gloomy sunset had been  steps from the other side of the ship approached hesitated towards her and then arrested themselves she looked round  why miss kenton said breckon stupidly  the sunset is over isnt it she answered  the twilight isnt breckon stopped then he asked wouldnt you like to take a little walk  yes she answered and smiled fully upon him he had never known before how radiant a smile she lead  better have my arm its getting rather dark  well she put her hand on his arm and he felt it tremble there while she palpitated we are all so glad you could go on to rotterdam my mother wanted me to tell you  oh dont speak of that said breckon not very appositely presently he forced a laugh in order to add with lightness i was afraid perhaps i had given you all some reason to regret it  she said i was afraid you would think thator momma wasand i couldnt bear to have you  well then i wont      xix  breckon had answered with gayety but his happiness was something beyond gayety he had really felt the exclusion from the kentons in which he had passed the day and he had felt it the more painfully because he liked them all it may be owned that he liked ellen best from the beginning and now he liked her better than ever but even in the days exile he had not ceased to like each of them they were in their family affection as lovable as that sort of selfishness can make people they were very united and good to one another lottie herself except in her most lurid moments was good to her brother and sister and almost invariably kind to her parents she would not breckon saw have brooked much meddling with her flirtations from them but as they did not offer to meddle she had no occasion to grumble on that score she grumbled when they asked her to do things for ellen but she did them and though she never did them without grumbling she sometimes did them without being asked she was really very watchful of ellen when it would least have been expected and sometimes she was sweet she never was sweet with boyne but she was often his friend though this did not keep her from turning upon him at the first chance to give him a little dig or a large one for that matter as for boyne he was a mass of helpless sweetness though he did not know it and sometimes took himself for an iceberg when he was merely an icecream of heroic mould he was as helplessly sweet with lottie as with any one and if he suffered keenly from her treacheries and seized every occasion to repay them in kind it was clearly a matter of conscience with him and always for the good their father and mother treated their squabbles very wisely breckon thought they ignored them as much as possible and they recognized them without attempting to do that justice between them which would have rankled in both their breasts  to a spectator who had been critical at first mr and mrs kenton seemed an exemplary father and mother with ellen as well as with their other children it is easy to be exemplary with a sick girl but they increasingly affected breckon as exemplary with ellen he fancied that they acted upon each other beneficially towards her at first he had foreboded some tiresome boasting from the fathers tenderness and some weak indulgence of the daughters whims from her mother but there was either never any ground for this or else mrs kenton in keeping her husband from boasting had been obliged in mere consistency to set a guard upon her own fondness  it was not that ellen he was more and more decided would have abused the weakness of either if there was anything more angelic than her patience it was her wish to be a comfort to them and between the caprices of her invalidism to be a service it was pathetic to see her remembering to do things for them which boyne and lottie had forgotten or plainly shirked doing and to keep the fact out of sight she really kept it out of sight with them and if she did not hide it from so close an observer as breckon that was more his fault than hers when her father first launched out in her praise or the praise of her reading the young man had dreaded a rustic prig yet she had never been a prig but simply glad of what book she had known and meekly submissive to his knowledge if not his taste he owned that she had a right to her taste which he found almost always good and accounted for as instinctive in the absence of an imaginable culture in her imaginable ambient so far as he had glimpses of this he found it so different from anything he had known that the modest adequacy of mrs kenton in the political experiences of modern europe as well as the clear judgments of kenton himself in matters sometimes beyond breekon himself mystified him no less than ellens taste  even with the growth of his respect for their intelligence and his love of their kindliness he had not been able to keep a certain patronage from mingling and it was not till they evinced not only entire ability but an apparent wish to get on without his approval without his acquaintance even that he had conceived a just sense of them the like is apt to happen with the best of us when we are also the finest and breckon was not singular in coming to a due consciousness of something valuable only in the hour of its loss he did not know that the loss was only apparent he knew that he had made a distinct sacrifice for these people and that when he had prepared himself to befriend them little short of selfdevotion they showed themselves indifferent and almost repellent in the revulsion of feeling when ellen gave him her mothers message and frankly offered him reparation on behalf of her whole family he may have overdone his gratitude but he did not overdo it to her perception they walked up and down the promenade of the amstel in the watery north sea moon while bells after bells noted the hour unheeded and when they parted for the night it was with an involuntary pressure of hands from which she suddenly pulled hers and ran down the corridor of her stateroom and lotties  he stood watching the narrow space in which she had vanished and thinking how gentle she was and how she had contrived somehow to make him feel that now it was she who had been consoling him and trying to interest him and amuse him he had not realized that before he had been used to interesting and amusing her but he could not resent it he could not resent the implication of superiority if such a thing were possible which her kindness conveyed the question with breckon was whether she had walked with him so long because she wished in the hour to make up as fully as possible for the days neglect or because she had liked to walk up and down with him it was a question he found keeping itself poignantly yet pleasantly in his mind after he had got into his berth under the solidly slumberous boyne and inclining now to one solution and now to the other with a delicate oscillation that was charming  the amstel took her time to get into rotterdam and when her passengers had gone ashore the next forenoon the train that carried breckon to the hague in the same compartment with the kentons was in no greater hurry it arrived with a deliberation which kept it from carrying them on to amsterdam before they knew it and mrs kenton had time to place such parts of the wars in the rise of the dutch republic as she could attach to the names of the stations and the general features of the landscape boyne was occupied with improvements for the windmills and the canalboats which did not seem to him of the quality of the michigan aerometers or the craft with which he was familiar on the hudson river and on the canal that passed through tuskingum lottie with respect to the canals offered the frank observation that they smelt and in recognizing a fact which travel almost universally ignores in holland she watched her chance of popping up the window between herself and boyne which boyne put down with mounting rage the agriculture which triumphed everywhere on the little halfacre plots lifted fifteen inches above the waters of the environing ditches and the black and white cattle everywhere attesting the immemorial dutch ideal of a cow were what at first occupied kenton and he was tardily won from them to the question of fighting over a country like that it was a concession to his wifes impassioned interest in the overthrow of the spaniards in a landscape which had evidently not changed since she said it was hard to realize that holland was not still a republic and she was not very patient with breckons defence of the monarchy on the ground that the young queen was a very pretty girl  and she is only sixteen boyne urged  then she is two years too old for you said lottie  no such thing boyne retorted i was fifteen in june  dear me i should never have thought it said his sister  ellen seemed hardly to look out of the window at anything directly but when her father bade her see this thing and that it seemed that she had seen it already she said at last with a quiet sigh i never want to go away  she had been a little shy of breckon the whole morning and had kept him asking himself whether she was sorry she had walked so long with him the night before or having offered him due reparation for her family she was again dropping him now and then he put her to the test by words explicitly directed at her and she replied with the dreamy passivity which seemed her normal mood and in which he could fancy himself half forgotten or remembered with an effort  in the midst of this doubt she surprised himhe reflected that she was always surprising himby asking him how far it was from the hague to the sea he explained that the hague was in the sea like all the rest of holland but that if she meant the shore it was no distance at all then she said vaguely she wished they were going to the shore her father asked breckon if there was not a hotel at the beach and the young man tried to give him a notion of the splendors of the kurhaus at scheveningen of scheveningen itself he despaired of giving any just notion  then we can go there said the judge ignoring ellen in his decision as if she had nothing to do with it  lottie interposed a vivid preference for the hague she had she said had enough of the sea for one while and did not want to look at it again till they sailed for home boyne turned to his father as if a good deal shaken by this reasoning and it was mrs kenton who carried the day for going first to a hotel in the hague and prospecting from there in the direction of scheveningen boyne and his father could go down to the shore and see which they liked best  i dont see what that has to do with me said lottie no one was alarmed by her announcement that if she did not like scheveningen she should stay at the hague whatever the rest did in the event fortune favored her going with her family  the hotel in the hague was very pleasant with a garden behind it where a companionable cat had found a dry spot and where lottie found the cat and made friends with it but she said the hotel was full of cooks tourists whom she recognized in spite of her lifelong ignorance of them by a prescience derived from the conversation of mr pogis and from the instinct of a society woman already rife in her she found that she could not stay in a hotel with cooks tourists and she took her fathers place in the exploring party which went down to the wateringplace in the afternoon on the top of a tramcar under the leafy roof of the adorable avenue of trees which embowers the track to scheveningen she disputed boynes impressions of the dutch people whom he found looking more like americans than any foreigners he had seen and she snubbed breckon from his supposed charge of the party but after the start when she declared that ellen could not go and that it was ridiculous for her to think of it she was very good to her and looked after her safety and comfort with a despotic devotion  at the kurhaus she promptly took the lead in choosing rooms for she had no doubt of staying there after the first glance at the place and she showed a practical sense in settling her family which at least her mother appreciated when they were installed the next day  mrs kenton could not make her husband admire lotties faculty so readily you think it would have been better for her to sit down with ellen on the sand and dream of the sea she reproached him with a tender resentment on behalf of lottie everybody cant dream  yes but i wish she didnt keep awake with such a din said the judge after all he admired lotties judgment about the rooms and he censured her with a sigh of relief from care as he sank back in the easychair fronting the window that looked out on the north sea lottie had already made him appreciate the view till he was almost sick of it  what is the matter said mrs kenton sharply do you want to be in tuskingum i suppose you would rather be looking into richards backyard  no said the judge mildly this is very nice  it will do ellen good every minute i dont care how much she sits on the sands and dream ill love to see her  the sitting on the sand was a survival of mr kentons preoccupations of the seaside as a mater of fact ellen was at that moment sitting in one of the hooked wicker armchairs which were scattered over the whole vast beach like a growth of monstrous mushrooms and confronting her in cosey proximity breckon sat equally hidden in another windstuhl her father and her mother were able to keep them placed among the multitude of windstuhls by the presence of lottie who hovered near them and with boyne fended off the demure wickedlooking little scheveningen girls on a smaller scale these were exactly like their demure wickedlooking scheveningen mothers and they approached with knitting in their hands and with large stones folded in their aprons which they had pilfered from the mole and were trying to sell for footstools the windstuhl men and they were enemies and when breckon bribed them to go away the windstuhl men chased them and the little girls ran making mouths at boyne over their shoulders he scorned to notice them but he was obliged to report the misconduct of lottie who began making eyes at the dutch officers as soon as she could feel that ellen was safely off her hands she was the more exasperating and the more culpable to boyne because she had asked him to walk up the beach with her and had then made the fraternal promenade a basis of operations against the dutch military she joined her parents in ignoring boynes complaints and continued to take credit for all the pleasant facts of the situation she patronized her family as much for the table dhote at luncheon as for the comfort of their rooms she was able to assure them that there was not a cooks tourist in the hotel where there seemed to be nearly every other kind of fellowcreature at the end of the first week she had acquaintance of as many nationalities as she could reach in their native or acquired english in all the stages of haughty toleration vivid intimacy and cold exhaustion she had a faculty for getting through with people or of ceasing to have any use for them which was perhaps her best safeguard in her adventurous flirting while the simple aliens were still in the full tide of fancied success lottie was sick of them all and deep in an indiscriminate correspondence with her young men in tuskingum  the letters which she had invited from these while still in new york arrived with the first of those readdressed from the judges london banker she had more letters than all the rest of the family together and counted a halfdozen against a poor two for her sister mrs kenton cared nothing about lotties letters but she was silently uneasy about the two that ellen carelessly took she wondered who could be writing to ellen especially in a cover bearing a handwriting altogether strange to her  it isnt from bittridge at any rate she said to her husband in the speculation which she made him share i am always dreading to have her find out what richard did it would spoil everything im afraid and now everything is going so well i do wish richard hadnt though of course he did it for the best who do you think has been writing to her  why dont you ask her  i suppose she will tell me after a while i dont like to seem to be following her up one was from bessie pearl i think  ellen did not speak of her letters to her mother and after waiting a day or two mrs kenton could not refrain from asking her  oh i forgot said ellen i havent read them yet  havent read them said mrs kenton then after reflection she added you are a strange girl ellen and did not venture to say more  i suppose i thought i should have to answer them and that made me careless but i will read them her mother was silent and presently ellen added i hate to think of the past dont you momma  it is certainly very pleasant here said mrs kenton cautiously youre enjoying yourselfi mean you seem to be getting so much stronger  why momma why do you talk as if i had been sick ellen asked  i mean youre so much interested  dont i go about everywhere like anybody ellen pursued ignoring her explanation  yes you certainly do mr breckon seems to like going about  ellen did not respond to the suggestion except to say we go into all sorts of places this morning we went up on that schooner thats drawn up on the beach and the old man who was there was very pleasant i thought it was a wreck but mr breckon says they are always drawing their ships that way up on the sand the old man was patching some of the woodwork and he told mr breckonhe can speak a little dutchthat they were going to drag her down to the water and go fishing as soon as he was done he seemed to think we were brother and sister she flushed a little and then she said i believe i like the dunes as well as anything sometimes when those curious cold breaths come in from the sea we climb up in the little hollows on the other side and sit there out of the draft everybody seems to do it  apparently ellen was submitting the propriety of the fact to her mother who said yes it seems to be quite the same as it is at home i always supposed that it was different with young people here there is certainly no harm in it  ellen went on irrelevantly i like to go and look at the scheveningen women mending the nets on the sand back of the dunes they have such good gossiping times they shouted to us last evening and then laughed when they saw us watching them when they got through their work they got up and stamped off so strong with their bare red arms folded into their aprons and their skirts sticking out so stiff yes i should like to be like them  you ellen  yes why not  mrs kenton found nothing better to answer than  they were very material looking  they are very happy looking they live in the present that is what i should like living in the present and not looking backwards or forwards after all the present is the only life weve got isnt it  i suppose you may say it is mrs kenton admitted not knowing just where the talk was leading but dreading to interrupt it  but that isnt the scheveningen womans only ideal their other ideal is to keep the place clean saturday afternoon they were all out scrubbing the brick sidewalks and clear into the middle of the street we were almost ashamed to walk over the nice bricks and we picked out as many dirty places as we could find  ellen laughed with a lighthearted gayety that was very strange to her and mrs kenton as she afterwards told her husband did not know what to think  i couldnt help wondering she said whether the poor child would have liked to keep on living in the present a month ago  well im glad you didnt say so the judge answered     xx  from the easy conquest of the men who looked at her lottie proceeded to the subjection of the women it would have been more difficult to put these down if the process had not been so largely so almost entirely subjective as it was lottie exchanged snubs with many ladies of the continental nationalities who were never aware of having offered or received offence in some cases when they fearlessly ventured to speak with her they behaved very amiable and seemed to find her conduct sufficiently gracious in return in fact she was approachable enough and had no shame before boyne in dismounting from the high horse which she rode when alone with him and meeting these ladies on foot at least halfway she made several of them acquainted with her mother who after a timorous reticence found them very conversable with a range of topics however that shocked her american sense of decorum one dutch lady talked with such manly freedom and with such untrammelled intimacy that she was obliged to send boyne and lottie about their business upon an excuse that was not apparent to the dutch lady she only complimented mrs kenton upon her children and their devotion to each other and when she learned that ellen was also her daughter ventured the surmise she was not long married  it isnt her husband mrs kenton explained with inward trouble its just a gentleman that came over with us and she went with her trouble to her own husband as soon as she could  im afraid it isnt the custom to go around alone with young men as much as ellen thinks she suggested  he ought to know said the judge i dont suppose he would if it wasnt  that is true mrs kenton owned and for the time she put her misgivings away  so long as we do nothing wrong the judge decided i dont see why we should not keep to our own customs  lottie says theyre not ours in new york  well we are not in new york now  they had neither of them the heart to interfere with ellens happiness for after all breckon was careful enough of the appearances and it was only his being constantly with ellen that suggested the dutch ladys surmise in fact the range of their wanderings was not beyond the dunes though once they went a little way on one of the neatly bricked country roads that led towards the hague as yet there had been no movement in any of the party to see the places that lie within such easy tramreach of the hague and the hoarded interest of the past in their keeping ellen chose to dwell in the actualities which were an enlargement of her own present and lotties active spirit found employment enough in the amusements at the kurhaus she shopped in the little bazars which make a saratoga under the colonnades fronting two sides of the great space before the hotel and she formed a critical and exacting taste in music from a constant attendance at the afternoon concerts it is true that during the winter in new york she had cast forever behind her the unsophisticated ideals of tuskingum in the art so that from the first she was able to hold the famous orchestra that played in the kurhaus concertroom up to the highest standard she had no use for anybody who had any use for ragtime and she was terribly severe with a young american primarily of boynes acquaintance who tried to make favor with her by asking about the latest coonsongs she took the highest ethical ground with him about tickets in a charitable lottery which he had bought from the portier but could not move him on the lower level which he occupied he offered to give her the picture which was the chief prize in case he won it and she assured him beforehand that she should not take it she warned boyne against him under threats of exposure to their mother as not a good influence but one afternoon when the young queen of holland came to the concert with the queenmother lottie cast her prejudices to the winds in accepting the places which the wicked fellowcountryman offered boyne and herself when they had failed to get any where they could see the queens as the dutch called them  the hotel was draped with flags and banked with flowers about the main entrance where the queens were to arrive and the guests massed themselves in a dense lane for them to pass through lottie could not fail to be one of the foremost in this array and she was able to decide when the queens had passed that the younger would not be considered a more than average pretty girl in america and that she was not very well dressed they had all stood within five feet of her and boyne had appropriated one of the prettiest of the pretty bends which the gracious young creature made to right and left and had responded to it with an empressement which he hoped had not been a sacrifice of his republican principles  during the concert he sat with his eyes fixed upon the queen where she sat in the royal box with her mother and her ladies behind her and wondered and blushed to wonder if she had noticed him when he bowed or if his chivalric devotion in applauding her when the audience rose to receive her had been more apparent than that of others whether it had seemed the heroic act of setting forth at the head of her armies to beat back a german invasion which it had essentially been with his instantaneous return as victor and the queens abdication and adoption of republican principles under conviction of his reasoning and her idolized consecration as the first chief of the dutch republic his cheeks glowed and he quaked at heart lest lottie should surprise his thoughts and expose them to that sarcastic acquaintance who proved to be a medical student resting at scheveningen from the winters courses and clinics in vienna he had already got on to many of boynes curves and had sacrilegiously suggested the queen of holland when he found him feeding his fancy on the modern heroical romances he advised him as an american adventurer to compete with the european princes paying court to her so thin a barrier divided that malign intelligence from boynes most secret dreams that he could never feel quite safe from him and yet he was always finding himself with him now that he was separated from miss rasmith and mr breckon was taken up so much with ellen on the ship he could put many things before mr breckon which must here perish in his breast or suffer the blight of this mr trannels raillery the student sat near the kentons at table and he was no more reverent of the judges modest convictions than of boynes fantastic preoccupations the worst of him was that you could not help liking him he had a fascination which the boy felt while he dreaded him and now and then he did something so pleasant that when he said something unpleasant you could hardly believe it  at the end of the concert when he rose and stood with all the rest while the royal party left their box and the orchestra played the dutch national hymn he said in a loud whisper to boyne nows your time my boy hurry out and hand her into her carriage  boyne fairly reeled at the words which translated a passage of the wild drama playing itself in his brain and found little support in bidding his tormentor shut up the retort rude as it was seemed insufficient but boyne tried in vain to think of something else he tried to punish him by separating lottie from him but failed as signally in that she went off with him and sat in a windstuhl facing his the rest of the afternoon with every effect of carrying on  boyne was helpless with his mother against it when he appealed to her to let him go and tell lottie that she wanted her mrs kenton said that she saw no harm in it that ellen was sitting in like manner with mr breckon  mr breckon is very different and ellen knows how to behave he urged but his mother remained unmoved or was too absent about something to take any interest in the matter in fact she was again unhappy about ellen though she put on such an air of being easy about her clearly so far as her maternal surmise could fathom the case mr breckon was more and more interested in ellen and it was evident that the child was interested in him the situation was everything that was acceptable to mrs kenton but she shuddered at the cloud which hung over it and which might any moment involve it again and again she had made sure that lottie had given ellen no hint of richards illadvised vengeance upon bittridge but it was not a thing that could be kept always and the question was whether it could be kept till ellen had accepted mr breckon and married him this was beyond the question of his asking her to do so but it was so much more important that mrs kenton was giving it her attention first quite out of the order of time besides she had every reason as she felt to count upon the event unless he was trifling with ellen far more wickedly than bittridge he was in love with her and in mrs kentons simple experience and philosophy of life being in love was briefly preliminary to marrying if she went with her anxieties to her husband she had first to reduce him from a buoyant optimism concerning the affair before she could get him to listen seriously when this was accomplished he fell into such despair that she ended in lifting him up and supporting him with hopes that she did not feel herself what they were both united in was the conviction that nothing so good could happen in the world but they were equally united in the old american tradition that they must not lift a finger to secure this supreme good for their child  it did not seem to them that leaving the young people constantly to themselves was doing this they interfered with ellen now neither more nor less than they had interfered with her as to bittridge or than they would have interfered with her in the case of any one else she was still to be left entirely to herself in such matters and mrs kenton would have kept even her thoughts off her if she could she would have been very glad to give her mind wholly to the study of the great events which had long interested her here in their scene but she felt that until the conquest of mr breckon was secured beyond the hazard of ellens morbid defection at the supreme moment she could not give her mind to the history of the dutch republic  dont bother me about lottie boyne she said i have enough to think of without your nonsense if this mr trannel is an american that is all that is necessary we are all americans together and i dont believe it will make remark lotties sitting on the beach with him  i dont see how hes different from that bittridge said boyne he doesnt care for anything and he plays the banjo just like him  mrs kenton was too troubled to laugh she said with finality lottie can take care of herself and then she asked boyne do you know whom ellens letters were from  one was from bessie pearl  yes she showed me that but you dont know who the other was from  no she didnt tell me you know how close ellen is  yes the mother sighed she is very odd  then she added dont you let her know that i asked you about her letters  no said boyne his audience was apparently at an end but he seemed still to have something on his mind momma he began afresh  well she answered a little impatiently  nothing only i got to thinking is a person able to control theirtheir fancies  fancies about what  oh i dont know about falling in love boyne blushed  why do you want to know you musnt think about such things a boy like you its a great pity that you ever knew anything about that bittridge business its made you too bold but it seems to have been meant to drag us down and humiliate us in every way  well i didnt try to know anything about it boyne retorted  no thats true his mother did him the justice to recognize well what is it you want to know boyne was too hurt to answer at once and his mother had to coax him a little she did it sweetly and apologized to him for saying what she had said after all he was the youngest and her baby still her words and caresses took effect at last and he stammered out is everybody so or is it only the kentons that seem to be always puttingwell their affectionswhere its perfectly useless  his mother pushed him from her boyne are you silly about that ridiculous old miss rasmith  no boyne shouted savagely im not  who is it then  i shant tell you boyne said and tears of rage and shame came into his eyes      xxi  in his exile from his kindred for it came practically to that boyne was able to add a fine gloom to the state which he commonly observed with himself when he was not giving way to his morbid fancies or his morbid fears and breaking down in helpless subjection to the nearest member of his household lottie was so taken up with her student that she scarcely quarrelled with him any more and they had no longer those moments of union in which they stood together against the world his mother had cast him off as he felt very heartlessly though it was really because she could not give his absurdities due thought in view of the hopeful seriousness of ellens affair and boyne was aware that his father at the best of times was ignorant of him when he was not impatient of him these were not the best of times with judge kenton and boyne was not the first object of his impatience in the last analysis he was living until he could get home and so largely in the hope of this that his wife at times could scarcely keep him from taking some step that would decide the matter between ellen and breckon at once they were tacitly agreed that they were waiting for nothing else and without making their agreement explicit she was able to quell him by asking what he expected to do in case there was nothing between them was he going to take the child back to tuskingum which was the same as taking her back to bittridge it hurt her to confront him with this question and she tried other devices for staying and appeasing him she begged him now seeing boyne so forlorn and hanging about the hotel alone or moping over those ridiculous books of his to go off with the boy somewhere and see the interesting places within such easy reach like leyden and delft if he cared nothing for the place where william the silent was shot he ought to see the place that the pilgrims started from she had counted upon doing those places herself with her husband and it was in a sacrifice of her ideal that she now urged him to go with boyne but her preoccupation with ellens affair forbade her selfabandon to those high historical interests to which she urged his devotion she might have gone with him and boyne but then she must have left the larger half of her divided mind with ellen not to speak of lottie who refused to be a party to any such excursion mrs kenton felt the disappointment and grieved at it but not without hope of repairing it later and she did not cease from entreating the judge to do what he could at once towards fulfilling the desires she postponed once she prevailed with him and really got him and boyne off for a day but they came back early with signs of having bored each other intolerably and after that it was boyne as much as his father who relucted from joint expeditions boyne did not so much object to going alone and his father said it was best to let him though his mother had her fears for her youngest he spent a good deal of his time on the trams between scheveningen and the hague and he was understood to have explored the capital pretty thoroughly in fact he did go about with a valet de place whom he got at a cheap rate and with whom he conversed upon the state of the country and its political affairs the valet said that the only enemy that holland could fear was germany but an invasion from that quarter could be easily repulsed by cutting the dikes and drowning the invaders the sea he taught boyne was the great defence of holland and it was a waste of money to keep such an army as the dutch had but neither the sea nor the sword could drive out the germans if once they insidiously married a prussian prince to the dutch queen  there seemed to be no getting away from the queen for boyne the valet not only talked about her as the pleasantest subject which he could find but he insisted upon showing boyne all her palaces he took him into the parliament house and showed him where she sat while the queenmother read the address from the throne he introduced him at a bazar where the shopgirl who spoke english better than boyne or at least without the central ohio accent wanted to sell him a miniature of the queen on porcelain she said the queen was such a nice girl and she was herself such a nice girl that boyne blushed a little in looking at her he bought the miniature and then he did not know what to do with it if any of the family if lottie found out that he had it or that trannel he should have no peace any more he put it in his pocket provisionally and when he came giddily out of the shop he felt himself taken by the elbow and placed against the wall by the valet who said the queens were coming they drove down slowly through the crowded narrow street bowing right and left to the people flattened against the shops and again boyne saw her so near that he could have reached out his hand and almost touched hers  the consciousness of this was so strong in him that he wondered whether he had not tried to do so if he had he would have been arrestedhe knew that and so he knew that he had not done it he knew that he imagined doing so because it would be so awful to have done it and he imagined being in love with her because it would be so frantic at the same time he dramatized an event in which he died for her and she became aware of his hopeless passion at the last moment while the anarchist from whom he had saved her confessed that the bomb had been meant for her perhaps it was a pistol  he escaped from the valet as soon as he could and went back to scheveningen limp from this experience but the queens were before him they had driven down to visit the studio of a famous dutch painter there and again the doom was on boyne to press forward with the other spectators and wait for the queens to appear and get into their carriage the young queens looks were stamped in boynes consciousness so that he saw her wherever he turned like the sun when one has gazed at it he thought how that trannel had said he ought to hand her into her carriage and he shrank away for fear he should try to do so but he could not leave the place till she had come out with the queenmother and driven off then he went slowly and breathlessly into the hotel feeling the queens miniature in his pocket it made his heart stand still and then bound forward he wondered again what he should do with it if he kept it lottie would be sure to find it and he could not bring himself to the sacrilege of destroying it he thought he would walk out on the breakwater as far as he could and throw it into the sea but when he got to the end of the mole he could not do so he decided that he would give it to ellen to keep for him and not let lottie see it or perhaps he might pretend he had bought it for her he could not do that though for it would not be true and if he did he could not ask her to keep it from lottie  at dinner mr trannel told him he ought to have been there to see the queen that she had asked especially for him and wanted to know if they had not sent up her card to him boyne meditated an apt answer through all the courses but he had not thought of one when they had come to the corbeille de fruits and he was forced to go to bed without having avenged himself  in taking rooms for her family at the hotel lottie had arranged for her emancipation from the thraldom of rooming with ellen she said that had gone on long enough if she was grown up at all she was grown up enough to have a room of her own and her mother had yielded to reasoning which began and ended with this position she would have interfered so far as to put lottie into the room next her but lottie said that if boyne was the baby he ought to be next his mother ellen might come next him but she was going to have the room that was furthest from any implication of the dependence in which she had languished and her mother submitted again boyne was not sorry there had always been hours of the night when he felt the need of getting at his mother for reassurance as to forebodings which his fancy conjured up to trouble him in the wakeful dark it was understood that he might freely do this and though the judge inwardly fretted he could not deny the boy the comfort of his mothers encouraging love boynes visits woke him but he slept the better for indulging in the young nerves that tremor from impressions against which the old nerves are proof but now in the strange fatality which seemed to involve him boyne could not go to his mother it was too weirdly intimate even for her besides when he had already tried to seek her counsel she had ignorantly repelled him  the night after his day in the hague when he could bear it no longer he put on his dressinggown and softly opened ellens door awake ellen he whispered  yes what is it boyne her gentle voice asked  he came and sat down by her bed and stole his hand into hers which she put out to him the watery moonlight dripped into the room at the edges of the shades and the long wash of the sea made itself regularly heard on the sands  cant you sleep ellen asked again are you homesick  not exactly that but it does seem rather strange for us to be off here so far doesnt it  yes i dont see how i can forgive myself for making you come said ellen but her voice did not sound as if she were very unhappy  you couldnt help it said boyne and the words suggested a question to him do you believe that such things are ordered ellen  everything is ordered isnt it  i suppose so and if they are were not to blame for what happens  not if we try to do right  of course the kentons always do that said boyne with the faith in his family that did not fail him in the darkest hour but what i mean is that if anything comes on you that you cant foresee and you cant get out of the next step was not clear and boyne paused he asked  do you think that we can control our feelings ellen  about what  well about persons that we like he added for safety or dislike  im afraid not said ellen sadly we ought to like persons and dislike them for some good reason but we dont  yes thats what i mean said borne with a long breath sometimes it seems like a kind of possession doesnt it  it seems more like that when we like them ellen said  yes thats what i mean if a person was to take a fancy to some one that was above him that was richer or older he wouldnt be to blame for it would he  was that what you wanted to ask me about  borne hesitated yes he said he was in for it now  ellen had not noticed boynes absorption with miss rasmith on the ship but she vaguely remembered hearing lottie tease him about her and she said now he wouldnt be to blame for it if he couldnt help it but if the person was much older it would be a pity  uh she isnt so very much older said borne more cheerfully than he had spoken before  is it somebody that you have taken a fancy to borne  i dont know ellen thats what makes it so kind of awful i cant tell whether its a real fancy or i only think it is sometimes i think it is and sometimes i think that i think so because i am afraid to believe it do you under ellen  it seems to me that i do but you oughtnt to let your fancy run away with you boyne what a queer boy  its a kind of fascination i suppose but whether its a real fancy or an unreal one i cant get away from it  poor boy said his sister  perhaps its those books sometimes i think it is and i laugh at the whole idea and then again its so strong that i cant get away from it ellen  well boyne  i could tell you who it is if you think that would do any goodif you think it would help me to see it in the true light or you could help me more by knowing who it is than you can now  i hope it isnt anybody that you cant respect boyne  no indeed its somebody you would never dream of  well ellen was waiting for him to speak but he could not get the words out even to her  i guess ill tell you some other time maybe i can get over it myself  it would be the best way if you could  he rose and left her bedside and then he came back ellen ive got something that i wish you would keep for me  what is it of course i will  well itssomething i dont want you to let lottie know ive got she tells that mr trannel everything and then he wants to make fun do you think hes so very witty  i cant help laughing at some things he says  i suppose he is boyne ruefully admitted but that doesnt make you like him any better well if you wont tell lottie ill give it to you now  i wont tell anything that you dont want me to boyne  its nothing its justa picture of the queen on porcelain that i got in the hague the guide took me into the store and i thought i ought to get something  oh thats very nice boyne i do like the queen so much shes so sweet  yes isnt she said boyne glad of ellens approval so far at least he was not wrong here it is now  he put the miniature in ellens hand she lifted herself on her elbow light the candle and let me see it  no no he entreated it might wake lottie andandgoodnight ellen  can you go to sleep now boyne  oh yes im all right goodnight  goodnight then  borne stooped over and kissed her and went to the door he came back and asked you dont think it was silly or anything for me to get it  no indeed its just what you will like to have when you get home weve all seen her so often ill put it in my trunk and nobody shall know about it till were safely back in tuskingum  boyne sighed deeply yes thats what i meant goodnight  goodnight boyne  i hope i havent waked you up too much  oh no i can get to sleep easily again  well goodnight boyne sighed again but not so deeply and this time he went out     xxii  mrs kenton woke with the clear vision which is sometimes vouchsafed to people whose eyes are holden at other hours of the day she had heard boyne opening and shutting ellens door and her heart smote her that he should have gone to his sister with whatever trouble he was in rather than come to his mother it was natural that she should put the blame on her husband and now mr kenton she began with an austerity of voice which he recognized before he was well awake if you wont take boyne off somewhere today i will i think we had better all go we have been here a whole fortnight and we have got thoroughly rested and there is no excuse for our wasting our time any longer if we are going to see holland we had better begin doing it  the judge gave a general assent and said that if she wanted to go to flushing he supposed he could find some gardenseeds there in the flower and vegetable nurseries which would be adapted to the climate of tuskingum and they could all put in the day pleasantly looking round the place whether it was the suggestion of tuskingum in relation to flushing that decided her against the place or whether she had really meant to go to leyden she now expressed the wish as vividly as if it were novel to explore the scene of the pilgrims sojourn before they sailed for plymouth and she reproached him for not caring about the place when they both used to take such an interest in it at home  well said the judge if i were at home i should take an interest in it here  this provoked her to a silence which he thought it best to break in tacit compliance with her wish and he asked do you propose taking the whole family and the appurtenances we shall be rather a large party  ellen would wish to go and i suppose mr breckon we couldnt very well go without them  and how about lottie and that young trannel  we cant leave him out very well i wish we could i dont like him  theres nothing easier than not asking him if you dont want him  yes there is when youve got a girl like lottie to deal with quite likely she would ask him herself we must take him because we cant leave her  yes i reckon the judge acquiesced  im glad mrs kenton said after a moment that it isnt ellen hes after it almost reconciles me to his being with lottie so much i only wonder he doesnt take to ellen hes so much like that  she did not say out what was in her mind but her husband knew yes ive noticed it this young breckon was quite enough so for my taste i dont know what it is that just saves him from it  hes good you could tell that from the beginning  they went off upon the situation that superficially or subliminally was always interesting them beyond anything in the world and they did not openly recur to mrs kentons plan for the day till they met their children at breakfast it was a meal at which breckon and trammel were both apt to join them where they took it at two of the tables on the broad seaward piazza of the hotel when the weather was fine both the young men now applauded her plan in their different sorts it was easily arranged that they should go by train and not by tram from the hague the train was chosen and mrs kenton when she went to her room to begin the preparations for a days pleasure which constitute so distinctly a part of its pain imagined that everything was settled she had scarcely closed the door behind her when lottie opened it and shut it again behind her  mother she said in the new style of address to which she was habituating mrs kenton after having so long called her momma i am not going with you  indeed you are then her mother retorted do you think i would leave you here all day with that fellow a nice talk we should make  you are perfectly welcome to that fellow mother and as hes accepted he will have to go with you and there wont be any talk but as i remarked before i am not going  why arent you going i should like to know  because i dont like the company  what do you mean have you got anything against mr breckon  hes insipid but as long as ellen dont mind it i dont care i object to mr trannel  why  i dont see why i should have to tell you if i said i liked him you might want to know but it seems to me that my not liking him ismy not liking him is my own affair there was a kind of logic in this that silenced mrs kenton for the moment in view of her advantage lottie relented so far as to add ive found out something about him  mrs kenton was imperative in her alarm what is it she demanded  lottie answered obliquely well i didnt leave the hague to get rid of them and then take up with one of them at scheveningen  one of what  cooks tourists if you must know mother mr trannel as you call him is a cooks tourist and thats the end of it i have got no use for him from this out  mrs kenton was daunted and not for the first time by her daughters superior knowledge of life she could put boyne down sometimes though not always when he attempted to impose a novel code of manners or morals upon her but she could not cope with lottie in the present case she could only ask well  well theyre the cheapest of the cheap he actually showed me his coupons and tried to put me down with the idea that everybody used them but i guess he found it wouldnt work he said if you were not personally conducted it was all right  now lottie you have got to tell me just what you mean said mrs kenton and from having stood during this parley she sat down to hear lottie out at her leisure but if there was anything more difficult than for lottie to be explicit it was to make her be so and in the end mrs kenton was scarcely wiser than she was at the beginning to her daughters reasons it appeared that if you wanted to be cheap you could travel with those coupons and lottie did not wish to be cheap or have anything to do with those who were the kentons had always held up their heads and if ellen had chosen to disgrace them with bittridge dick had made it all right and she at least was not going to do anything that she would be ashamed of she was going to stay at home and have her meals in her room till they got back  her mother paid no heed to her repeated declaration lottie she asked with the heartquake that the thought of richards act always gave her with reference to ellen have you ever let out the least hint of that  of course i havent lottie scornfully retorted i hope i know what a crank ellen is  they were not just the terms in which mrs kenton would have chosen to be reassured but she was glad to be assured in any terms she said vaguely i believe in my heart that i will stay at home too all this has given me a bad headache  i was going to have a headache myself said lottie with injury but i suppose i can get on along without i can just simply say im not going if he proposes to stay too i can soon settle that  the great difficulty will be to get your father to go  you can make ellen make him lottie suggested  that is true said mrs kenton with such increasing absence that her daughter required of her  are you staying on my account  i think you had better not be left alone the whole day but i am not staying on your account i dont believe we had so many of us better go it might look a little pointed  lottie laughed harshly i guess mr breckon wouldnt see the point hes so perfectly gone  do you really believe it lottie mrs kenton entreated with a sudden tenderness for her younger daughter such as she did not always feel  i should think anybody would believe itanybody but ellen  yes mrs kenton dreamily assented  lottie made her way to the door well if you do stay mother im not going to have you hanging round me all day i can chaperon myself  lottie her mother tried to stay her i wish you would go i dont believe that mr trannel will be much of an addition he will be on your poor fathers hands all day or else ellens and if you went you could help off  thank you mother ive had quite all i want of mr trannel you can tell him he neednt go if you want to  lottie at least did not leave her mother to make her excuses to the party when they met for starting mrs kenton had deferred her own till she thought it was too late for her husband to retreat and then bunglingly made them with so much iteration that it seemed to her it would have been far less pointed as concerned mr breckon if she had gone lottie sunnily announced that she was going to stay with her mother and did not even try to account for her defection to mr trannel  whats the matter with my staying too he asked it seems to me there are four wheels to this coach now  he had addressed his misgiving more to lottie than the rest but with the same sunny indifference to the consequence for others that she had put on in stating her decision she now discharged herself from further responsibility by turning on her heel and leaving it with the party generally in the circumstances mr trannel had no choice but to go and he was supported possibly by the hope of taking it out of lottie some other time  it was more difficult for mrs kenton to get rid of the judge but an inscrutable frown goes far in such exigencies it seems to explain and it certainly warns and the husband on whom it is bent never knows even after the longest experience whether he had better inquire further usually he decides that he had better not and judge kenton went off towards the tram with boyne in the cloud of mystery which involved them both as to mrs kentons meaning     xxiii   trannel attached himself as well as he could to breckon and ellen and breckon had an opportunity not fully offered him before to note a likeness between himself and a fellowman whom he was aware of not liking though he tried to love him as he felt it right to love all men he thought he had not been quite sympathetic enough with mrs kenton in her having to stay behind and he tried to make it up to mr trannel in his having to come he invented civilities to show him and ceded his place next ellen as if trannel had a right to it trannel ignored him in keeping it unless it was recognizing breckon to say oh i hope im not in your way old fellow and then making jokes to ellen breckon could not say the jokes were bad though the taste of them seemed to him so the man had a fleeting wit which scorched whatever he turned it upon and yet it was wit why dont you try him in american he asked at the failure of breckon and the tram conductor to understand each other in dutch he tried the conductor himself in american and he was so deplorably funny that it was hard for breckon to help being particeps criminus at least in a laugh  he asked himself if that were really the kind of man he was and he grew silent and melancholy in the fear that it was a good deal the sort of man to this morbid fancy trannel seemed himself in a sort of excess or what he would be if he were logically ultimated he remembered all the triviality of his behavior with ellen at first and rather sickened at the thought of some of his early pleasantries she was talking gayly now with trannel and breckon wondered whether she was falling under the charm that he felt in him in spite of himself  if she was her father was not the judge sat on the other side of the car and unmistakably glowered at the fellows attempts to make himself amusing to ellen trannel himself was not insensible to the judges mood now and then he said something to intensify it he patronized the judge and he made fun of the tourist character in which boyne had got himself up with a fieldglass slung by a strap under one arm and a red baedeker in his hand he sputtered with malign laughter at a rather gorgeous necktie which boyne had put on for the day and said it was not a very good match for the baedeker  boyne retorted rudely and that amused trannel still more he became personal to breckon and noted the unclerical cut of his clothes he said he ought to have put on his uniform for an expedition like that in case they got into any sort of trouble to ellen alone he was inoffensive unless he overdid his polite attentions to her in carrying her parasol for her and helping her out of the tram when they arrived shouldering every one else away and making haste to separate her from the others and then to walk on with her a little in advance  suddenly he dropped her and fell back to boyne and his father while breckon hastened forward to her side trannel put his arm across boynes shoulders and asked him if he were mad and then laughed at him youre all right boyne but you oughtnt to be so approachable you ought to put on more dignity and repel familiarity  boyne could only twitch away in silence that he made as haughty as he could but not so haughty that trannel did not find it laughable and he laughed in a teasing way that made breckon more and more serious he was aware of becoming even solemn with the question of his likeness to trannel he was of trannels quality and their difference was a matter of quantity and there was not enough difference in his sense of their likeness breckon vowed himself to a gravity of behavior evermore which he should not probably be able to observe but the sample he now displayed did not escape the keen vigilance of trannel  with the exception of miss kenton he addressed himself to the party youre all so easy and careless that if you dont look out youll lose me miss kenton i wish you would keep an eye on me i dont want to get lost  ellen laughedshe could not help itand her laughing made it less possible than before for breckon to unbend and meet trannel on his own ground to give him joke for joke to exchange banter with him he might never have been willing to do that but now he shrank from it in his realization of their likeness with an abhorrence that rendered him rigid  the judge was walking ahead with boyne and his back expressed such severe disapproval that between her fear that trannel would say something to bring her fathers condemnation on him and her sense of their inhospitable attitude towards one who was their guest in a sort she said with her gentle gayety then you must keep near me mr trannel ill see that nothing happens  thats very sweet of you said trannel soberly whether he had now vented his malicious humor and was ready to make himself agreeable or was somewhat quelled by the unfriendly ambient he had created or was wrought upon by her friendliness he became everything that could be wished in a companion for a days pleasure he took the lead at the station and got them a compartment in the car to themselves for the little run to leyden and on the way he talked very well he politely borrowed boynes baedeker and decided for the party what they had best see and showed an acceptable intelligence as well as a large experience in the claims of leyden upon the visitors interest he had been there often before it seemed and in the event it appeared that he had chosen the days sightseeing wisely  he no longer addressed himself respectfully to ellen alone but he reestablished himself in boynes confidence with especial pains and he conciliated breckon by a recognition of his priority with ellen with a delicacy refined enough for even the susceptibility of a lover alarmed for his rights if he could not overcome the reluctance of the judge he brought him to the civil response which any one who tried for kentons liking achieved even if he did not merit it and there remained no more reserve in kentons manner than there had been with the young man from the first he had never been a persona grata to the judge and if he did not become so now he at least ceased to be actively displeasing  that was the year before the young queen came to her own and in the last days of her minority she was visiting all the cities of her future dominion with the queenmother when kentons party left the station they found leyden as gay for her reception as flags and banners could make the gray old town and trannel relapsed for a moment so far as to suggest that the decorations were in honor of boynes presence but he did not abuse the laugh that this made to boynes further shame  there was no carriage at the station which would hold the party of five and they had to take two vehicles trannel said it was lucky they wanted two since there were no more and he put himself in authority to assort the party the judge he decided must go with ellen and breckon and he hoped boyne would let him go in his carriage if he would sit on the box with the driver the judge afterwards owned that he had weakly indulged his dislike of the fellow in letting him take boyne and not insisting on going himself with tramiel but this was when it was long too late ellen had her misgivings but except for that gibe about the decorations trannel had been behaving so well that she hoped she might trust boyne with him she made a kind of appeal for her brother bidding him and trannel take good care of each other and trannel promised so earnestly to look after boyne that she ought to have been alarmed for him he took the lead rising at times to wave a reassuring hand to her over the back of his carriage and in fact nothing evil could very well happen from him with the others following so close upon him they met from time to time in the churches they visited and when they lost sight of one another through a difference of opinion in the drivers as to the best route they came together at the place trannel had appointed for their next reunion  he showed himself a guide so admirably qualified that he found a way for them to objects of interest that had at first denied themselves in anticipation of the visit from the queens when they all sat down at lunch in the restaurant which he found for them he could justifiably boast that he would get them into the town hall which they had been told was barred for the day against anything but sovereign curiosity he was now on the best term with boyne who seemed to have lost all diffidence of him and treated him with an easy familiarity that showed itself in his slapping him on the shoulder and making dints in his hat trannel seemed to enjoy these caresses and when they parted again for the afternoons sightseeing ellen had no longer a qualm in letting boyne drive off with him  he had in fact known how to make himself very acceptable to boyne he knew all the originals of his heroical romances and was able to give the real names and the geographical position of those princesses who had been in love with american adventurers under promise of secrecy he disclosed the real names of the adventurers themselves now obscured in the titles given them to render them worthy their union with sovereigns he resumed his fascinating confidences when they drove off after luncheon and he resumed them after each separation from the rest of the party boyne listened with a flushed face and starting eyes and when at last trannel offered upon a pledge of the most sacred nature from him never to reveal a word of what he said he began to relate an adventure of which he was himself the hero it was a bold travesty of one of the latest romances that boyne had read involving the experience of an american very little older than boyne himself to whom a wilful young crownprincess in a little state which trannel would not name even to boyne had made advances such as he could not refuse to meet without cruelty he was himself deeply in love with her but he felt bound in honor not to encourage her infatuation as long as he could help for he had been received by her whole family with such kindness and confidence that he had to consider them  oh pshaw boyne broke in upon him doubting and yet wishing not to doubt thats the same as the story of hector folleyne  yes said trannel quietly i thought you would recognize it  well but boyne went on hector married the princess  in the book yes the fellow i gave the story to said it would never do not to have him marry her and it would help to disguise the fact thats what he said after he had given the whole thing away  and do you mean to say it was you oh you cant stuff me how did you get out of marrying her i should like to know when the chancellor came to you and said that the whole family wanted you to for fear it would kill her if  well there was a scene i cant deny that we had a regular family conclavefather mother aunt hitty and all the folksand we kept it up pretty much all night the princess wasnt there of course and i could convince them that i was right if she had been i dont believe i could have held out but they had to listen to reason and i got away between two days  but why didnt you marry her  well for one thing as i told you i thought i ought to consider her family then there was a good fellow the crownprince of saxewolfenhutten who was dead in love with her and was engaged to her before i turned up i had been at school with him and i felt awfully sorry for him and i thought i ought to sacrifice myself a little to him but i suppose the thing that influenced me most was finding out that if i married the princess i should have to give up my american citizenship and become her subject  well boyne panted  well would you have done it  couldnt you have got along without doing that  that was the only thing i couldnt get around somehow so i left  and the princess did shedie  it takes a good deal more than that to kill a fifteenyearold princess said trannel and he gave a harsh laugh she married saxewolfenhutten boyne was silent now i dont want you to speak of this till after i leave scheveningenespecially to miss lottie you know how girls are and i think miss lottie is waiting to get a bind on me anyway if she heard how i was cut out of my chance with that princess shed never let me believe i gave her up of my own free will  no no i wont tell her  boyne remained in a silent rapture and he did not notice they were no longer following the rest of their party in the other carriage this had turned down a corner at which mr breckon sitting on the front seat had risen and beckoned their driver to follow but their driver who appeared afterwards to have not too much a head of his own or no head at all had continued straight on in the rear of a tramcar which was slowly finding its way through the momently thickening crowd boyne was first aware that it was a humorous crowd when at a turn of the street their equipage was greeted with ironical cheers by a group of gay young dutchmen on the sidewalk then he saw that the sidewalks were packed with people who spread into the street almost to the tram and that the house fronts were dotted with smiling dutch faces the faces of pretty dutch girls who seemed to share the amusement of the young fellows below  trannel lay back in the carriage this is something like he said boyne theyre on to the distinguished young ohioanthe only ohioan out of office in europe  yes said boyne trying to enjoy it i wonder what they are holloing at  trannel laughed theyre holloing at your baedeker my dear boy they never saw one before and boyne was aware that he was holding his redbacked guide conspicuously in view on his lap they know youre a foreigner by it  dont you think we ought to turn down somewhere i dont see poppa anywhere he rose and looked anxiously back over the top of their carriage the crowd closing in behind it hailed his troubled face with cries that were taken up by the throng on the sidewalks boyne turned about to find that the tramcar which they had been following had disappeared round a corner but their driver was still keeping on at a wilder burst of applause trannel took off his hat and bowed to the crowd right and left  bow bow he said to boyne theyll be calling for a speech the next thing bow i tell you  tell him to turn round cried the boy  i cant speak dutch said trannel and boyne leaned forward and poked the driver in the back  go back he commanded  the driver shook his head and pointed forward with his whip hes all right said trannel he cant turn now weve got to take the next corner the street in front was empty and the people were crowding back on the sidewalks loud vague noises made themselves heard round the corner to which the driver had pointed by jove trannel said i believe theyre coming round that way  who are coming boyne palpitated  the queens  the queens boyne gasped it seemed to him that he shrieked the words  yes and theres a tobacconists now said trannel as if that were what he had been looking for all along i want some cigarettes  he leaped lightly from the carriage and pushed his way out of sight on the sidewalk boyne remained alone in the vehicle staring wildly round the driver kept slowly and stupidly on boyne did not know how much farther he could not speak he felt as if he could not stir but the moment came when he could not be still he gave a galvanic jump to the ground and the friendly crowd on the sidewalk welcomed him to its ranks and closed about him the driver had taken the lefthand corner just before a plain carriage with the queen and the queenmother came in sight round the right the young queen was bowing to the people gently and with a sort of mechanical regularity now and then a brighter smile than that she conventionally wore lighted up her face the simple progress was absolutely without state except for the aidedecamp on horseback who rode beside the carriage a little to the front  boyne stood motionless on the curb where a friendly tall dutchman had placed him in front that he might see the queen  hello said the voice of trannel and elbowing his way to boynes side he laughed and coughed through the smoke of his cigarette i was afraid you had lost me wheres your carriage  boyne did not notice his mockeries he was entranced in that beatific vision his boyheart went out in worship to the pretty young creature with a reverence that could not be uttered the tears came into his eyes  there there shes bowing to you boyne shes smiling right at you by jove shes beckoning to you  you be still boyne retorted finding his tongue she isnt doing any such a thing  she is i swear she is shes doing it again shes stopping the carriage oh go out and see what she wants dont you know that a queens wish is a command youve got to go  boyne never could tell just how it happened the carriage did seem to be stopping and the queen seemed to be looking at him he thought he must and he started into the street towards her and the carriage came abreast of him he had almost reached the carriage when the aide turned and spurred his horse before him four strong hands that were like iron clamps were laid one on each of boynes elbows and shoulders and he was haled away as if by superhuman force mr trannel he called out in his agony but the wretch had disappeared and boyne was left with his captors to whom he could have said nothing if he could have thought of anything to say  the detectives pulled him through the crowd and hurried him swiftly down the side street a little curiosity straggled after him in the shape of small dutch boys too short to look over the shoulders of men at the queens and too weak to make their way through them to the front but for them boyne seemed alone in the world with the relentless officers who were dragging him forward and hurting him so with the grip of their iron hands he lifted up his face to entreat them not to hold him so tight and suddenly it was as if he beheld an angel standing in his path it was breckon who was there staring at him aghast  why boyne he cried  oh mr breckon boyne wailed back is it you oh do tell them i didnt mean to do anything i thought she beckoned to me  who who beckoned to you  the queen boyne sobbed while the detectives pulled him relentlessly on  breckon addressed them suavely in their owe tongue which had never come in more deferential politeness from human lips he ventured the belief that there was a mistake he assured them that he knew their prisoner and that he was the son of a most respectable american family whom they could find at the kurhaus in scheveningen he added some irrelevancies and got for all answer that they had made boynes arrest for sufficient reasons and were taking him to prison if his friends wished to intervene in his behalf they could do so before the magistrate but for the present they must admonish mr breckon not to put himself in the way of the law  dont go mr breckon boyne implored him as his captors made him quicken his pace after slowing a little for their colloquy with breckon oh where is poppa he could get me away oh where is poppa  dont dont call out boyne breckon entreated your father is right here at the end of the street hes in the carriage there with miss kenton i was coming to look for you dont cry out so  no no i wont mr breckon ill be perfectly quiet now only do get poppa quick he can tell them in a minute that its all right  he made a prodigious effort to control himself while breckon ran a little ahead with some wild notion of preparing ellen as he disappeared at the corner boyne choked a sob into a muffed bellow and was able to meet the astonished eyes of his father and sister in this degree of triumph  they had not in the least understood breckons explanation and in fact it had not been very lucid at sight of her brother strenuously upheld between the detectives and dragged along the sidewalk ellen sprang from the carriage and ran towards him why whats the matter with boyne she demanded are you hurt boyne dear are they taking him to the hospital  before he could answer and quite before the judge could reach the tragical group she had flung her arms round boynes neck and was kissing his teardrabbled face while he lamented back theyre taking me to prison  taking you to prison i should like to know what for what are you taking my brother to prison for she challenged the detectives who paused bewildered while all the little dutch boys round admired this obstruction of the law and several dutch housewives too old to go out to see the queens looked down from their windows it was wholly illegal but the detectives were human they could snub such a friend of their prisoner as breckon but they could not meet the dovelike ferocity of ellen with unkindness they explained as well as they might and at a suggestion which kenton made through breckon they admitted that it was not beside their duty to take boyne directly to a magistrate who could pass upon his case and even release him upon proper evidence of his harmlessness and sufficient security for any demand that justice might make for his future appearance  then said the judge quietly tell them that we will go with them it will be all right boyne ellen you and i will get back into the carriage and  no boyne roared dont leave me nelly  indeed i wont leave you boyne mr breckon you get into the carriage with poppa and i  i think i had better go with you miss kenton said breckon and in a tender superfluity they both accompanied boyne on foot while the judge remounted to his place in the carriage and kept abreast of them on their way to the magistrates     xxiv  the magistrate conceived of boynes case with a readiness that gave the judge a high opinion of his personal and national intelligence he even smiled a little in accepting the explanation which breckon was able to make him from boyne but he thought his duty to give the boy a fatherly warning for the future he remarked to breckon that it was well for boyne that the affair had not happened in germany where it would have been found a much more serious matter though indeed he added it had to be seriously regarded anywhere in these times when the lives of sovereigns were so much at the mercy of all sorts of madmen and miscreants he relaxed a little from his severity in his admonition to say directly to boyne that queens even when they wished to speak with people did not beckon them in the public streets when this speech translated to boyne by breckon whom the magistrate complimented on the perfection of his dutch boyne hung his head sheepishly and could not be restored to his characteristic dignity again in the magistrates presence the judge gratefully shook hands with the friendly justice and made him a little speech of thanks which breckon interpreted and then the justice shook hand with the judge and gracefully accepted the introduction which he offered him to ellen they parted with reciprocal praises and obeisances which included even the detectives the judge had some question which he submitted to breckon whether he ought not to offer them something but breckon thought not  breckon found it hard to abdicate the sort of authority in which his knowledge of dutch had placed him and when he protested that he had done nothing but act as interpreter ellen said yes but we couldnt have done anything without you and this was the view that mrs kenton took of the matter in the family conclave which took place later in the evening breckon was not allowed to withdraw from it in spite of many modest efforts before she had bashfully expressed her sense of his service to him and made boyne share her thanksgiving she had her arm about the boys shoulder in giving breckon her hand and when breckon had got away she pulled boyne to her in a more peremptory embrace  now boyne she said i am not going to have any more nonsense i want to know why you did it  the judge and ellen had already conjectured clearly enough and boyne did not fear them but he looked at his younger sister as he sulkily answered i am not going to tell you before lottie  come in here then said his mother and she led him into the next room and closed the door she quickly returned without him yes she began its just as i supposed it was that worthless fellow who put him up to it of course it began with those fool books hes been reading and the notions that miss rasmith put into his head but he never would have done anything if it hadnt been for mr trannel  lottie had listened in silent scorn to the whole proceedings up to this point and had refused a part in the general recognition of breckon as a special providence now she flashed out with a terrible volubility what did i tell you what else could you expect of a cooks tourist and mommother wanted to make me go with you after i told her what he was well if i had have gone ill bet i could have kept him from playing his tricks ill bet he wouldnt have taken any liberties with me along ill bet if he had it wouldnt have been boyne that got arrested ill bet he wouldnt have got off so easily with the magistrate either but i suppose youll all let him come bowing and smiling round in the morning like butter wouldnt melt in your mouths that seems to be the kenton way anybody can pull our noses or get us arrested that wants to and we never squeak she went on a long time to this purpose mrs kenton listening with an air almost of conviction and ellen patiently bearing it as a right that lottie had in a matter where she had been otherwise ignored  the judge broke out not upon lottie but upon his wife good heavens sarah cant you make the child hush  lottie answered for her mother with a crash of nerves and a gush of furious tears oh ive got to hush i suppose its always the way when im trying to keep up the dignity of the family i suppose it will be cabled to america and by tomorrow it will be all over tuskingum how boyne was made a fool of and got arrested but i bet theres one person in tuskingum that wont have any remarks to make and thats bittridge not as long as dicks there he wont  lottie cried her mother and her father started towards her while ellen still sat patiently quiet  oh well lottie submitted but if dick was here i know this trannel wouldnt get off so smoothly dick would give him a worse cowhiding than he did bittridge  half the last word was lost in the bang of the door which lottie slammed behind her leaving her father and mother to a silence which ellen did not offer to break the judge had no heart to speak in his dismay and it was mrs kenton who took the word  ellen she began with compassionate gentleness we tried to keep it from you we knew how you would feel but now we have got to tell you dick did cowhide him when he got back to tuskingum lottie wrote out to dick about it how mr bittridge had behaved in new york your father and i didnt approve of it and dick didnt afterwards but yes he did do it  i knew it momma said ellen sadly  you knew it how  that other letter i got when we first cameit was from his mother  did she tell  yes it was terrible she seemed to feel so and i was sorry for her i thought i ought to answer it and i did i told her i was sorry too i tried not to blame richard i dont believe i did and i tried not to blame him she was feeling badly enough without that  her father and mother looked at each other they did not speak and she asked do you think i oughtnt to have written  her father answered a little tremulously you did right ellen and i am sure that you did it in just the right way  i tried to i thought i wouldnt worry you about it  she rose and now her mother thought she was going to say that it put an end to everything that she must go back and offer herself as a sacrifice to the injured bittridges her mind had reverted to that moment on the steamer when ellen told her that nothing had reconciled her to what had happened with bittridge but the fact that all the wrong done had been done to themselves that this freed her in her despair she could not forbear asking what did you write to her ellen  nothing i just said that i was very sorry and that i knew how she felt i dont remember exactly  she went up and kissed her mother she seemed rather fatigued than distressed and her father asked her are you going to bed my dear  yes im pretty tired and i should think you would be too poppa ill speak to poor boyne dont mind lottie i suppose she couldnt help saying it she kissed her father and slipped quietly into boynes room from which they could hear her passing on to her own before they ventured to say anything to each other in the hopeful bewilderment to which she had left them  well said the judge  well mrs kenton returned in a note of exasperation as if she were not going to let herself be forced to the initiative  i thought you thought  i did think that now i dont know what to think we have got to wait  im willing to wait for ellen  she seems said mrs kenton to have more sense than both the other children put together and i was afraid  she might easily have more sense than boyne or lottie either  well i dont know mrs kenton began but she did not go on to resent the disparagement which she had invited what i was afraid of was her goodness it was her goodness that got her into the trouble to begin with if she hadnt been so good that fellow could never have fooled her as he did she was too innocent  the judge could not forbear the humorous view perhaps shes getting wickeder or not so innocent at any rate she doesnt seem to have been take in by trannel  he didnt pay any attention to her he was all taken up with lottie  well that was lucky sarah said the judge do you think he is like bittridge  hes made me think of him all the time  its curious the judge mused i have always noticed how our faults repeat themselves but i didnt suppose our fates would always take the same shape or something like it mrs kenton stared at him when this other one first made up to us on the boat my heart went down i thought of bittridge so  mr breckon  yes the same lightness the same sort of triflingdidnt you notice it  noyes i noticed it but i wasnt afraid for an instant i saw that he was good  oh  what im afraid of now is that ellen doesnt care anything about him  he isnt wicked enough  i dont say that but it would be too much happiness to expect in one short life  the judge could not deny the reasonableness of her position he could only oppose it well i dont think weve had any more than our share of happiness lately  no one except boyne could have made trannels behavior a cause of quarrel but the other kentons made it a cause of coldness which was quite as effective in lottie this took the form of something so active so positive that it was something more than a mere absence of warmth before she came clown to breakfast the next morning she studied a stare in her mirror and practised it upon trannel so successfully when he came up to speak to her that it must have made him doubt whether he had ever had her acquaintance in his doubt he ventured to address her and then lottie turned her back upon him in a manner that was perfectly convincing he attempted a smiling ease with mrs kenton and the judge but they shared neither his smile nor his ease and his jocose questions about the end of yesterdays adventures which he had not been privy to did not seem to appeal to the american sense of humor in them ellen was not with them nor boyne but trannel was not asked to take either of the vacant places at the table even when breckon took one of them after a decent exchange of civilities with him he could only saunter away and leave mrs kenton to a little pang  tchk she made im sorry for him  so am i said the judge but he will get over itonly too soon im afraid i dont believe hes very sorry for himself  they had not advised with breckon and he did not feel authorized to make any comment he seemed preoccupied to mrs kentons eye when she turned it upon him from trannels discomfited back lessening in the perspective and he answered vaguely to her overture about his nights rest lottie never made any conversation with breckon and she now left him to himself with some remnants of the disapproval which she found on her hands after crushing trannel it could not be said that breckon was aware of her disapproval and the judge had no apparent consciousness of it he and breckon tried to make something of each other but failed and it all seemed a very defeating sequel to mrs kenton after the triumphal glow of the evening before when lottie rose she went with her alleging her wish to see if boyne had eaten his breakfast she confessed to breckons kind inquiry that boyne did not seem very well and that she had made him take his breakfast in his room and she did not think it necessary to own even to so friendly a witness as mr breckon that boyne was ashamed to come down and dreaded meeting trannel so much that she was giving him time to recover his selfrespect and courage     xv  as soon as she and lottie were gone breckon began rather more formidably than he liked but helplessly so judge kenton i should be glad of a few moments with you onon an importanton a matter that is important to me  well said the judge cautiously whatever was coming he wished to guard himself from the mistake that he had once so nearly fallen into and that still made him catch his breath to think of how can i be of use to you  i dont know that you can be of any usei dont know that i ought to speak to you but i thought you might perhaps save me fromsave my taking a false step  he looked at kenton as if he would understand and kenton supposed that he did he said my daughter once mentioned your wish to talk with me  your daughter breckon stared at him in stupefaction  yes ellen she said you wished to consult me about going back to your charge in new york when we were on the ship together but i dont know that im very competent to give advice in such  oh breckon exclaimed in a tone of immense relief which did not continue itself in what he went on to say that ive quite made up my mind to go back he stopped and then he burst out i want to speak with you about her the judge sat steady still resolute not to give himself away and the young man scarcely recovered from what had been a desperate plunge in adding i know that its usual to speak with herwith the lady herself first buti dont know the circumstances are peculiar you only know about me what youve seen of me and i would rather make my mistakes in the order that seems right to me although it isnt just the american way  he smiled rather piteously and the judge said rather encouragingly i dont quite know whether i follow you  breckon blushed and sought help in what remained of his coffee the way isnt easy for me but its this i ask your leave to ask miss ellen to marry me the worst was over now and looked as if it were a relief she is the most beautiful person in the world to me and the best but as you know so little of me i thought it right to get your leaveto tell youtotothat is all he fell back in his chair and looked a at kenton  it is unusual the judge began  yes yes i know that and for that reason i speak first to you ill be ruled by you implicitly  i dont mean that kenton said i would have expected that you would speak to her first but i get your point of view and i must say i think youre right i think you are behavinghonorably i wish that every one was like you but i cant say anything now i must talk with her mother my daughters life has not been happy i cant tell you but as far as i am concerned and i think mrs kenton too i would be gladwe like you mr breckon we think you are a good man  oh thank you im not so sure  wed risk it but that isnt all will you excuse me if i dont say anything more just yetand if i leave you  why certainly the judge had risen and pushed back his chair and breckon did the same and i shallhear from you  why certainly said the judge in his turn  it isnt possible that you put him off his wife reproached him when he told what had passed between him and breckon oh you couldnt have let him think that we didnt want him for her surely you didnt  will you get it into your head he flamed back that he hasnt spoken to ellen yet and i couldnt accept him till she had  oh yes i forgot that mrs kenton struggled with the fact in the difficulty of realizing so strange an order of procedure i suppose its his being educated abroad that way but do go back to him rufus and tell him that of course  i will do nothing of the kind sarah what are you thinking of  oh i dont know what im thinking of i must see ellen i suppose ill go to her now oh dear if she doesntif she lets such a chance slip through her fingersbut shes quite likely to shes so obstinate i wonder what shell want us to do  she fled to her daughters room and found boyne there sitting beside his sisters bed giving her a detailed account of his adventure of the day before up to the moment mr breckon met him in charge of the detectives up to that moment it appeared to boyne as nearly as he could recollect that he had not broken down but had behaved himself with a dignity which was now beginning to clothe his whole experience in the retrospect a quiet heroism characterized his conduct and at the moment his mother entered the room he was questioning ellen as to her impressions of his bearing when she first saw him in the grasp of the detectives  his mother took him by the arm and said i want to speak with ellen boyne and put him out of the door  then she came back and sat down in his chair ellen mr breckon has been speaking to your father do you know what about  about his going back to new york the girl suggested  her mother kept her patience with difficulty no not about that about you hes asked your fatheri cant understand yet why he did it only hes so delicate and honorable and goodness known we appreciate itwhether he can tell you thatthat it was not possible for such a mother as mrs kenton to say he loves you it would have sounded as she would have said too sickish and she compromised on he likes you and wants to ask you whether you will marry him and ellen she continued in the ample silence which followed if you dont say you will i will have nothing more to do with such a simpleton i have always felt that you behaved very foolishly about mr bittridge but i hoped that when you grew older you would see it as we did andand behave differently and now if after all weve been through with you you are going to say that you wont have mr breckon  mrs kenton stopped for want of a figure that would convey all the disaster that would fall upon ellen in such an event and she was given further pause when the girl gently answered im not going to say that momma  then what in the world are you going to say mrs kenton demanded  ellen had turned her face away on the pillow and now she answered quietly when mr breckon asks me i will tell him  well you had better her mother threatened in return and she did not realize the falsity of her position till she reported ellens words to the judge  well sarah i think she had you there he said and mrs kenton then said that she did not care if the child was only going to behave sensibly at last and she did believe she was  then its all right said the judge and he took up the tuskingum intelligencer lying till then unread in the excitements which had followed its arrival the day before and began to read it  mrs kenton sat dreamily watching him with her hands fallen in her lap she suddenly started up with the cry good gracious what are we all thinking of  kenton stared at her over the top of his paper how thinking of  why mr breckon he must be crazy to know what weve decided poor fellow  oh said the judge folding the intelligencer on his knee i had forgotten somehow i thought it was all settled  mrs kenton took his paper from him and finished folding it it hasnt begun to be settled you must go and let him know  wont he look me up the judge suggested  you must look him up go at once dear think how anxious he must be  kenton was not sure that breckon looked very anxious when he found him on the brick promenade before the kurhaus apparently absorbed in noting the convulsions of a large round german lady in the water who must have supposed herself to be bathing but perhaps the young man did not see her the smile on his face was too vague for such an interest when he turned at kentons approaching steps  the judge hesitated for an instant in which the smile left breckons face i believe thats all right mr breckon he said youll find mrs kenton in our parlor and then the two men parted with an oh thank you from breckon who walked back towards the hotel and left kenton to ponder upon the german lady as soon as he realized that she was not a barrel the judge continued his walk along the promenade feeling rather ashamed  mrs kenton had gone to ellens room again when she had got the judge off upon his mission she rather flung in upon her oh you are up she apologized to ellens back the girls face was towards the glass and she was tilting her head to get the effect of the hat on it which she now took off  i suppose poppas gone to tell him she said sitting tremulously down  didnt you want him to her mother asked stricken a little at sight of her agitation  yes i wanted him to but that doesnt make it any easier it makes it harder momma  well ellen  you know youve got to tell him first  tell him mrs kenton repeated but she knew what ellen meant  aboutmr bittridge all about it every single thing about his kissing me that night  at the last demand mrs kenton was visibly shaken in her invisible assent to the girls wish dont you think ellen that you had better tell him thatsome time  no now and you must tell him you let me go to the theatre with him the faintest shadow of resentment clouded the girls face but still mrs kenton thought she knew her own guilt could not yield  why ellen she pleaded not without a reproachful sense of vulgarity in such a plea dont you suppose he everkissed any one  that doesnt concern me momma said ellen without a trace of consciousness that she was saying anything uncommon if you wont tell him then that ends it i wont see him  oh well her mother sighed i will try to tell him but id rather be whipped i know hell laugh at me  he wont laugh at you said the girl confidently almost comfortingly i want him to know everything before i meet him i dont want to have a single thing on my mind i dont want to think of myself  mrs kenton understood the womansoul that spoke in these words well she said with a deep long breath be ready then  but she felt the burden which had been put upon her to be so much more than she could bear that when she found her husband in their parlor she instantly resolved to cast it upon him he stood at the window with his hat on  has breckon been here yet he asked  have you seen him yet she returned  yes and i thought he was coming right here but perhaps he stopped to screw his courage up he only knew how little it needed with us  well now its we whove got to have the courage or you have do you know what ellen wants to have done mrs kenton put it in these impersonal terms and as a preliminary to shirking her share of the burden  she doesnt want to have him refused  she wants to have him told all about bittridge  after a momentary revolt the judge said well thats right its like ellen  theres something else thats more like her said mrs kenton indignantly she wants him to told about what bittridge did that nightabout him kissing her  the judge looked disgusted with his wife for the word then he looked aghast about  yes and she wont have a word to say to him till he is told and unless he is told she will refuse him  did she say that  no but i know she will  if she didnt say she would i think we may take the chances that she wont  no we mustnt take any such chances you must tell him  i no i couldnt manage it i have no tact and it would sound so confoundedly queer coming from one man to another it would beindelicate its something that nobody but a womanwhy doesnt she tell him herself  she wont she considers it our part and something we ought to do before he commits himself  very well then sarah you must tell him you can manage it so it wont by soqueer  that is just what i supposed you would say mr kenton but i must say i didnt expect it of you i think its cowardly  look out sarah i dont like that word  oh i suppose youre brave enough when it comes to any kind of danger but when it comes to taking the brunt of anything unpleasant  it isnt unpleasantits queer  why do you keep saying that over and over theres nothing queer about it its ellenish but isnt it right  its right yes i suppose but its squeamish  i see nothing squeamish about it but i know youre determined to leave it to me and so i shall do it i dont believe mr breckon will think its queer or squeamish  ive no doubt hell take it in the right way youll know how to kenton looked into his hat which he had taken off and then put it on again his tone and his manner were sufficiently sneaking and he could not make them otherwise it was for this reason no doubt that he would not prolong the interview  oh yes go said mrs kenton as he found himself with his hand on the door leave it all to me do and he was aware of skulking out of the room by the time that it would have taken him so long as to walk to the top of the grand stairway he was back again hes coming he said breathlessly i saw him at the bottom of the stairs go into your room and wash your eyes ill tell him  no no rufus let me it will be much better youll be sure to bungle it  we must risk that you were quite right sarah it would have been cowardly in me to let you do it  rufus you know i didnt mean it surely youre not resenting that  no im glad you made me see it youre all right sarah and youll find that it will all come out all right you neednt be afraid ill bungle it i shall use discretion go  i shall not stir a step from this parlor youve got back all your spirit dear said the old wife with young pride in her husband but i must say that ellen is putting more upon you than she has any right to i think she might tell him herself  no its our businessmy business we allowed her to get in for it shes quite right about it we must not let him commit himself to her till he knows the thing that most puts her to shame it isnt enough for us to say that it was really no shame she feels that it casts a sort of stainyou know what i mean sarah and i believe i can make this young man know if i cant so much the worse for him he shall never see ellen again  oh rufus  do you think he would be worthy of her if he couldnt  i think ellen is perfectly ridiculous  then that shows that i am right in deciding not to leave this thing to you i feel as she does about it and i intend that he shall  do you intend to let her run the chance of losing him  that is what i intend to do  well then ill tell you what i am going to stay right here we will both see him its right for us to do it but at a rap on the parlor door mrs kenton flew to that of her own room which she closed upon her with a sort of parthian whimper oh do be careful rufus  whether kenton was careful or not could never be known from either kenton himself or from breckon the judge did tell him everything and the young man received the most damning details of ellens history with a radiant absence which testified that they fell upon a surface sense of kenton and did not penetrate to the allpervading sense of ellen herself below at the end kenton was afraid he had not understood  you understand he said that she could not consent to see you before you knew just how weak she thought she had been the judge stiffened to defiance in making this humiliation i dont consider myself that she was weak at all  of course not breckon beamed back at him  i consider that throughout she acted with the greatestgreatestand that in that affair when he behaved with thatthat outrageous impudence it was because she had misled the scoundrel by her kindness her forbearance her wish not to do him the least shadow of injustice but to give him every chance of proving himself worthy of her tolerance and  the judge choked and breckon eagerly asked and shall imay i see her now  whyyes the judge faltered if youre sure  what about breckon demanded  i dont know whether she will believe that i have told you  i will try to convince her where shall i see her  i will go and tell her you are here i will bring her  kenton passed into the adjoining room where his wife laid hold of him almost violently you did it beautifully rufus she huskily whispered and i was so afraid you would spoil everything oh how manly you were and how perfect he was but now its my turn and i will go and bring ellenyou will let me wont you  you may do anything you please sarah i dont want to have any more of this said the judge from the chair he had dropped into  well then i will bring her at once said mrs kenton staying only in her gladness to kiss him on his gray head he received her embrace with a superficial sultriness which did not deceive her  ellen came back without her mother and as soon as she entered the room and breckon realized that she had come alone he ran towards her as if to take her in his arms but she put up her hand with extended fingers and held him lightly off  did poppa tell you she asked with a certain defiance she held her head up fiercely and spoke steadily but he could see the pulse beating in her pretty neck  yes he told me  andwell  oh i love you ellen  that isnt it did you care  breckon had an inspiration an inspiration from the truth that dwelt at the bottom of his soul and had never yet failed to save him he let his arms fall and answered desperately yes i did i wished it hadnt happened he saw the pulse in her neck cease to beat and he swiftly added but i know that it happened just because you were yourself and were so  if you had said you didnt care she breathlessly whispered i would never have spoken to you he felt a conditional tremor creeping into the fingers which had been so rigid against his breast i dont see how i lived through it do you think you can  i think so he returned with a faint far suggestion of levity that brought from her an imperative imploring  dont  then he added solemnly it had no more to do with you ellen than an offence from some hateful animal  oh how good you are the fingers folded themselves and her arms weakened so that there was nothing to keep him from drawing her to him whatwhat are you doing she asked with her face smothered against his  oh ellen ellen ellen oh my love my dearest my best  but i have been such a fool she protested imagining that she was going to push him from her but losing herself in him more and more  yes yes darling i know it thats why i love you so     xxvi  there is just one thing said the judge as he wound up his watch that night that makes me a little uneasy still  mrs kenton already in her bed turned her face upon him with a despairing tchk dear what is it i thought we had talked over everything  we havent got lotties consent yet  well i think i see myself asking lottie mrs kenton began before she realized her husbands irony she added how could you give me such a start  well lottie has bossed us so long that i couldnt help mentioning it said the judge  it was a lame excuse and in its most potential implication his suggestion proved without reason if lottie never gave her explicit approval to ellens engagement she never openly opposed it she treated it rather with something like silent contempt as a childish weakness on ellens part which was beneath her serious consideration towards breckon her behavior hardly changed in the severity which she had assumed from the moment she first ceased to have any use for him i suppose i will have to kiss him she said gloomily when her mother told her that he was to be her brother and she performed the rite with as much coldness as was ever put in that form of affectionate welcome it is doubtful if breckon perfectly realized its coldness he never knew how much he enraged her by acting as if she were a little girl and saying lightly almost trivially im so glad youre going to be a sister to me  with ellen lottie now considered herself quits and from the first hour of ellens happiness she threw off all the care with all the apparent kindness which she had used towards her when she was a morbid invalid here again if lottie had minded such a thing she might have been as much vexed by ellens attitude as by breckons ellen never once noticed the withdrawal of her anxious oversight or seemed in the least to miss it as much as her meek nature would allow she arrogated to herself the privileges and prerogatives of an elder sister and if it had been possible to make lottie ever feel like a chit there were moments when ellens behavior would have made her feel like a chit it was not till after their return to tuskingum that lottie took her true place in relation to the affair and in the preparations for the wedding which she appointed to be in the first universalist church overruling both her mothers and sisters preferences for a home wedding that lottie rose in due authority mrs kenton had not ceased to feel quelled whenever her younger daughter called her mother instead of momma and ellen seemed not really to care she submitted the matter to breckon who said oh yes if lottie wishes and he laughed when ellen confessed well i said we would  with the lifting of his great anxiety he had got back to that lightness which was most like him and he could not always conceal from lottie herself that he regarded her as a joke she did not mind it she said from such a mere sop as in the vast content of his love he was  this was some months after lottie had got at scheveningen from mr plumpton that letter which decided her that she had no use for him there came the same day and by the same post with it a letter from one of her young men in tuskingum who had faithfully written to her all the winter before and had not intermitted his letters after she went abroad to kenton he had always seemed too wise if not too good for lottie but mrs kenton who had her own doubts of lottie would not allow this when it came to the question and said woundedly that she did not see why lottie was not fully his equal in every way  well the judge suggested she isnt the first young lawyer at the tuskingum bar  well i wouldnt wish her to be said mrs kenton who did not often make jokes  well i dont know that i would her husband assented and he added pretty good sarah  lottie her mother summed up is practical and she is very neat she wont let mr elroy go around looking so slovenly i hope she will make him have his hair cut and not look as if it were bitten off and i dont believe hes had his boots blacked since  he was born the judge proposed and she assented  yes she is very saving and he is wasteful it will be a very good match you can let them build on the other corner of the lot if ellen is going to be in new york i would miss lottie more than ellen about the housekeeping though the dear knows i will miss them both badly enough  well you can break off their engagements said the judge  as yet and until ellen was off her hands lottie would not allow mr elroy to consider himself engaged to her his conditional devotion did not debar him from a lovers rights and until breckon came on from new york to be married there was much more courtship of lottie than of ellen in the house but lottie saved herself in the form if not the fact and as far as verbal terms were concerned she was justified by them in declaring that she would not have another sop hanging round  it was boyne and boyne alone who had any misgivings in regard to ellens engagement and these were of a nature so recondite that when he came to impart them to his mother before they left scheveningen and while there was yet time for that conclusion which his father suggested to mrs kenton too late boyne had an almost hopeless difficulty in stating them his approaches even were so mystical that his mother was forced to bring him to book sharply  boyne if you dont tell me right off just what you mean i dont know what i will do to you what are you driving at for pitys sake are you saying that she oughtnt to be engaged to mr breckon  no im not saying that momma said boyne in a distress that caused his mother to take a reef in her impatience  well what are you saying then  why you know how ellen is momma you know how conscientious andandsensitive or i dont mean sensitive exactly  well  well i dont think she ought to be engaged to mr breckon out ofgratitude  gratitude  yes i just know that she thinksor it would be just like herthat he saved me that day but he only met me about a second before we came to her and poppa and the officers were taking me right along towards them mrs kenton held herself stormily in and he continued i know that he translated for us before the magistrate but the magistrate could speak a little english and when he saw poppa he saw that it was all right anyway i dont want to say anything against mr breckon and i think he behaved as well any one could but if ellen is going to marry him out of gratitude for saving me  mrs kenton could hold in no longer and is this what youve been bothering the life half out of me for for the last hour  well i thought you ought to look at it in that light momma  well boyne said his mother sometimes i think youre almost a fool and she turned her back upon her son and left him  boynes place in the kenton family for which he continued to have the highest regard became a little less difficult a little less incompatible with his selfrespect as time went on his spirit which had lagged a little after his body in stature began as his father said to catch up he no longer nourished it so exclusively upon heroical romance as he had during the past year and after his return to tuskingum he went into his brother richards once and manifested a certain curiosity in the study of the law he read blackstone and could give a fair account of his impressions of english law to his father he had quite outlived the period of entomological research and he presented his collections of insects somewhat motheaten to his nephew on whom he also bestowed his postagestamp album mary kenton accepted them in trust the nephew being of yet too tender years for their care in the preoccupations of his immediate family with ellens engagement boyne became rather close friends with his sisterinlaw and there were times when he was tempted to submit to her judgment the question whether the young queen of holland did not really beckon to him that day but pending the hour when he foresaw that lottie should come out with the whole story in some instant of excitement boyne had not quite the heart to speak of his experience it assumed more and more respectability with him and lost that squalor which had once put him to shame while it was yet new he thought that mary might be reasoned into regarding him as the hero of an adventure but he is still hesitating whether to confide in her in the meantime she knows all about it mary and richard both approved of ellens choice though they are somewhat puzzled to make out just what mr breckons religion is and what his relations to his charge in new york may be these do not seem to them quite pastoral and he himself shares their uncertainty but since his flock does not include mrs rasmith and her daughter he is content to let the question remain in abeyance the rasmiths are settled in rome with an apparent permanency which they have not known elsewhere for a long time and they have both joined in the friendliest kind of letter on his marriage to their former pastor if that was what breckon was they have professed to know from the first that he was in love with ellen and that he is in love with her now is the strong present belief of his flock if they are a flock and if they may be said to have anything so positive as a belief in regard to anything  judge kenton has given the elroys the other corner of the lot and has supplied them the means of building on it mary and lottie run diagonally into the homehouse every day and nothing keeps either from coming into authority over the old people except the fear of each other in which they stand the kentons no longer make any summer journeys but in the winter they take boyne and go to see ellen in new york they do not stay so long as mrs kenton would like as soon as they have fairly seen the breckons and have settled comfortably down in their pleasant house on west seventyfourth street she detects him in a secret habit of sighing which she recognizes as the worst symptom of homesickness and then she confides to ellen that she supposes mr kenton will make her go home with him before long ellen knows it is useless to interfere she even encourages her fathers longings so far as indulging his clandestine visits to the seedsmans and she goes with him to pick up secondhand books about ohio in the war at the dealers who remember the judge very flatteringly  as february draws on towards march it becomes impossible to detain kenton his wife and son return with him to tuskingum where lottie has seen to the kindling of a good fire in the furnace against their arrival and has nearly come to blows with mary about provisioning them for the first dinner then mrs kenton owns with a comfort which she will not let her husband see that there is no place like home and they take up their life in the place where they have been so happy and so unhappy he reads to her a good deal at night and they play a game of checkers usually before they go to bed she still cheats without scruple for as she justly says he knows very well that she cannot bear to be beaten  the colonel as he is still invariably known to his veterans works pretty faithfully at the regimental autobiography and drives round the country picking up material among them in a buggy plastered with mud he has imagined since his last visit to breckon who dictates his sermons if they are sermons taking a stenographer with him and the young lady who is in deadly terror of the colonels driving is of the greatest use to him in the case of veterans who will not or cannot give down as they say in their dairycountry parlance and has already rescued many reminiscences from perishing in their faltering memories she writes them out in the judges library when the colonel gets home and his wife sometimes surprises mr kenton correcting them there at night after she supposes he has gone to bed  since it has all turned out for the best concerning bittridge she no longer has those pangs of selfreproach for richards treatment of him which she suffered while afraid that if the fact came to ellens knowledge it might make her refuse breckon she does not find her daughters behavior in the matter so anomalous as it appears to the judge  he is willing to account for it on the ground of that inconsistency which he has observed in all human behavior but mrs kenton is not inclined to admit that it is so very inconsistent she contends that ellen had simply lived through that hateful episode of her psychological history as she was sure to do sooner or later and as she was destined to do as soon as some other person arrived to take her fancy  if this is the crude commonsense view of the matter ellen herself is able to offer no finer explanation which shall at the same time be more thorough she and her husband have not failed to talk the affair over with that fulness of treatment which young married people give their past when they have nothing to conceal from each other she has attempted to solve the mystery by blaming herself for a certain essential levity of nature which under all her appearance of gravity sympathized with levity in others and for what she knows to the contrary with something ignoble and unworthy in them breckon of course does not admit this but he has suggested that she was first attracted to him by a certain unseriousness which reminded her of bittridge in enabling him to take her seriousness lightly this is the logical inference which he makes from her theory of herself but she insists that it does not follow and she contends that she was moved to love him by an instant sense of his goodness which she never lost and in which she was trying to equal herself with him by even the desperate measure of renouncing her happiness if that should ever seem her duty to his perfection he says this is not very clear though it is awfully gratifying and he does not quite understand why mrs bittridges letter should have liberated ellen from her fancied obligations to the past ellen can only say that it did so by making her so ashamed ever to have had anything to do with such people and making her see how much she had tried her father and mother by her folly this again breckon contends is not clear but he says we live in a universe of problems in which another more or less does not much matter he is always expecting that some chance shall confront him with bittridge and that the mans presence will explain everything for like so many ohio people who leave their native state the bittridges have come east instead of going west in quitting the neighborhood of tuskingum he is settled with his idolized mother in new york where he is obscurely attached to one of the newspapers that he has as yet failed to rise from the ranks in the great army of assignment men may be because moral quality tells everywhere and to be a clever blackguard is not so well as to be simply clever if ever breckon has met his alter ego as he amuses himself in calling him he has not known it though bittridge may have been wiser in the case of a man of breckons publicity not to call it distinction there was a time immediately after the breckons heard from tuskingum that the bittridges were in new york when ellens husband consulted her as to what might be his duty towards her late suitor in the event which has not taken place and when he suggested not too seriously that richards course might be the solution to his suggestion ellen answered oh no dear that was wrong and this remains also richards opinion     pg editors bookmarks      a
