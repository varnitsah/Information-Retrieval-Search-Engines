4141934	father damien an open letter to the reverend doctor hyde of honolulu from robert louis stevenson   1914 london chatto  windus  a new impression all rights reserved  sydney february 25 1890  sirit may probably occur to you that we have met and visited and conversed on my side with interest  you may remember that you have done me several courtesies for which i was prepared to be grateful  but there are duties which come before gratitude and offences which justly divide friends far more acquaintances  your letter to the reverend h b gage is a document which in my sight if you had filled me with bread when i was starving if you had sat up to nurse my father when he lay a dying would yet absolve me from the bonds of gratitude  you know enough doubtless of the process of canonisation to be aware that a hundred years after the death of damien there will appear a man charged with the painful office of the devils advocate  after that noble brother of mine and of all frail clay shall have lain a century at rest one shall accuse one defend him  the circumstance is unusual that the devils advocate should be a volunteer should be a member of a sect immediately rival and should make haste to take upon himself his ugly office ere the bones are cold unusual and of a taste which i shall leave my readers free to qualify unusual and to me inspiring  if i have at all learned the trade of using words to convey truth and to arouse emotion you have at last furnished me with a subject  for it is in the interest of all mankind and the cause of public decency in every quarter of the world not only that damien should be righted but that you and your letter should be displayed at length in their true colours to the public eye  to do this properly i must begin by quoting you at large i shall then proceed to criticise your utterance from several points of view divine and human in the course of which i shall attempt to draw again and with more specification the character of the dead saint whom it has pleased you to vilify so much being done i shall say farewell to you for ever     honolulu    august 2 1889     rev h b gage     dear brotherin answer to your inquires about father damien i can    only reply that we who knew the man are surprised at the extravagant    newspaper laudations as if he was a most saintly philanthropist  the    simple truth is he was a coarse dirty man headstrong and bigoted    he was not sent to molokai but went there without orders did not    stay at the leper settlement before he became one himself but    circulated freely over the whole island less than half the island is    devoted to the lepers and he came often to honolulu  he had no hand    in the reforms and improvements inaugurated which were the work of    our board of health as occasion required and means were provided  he    was not a pure man in his relations with women and the leprosy of    which he died should be attributed to his vices and carelessness    other have done much for the lepers our own ministers the government    physicians and so forth but never with the catholic idea of meriting    eternal lifeyours etc     c m hyde 1  to deal fitly with a letter so extraordinary i must draw at the outset on my private knowledge of the signatory and his sect  it may offend others scarcely you who have been so busy to collect so bold to publish gossip on your rivals  and this is perhaps the moment when i may best explain to you the character of what you are to read i conceive you as a man quite beyond and below the reticences of civility with what measure you mete with that shall it be measured you again with you at last i rejoice to feel the button off the foil and to plunge home  and if in aught that i shall say i should offend others your colleagues whom i respect and remember with affection i can but offer them my regret i am not free i am inspired by the consideration of interests far more large and such pain as can be inflicted by anything from me must be indeed trifling when compared with the pain with which they read your letter  it is not the hangman but the criminal that brings dishonour on the house  you belong sir to a secti believe my sect and that in which my ancestors labouredwhich has enjoyed and partly failed to utilise and exceptional advantage in the islands of hawaii  the first missionaries came they found the land already selfpurged of its old and bloody faith they were embraced almost on their arrival with enthusiasm what troubles they supported came far more from whites than from hawaiians and to these last they stood in a rough figure in the shoes of god this is not the place to enter into the degree or causes of their failure such as it is  one element alone is pertinent and must here be plainly dealt with  in the course of their evangelical calling theyor too many of themgrew rich  it may be news to you that the houses of missionaries are a cause of mocking on the streets of honolulu  it will at least be news to you that when i returned your civil visit the driver of my cab commented on the size the taste and the comfort of your home  it would have been news certainly to myself had any one told me that afternoon that i should live to drag such a matter into print but you see sir how you degrade better men to your own level and it is needful that those who are to judge betwixt you and me betwixt damien and the devils advocate should understand your letter to have been penned in a house which could raise and that very justly the envy and the comments of the passersby  i think to employ a phrase of yours which i admire it should be attributed to you that you have never visited the scene of damiens life and death  if you had and had recalled it and looked about your pleasant rooms even your pen perhaps would have been stayed  your sect and remember as far as any sect avows me it is mine has not done ill in a worldly sense in the hawaiian kingdom  when calamity befell their innocent parishioners when leprosy descended and took root in the eight islands a quid pro quo was to be looked for  to that prosperous mission and to you as one of its adornments god had sent at last an opportunity  i know i am touching here upon a nerve acutely sensitive  i know that others of your colleagues look back on the inertia of your church and the intrusive and decisive heroism of damien with something almost to be called remorse  i am sure it is so with yourself i am persuaded your letter was inspired by a certain envy not essentially ignoble and the one human trait to be espied in that performance  you were thinking of the lost chance the past day of that which should have been conceived and was not of the service due and not rendered  time was said the voice in your ear in your pleasant room as you sat raging and writing and if the words written were base beyond parallel the rage i am happy to repeatit is the only compliment i shall pay youthe rage was almost virtuous  but sir when we have failed and another has succeeded when we have stood by and another has stepped in when we sit and grow bulky in our charming mansions and a plain uncouth peasant steps into the battle under the eyes of god and succours the afflicted and consoles the dying and is himself afflicted in his turn and dies upon the field of honourthe battle cannot be retrieved as your unhappy irritation has suggested  it is a lost battle and lost for ever  one thing remained to you in your defeatsome rags of common honour and these you have made haste to cast away  common honour not the honour of having done anything right but the honour of not having done aught conspicuously foul the honour of the inert that was what remained to you  we are not all expected to be damiens a man may conceive his duty more narrowly he may love his comforts better and none will cast a stone at him for that  but will a gentleman of your reverend profession allow me an example from the fields of gallantry  when two gentlemen compete for the favour of a lady and the one succeeds and the other is rejected and as will sometimes happen matter damaging to the successful rivals credit reaches the ear of the defeated it is held by plain men of no pretensions that his mouth is in the circumstance almost necessarily closed  your church and damiens were in hawaii upon a rivalry to do well to help to edify to set divine examples  you having in one huge instance failed and damien succeeded i marvel it should not have occurred to you that you were doomed to silence that when you had been outstripped in that high rivalry and sat inglorious in the midst of your wellbeing in your pleasant roomand damien crowned with glories and horrors toiled and rotted in that pigsty of his under the cliffs of kalawaoyou the elect who would not were the last man on earth to collect and propagate gossip on the volunteer who would and did  i think i see youfor i try to see you in the flesh as i write these sentencesi think i see you leap at the word pigsty a hyperbolical expression at the best  he had no hand in the reforms he was a coarse dirty man these were your own words and you may think it possible that i am come to support you with fresh evidence  in a sense it is even so  damien has been too much depicted with a conventional halo and conventional features so drawn by men who perhaps had not the eye to remark or the pen to express the individual or who perhaps were only blinded and silenced by generous admiration such as i partly envy for myselfsuch as you if your soul were enlightened would envy on your bended knees  it is the least defect of such a method of portraiture that it makes the path easy for the devils advocate and leaves the misuse of the slanderer a considerable field of truth  for the truth that is suppressed by friends is the readiest weapon of the enemy  the world in your despite may perhaps owe you something if your letter be the means of substituting once for all a credible likeness for a wax abstraction  for if that world at all remember you on the day when damien of molokai shall be named a saint it will be in virtue of one work your letter to the reverend h b gage  you may ask on what authority i speak  it was my inclement destiny to become acquainted not with damien but with dr hyde  when i visited the lazaretto damien was already in his resting grave  but such information as i have i gathered on the spot in conversation with those who knew him well and long some indeed who revered his memory but others who had sparred and wrangled with him who beheld him with no halo who perhaps regarded him with small respect and through whose unprepared and scarcely partial communications the plain human features of the man shone on me convincingly  these gave me what knowledge i possess and i learnt it in that scene where it could be most completely and sensitively understoodkalawao which you have never visited about which you have never so much as endeavoured to inform yourself for brief as your letter is you have found the means to stumble into that confession  less than onehalf of the island you say is devoted to the lepers  molokaimolokai ahina the grey lofty and most desolate islandalong all its northern side plunges a front of precipice into a sea of unusual profundity  this range of cliff is from east to west the true end and frontier of the island  only in one spot there projects into the ocean a certain triangular and rugged down grassy stony windy and rising in the midst into a hill with a dead crater the whole bearing to the cliff that overhangs it somewhat the same relation as a bracket to a wall  with this hint you will now be able to pick out the leper station on a map you will be able to judge how much of molokai is thus cut off between the surf and precipice whether less than a half or less than a quarter or a fifth or a tenthor say a twentieth and the next time you burst into print you will be in a position to share with us the issue of your calculations  i imagine you to be one of those persons who talk with cheerfulness of that place which oxen and wainropes could not drag you to behold  you who do not even know its situation on the map probably denounce sensational descriptions stretching your limbs the while in your pleasant parlour on beretania street  when i was pulled ashore there one early morning there sat with me in the boat two sisters bidding farewell in humble imitation of damien to the lights and joys of human life  one of these wept silently i could not withhold myself from joining her  had you been there it is my belief that nature would have triumphed even in you and as the boat drew but a little nearer and you beheld the stairs crowded with abominable deformations of our common manhood and saw yourself landing in the midst of such a population as only now and then surrounds us in the horror of a nightmarewhat a haggard eye you would have rolled over your reluctant shoulder towards the house on beretania street  had you gone on had you found every fourth face a blot upon the landscape had you visited the hospital and seen the buttends of human beings lying there almost unrecognisable but still breathing still thinking still remembering you would have understood that life in the lazaretto is an ordeal from which the nerves of a mans spirit shrink even as his eye quails under the brightness of the sun you would have felt it was even today a pitiful place to visit and a hell to dwell in  it is not the fear of possible infection  that seems a little thing when compared with the pain the pity and the disgust of the visitors surroundings and the atmosphere of affliction disease and physical disgrace in which he breathes  i do not think i am a man more than usually timid but i never recall the days and nights i spent upon that island promontory eight days and seven nights without heartfelt thankfulness that i am somewhere else  i find in my diary that i speak of my stay as a grinding experience i have once jotted in the margin harrowing is the word and when the mokolii bore me at last towards the outer world i kept repeating to myself with a new conception of their pregnancy those simple words of the song     tis the most distressful country that ever yet was seen  and observe that which i saw and suffered from was a settlement purged bettered beautified the new village built the hospital and the bishop home excellently arranged the sisters the doctor and the missionaries all indefatigable in their noble tasks  it was a different place when damien came there and made this great renunciation and slept that first night under a tree amidst his rotting brethren alone with pestilence and looking forward with what courage with what pitiful sinkings of dread god only knows to a lifetime of dressing sores and stumps  you will say perhaps i am too sensitive that sights as painful abound in cancer hospitals and are confronted daily by doctors and nurses  i have long learned to admire and envy the doctors and the nurses  but there is no cancer hospital so large and populous as kalawao and kalaupapa and in such a matter every fresh case like every inch of length in the pipe of an organ deepens the note of the impression for what daunts the onlooker is that monstrous sum of human suffering by which he stands surrounded  lastly no doctor or nurse is called upon to enter once for all the doors of that gehenna they do not say farewell they need not abandon hope on its sad threshold they but go for a time to their high calling and can look forward as they go to relief to recreation and to rest  but damien shutto with his own hand the doors of his own sepulchre  i shall now extract three passages from my diary at kalawao  a  damien is dead and already somewhat ungratefully remembered in the field of his labours and sufferings  he was a good man but very officious says one  another tells me he had fallen as other priests so easily do into something of the ways and habits of thought of a kanaka but he had the wit to recognise the fact and the good sense to laugh at over it  a plain man it seems he was i cannot find he was a popular  b  after ragsdales death ragsdale was a famous luna or overseer of the unruly settlement there followed a brief term of office by father damien which served only to publish the weakness of that noble man  he was rough in his ways and he had no control  authority was relaxed damiens life was threatened and he was soon eager to resign  c  of damien i begin to have an idea  he seems to have been a man of the peasant class certainly of the peasant type shrewd ignorant and bigoted yet with an open mind and capable of receiving and digesting a reproof if it were bluntly administered superbly generous in the least thing as well as in the greatest and as ready to give his last shirt although not without human grumbling as he had been to sacrifice his life essentially indiscreet and officious which made him a troublesome colleague domineering in all his ways which made him incurably unpopular with the kanakas but yet destitute of real authority so that his boys laughed at him and he must carry out his wishes by the means of bribes  he learned to have a mania for doctoring and set up the kanakas against the remedies of his regular rivals perhaps if anything matter at all in the treatment of such a disease the worst thing that he did and certainly the easiest  the best and worst of the man appear very plainly in his dealings with mr chapmans money he had originally laid it out intended to lay it out entirely for the benefit of catholics and even so not wisely but after a long plain talk he admitted his error fully and revised the list  the sad state of the boys home is in part the result of his lack of control in part of his own slovenly ways and false ideas of hygiene  brother officials used to call it damiens chinatown  well they would say your chinatown keeps growing  and he would laugh with perfect goodnature and adhere to his errors with perfect obstinacy  so much i have gathered of truth about this plain noble human brother and father of ours his imperfections are the traits of his face by which we know him for our fellow his martyrdom and his example nothing can lessen or annul and only a person here on the spot can properly appreciate their greatness  i have set down these private passages as you perceive without correction thanks to you the public has them in their bluntness  they are almost a list of the mans faults for it is rather these that i was seeking with his virtues with the heroic profile of his life i and the world were already sufficiently acquainted  i was besides a little suspicious of catholic testimony in no ill sense but merely because damiens admirers and disciples were the least likely to be critical  i know you will be more suspicious still and the facts set down above were one and all collected from the lips of protestants who had opposed the father in his life  yet i am strangely deceived or they build up the image of a man with all his weakness essentially heroic and alive with rugged honesty generosity and mirth  take it for what it is rough private jottings of the worst sides of damiens character collected from the lips of those who had laboured with and in your own phrase knew the manthough i question whether damien would have said that he knew you  take it and observe with wonder how well you were served by your gossips how ill by your intelligence and sympathy in how many points of fact we are at one and how widely our appreciations vary  there is something wrong here either with you or me  it is possible for instance that you who seem to have so many ears in kalawao had heard of the affair of mr chapmans money and were singly struck by damiens intended wrongdoing  i was struck with that also and set it fairly down but i was struck much more by the fact that he had the honesty of mind to be convinced  i may here tell you that it was a long business that one of his colleagues sat with him late into the night multiplying arguments and accusations that the father listened as usual with perfect goodnature and perfect obstinacy but at the last when he was persuadedyes said he i am very much obliged to you you have done me a service it would have been a theft  there are many not catholics merely who require their heroes and saints to be infallible to these the story will be painful not to the true lovers patrons and servants of mankind  and i take it this is a type of our division that you are one of those who have an eye for faults and failures that you take a pleasure to find and publish them and that having found them you make haste to forget the overvailing virtues and the real success which had alone introduced them to your knowledge  it is a dangerous frame of mind  that you may understand how dangerous and into what a situation it has already brought you we will if you please go handinhand through the different phrases of your letter and candidly examine each from the point of view of its truth its appositeness and its charity     damien was coarse  it is very possible  you make us sorry for the lepers who had only a coarse old peasant for their friend and father  but you who were so refined why were you not there to cheer them with the lights of culture  or may i remind you that we have some reason to doubt if john the baptist were genteel and in the case of peter on whose career your doubtless dwell approvingly in the pulpit no doubt at all he was a coarse headstrong fisherman  yet even in our protestant bibles peter is called saint     damien was dirty  he was  think of the poor lepers annoyed with this dirty comrade  but the clean dr hyde was at his food in a fine house     damien was headstrong  i believe you are right again and i thank god for his strong head and heart     damien was bigoted  i am not fond of bigots myself because they are not fond of me  but what is meant by bigotry that we should regard it as a blemish in a priest  damien believed his own religion with the simplicity of a peasant or a child as i would i could suppose that you do  for this i wonder at him some way off and had that been his only character should have avoided him in life  but the point of interest in damien which has caused him to be so much talked about and made him at last the subject of your pen and mine was that in him his bigotry his intense and narrow faith wrought potently for good and strengthened him to be one of the worlds heroes and exemplars     damien was not sent to molokai but went there without orders  is this a misreading or do you really mean the words for blame  i have heard christ in the pulpits of our church held up for imitation on the ground that his sacrifice was voluntary  does dr hyde think otherwise     damien did not stay at the settlement etc  it is true he was allowed many indulgences  am i to understand that you blame the father for profiting by these or the officers for granting them  in either case it is a mighty spartan standard to issue from the house on beretania street and i am convinced you will find yourself with few supporters     damien had no hand in the reforms etc  i think even you will admit that i have already been frank in my description of the man i am defending but before i take you up upon this head i will be franker still and tell you that perhaps nowhere in the world can a man taste a more pleasurable sense of contrast than when he passes from damiens chinatown at kalawao to the beautiful bishophome at kalaupapa  at this point in my desire to make all fair for you i will break my rule and adduce catholic testimony  here is a passage from my diary about my visit to the chinatown from which you will see how it is even now regarded by its own officials we went round all the dormitories refectories etcdark and dingy enough with a superficial cleanliness which he mr dutton the laybrother did not seek to defend  it is almost decent said he the sisters will make that all right when we get them here  and yet i gathered it was already better since damien was dead and far better than when he was there alone and had his own not always excellent way  i have now come far enough to meet you on a common ground of fact and i tell you that to a mind not prejudiced by jealousy all the reforms of the lazaretto and even those which he most vigorously opposed are properly the work of damien  they are the evidence of his success they are what his heroism provoked from the reluctant and the careless  many were before him in the field mr meyer for instance of whose faithful work we hear too little there have been many since and some had more worldly wisdom though none had more devotion than our saint  before his day even you will confess they had effected little  it was his part by one striking act of martyrdom to direct all mens eyes on that distressful country  at a blow and with the price of his life he made the place illustrious and public  and that if you will consider largely was the one reform needful pregnant of all that should succeed  it brought money it brought best individual addition of them all the sisters it brought supervision for public opinion and public interest landed with the man at kalawao  if ever any man brought reforms and died to bring them it was he  there is not a clean cup or towel in the bishophome but dirty damien washed it     damien was not a pure man in his relations with women etc  how do you know that  is this the nature of conversation in that house on beretania street which the cabman envied driving pastracy details of the misconduct of the poor peasant priest toiling under the cliffs of molokai  many have visited the station before me they seem not to have heard the rumour  when i was there i heard many shocking tales for my informants were men speaking with the plainness of the laity and i heard plenty of complaints of damien  why was this never mentioned and how came it to you in the retirement of your clerical parlour  but i must not even seem to deceive you  this scandal when i read it in your letter was not new to me  i had heard it once before and i must tell you how  there came to samoa a man from honolulu he in a public house on the beach volunteered the statement that damien had contracted the disease from having connection with the female lepers and i find a joy in telling you how the report was welcomed in a publichouse  a man sprang to his feet i am not at liberty to give his name but from what i heard i doubt if you would care to have him to dinner in beretania street  you miserable little  here is a word i dare not print it would so shock your ears  you miserable little  he cried if the story were a thousand times true cant you see you are a million times a lower  for daring to repeat it  i wish it could be told of you that when the report reached you in your house perhaps after family worship you had found in your soul enough holy anger to receive it with the same expressions ay even with that one which i dare not print it would not need to have been blotted away like uncle tobys oath by the tears of the recording angel it would have been counted to you for your brightest righteousness  but you have deliberately chosen the part of the man from honolulu and you have played it with improvements of your own  the man from honolulumiserable leering creaturecommunicated the tale to a rude knot of beachcombing drinkers in a publichouse where i will so far agree with your temperance opinions man is not always at his noblest and the man from honolulu had himself been drinkingdrinking we may charitably fancy to excess  it was to your dear brother the reverend h b gage that you chose to communicate the sickening story and the blue ribbon which adorns your portly bosom forbids me to allow you the extenuating plea that you were drunk when it was done  your dear brothera brother indeedmade haste to deliver up your letter as a means of grace perhaps to the religious papers where after many months i found and read and wondered at it and whence i have now reproduced it for the wonder of others  and you and your dear brother have by this cycle of operations built up a contrast very edifying to examine in detail  the man whom you would not care to have to dinner on the one side on the other the reverend dr hyde and the reverend h b gage the apia barroom the honolulu manse  but i fear you scarce appreciate how you appear to your fellowmen and to bring it home to you i will suppose your story to be true  i will supposeand god forgive me for supposing itthat damien faltered and stumbled in his narrow path of duty i will suppose that in the horror of his isolation perhaps in the fever of incipient disease he who was doing so much more than he had sworn failed in the letter of his priestly oathhe who was so much a better man than either you or me who did what we have never dreamed of daringhe too tasted of our common frailty  o iago the pity of it  the least tender should be moved to tears the most incredulous to prayer  and all that you could do was to pen your letter to the reverend h b gage  is it growing at all clear to you what a picture you have drawn of your own heart  i will try yet once again to make it clearer  you had a father suppose this tale were about him and some informant brought it to you proof in hand i am not making too high an estimate of your emotional nature when i suppose you would regret the circumstance that you would feel the tale of frailty the more keenly since it shamed the author of your days and that the last thing you would do would be to publish it in the religious press  well the man who tried to do what damien did is my father and the father of the man in the apia bar and the father of all who love goodness and he was your father too if god had given you grace to see it     footnotes   1  from the sydney presbyterian october 26
