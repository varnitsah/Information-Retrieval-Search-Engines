lost    book i       of mans first disobedience and the fruit   of that forbidden tree whose mortal tast   brought death into the world and all our woe   with loss of eden till one greater man   restore us and regain the blissful seat   sing heavnly muse that on the secret top   of oreb or of sinai didst inspire   that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed   in the beginning how the heavns and earth   rose out of chaos or if sion hill   delight thee more and siloas brook that flowd   fast by the oracle of god i thence   invoke thy aid to my adventrous song   that with no middle flight intends to soar   above th aonian mount while it pursues   things unattempted yet in prose or rhime   and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer   before all temples th upright heart and pure   instruct me for thou knowst thou from the first   wast present and with mighty wings outspread   dovelike satst brooding on the vast abyss   and madst it pregnant what in me is dark   illumine what is low raise and support   that to the highth of this great argument   i may assert th eternal providence   and justifie the wayes of god to men      say first for heavn hides nothing from thy view   nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause   movd our grand parents in that happy state   favourd of heavn so highly to fall off   from their creator and transgress his will   for one restraint lords of the world besides   who first seducd them to that fowl revolt   th infernal serpent he it was whose guile   stird up with envy and revenge deceivd   the mother of mankinde what time his pride   had cast him out from heavn with all his host   of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring   to set himself in glory above his peers   he trusted to have equald the most high   if he opposd and with ambitious aim   against the throne and monarchy of god   raisd impious war in heavn and battel proud   with vain attempt  him the almighty power   hurld headlong flaming from th ethereal skie   with hideous ruine and combustion down   to bottomless perdition there to dwell   in adamantine chains and penal fire   who durst defie th omnipotent to arms   nine times the space that measures day and night   to mortal men he with his horrid crew   lay vanquisht rowling in the fiery gulfe   confounded though immortal but his doom   reservd him to more wrath for now the thought   both of lost happiness and lasting pain   torments him round he throws his baleful eyes   that witnessd huge affliction and dismay   mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate   at once as far as angels kenn he views   the dismal situation waste and wilde   a dungeon horrible on all sides round   as one great furnace flamd yet from those flames   no light but rather darkness visible   servd only to discover sights of woe   regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace   and rest can never dwell hope never comes   that comes to all but torture without end   still urges and a fiery deluge fed   with everburning sulphur unconsumd   such place eternal justice had prepard   for those rebellious here their prison ordaind   in utter darkness and their portion set   as far removd from god and light of heavn   as from the center thrice to th utmost pole   o how unlike the place from whence they fell   there the companions of his fall orewhelmd   with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire   he soon discerns and weltring by his side   one next himself in power and next in crime   long after known in palestine and namd   beelzebub  to whom th archenemy   and thence in heavn calld satan with bold words   breaking the horrid silence thus began      if thou beest he but o how falln how changd   from him who in the happy realms of light   clothd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine   myriads though bright if he whom mutual league   united thoughts and counsels equal hope   and hazard in the glorious enterprize   joynd with me once now misery hath joynd   in equal ruin into what pit thou seest   from what highth faln so much the stronger provd   he with his thunder and till then who knew   the force of those dire arms yet not for those   nor what the potent victor in his rage   can else inflict do i repent or change   though changd in outward lustre that fixt mind   and high disdain from sence of injurd merit   that with the mightiest raisd me to contend   and to the fierce contention brought along   innumerable force of spirits armd   that durst dislike his reign and me preferring   his utmost power with adverse power opposd   in dubious battel on the plains of heavn   and shook his throne  what though the field be lost   all is not lost the unconquerable will   and study of revenge immortal hate   and courage never to submit or yield   and what is else not to be overcome   that glory never shall his wrath or might   extort from me  to bow and sue for grace   with suppliant knee and deifie his power   who from the terrour of this arm so late   doubted his empire that were low indeed   that were an ignominy and shame beneath   this downfall since by fate the strength of gods   and this empyreal substance cannot fail   since through experience of this great event   in arms not worse in foresight much advanct   we may with more successful hope resolve   to wage by force or guile eternal warr   irreconcileable to our grand foe   who now triumphs and in th excess of joy   sole reigning holds the tyranny of heavn      so spake th apostate angel though in pain   vaunting aloud but rackt with deep despare   and him thus answerd soon his bold compeer      o prince o chief of many throned powers   that led th imbattelld seraphim to warr   under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds   fearless endangerd heavns perpetual king   and put to proof his high supremacy   whether upheld by strength or chance or fate   too well i see and rue the dire event   that with sad overthrow and foul defeat   hath lost us heavn and all this mighty host   in horrible destruction laid thus low   as far as gods and heavnly essences   can perish for the mind and spirit remains   invincible and vigour soon returns   though all our glory extinct and happy state   here swallowd up in endless misery   but what if he our conquerour whom i now   of force believe almighty since no less   then such could hav orepowrd such force as ours   have left us this our spirit and strength intire   strongly to suffer and support our pains   that we may so suffice his vengeful ire   or do him mightier service as his thralls   by right of warr what ere his business be   here in the heart of hell to work in fire   or do his errands in the gloomy deep   what can it then avail though yet we feel   strength undiminisht or eternal being   to undergo eternal punishment   whereto with speedy words th archfiend replyd      falln cherube to be weak is miserable   doing or suffering but of this be sure   to do ought good never will be our task   but ever to do ill our sole delight   as being the contrary to his high will   whom we resist  if then his providence   out of our evil seek to bring forth good   our labour must be to pervert that end   and out of good still to find means of evil   which oft times may succeed so as perhaps   shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb   his inmost counsels from their destind aim   but see the angry victor hath recalld   his ministers of vengeance and pursuit   back to the gates of heavn the sulphurous hail   shot after us in storm oreblown hath laid   the fiery surge that from the precipice   of heavn receivd us falling and the thunder   wingd with red lightning and impetuous rage   perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now   to bellow through the vast and boundless deep   let us not slip th occasion whether scorn   or satiate fury yield it from our foe   seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wilde   the seat of desolation voyd of light   save what the glimmering of these livid flames   casts pale and dreadful  thither let us tend   from off the tossing of these fiery waves   there rest if any rest can harbour there   and reassembling our afflicted powers   consult how we may henceforth most offend   our enemy our own loss how repair   how overcome this dire calamity   what reinforcement we may gain from hope   if not what resolution from despare      thus satan talking to his neerest mate   with head uplift above the wave and eyes   that sparkling blazd his other parts besides   prone on the flood extended long and large   lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge   as whom the fables name of monstrous size   titanian or earthborn that warrd on jove   briarios or typhon whom the den   by ancient tarsus held or that seabeast   leviathan which god of all his works   created hugest that swim th ocean stream   him haply slumbring on the norway foam   the pilot of some small nightfounderd skiff   deeming some island oft as seamen tell   with fixed anchor in his skaly rind   moors by his side under the lee while night   invests the sea and wished morn delayes   so stretcht out huge in length the archfiend lay   chaind on the burning lake nor ever thence   had risn or heavd his head but that the will   and high permission of allruling heaven   left him at large to his own dark designs   that with reiterated crimes he might   heap on himself damnation while he sought   evil to others and enragd might see   how all his malice servd but to bring forth   infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn   on man by him seduct but on himself   treble confusion wrath and vengeance pourd   forthwith upright he rears from off the pool   his mighty stature on each hand the flames   drivn backward slope their pointing spires  rowld   in billows leave ith midst a horrid vale   then with expanded wings he stears his flight   aloft incumbent on the dusky air   that felt unusual weight till on dry land   he lights if it were land that ever burnd   with solid as the lake with liquid fire   and such appeard in hue as when the force   of subterranean wind transports a hill   torn from pelorus or the shatterd side   of thundring aetna whose combustible   and feweld entrals thence conceiving fire   sublimd with mineral fury aid the winds   and leave a singed bottom all involvd   with stench and smoak such resting found the sole   of unblest feet  him followed his next mate   both glorying to have scapt the stygian flood   as gods and by their own recoverd strength   not by the sufferance of supernal power      is this the region this the soil the clime   said then the lost arch angel this the seat   that we must change for heavn this mournful gloom   for that celestial light  be it so since hee   who now is sovran can dispose and bid   what shall be right fardest from him is best   whom reason hath equald force hath made supream   above his equals  farewel happy fields   where joy for ever dwells hail horrours hail   infernal world and thou profoundest hell   receive thy new possessor one who brings   a mind not to be changd by place or time   the mind is its own place and in it self   can make a heavn of hell a hell of heavn   what matter where if i be still the same   and what i should be all but less then hee   whom thunder hath made greater  here at least   we shall be free th almighty hath not built   here for his envy will not drive us hence   here we may reign secure and in my choyce   to reign is worth ambition though in hell   better to reign in hell then serve in heavn   but wherefore let we then our faithful friends   th associates and copartners of our loss   lye thus astonisht on th oblivious pool   and call them not to share with us their part   in this unhappy mansion or once more   with rallied arms to try what may be yet   regaind in heavn or what more lost in hell      so satan spake and him beelzebub   thus answerd  leader of those armies bright   which but th omnipotent none could have foyld   if once they hear that voyce their liveliest pledge   of hope in fears and dangers heard so oft   in worst extreams and on the perilous edge   of battel when it ragd in all assaults   their surest signal they will soon resume   new courage and revive though now they lye   groveling and prostrate on yon lake of fire   as we erewhile astounded and amazd   no wonder falln such a pernicious highth      he scarce had ceast when the superiour fiend   was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield   ethereal temper massy large and round   behind him cast the broad circumference   hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb   through optic glass the tuscan artist views   at evning from the top of fesole   or in valdarno to descry new lands   rivers or mountains in her spotty globe   his spear to equal which the tallest pine   hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast   of some great ammiral were but a wand   he walkt with to support uneasie steps   over the burning marle not like those steps   on heavens azure and the torrid clime   smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire   nathless he so endurd till on the beach   of that inflamed sea he stood and calld   his legions angel forms who lay intranst   thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks   in vallombrosa where th etrurian shades   high overarcht imbowr or scatterd sedge   afloat when with fierce winds orion armd   hath vext the redsea coast whose waves orethrew   busiris and his memphian chivalrie   vvhile with perfidious hatred they pursud   the sojourners of goshen who beheld   from the safe shore their floating carkases   and broken chariot wheels so thick bestrown   abject and lost lay these covering the flood   under amazement of their hideous change   he calld so loud that all the hollow deep   of hell resounded  princes potentates   warriers the flowr of heavn once yours now lost   if such astonishment as this can sieze   eternal spirits or have ye chosn this place   after the toyl of battel to repose   your wearied vertue for the ease you find   to slumber here as in the vales of heavn   or in this abject posture have ye sworn   to adore the conquerour who now beholds   cherube and seraph rowling in the flood   with scatterd arms and ensigns till anon   his swift pursuers from heavn gates discern   th advantage and descending tread us down   thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts   transfix us to the bottom of this gulfe   awake arise or be for ever falln      they heard and were abasht and up they sprung   upon the wing as when men wont to watch   on duty sleeping found by whom they dread   rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake   nor did they not perceave the evil plight   in which they were or the fierce pains not feel   yet to their generals voyce they soon obeyd   innumerable  as when the potent rod   of amrams son in egypts evill day   wavd round the coast up calld a pitchy cloud   of locusts warping on the eastern wind   that ore the realm of impious pharoah hung   like night and darkend all the land of nile   so numberless were those bad angels seen   hovering on wing under the cope of hell   twixt upper nether and surrounding fires   till as a signal givn th uplifted spear   of their great sultan waving to direct   thir course in even ballance down they light   on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain   a multitude like which the populous north   pourd never from her frozen loyns to pass   rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons   came like a deluge on the south and spread   beneath gibraltar to the lybian sands   forthwith from every squadron and each band   the heads and leaders thither hast where stood   their great commander godlike shapes and forms   excelling human princely dignities   and powers that earst in heaven sat on

till wandring ore the earth   through gods high sufferance for the tryal of man   by falsities and lyes the greatest part   of mankind they corrupted to forsake   god their creator and th invisible   glory of him that made them to transform   oft to the image of a brute adornd   with gay religions full of pomp and gold   and devils to adore for deities   then were they known to men by various names   and various idols through the heathen world   say muse their names then known who first who last   rousd from the slumber on that fiery couch   at thir great emperors call as next in worth

uxorious king whose heart though large   beguild by fair idolatresses fell   to idols foul  thammuz came next behind   whose annual wound in lebanon allurd   the syrian damsels to lament his fate   in amorous dittyes all a summers day   while smooth adonis from his native rock   ran purple to the sea supposd with blood   of thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale   infected sions daughters with like

mute   thrice he assayd and thrice in spite of scorn   tears such as angels weep burst forth at last   words interwove with sighs found out their way      o myriads of immortal spirits o powers   matchless but with th almighty and that strife   was not inglorious though th event was dire   as this place testifies and this dire change   hateful to utter but what power of mind   foreseeing or presaging from the depth   of knowledge past or present could have feard   how such united force of gods how such   as stood like these could ever know repulse   for who can yet beleeve though after

different or danger shund   by me have lost our hopes  but he who reigns   monarch in heavn till then as one secure   sat on his throne upheld by old repute   consent or custome and his regal state   put forth at full but still his strength conceald   which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall   henceforth his might we know and know our own   so as not either to provoke or dread   new warr provokt our better part remains   to work in close design by fraud or guile   what force effected not that he no less   at length from us may find who overcomes   by force hath overcome but half his foe   space may produce new worlds whereof so rife   there went a fame in heavn that he ere long   intended to create and therein plant   a generation whom his choice regard   should favour equal to

his words outflew   millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs   of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze   far round illumind hell highly they ragd   against the highest and fierce with grasped arms   clashd on their sounding shields the din of war   hurling defiance toward the vault of heavn      there stood a hill not far whose griesly top   belchd fire and rowling smoak the rest entire   shon

ransackd the center and with impious hands   rifld the bowels of thir mother earth   for treasures better hid  soon had his crew   opnd into the hill a spacious wound   and digd out ribs of gold  let none admire   that riches grow in hell that soyle may best   deserve the pretious bane  and here let those   who boast in mortal things and wondring tell   of babel and the works of memphian kings   learn how thir greatest monuments of fame   and strength and art are easily outdone   by spirits reprobate and in an hour   what in an age they with incessant toyle   and hands innumerable scarce perform   nigh on the plain in many cells prepard   that underneath had veins of liquid fire   slucd from the lake a second multitude   with wondrous art founded the massie ore   severing each kinde

ore the chrystal battlements from morn   to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve   a summers day and with the setting sun   dropt from the zenith like a falling star   on lemnos th aegaean ile thus they relate   erring for he with this rebellious rout   fell long before nor aught availd him now   to have built in heavn high towrs nor did he scape   by all his engins but was headlong sent   with his industrious crew to build in hell   mean while the winged haralds by command   of sovran power with awful ceremony   and trumpets sound throughout the host proclaim   a solemn councel forthwith to be

amidst the hall   of that infernal court  but far within   and in thir own dimensions like themselves   the great seraphic lords and cherubim   in close recess and secret conclave sat   a thousand demygods on golden seats   frequent and full  after short silence then   and summons read the great consult began        the end of the first book     paradise lost    book ii    high on a throne of

bad eminence and from despair   thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires   beyond thus high insatiate to pursue   vain warr with heavn and by success untaught   his proud imaginations thus displaid      powers and dominions deities of heavn   for since no deep within her gulf can hold   immortal vigor though opprest and falln   i give not heavn for lost  from this descent   celestial vertues rising will appear   more glorious and more dread then from no fall   and trust themselves to fear no second fate   mee though just right and the fixt laws of heavn   did first create your leader next free choice   with what besides in counsel or in fight   hath bin achievd of merit yet this loss   thus farr at least recoverd hath much more   establisht in a safe unenvied throne   yeilded with full consent  the happier state   in heavn which follows dignity might draw   envy from each inferior but who here   will envy whom the highest place exposes   formost to stand against the thunderers aime   your bulwark and condemns to greatest share   of endless pain where there is then no good   for which to strive no strife can grow up there   from faction for none sure will claim in hell   precedence none whose portion is so small   of present pain that with ambitious mind   will covet more  with this advantage then   to union and firm faith and firm accord   more then can be in heavn we now return   to claim our just inheritance of old   surer to prosper then prosperity   could have assurd us and by what best way   whether of open warr or covert guile   we now debate who can advise may speak      he ceasd and next him moloc scepterd king   stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit   that fought in heavn now fiercer by despair   his trust was with th eternal to be deemd   equal in strength and rather then be less   card not to be at all with that care lost   went all his fear of god or hell or worse   he reckd not and these words thereafter spake      my sentence is for open warr of wiles   more unexpert i boast not them let those   contrive who need or when they need not now   for while they sit contriving shall the rest   millions that stand in arms and longing wait   the signal to ascend sit lingring here   heavns fugitives and for thir dwelling place   accept this dark opprobrious den of shame   the prison of his tyranny who reigns   by our delay no let us rather choose   armd with hell flames and fury all at once   ore heavns high towrs to force resistless way   turning our tortures into horrid arms   against the torturer when to meet the noise   of his almighty engin he shall hear   infernal thunder and for lightning see   black fire and horror shot with equal rage   among his angels and his throne it self   mixt with tartarean sulphur and strange fire   his own invented torments  but perhaps   the way seems difficult and steep to scale   with upright wing against a higher foe   let such bethink them if the sleepy drench   of that forgetful lake benumme not still   that in our proper motion we ascend   up to our native seat descent and fall   to us is adverse  who but felt of late   when the fierce foe hung on our brokn rear   insulting and pursud us through the deep   with what compulsion and laborious flight   we sunk thus low  th ascent is easie then   th event is feard should we again provoke   our stronger some worse way his wrath may find   to our destruction if there be in hell   fear to be worse destroyd what can be worse   then to dwell here drivn out from bliss condemnd   in this abhorred deep to utter woe   where pain of unextinguishable fire   must exercise us without hope of end   the vassals of his anger when the scourge   inexorably and the torturing houre   calls us to penance  more destroyd then thus   we should be quite abolisht and expire   what fear we then what doubt we to incense   his utmost ire which to the highth enragd   will either quite consume us and reduce   to nothing this essential happier farr   then miserable to have eternal being   or if our substance be indeed divine   and cannot cease to be we are at worst   on this side nothing and by proof we feel   our power sufficient to disturb his heavn   and with perpetual inrodes to allarme   though inaccessible his fatal throne   which if not victory is yet revenge      he ended frowning and his look denouncd   desperate revenge and battel dangerous   to less then gods  on th other side up rose   belial in act more graceful and humane   a fairer person lost not heavn he seemd   for dignity composd and high exploit   but all was false and hollow though his tongue   dropt manna and could make the worse appear   the better reason to perplex and dash   maturest counsels for his thoughts were low   to vice industrious but to nobler deeds   timorous and slothful yet he pleasd the eare   and with perswasive accent thus began      i should be much for open warr o peers   as not behind in hate if what was urgd   main reason to perswade immediate warr   did not disswade me most and seem to cast   ominous conjecture on the whole success   when he who most excels in fact of arms   in what he counsels and in what excels   mistrustful grounds his courage on despair   and utter dissolution as the scope   of all his aim after some dire revenge   first what revenge the towrs of heavn are filld   with armed watch that render all access   impregnable oft on the bordering deep   encamp thir legions or with obscure wing   scout farr and wide into the realm of night   scorning surprize  or could we break our way   by force and at our heels all hell should rise   with blackest insurrection to confound   heavns purest light yet our great enemie   all incorruptible would on his throne   sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould   incapable of stain would soon expel   her mischief and purge off the baser fire   victorious  thus repulsd our final hope   is flat despair we must exasperate   th almighty victor to spend all his rage   and that must end us that must be our cure   to be no more sad cure for who would loose   though full of pain this intellectual being   those thoughts that wander through eternity   to perish rather swallowd up and lost   in the wide womb of uncreated night   devoid of sense and motion and who knows   let this be good whether our angry foe   can give it or will ever how he can   is doubtful that he never will is sure   will he so wise let loose at once his ire   belike through impotence or unaware   to give his enemies thir wish and end   them in his anger whom his anger saves   to punish endless wherefore cease we then   say they who counsel warr we are decreed   reservd and destind to eternal woe   whatever doing what can we suffer more   what can we suffer worse is this then worst   thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms   what when we fled amain pursud and strook   with heavns afflicting thunder and besought   the deep to shelter us this hell then seemd   a refuge from those wounds or when we lay   chaind on the burning lake that sure was worse   what if the breath that kindld those grim fires   awakd should blow them into sevenfold rage   and plunge us in the flames or from above   should intermitted vengeance arme again   his red right hand to plague us what if all   her stores were opnd and this firmament   of hell should spout her cataracts of fire   impendent horrors threatning hideous fall   one day upon our heads while we perhaps   designing or exhorting glorious warr   caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurld   each on his rock transfixt the sport and prey   of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk   under yon boyling ocean wrapt in chains   there to converse with everlasting groans   unrespited unpitied unrepreevd   ages of hopeless end this would be worse   warr therefore open or conceald alike   my voice disswades for what can force or guile   with him or who deceive his mind whose eye   views all things at one view he from heavns highth   all these our motions vain sees and derides   not more almighty to resist our might   then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles   shall we then live thus vile the race of heavn   thus trampld thus expelld to suffer here   chains  these torments better these then worse   by my advice since fate inevitable   subdues us and omnipotent decree   the victors will  to suffer as to doe   our strength is equal nor the law unjust   that so ordains this was at first resolvd   if we were wise against so great a foe   contending and so doubtful what might fall   i laugh when those who at the spear are bold   and ventrous if that fail them shrink and fear   what yet they know must follow to endure   exile or ignominy or bonds or pain   the sentence of thir conquerour this is now   our doom which if we can sustain and bear   our supream foe in time may much remit   his anger and perhaps thus farr removd   not mind us not offending satisfid   with what is punisht whence these raging fires   will slackn if his breath stir not thir flames   our purer essence then will overcome   thir noxious vapour or enurd not feel   or changd at length and to the place conformd   in temper and in nature will receive   familiar the fierce heat and void of pain   this horror will grow milde this darkness light   besides what hope the neverending flight   of future days may bring what chance what change   worth waiting since our present lot appeers   for happy though but ill for ill not worst   if we procure not to our selves more woe      thus belial with words cloathd in reasons garb   counseld ignoble ease and peaceful sloath   not peace and after him thus mammon spake      either to disinthrone the king of heavn   we warr if warr be best or to regain   our own right lost him to unthrone we then   may hope when everlasting fate shall yeild   to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife   the former vain to hope argues as vain   the latter for what place can be for us   within heavns bound unless heavns lord supream   we overpower  suppose he should relent   and publish grace to all on promise made   of new subjection with what eyes could we   stand in his presence humble and receive   strict laws imposd to celebrate his throne   with warbld hymns and to his godhead sing   forct halleluiahs while he lordly sits   our envied sovran and his altar breathes   ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers   our servile offerings  this must be our task   in heavn this our delight how wearisom   eternity so spent in worship paid   to whom we hate  let us not then pursue   by force impossible by leave obtaind   unacceptable though in heavn our state   of splendid vassalage but rather seek   our own good from our selves and from our own   live to our selves though in this vast recess   free and to none accountable preferring   hard liberty before the easie yoke   of servile pomp  our greatness will appear   then most conspicuous when great things of small   useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse   we can create and in what place so ere   thrive under evil and work ease out of pain   through labour and endurance  this deep world   of darkness do we dread  how oft amidst   thick clouds and dark doth heavns allruling sire   choose to reside his glory unobscurd   and with the majesty of darkness round   covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar   mustring thir rage and heavn resembles hell   as he our darkness cannot we his light   imitate when we please  this desart soile   wants not her hidden lustre gemms and gold   nor want we skill or art from whence to raise   magnificence and what can heavn shew more   our torments also may in length of time   become our elements these piercing fires   as soft as now severe our temper changd   into their temper which must needs remove   the sensible of pain  all things invite   to peaceful counsels and the settld state   of order how in safety best we may   compose our present evils with regard   of what we are and where dismissing quite   all thoughts of warr ye have what i advise      he scarce had finisht when such murmur filld   th assembly as when hollow rocks retain   the sound of blustring winds which all night long   had rousd the sea now with hoarse cadence lull   seafaring men orewatcht whose bark by chance   or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay   after the tempest such applause was heard   as mammon ended and his sentence pleasd   advising peace for such another field   they dreaded worse then hell so much the fear   of thunder and the sword of michael   wrought still within them and no less desire   to found this nether empire which might rise   by pollicy and long process of time   in emulation opposite to heavn   which when beelzebub perceivd then whom   satan except none higher sat with grave   aspect he rose and in his rising seemd   a pillar of state deep on his front engraven   deliberation sat and publick care   and princely counsel in his face yet shon   majestick though in ruin sage he stood   with atlantean shoulders fit to bear   the weight of mightiest monarchies his look   drew audience and attention still as night   or summers noontide air while thus he spake      thrones and imperial powers offspring of heavn   ethereal vertues or these titles now   must we renounce and changing stile be calld   princes of hell for so the popular vote   inclines here to continue and build up here   a growing empire doubtless while we dream   and know not that the king of heavn hath doomd   this place our dungeon not our safe retreat   beyond his potent arm to live exempt   from heavns high jurisdiction in new league   banded against his throne but to remaine   in strictest bondage though thus far removd   under th inevitable curb reservd   his captive multitude for he be sure   in highth or depth still first and last will reign   sole king and of his kingdom loose no part   by our revolt but over hell extend   his empire and with iron scepter rule   us here as with his golden those in heavn   what sit we then projecting peace and warr   warr hath determind us and foild with loss   irreparable tearms of peace yet none   voutsaft or sought for what peace will be givn   to us enslavd but custody severe   and stripes and arbitrary punishment   inflicted and what peace can we return   but to our power hostility and hate   untamd reluctance and revenge though slow   yet ever plotting how the conquerour least   may reap his conquest and may least rejoyce   in doing what we most in suffering feel   nor will occasion want nor shall we need   with dangerous expedition to invade   heavn whose high walls fear no assault or siege   or ambush from the deep  what if we find   some easier enterprize  there is a place   if ancient and prophetic fame in heavn   err not another world the happy seat   of som new race calld man about this time   to be created like to us though less   in power and excellence but favourd more   of him who rules above so was his will   pronouncd among the gods and by an oath   that shook heavns whol circumference confirmd   thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn   what creatures there inhabit of what mould   or substance how endud and what thir power   and where thir weakness how attempted best   by force or suttlety though heavn be shut   and heavns high arbitrator sit secure   in his own strength this place may lye exposd   the utmost border of his kingdom left   to their defence who hold it here perhaps   som advantagious act may be achievd   by sudden onset either with hell fire   to waste his whole creation or possess   all as our own and drive as we were driven   the punie habitants or if not drive   seduce them to our party that thir god   may prove thir foe and with repenting hand   abolish his own works  this would surpass   common revenge and interrupt his joy   in our confusion and our joy upraise   in his disturbance when his darling sons   hurld headlong to partake with us shall curse   thir frail originals and faded bliss   faded so soon  advise if this be worth   attempting or to sit in darkness here   hatching vain empires  thus beelzebub   pleaded his devilish counsel first devisd   by satan and in part proposd for whence   but from the author of all ill could spring   so deep a malice to confound the race   of mankind in one root and earth with hell   to mingle and involve done all to spite   the great creatour  but thir spite still serves   his glory to augment  the bold design   pleasd highly those infernal states and joy   sparkld in all thir eyes with full assent   they vote whereat his speech he thus renews      well have ye judgd well ended long debate   synod of gods and like to what ye are   great things resolvd which from the lowest deep   will once more lift us up in spight of fate   neerer our ancient seat perhaps in view   of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms   and opportune excursion we may chance   reenter heavn or else in some milde zone   dwell not unvisited of heavns fair light   secure and at the brightning orient beam   purge off this gloom the soft delicious air   to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires   shall breath her balme  but first whom shall we send   in search of this new world whom shall we find   sufficient who shall tempt with wandring feet   the dark unbottomd infinite abyss   and through the palpable obscure find out   his uncouth way or spread his aerie flight   upborn with indefatigable wings   over the vast abrupt ere he arrive   the happy ile what strength what art can then   suffice or what evasion bear him safe   through the strict senteries and stations thick   of angels watching round  here he had need   all circumspection and we now no less   choice in our suffrage for on whom we send   the weight of all and our last hope relies      this said he sat and expectation held   his look suspence awaiting who appeerd   to second or oppose or undertake   the perilous attempt but all sat mute   pondering the danger with deep thoughts  each   in others countnance red his own dismay   astonisht none among the choice and prime   of those heavnwarring champions could be found   so hardie as to proffer or accept   alone the dreadful voyage till at last   satan whom now transcendent glory raisd   above his fellows with monarchal pride   conscious of highest worth unmovd thus spake      o progeny of heavn empyreal thrones   with reason hath deep silence and demurr   seisd us though undismaid long is the way   and hard that out of hell leads up to light   our prison strong this huge convex of fire   outrageous to devour immures us round   ninefold and gates of burning adamant   barrd over us prohibit all egress   these past if any pass the void profound   of unessential night receives him next   wide gaping and with utter loss of being   threatens him plungd in that abortive gulf   if thence he scape into what ever world   or unknown region what remains him less   then unknown dangers and as hard escape   but i should ill become this throne o peers   and this imperial sovranty adornd   with splendor armd with power if aught proposd   and judgd of public moment in the shape   of difficulty or danger could deterre   me from attempting  wherefore do i assume   these royalties and not refuse to reign   refusing to accept as great a share   of hazard as of honour due alike   to him who reigns and so much to him due   of hazard more as he above the rest   high honourd sits  go therfore mighty powers   terror of heavn though falln intend at home   while here shall be our home what best may ease   the present misery and render hell   more tollerable if there be cure or charm   to respite or deceive or slack the pain   of this ill mansion intermit no watch   against a wakeful foe while i abroad   through all the coasts of dark destruction seek   deliverance for us all this enterprize   none shall partake with me  thus saying rose   the monarch and prevented all reply   prudent least from his resolution raisd   others among the chief might offer now   certain to be refusd what erst they feard   and so refusd might in opinion stand   his rivals winning cheap the high repute   which he through hazard huge must earn  but they   dreaded not more th adventure then his voice   forbidding and at once with him they rose   thir rising all at once was as the sound   of thunder heard remote  towards him they bend   with awful reverence prone and as a god   extoll him equal to the highest in heavn

breaks his fealtie and sinns   against the high supremacie of heavn   affecting godhead and so loosing all   to expiate his treason hath naught left   but to destruction sacred and devote   he with

his travelld steps farr distant hee descries   ascending by degrees magnificent   up to the wall of heaven a structure high   at top whereof but farr more rich appeerd   the work as of a kingly palace gate   with frontispice of diamond and gold   imbellisht thick with sparkling orient gemmes   the portal shon inimitable on earth   by model or by shading pencil drawn   the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw   angels ascending and descending bands   of guardians bright when he from esau fled   to padanaram in the field of luz   dreaming by night under the open skie   and waking crid this is the gate of heavn   each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood   there alwaies but drawn up to heavn somtimes   viewless and underneath a bright sea flowd   of jasper or of liquid pearle whereon   who after came from earth sayling arrivd   wafted by angels or flew ore the lake   rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds   the stairs were then let down whether to dare   the fiend by easie ascent

canopie   of nights extended shade from eastern point   of libra to the fleecie starr that bears   andromeda farr off atlantick seas   beyond th horizon then from pole to pole   he views in bredth and without longer pause   down right into the worlds first region throws   his flight precipitant and windes with ease   through the pure marble air his oblique way   amongst innumerable starrs that shon   stars distant but nigh hand seemd other worlds   or other worlds they seemd or happy iles   like those hesperian gardens famd of old   fortunate fields and groves and flourie vales   thrice happy

i saw when at his word the formless mass   this worlds material mould came to a heap   confusion heard his voice and wilde uproar   stood ruld stood vast infinitude confind   till at his second

none neglects   took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath   down from th ecliptic sped with hopd success   throws his steep flight with many an aerie wheele   nor staid till on niphates top he

one step no more then from himself can fly   by change of place now conscience wakes despair   that slumberd wakes the bitter memorie   of what he was what is and what must be   worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue   sometimes towards eden which now in his view   lay pleasant his grievd look he fixes sad   sometimes towards heavn and the fullblazing sun   which now sat high in his meridian towre   then much revolving thus in sighs began      o thou that with surpassing glory crownd   lookst from thy sole dominion like the god   of this new world at whose sight all the starrs   hide thir diminisht heads to thee i call   but with no friendly voice and add thy name   o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams   that bring to my remembrance from what state   i fell how glorious once above thy spheare   till pride and worse ambition threw me down   warring in heavn against heavns matchless king   ah wherefore he deservd no such return   from me whom he created what i was   in that bright eminence and with his good   upbraided none nor was his service hard   what could be less then to afford him praise   the easiest recompence and pay him thanks   how due yet all his good provd ill in me   and wrought but malice lifted up so high   i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher   would set me highest and in a moment quit   the debt immense of endless gratitude   so

then   o had his powerful destiny ordaind   me some inferiour angel i had stood   then happie no unbounded hope had raisd   ambition  yet why not som other power   as great might have aspird and me

none left but by submission and that word   disdain forbids me and my dread of shame   among the spirits beneath whom i seducd   with other promises and other vaunts   then to submit boasting i could subdue   th omnipotent  ay me they little know   how dearly i abide that boast so vaine   under what torments inwardly i groane   while they adore me on the throne of hell   with diadem and scepter

higher then that wall a circling row   of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit   blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue   appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt   on which the sun more glad

 vernal delight and joy able to drive   all sadness but despair now gentle gales   fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense   native perfumes and whisper whence they stole   those balmie spoiles  as

hasting this way and now by glimps discerne   ithuriel and zephon through the shade   and with them comes a third of regal port   but faded splendor wan who by his gate   and fierce demeanour seems

found   how busied in what form and posture coucht      to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake   why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribd   to thy transgressions and disturbd the charge   of others who approve not to transgress   by thy example but have power and right   to question thy bold entrance on this place   imploid it seems to violate sleep and those   whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss      to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow   gabriel thou hadst in heavn th esteem of wise   and such i held thee but this question askt   puts me in doubt  lives ther who loves his pain   who would not finding way break loose from hell   though thither doomd  thou wouldst thy self no doubt   and boldly venture to whatever place   farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change   torment with ease  soonest recompence   dole with delight which in this place i sought   to thee no reason who knowst only good   but evil hast not trid and wilt object   his will who bound us let him surer barr   his iron gates if he intends our stay   in that dark durance thus much what was askt   the rest is true they found me where they say   but that implies not violence or harme      thus hee in scorn  the warlike angel movd   disdainfully half smiling thus replid   o loss of one in heavn to judge of wise   since satan fell whom follie overthrew   and now returns him from his prison scapt   gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise   or not who ask what boldness brought him hither   unlicenct from his bounds in hell prescribd   so wise he judges it to fly from pain   however and to scape his punishment   so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth   which thou incurrst by flying meet thy flight   seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell   which taught thee yet no better that no pain   can equal anger infinite provokt   but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee   came not all hell broke loose is pain to them   less pain less to be fled or thou then they   less hardie to endure courageous chief   the first in flight from pain hadst thou allegd   to thy deserted host this cause of flight   thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive      to

cheek   as through unquiet rest he on his side   leaning halfraisd with looks of cordial love   hung over her enamourd and beheld   beautie which whether waking or asleep   shot forth peculiar graces

repose   my glorie my perfection glad i see   thy face and morn returnd for i this night   such night till this i never passd have dreamd   if dreamd not as i oft am wont of thee   works of day passt or morrows next designe   but of offence and trouble which my mind   knew never till this irksom night methought   close at mine ear one calld me forth to walk   with gentle voice i thought it thine it said   why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time   the cool the silent save where silence yields   to the nightwarbling bird that now awake   tunes sweetest his lovelabord song now reignes   full orbd the moon and with more pleasing light   shadowie sets off the face of things in vain   if none regard heavn wakes with all his eyes   whom to behold but thee natures desire   in whose sight all things joy with ravishment   attracted by thy beauty still to gaze   i rose as at thy call but found thee not   to find thee i directed then my walk   and on methought alone i passd through ways   that brought me on a sudden to the tree   of interdicted knowledge fair it seemd   much fairer to my fancie then by day   and as i wondring lookt beside it stood   one shapd  wingd like one of those from heavn   by us oft seen his dewie locks distilld   ambrosia on that tree he also gazd   and o fair plant said he with fruit surchargd   deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet   nor god nor man is knowledge so despisd   or envie or what reserve forbids to taste   forbid who will none shall from me withhold   longer thy offerd good why else set here   this said he pausd not but with ventrous arme   he pluckt he tasted mee damp horror child   at such bold words voucht with a deed so bold   but he thus overjoyd o fruit divine   sweet of thy self but much more sweet thus cropt   forbiddn here it seems as onely fit   for gods yet able to make gods of men   and why not gods of men since good the more   communicated more abundant growes   the author not impaird but honourd more

my mouth of that same fruit held part   which he had pluckt the pleasant savourie smell   so quicknd appetite that i methought   could not but taste  forthwith up to the clouds   with him i flew and underneath beheld   the earth outstretcht immense a prospect wide   and various wondring at my flight and change   to this high exaltation suddenly   my guide was gon and i me thought sunk down   and fell asleep but o how glad i wakd   to find this but a dream  thus eve her night   related and thus adam answerd sad      best image of my self and dearer half   the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep   affects me equally nor can i like   this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear   yet evil whence in thee can harbour none   created pure  but know that in the soule   are many lesser faculties that serve   reason as chief among these fansie next   her office holds of all external things   which the five watchful senses represent   she forms imaginations aerie shapes   which reason joyning or disjoyning frames   all what we affirm or what deny and call   our knowledge or opinion then retires   into her private cell when nature rests   oft in her absence mimic fansie wakes   to imitate her but misjoyning shapes   wilde work produces oft and most in dreams   ill matching words and deeds long past or late   som such resemblances methinks i find   of our last eevnings talk in this thy dream   but with addition strange yet be not sad   evil into the mind of god or man   may come and go so unapprovd and leave   no spot or blame behind which gives me hope   that what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream   waking thou never wilt consent to do   be not disheartnd then nor cloud those looks   that wont to be more chearful and serene   then when fair morning first smiles on the world   and let us to our fresh imployments rise   among the groves the fountains and the flours   that open now thir choicest bosomd smells   reservd from night and kept for thee in store      so

messiah was declard in sight of heavn   the mountain of the congregation calld   for thither he assembld all his train   pretending so commanded to consult   about the great reception of thir king

seemd   at first that angel should with angel warr   and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet   so oft in festivals of joy and love   unanimous as sons of one great sire   hymning th eternal father but the shout   of battel now began and rushing sound   of onset ended soon each milder thought   high in the midst exalted as a god   th apostat in his sunbright chariot sate   idol of majestie

thirst excites   proceeded thus to ask his heavnly guest      great things and full of wonder in our eares   farr differing from this world thou hast reveald   divine interpreter by favour sent   down from the empyrean to forewarne   us timely of what might else have bin our loss   unknown which human knowledg could not reach   for which to the infinitly good we owe   immortal thanks and his

thought which yet concernd   our knowing as to highest wisdom seemd   deign to descend now lower and relate   what may no less perhaps availe us known   how first began this heavn which we behold   distant so high with moving fires adornd   innumerable and this which yeelds or fills   all space the ambient aire wide interfusd   imbracing round this florid earth what cause   movd the creator in

    and thus the godlike angel answerd milde   this also thy request with caution askt   obtaine though to recount almightie works   what words or tongue of seraph can suffice   or heart of man

father calld by thee i come thy guide   to the garden of bliss thy seat prepard   so saying by the hand he took me raisd   and over fields and waters as in aire   smooth sliding without step last led me up   a woodie mountain whose high top was plaine   a circuit wide enclosd with goodliest trees   planted with walks and bowers that what i saw   of earth before scarse pleasant seemd  each tree   loadn with fairest fruit that hung to the eye   tempting stirrd in me sudden appetite   to pluck and eate whereat i wakd and found   before mine eyes all real as the dream   had lively shadowd here had new begun   my wandring had not hee who was my guide   up hither from among the trees appeerd   presence divine  rejoycing but with aw   in adoration at his feet i fell   submiss he reard me  whom thou soughtst i am   said mildely author of all this thou seest   above or round about thee or beneath   this paradise i give thee count it thine   to till and keep and of the fruit to eate   of every tree that in the garden growes   eate freely with glad heart fear here no dearth   but of the tree whose operation brings   knowledg of good and ill which i have set   the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith   amid the garden by the tree of life   remember what i warne thee shun to taste   and shun the bitter consequence for know   the day thou eatst thereof my sole command   transgrest inevitably thou shalt dye   from that day mortal and this happie state   shalt loose expelld from hence into a world   of woe and sorrow  sternly he pronouncd   the rigid interdiction which resounds   yet dreadful in mine eare though in my choice   not to incur but soon his cleer aspect   returnd and gratious purpose thus renewd   not onely these fair bounds but all the earth   to thee and to thy

receave   from thee thir names and pay thee fealtie   with low subjection understand the same   of fish within thir watry residence   not hither summond since they cannot change   thir element to draw the thinner aire   as thus he spake each bird and beast behold   approaching two and two these cowring low   with blandishment each bird stoopd on his wing   i namd them as they passd and understood   thir nature with such knowledg god endud   my sudden apprehension but in these   i found not what me thought i wanted still   and to the heavnly vision thus presumd      o by what name for thou above

for in the wilie snake   whatever sleights none would suspicious mark   as from his wit and native suttletie   proceeding which in other beasts observd   doubt might beget of diabolic powr   active

summd up in man   with what delight could i have walkt thee round   if i could joy in aught sweet interchange   of hill and vallie rivers woods and plaines   now land now sea  shores with forrest crownd   rocks dens and caves but i in none of these   find place or refuge and the more i see   pleasures about me so much more i feel   torment within me as from the hateful siege   of contraries all good to me becomes   bane and in heavn much worse would be my state   but neither here seek i no nor in heavn   to dwell unless by maistring heavns supreame   nor hope to be my self less miserable

sole eve associate sole to me beyond   compare above all living creatures deare   well hast thou motiond wel thy thoughts imployd   how we might best fulfill the work which here   god hath assignd us

labour as to debarr us when we need   refreshment whether food or talk between   food of the mind or this sweet intercourse   of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow   to brute denid and are of love the food   love not the lowest end of human life   for not to irksom toile but to delight   he made us and delight to reason joynd   these paths and bowers doubt not but our joynt   will keep

societie   and short retirement urges sweet returne   but other doubt possesses me least harm   befall thee severd from me for thou knowst   what hath bin warnd us what malicious foe   envying our happiness and of his own   despairing seeks to work us woe and shame   by sly assault and somwhere nigh at hand   watches no doubt with greedy hope to find   his wish and best advantage us asunder   hopeless to circumvent us joynd where each   to other speedie aide might lend at need   whether his first design be to withdraw   our fealtie from god or to disturb   conjugal love then which perhaps no bliss   enjoyd by us excites his envie more   or this or worse leave not the faithful side   that gave thee being stil shades thee and protects   the wife where danger or dishonour lurks   safest and seemliest by her husband staies   who guards her or with her the worst endures      to whom the virgin majestie of eve   as one who loves and some unkindness meets   with sweet austeer composure thus replyd      ofspring of heavn and earth and all earths lord   that such an enemie we have who seeks   our ruin both by thee informd i learne   and from the parting angel overheard   as in a

hear   his violence thou fearst not being such   as wee not capable of death or paine   can either not receave or can repell   his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs   thy equal fear that my firm faith and love   can by his fraud be shakn or seduct   thoughts which how found they harbour in thy brest   adam misthought of her to thee so dear      to whom with healing words adam replyd   daughter of god and man immortal eve   for such thou art from sin and blame entire   not diffident of thee do i dissuade   thy absence from my sight but to avoid   th attempt it self intended by our foe   for hee who tempts though in vain at least asperses   the tempted with dishonour foul supposd   not incorruptible of faith not prooff   against temptation thou thy self with scorne   and anger wouldst resent the offerd wrong   though ineffectual found misdeem not then   if such affront i labour to avert   from thee alone which on us both at once   the enemie though bold will hardly dare   or daring first on mee th assault shall light   nor thou his malice and false guile contemn   suttle he needs must be who could seduce   angels nor think superfluous others aid   i from the influence of thy looks receave   access in every vertue in thy sight   more wise more watchful stronger if need were   of outward strength while shame thou looking on   shame to be overcome or overreacht   would utmost vigor raise and raisd unite   why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel   when i am present and thy trial choose   with me best witness of thy vertue trid      so spake domestick adam in his care   and matrimonial love but eve who thought   less attributed to her faith sincere   thus her reply with accent sweet renewd      if this be our condition thus to dwell   in narrow circuit straitnd by a foe   suttle or violent we not endud   single with like defence wherever met   how are we happie still in fear of harm   but harm precedes not sin onely our foe   tempting affronts us with his foul esteem   of our integritie his foul esteeme   sticks no dishonor on our front but turns   foul on himself then wherfore shund or feard   by us who rather double honour gaine   from his surmise provd false finde peace within   favour from heavn our witness from th event   and what is faith love vertue unassaid   alone without exterior help sustaind   let us not then suspect our happie state   left so imperfet by the maker wise   as not secure to single or combind   fraile is our happiness if this be so   and eden were no eden thus exposd      to whom thus adam fervently replid   o woman best are all things as the will   of god ordaind them his creating hand   nothing imperfet or deficient left   of all that he created much less man   or ought that might his happie state secure   secure from outward force within himself   the danger lies yet lies within his power   against his will he can receave no harme   but god left free the will for what obeyes   reason is free and reason he made right   but bid her well beware and still erect   least by some faire appeering good surprisd   she dictate false and missinforme the will   to do what god expresly hath forbid   not then mistrust but tender love enjoynes   that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me   firm we subsist yet possible to swerve   since reason not impossibly may meet   some specious object by the foe subornd   and fall into deception unaware   not keeping strictest watch as she was warnd   seek not temptation then which to avoide   were better and most likelie if from mee   thou sever not trial will come unsought   wouldst thou approve thy constancie approve   first thy obedience th other who can know   not seeing thee attempted who attest   but if thou think trial unsought may finde   us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst   go for thy stay not free absents thee more   go in thy native innocence relie   on what thou hast of vertue summon all   for god towards thee hath done his part do thine      so spake the patriarch of mankinde but eve   persisted yet submiss though last replid      with thy permission then and thus forewarnd   chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words   touchd onely that our trial when least sought   may finde us both perhaps farr less prepard   the willinger i goe nor much expect   a foe so proud will first the weaker seek   so bent the more

highest agents deemd however wise   queen of this universe doe not believe   those rigid threats of death ye shall not die   how should ye by the fruit it gives you life   to knowledge  by the threatner look on mee   mee who have touchd and tasted yet both live   and life more perfet have attaind then fate   meant mee by ventring higher then my lot   shall that be shut to man which to the beast   is open or will god incense his ire   for such a pretty trespass and not praise   rather your dauntless vertue whom the pain   of death denounct whatever thing death be   deterrd not from atchieving what might leade   to happier life knowledge of good and evil   of good how just of evil if what is evil   be real why not known since easier shunnd   god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just   not just not god not feard then nor obeid   your feare it self of death removes the feare   why then was this forbid  why but to awe   why but to keep ye low and ignorant   his worshippers he knows that in the day   ye eate thereof your eyes that seem so cleere   yet are but dim shall perfetly be then   opnd and cleerd and ye shall be as gods   knowing both good and evil as they know   that ye should be as gods since i as man   internal man is but proportion meet   i of brute human yee of human gods   so ye shalt die perhaps by putting off   human to put on gods death to be wisht   though threatnd which no worse then this can bring   and what are gods that man may not become   as they participating godlike food   the gods are first and that advantage use   on our belief that all from them proceeds   i question it for this fair earth i see   warmd by the sun producing every kind   them nothing if they all things who enclosd   knowledge of good and evil in this tree   that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains   wisdom without their leave and wherein lies   th offence that man should thus attain to know   what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree   impart against his will if all be his   or is it envie and can envie dwell   in heavnly brests these these and many more   causes import your need of this fair fruit   goddess humane reach then and freely taste      he ended and his words replete with guile   into her heart too easie entrance won   fixt on the fruit she gazd which to behold   might tempt alone and in her ears the sound   yet rung of his perswasive words impregnd   with reason to her seeming and with truth   meanwhile the hour of noon drew on and wakd   an eager appetite raisd by the smell   so savorie of that fruit which with desire   inclinable now grown to touch or taste   sollicited her longing eye yet first   pausing a while thus to her self she musd      great are thy vertues doubtless best of fruits   though kept from man  worthy to be admird   whose taste too long forborn at first assay   gave elocution to the mute and taught   the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise   thy praise hee also who forbids thy use   conceales not from us naming thee the tree   of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil   forbids us then to taste but his forbidding   commends thee more while it inferrs the good   by thee communicated and our want   for good unknown sure is not had or had   and yet unknown is as not had at all   in plain then what forbids he but to know   forbids us good forbids us to be wise   such prohibitions binde not  but if death   bind us with afterbands what profits then   our inward freedom  in the day we eate   of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die   how dies the serpent hee hath eatn and lives   and knows and speaks and reasons and discernes   irrational till then  for us alone   was death invented or to us denid   this intellectual food for beasts reservd   for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first   hath tasted envies not but brings with joy   the good befalln him author unsuspect   friendly to man farr from deceit or guile   what fear i then rather what know to feare   under this ignorance of good and evil   of god or death of law or penaltie   here grows the cure of all this fruit divine   fair to the eye inviting to the taste   of vertue to make wise what hinders then   to reach and feed at once both bodie and mind      so saying her rash hand in evil hour   forth reaching to the fruit she pluckd she eat   earth felt the wound and nature from her seat   sighing through all her works gave signs of woe   that all was lost  back to the thicket slunk   the guiltie serpent and well might for eve   intent now wholly on her taste naught else   regarded such delight till then as seemd   in fruit she never tasted whether true   or fansied so through expectation high   of knowledg nor was godhead from her thought   greedily she ingorgd without restraint   and knew not eating death satiate at length   and hightnd as with wine jocond and boon   thus to her self she pleasingly began      o sovran vertuous precious of all trees   in paradise of operation blest   to sapience hitherto obscurd infamd   and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end   created but henceforth my early care   not without song each morning and due praise   shall tend thee and the fertil burden ease   of thy full branches offerd free to all   till dieted by thee i grow mature   in knowledge as the gods who all things know   though others envie what they cannot give   for had the gift bin theirs it had not here   thus grown  experience next to thee i owe   best guide not following thee i had remaind   in ignorance thou opnst wisdoms way   and givst access though secret she retire   and i perhaps am secret heavn is high   high and remote to see from thence distinct   each thing on earth and other care perhaps   may have diverted from continual watch   our great forbidder safe with all his spies   about him  but to adam in what sort   shall i appeer shall i to him make known   as yet my change and give him to partake   full happiness with mee or rather not   but keep the odds of knowledge in my power   without copartner so to add what wants   in femal sex the more to draw his love   and render me more equal and perhaps   a thing not undesireable somtime   superior for inferior who is free   this may be well but what if god have seen   and death ensue then i shall be no more   and adam wedded to another eve   shall live with her enjoying i extinct   a death to think  confirmd then i resolve   adam shall share with me in bliss or woe   so dear i love him that with him all deaths   i could endure without him live no life      so saying from the tree her step she turnd   but first low reverence don as to the power   that dwelt within whose presence had infusd   into the plant sciential sap derivd   from nectar drink of gods  adam the while   waiting desirous her return had wove   of choicest flours a garland to adorne   her tresses and her rural labours crown   as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen   great joy he promisd to his thoughts and new   solace in her return so long delayd   yet oft his heart divine of somthing ill   misgave him hee the faultring measure felt   and forth to meet her went the way she took   that morn when first they parted by the tree   of knowledge he must pass there he her met   scarse from the tree returning in her hand   a bough of fairest fruit that downie smild   new gatherd and ambrosial smell diffusd   to him she hasted in her face excuse   came prologue and apologie to prompt   which with bland words at will she thus addrest      hast thou not wonderd adam at my stay

and make them gods who taste   and hath bin tasted such the serpent wise   or not restraind as wee or not obeying   hath eatn of the fruit and is become   not dead as we are threatnd but thenceforth

amazd   astonied stood and blank while horror chill   ran through his veins and all his joynts relaxd   from his slack hand the garland wreathd for eve   down dropd and all the faded roses shed

both together went   into the thickest wood there soon they chose   the figtree not that kind for fruit renownd   but such as at this day to indians known   in malabar or decan spreds her armes   braunching so broad and long that in the ground   the bended twigs take root and daughters grow   about the mother tree a pillard shade   high overarcht and echoing walks between   there oft the

with swiftest minutes wingd   now was the sun in western cadence low   from noon and gentle aires due at thir hour   to fan the earth now wakd and usher in   the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole   came the mild judge and intercessor both   to sentence man the voice of god they heard   now walking in the garden by soft windes   brought to thir ears while day declind they heard   and from his presence hid themselves among   the thickest trees both man and wife till god   approaching thus to adam calld aloud      where art thou adam wont with joy to meet   my coming seen far off  i miss thee here   not pleasd thus entertaind with solitude   where obvious dutie erewhile appeard unsaught   or come i less conspicuous or what change   absents thee or what chance detains  come forth   he came and with him eve more loth though first   to offend discountnanct both and discomposd   love was not in thir looks either to god   or to each other but apparent guilt   and shame and perturbation and despaire   anger and obstinacie and hate and guile   whence adam faultring long thus answerd brief      i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice   affraid being naked hid my self  to whom   the gracious judge without revile replid      my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feard   but still rejoyct how is it now become   so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who   hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree   whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat      to whom thus adam sore beset replid   o heavn in evil strait this day i stand   before my judge either to undergoe   my self the total crime or to accuse   my other self the partner of my life   whose failing while her faith to me remaines   i should conceal and not expose to blame   by my complaint but strict necessitie   subdues me and calamitous constraint   least on my head both sin and punishment   however insupportable be all   devolvd though should i hold my peace yet thou   wouldst easily detect what i conceale   this woman whom thou madst to be my help   and gavst me as thy perfet gift so good   so fit so acceptable so divine   that from her hand i could suspect no ill   and what she did whatever in it self   her doing seemd to justifie the deed   shee gave me of the tree and i did eate      to whom the sovran presence thus replid   was shee thy god that her thou didst obey   before his voice or was shee made thy guide   superior or but equal that to her   thou didst resigne thy manhood and the place   wherein god set thee above her made of thee   and for thee whose perfection farr excelld   hers in all real dignitie adornd   she was indeed and lovely to attract   thy love not thy subjection and her gifts   were such as under government well seemd   unseemly to beare rule which was thy part   and person hadst thou known thy self aright      so having said he thus to eve in few   say woman what is this which thou hast done      to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmd   confessing soon yet not before her judge   bold or loquacious thus abasht replid      the serpent me beguild and i did eate      which when the lord god heard without delay   to judgement he proceeded on th accusd   serpent though brute unable to transferre   the guilt on him who made him instrument   of mischief and polluted from the end   of his creation justly then accurst   as vitiated in nature more to know   concernd not man since he no further knew   nor alterd his offence yet god at last   to satan first in sin his doom applyd   though in mysterious terms judgd as then best   and on the serpent thus his curse let fall      because thou hast done this thou art accurst   above all cattel each beast of the field   upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe   and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life   between thee and the woman i will put   enmitie and between thine and her seed   her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel      so spake this oracle then verifid   when jesus son of mary second eve   saw satan fall like lightning down from heavn   prince of the aire then rising from his grave   spoild principalities and powers triumpht   in open shew and with ascention bright   captivity led captive through the aire   the realme it self of satan long usurpt   whom he shall tread at last under our feet   eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise   and to the woman thus his sentence turnd      thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie   by thy conception children thou shalt bring   in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will   thine shall submit hee over thee shall rule      on adam last thus judgement he pronouncd   because thou hast hearknd to the voice of thy wife   and eaten of the tree concerning which   i chargd thee saying thou shalt not eate thereof   cursd is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow   shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life   thornes also and thistles it shall bring thee forth   unbid and thou shalt eate th herb of th field   in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread   till thou return unto the ground for thou   out of the ground wast taken know thy birth   for dust thou art and shalt to dust returne       so judgd he man both judge and saviour sent   and th instant stroke of death denounct that day   removd farr off then pittying how they stood   before him naked to the aire that now   must suffer change

thee maker from my clay   to mould me man did i sollicite thee   from darkness to promote me or here place   in this delicious garden as my will   concurd not to my being it were but right   and equal to reduce me to my dust   desirous to resigne and render back   all i receavd unable to performe   thy terms too hard by which i was to hold   the good i sought not  to the loss of that   sufficient penaltie why hast thou added   the sense of endless woes inexplicable   thy justice seems yet to say truth too late   i thus contest then should have been refusd   those terms whatever when they were proposd   thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good   then cavil the conditions and though god   made thee without thy leave what if thy son   prove disobedient and reprovd retort   wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not   wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee   that proud excuse yet him not thy election   but natural necessity begot   god made thee of choice his own and of his own   to serve him thy reward was of his grace   thy punishment then justly is at his will   be it so for i submit his doom is fair   that dust i am and shall to dust returne   o welcom hour whenever why delayes   his hand to execute what his decree   fixd on this day why do i overlive   why am i mockt with death and lengthnd out   to deathless pain how gladly would i meet   mortalitie my sentence and be earth   insensible how glad would lay me down   as in my mothers lap there i should rest   and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more   would thunder in my ears no fear of worse   to mee and to my ofspring would torment me   with cruel expectation  yet one doubt   pursues me still least all i cannot die   least that pure breath of life the spirit of man   which god inspird cannot together perish   with this corporeal clod then in the grave   or in some other dismal place who knows   but i shall die a living death  o thought   horrid if true yet why it was but breath   of life that sinnd what dies but what had life   and sin the bodie properly hath neither   all of me then shall die let this appease   the doubt since humane reach no further knows   for though the lord of all be infinite   is his wrauth also be it man is not so   but mortal doomd  how can he exercise   wrath without end on man whom death must end   can he make deathless death that were to make   strange contradiction which to god himself   impossible is held as argument   of weakness not of power  will he draw out   for angers sake finite to infinite   in punisht man to satisfie his rigour   satisfid never that were to extend   his sentence beyond dust and natures law   by which all causes else according still   to the reception of thir matter act   not to th extent of thir own spheare  but say   that death be not one stroak as i supposd   bereaving sense but endless miserie   from this day onward which i feel begun   both in me and without me and so last   to perpetuitie ay me that fear   comes thundring back with dreadful revolution   on my defensless head both death and i   am found eternal and incorporate both   nor i on my part single in mee all   posteritie stands curst fair patrimonie   that i must leave ye sons o were i able   to waste it all my self and leave ye none   so disinherited how would ye bless   me now your curse  ah why should all mankind   for one mans

stand   in sight of god  him after all disputes   forct i absolve all my evasions vain   and reasonings though through mazes lead me still   but to my own conviction first and last   on mee mee onely as the sourse and spring   of all corruption all the blame lights due   so might the wrauth fond wish couldst thou support   that burden heavier then the earth to bear   then all the world much heavier though divided   with that bad woman  thus what thou desirst   and what thou fearst alike destroyes all hope   of refuge and concludes thee miserable   beyond all past example and future   to satan onely like both crime and doom   o conscience into what abyss of fears   and horrors hast thou drivn me out of which   i find no way from deep to deeper plungd      thus adam to himself lamented

found so erroneous thence by just event   found so unfortunate nevertheless   restord by thee vile as i am to place   of new acceptance hopeful to regaine   thy love the sole contentment of my heart   living or dying from thee i will not hide   what thoughts in my unquiet brest are risn   tending to som relief of our extremes   or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable   as in our evils and of easier choice   if care of our descent perplex us most   which must be born to certain woe devourd   by death at last and miserable it is   to be to others cause of misery   our own begotten and of our loines to bring   into this cursed world a woful race   that after wretched life must be at last   food for so foule a monster in thy power   it lies yet ere conception to prevent   the race unblest to being yet unbegot   childless thou art childless remaine   so death shall be deceavd his glut and with us two   be forcd to satisfie his ravnous maw   but if thou judge it hard and difficult   conversing looking loving to abstain   from loves due rites nuptial embraces sweet   and with desire to languish without hope   before the present object languishing   with like desire which would be miserie   and torment less then none of what we dread   then both our selves and seed at once to free   from what we fear for both let us make short   let us seek death or hee not found supply   with our own hands his office on our selves   why stand we longer shivering under feares   that shew no end but death and have the power   of many wayes to die the shortest choosing   destruction with destruction to destroy      she ended heer or vehement despaire   broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts   had entertaind as did her cheeks with pale   but adam with such counsel nothing swayd   to better hopes his more attentive minde   labouring had raisd and thus to eve replid      eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems   to argue in thee somthing more sublime   and excellent then what thy minde contemnes   but selfdestruction therefore saught refutes   that excellence thought in thee and implies   not thy contempt but anguish and regret   for loss of life and pleasure overlovd   or if thou covet death as utmost end   of miserie so thinking to evade   the penaltie pronounct doubt not but god   hath wiselier armd his vengeful ire then so   to be forestalld much more i fear least death   so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine   we are by doom to pay rather such acts   of contumacie will provoke the highest   to make death in us live then let us seek   som safer resolution which methinks   i have in view calling to minde with heed   part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise   the serpents head piteous amends unless   be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe   satan who in the serpent hath contrivd   against us this deceit to crush his head   would be revenge indeed which will be lost   by death brought on our selves or childless days   resolvd as thou proposest so our foe   shall scape his punishment ordaind and wee   instead shall double ours upon our heads   no more be mentiond then of violence   against our

mild   and gracious temper he both heard and judgd   without wrauth or reviling wee expected   immediate dissolution which we thought   was meant by death that day when lo to thee   pains onely in

wearie him with my assiduous cries   but prayer against his absolute decree   no more availes then breath against the winde   blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth   therefore to his great bidding i submit   this most afflicts me that departing hence   as from his face i shall be hid deprivd   his blessed countnance here i could frequent   with worship place by place where he voutsafd   presence divine and to my sons relate   on this mount he appeerd under this tree   stood visible among these pines his voice   i heard here with him at this fountain talkd   so many grateful altars i would reare   of grassie terfe and pile up every stone   of lustre from the brook in memorie   or monument to ages and thereon   offer sweet smelling gumms  fruits and flours   in yonder nether world where shall i seek   his bright appearances or footstep trace   for though i fled him angrie yet recalld   to life prolongd and promisd race i now   gladly behold though but his utmost skirts   of glory and farr off his steps adore      to whom thus michael with regard benigne   adam thou knowst heavn his and all the earth   not this rock onely his omnipresence fills   land sea and aire and every kinde that lives   fomented by his virtual power and warmd   all th earth he gave thee to possess and rule   no despicable gift surmise not then   his presence to these narrow bounds confind   of paradise or eden this had been   perhaps thy capital seate from whence had spred   all generations and had hither come   from all the ends of th earth to celebrate   and reverence thee thir great progenitor   but this praeeminence thou hast lost brought down   to dwell on eeven ground now with thy sons   yet doubt not but in vallie and in plaine   god is as here and will be found alike   present and of his presence many a signe   still following thee still compassing thee round   with goodness and paternal love his face   express and of his steps the track divine   which that thou mayst beleeve and be confirmd   ere thou from hence depart know i am sent   to shew thee what shall come in future dayes   to thee and to thy ofspring good with bad   expect to hear supernal grace contending   with sinfulness of men thereby to learn   true patience and to temper joy with fear   and pious sorrow equally enurd   by moderation either state to beare   prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead   safest thy life and best prepard endure   thy mortal passage when it comes  ascend   this hill let eve for i have drencht her eyes   here sleep below while thou to foresight wakst   as once thou slepst while shee to life was formd      to whom thus adam gratefully replid   ascend i follow thee safe guide the path   thou leadst me and to the hand of heavn submit   however chastning to the evil turne   my obvious breast arming to overcom   by suffering and earne rest from labour won   if so i may attain  so both ascend   in the visions of god  it was a hill   of paradise the highest from whose top   the hemisphere of earth in cleerest ken   stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay   not higher that hill nor wider looking round   whereon for different cause the tempter set   our second adam in the wilderness   to shew him all earths kingdomes and thir glory   his eye might there command wherever stood   city of old or modern fame the seat   of mightiest empire from the destind walls   of cambalu seat of cathaian can   and samarchand by oxus temirs throne   to paquin of sinaean kings and thence   to agra and lahor of great mogul   down to the golden chersonese or where   the persian in ecbatan sate or since   in hispahan or where the russian ksar   in mosco or the sultan in bizance   turchestanborn nor could his eye not ken   th empire of negus

motezume   and cusco in peru the richer seat   of atabalipa and yet unspoild   guiana whose great citie geryons sons   call el dorado but to nobler sights   michael from adams eyes the filme removd   vvhich that false fruit that promisd clearer sight   had bred then purgd with euphrasie and rue   the visual nerve for he had much to see   and from the vvell of life three drops instilld   so deep the power of these ingredients piercd   eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight   that adam now enforct to close his eyes   sunk down and all his spirits became intranst   but him the gentle angel by the hand   soon raisd and his attention thus recalld      adam now ope thine eyes and first behold   th effects which thy original crime hath wrought   in some to spring from thee who never touchd   th excepted tree nor with the snake conspird   nor sinnd thy sin yet from that sin derive   corruption to bring forth more violent deeds      his eyes he opnd and beheld a field   part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves   new reapt the other part sheepwalks and foulds   ith midst an altar as the landmark stood   rustic of grassie sord thither anon   a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought   first fruits the green eare and the yellow sheaf   unculld as came to hand a shepherd next   more meek came with the firstlings of his flock   choicest and best then sacrificing laid   the inwards and thir fat with incense strewd   on the cleft wood and all due rites performd   his offring soon propitious fire from heavn   consumd with nimble glance and grateful steame   the others not for his was not sincere   whereat hee inlie ragd and as they talkd   smote him into the midriff with a stone   that beat out life he fell and deadly pale   groand out his soul with gushing bloud effusd   much at that sight was adam in his heart   dismaid and thus in haste to th angel crid      o teacher some great mischief hath befalln   to that meek man who well had sacrificd   is pietie thus and pure devotion paid      t whom michael thus hee also movd replid   these two are brethren adam and to come   out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain   for envie that his brothers offering found   from heavn acceptance but the bloodie fact   will be avengd and th others faith approvd   loose no reward though here thou see him die   rowling in dust and gore  to which our sire      alas both for the deed and for the cause   but have i now seen death  is this the way   i must return to native dust  o sight   of terrour foul and ugly to behold   horrid to think how horrible to feel      to whom thus michael  death thou hast seen   in his first shape on man but many shapes   of death and many are the wayes that lead   to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense   more terrible at th entrance then within   some as thou sawst by violent stroke shall die   by fire flood famin by intemperance more   in meats and drinks which on the earth shal bring   diseases dire of which a monstrous crew   before thee shall appear that thou mayst know   what miserie th inabstinence of eve   shall bring on men  immediately a place   before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark   a lazarhouse it seemd wherein were laid   numbers of all diseasd all maladies   of gastly spasm or racking torture qualmes   of heartsick agonie all feavorous kinds   convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs   intestin stone and ulcer colic pangs   dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums   dire was the tossing deep the groans despair   tended the sick busiest from couch to couch   and over them triumphant death his dart   shook but delaid to strike though oft invokt   with vows as thir chief good and final hope   sight so deform what heart of rock could long   drieeyd behold  adam could not but wept   though not of woman born compassion quelld   his best of man and gave him up to tears   a space till firmer thoughts restraind excess   and scarce recovering words his plaint renewd      o miserable mankind to what fall   degraded to what wretched state reservd   better end heer unborn  why is life givn   to be thus wrested from us rather why   obtruded on us thus who if we knew   what we receive would either not accept   life offerd or soon beg to lay it down   glad to be so dismist in peace  can thus   th image of god in man created once   so goodly and erect though faultie since   to such unsightly sufferings be debast   under inhuman pains  why should not man   retaining still divine similitude   in part from such deformities be free   and for his makers image sake exempt      thir makers image answerd michael then   forsook them when themselves they villifid   to serve ungovernd appetite and took   his image whom they servd a brutish vice   inductive mainly to the sin of eve   therefore so abject is thir punishment   disfiguring not gods likeness but thir own   or if his likeness by themselves defact   while they pervert pure natures healthful rules   to loathsom sickness worthily since they   gods image did not reverence in themselves      i yeild it just said adam and submit   but is there yet no other way besides   these painful passages how we may come   to death and mix with our connatural dust      there is said michael if thou well observe   the rule of not too much by temperance taught   in what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence   due nourishment not gluttonous delight   till many years over thy head return   so maist thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop   into thy mothers lap or be with ease   gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature   this is old age but then thou must outlive   thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change   to witherd weak  gray thy senses then   obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe   to what thou hast and for the aire of youth   hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne   a melancholly damp of cold and dry   to waigh thy spirits down and last consume   the balme of life  to whom our ancestor      henceforth i flie not death nor would prolong   life much bent rather how i may be quit   fairest and easiest of this combrous charge   which i must keep till my appointed day   of rendring up  michael to him replid      nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst   live well how long or short permit to heavn   and now prepare thee for another sight      he lookd and saw a spacious plaine whereon   were tents of various hue by some were herds   of cattel grazing others whence the sound   of instruments that made melodious chime   was heard of harp and organ and who moovd   thir stops and chords was seen his volant touch   instinct through all proportions low and high   fled and pursud transverse the resonant fugue   in other part stood one who at the forge   labouring two massie clods of iron and brass   had melted whether found where casual fire   had wasted woods on mountain or in vale   down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot   to som caves mouth or whether washt by stream   from underground the liquid ore he dreind   into fit moulds prepard from which he formd   first his own tooles then what might else be wrought   fulfil or gravn in mettle  after these   but on the hether side a different sort   from the high neighbouring hills which was thir seat   down to the plain descended by thir guise   just men they seemd and all thir study bent   to worship god aright and know his works   not hid nor those things lost which might preserve   freedom and peace to men they on the plain   long had not walkt when from the tents behold   a beavie of fair women richly gay   in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung   soft amorous ditties and in dance came on   the men though grave eyd them and let thir eyes   rove without rein till in the amorous net   fast caught they likd and each his liking chose   and now of love they treat till th eevning star   loves harbinger appeerd then all in heat   they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke   hymen then first to marriage rites invokt   with feast and musick all the tents resound   such happy interview and fair event   of love  youth not lost songs garlands flours   and charming symphonies attachd the heart   of adam soon enclind to admit delight   the bent of nature which he thus expressd      true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest   much better seems this vision and more hope   of peaceful dayes portends then those two past   those were of hate and death or pain much worse   here nature seems fulfilld in all her ends      to whom thus michael  judg not what is best   by pleasure though to nature seeming meet   created as thou art to nobler end   holie and pure conformitie divine   those tents thou sawst so pleasant were the tents   of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race   who slew his brother studious they appere   of arts that polish life inventers rare   unmindful of thir maker though his spirit   taught them but they his gifts acknowledgd none   yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget   for that fair femal troop thou sawst that seemd   of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay   yet empty of all good wherein consists   womans domestic honour and chief praise   bred onely and completed to the taste   of lustful apperence to sing to dance   to dress and troule the tongue and roule the eye   to these that sober race of men whose lives   religious titld them the sons of god   shall yeild up all thir vertue all thir fame   ignobly to the trains and to the smiles   of these fair atheists and now swim in joy   erelong to swim at larg and laugh for which   the world erelong a world of tears must weepe      to whom thus adam of short joy bereft   o pittie and shame that they who to live well   enterd so faire should turn aside to tread   paths indirect or in the mid way faint   but still i see the tenor of mans woe   holds on the same from woman to begin      from mans effeminate slackness it begins   said th angel who should better hold his place   by wisdome and superiour gifts receavd   but now prepare thee for another scene      he lookd and saw wide territorie spred   before him towns and rural works between   cities of men with lofty gates and towrs   concours in arms fierce faces threatning warr   giants of mightie bone and bould emprise   part wield thir arms part courb the foaming steed   single or in array of battel rangd   both horse and foot nor idely mustring stood   one way a band select from forage drives   a herd of beeves faire oxen and faire kine   from a fat meddow ground or fleecy flock   ewes and thir bleating lambs over the plaine   thir bootie scarce with life the shepherds flye   but call in aide which tacks a bloody fray   with cruel tournament the squadrons joine   where cattel pasturd late now scatterd lies   with carcasses and arms th ensanguind field   deserted others to a citie strong   lay siege encampt by batterie scale and mine   assaulting others from the wall defend   with dart and javlin stones and sulfurous fire   on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds   in other part the scepterd haralds call   to council in the citie gates anon   greyheaded men and grave with warriours mixt   assemble and harangues are heard but soon   in factious opposition till at last   of middle age one rising eminent   in wise deport spake much of right and wrong   of justice of religion truth and peace   and judgement from above him old and young   exploded and had seizd with violent hands   had not a cloud descending snatchd him thence   unseen amid the throng so violence   proceeded and oppression and swordlaw   through all the plain and refuge none was found   adam was all in tears and to his guide   lamenting turnd full sad o what are these   deaths ministers not men who thus deal death   inhumanly to men and multiply   ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew   his brother for of whom such massacher   make they but of thir brethren men of men   but who was that just man whom had not heavn   rescud had in his righteousness bin lost      to whom thus michael these are the product   of those illmated marriages thou sawst   where good with bad were matcht who of themselves   abhor to joyn and by imprudence mixt   produce prodigious births of bodie or mind   such were these giants men of high renown   for in those dayes might onely shall be admird   and valour and heroic vertu calld   to overcome in battel and subdue   nations and bring home spoils with infinite   manslaughter shall be held the highest pitch   of human glorie and for glorie done   of triumph to be styld great conquerours   patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods   destroyers rightlier calld and plagues of men   thus fame shall be achievd renown on earth   and what most merits fame in silence hid   but hee the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst   the onely righteous in a world perverse   and therefore hated therefore so beset   with foes for daring single to be just   and utter odious truth that god would come   to judge them with his saints him the most high   rapt in a balmie cloud with winged steeds   did as thou sawst receave to walk with god   high in salvation and the climes of bliss   exempt from death to shew thee what reward   awaits the good the rest what punishment   which now direct thine eyes and soon behold      he lookd  saw the face of things quite changd   the brazen throat of warr had ceast to roar   all now was turnd to jollitie and game   to luxurie and riot feast and dance   marrying or prostituting as befell   rape or adulterie where passing faire   allurd them thence from cups to civil broiles   at length a reverend sire among them came   and of thir doings great dislike declard   and testifid against thir wayes hee oft   frequented thir assemblies whereso met   triumphs or festivals and to them preachd   conversion and repentance as to souls   in prison under judgements imminent   but all in vain which when he saw he ceasd   contending and removd his tents farr off   then from the mountain hewing timber tall   began to build a vessel of huge bulk   measurd by cubit length  breadth and highth   smeard round with pitch and in the side a dore   contrivd and of provisions laid in large   for man and beast when loe a wonder strange   of everie beast and bird and insect small   came seavens and pairs and enterd in as taught   thir order last the sire and his three sons   with thir four wives and god made fast the dore   meanwhile the southwind rose  with black wings   wide hovering all the clouds together drove   from under heavn the hills to their supplie   vapour and exhalation dusk and moist   sent up amain and now the thicknd skie   like a dark ceeling stood down rushd the rain   impetuous and continud till the earth   no more was seen the floating vessel swum   uplifted and secure with beaked prow   rode tilting ore the waves all dwellings else   flood overwhelmd and them with all thir pomp   deep under water rould sea coverd sea   sea without shoar and in thir palaces   where luxurie late reignd seamonsters whelpd   and stabld of mankind so numerous late   all left in one small bottom swum imbarkt   how didst thou grieve then adam to behold   the end of all thy ofspring end so sad   depopulation thee another floud   of tears and sorrow a floud thee also drownd   and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reard   by th angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last   though comfortless as when a father mourns   his childern all in view destroyd at once   and scarce to th angel utterdst thus thy plaint      o visions ill foreseen better had i   livd ignorant of future so had borne   my part of evil onely each dayes lot   anough to bear those now that were dispenst   the burdn of many ages on me light   at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth   abortive to torment me ere thir being   with thought that they must be  let no man seek   henceforth to be foretold what shall befall   him or his childern evil he may be sure   which neither his foreknowing can prevent   and hee the future evil shall no less   in apprehension then in substance feel   grievous to bear but that care now is past   man is not whom to warne those few escapt   famin and anguish will at last consume   wandring that watrie desert i had hope   when violence was ceast and warr on earth   all would have then gon well peace would have crownd   with length of happy days the race of man   but i was farr deceavd for now i see   peace to corrupt no less then warr to waste   how comes it thus unfould celestial guide   and whether here the race of man will end   to whom thus michael  those whom last thou sawst   in triumph and luxurious wealth are they   first seen in acts of prowess eminent   and great exploits but of true vertu void   who having spilt much blood and don much waste   subduing nations and achievd thereby   fame in the world high titles and rich prey   shall change thir course to pleasure ease and sloth   surfet and lust till wantonness and pride   raise out of friendship hostil deeds in peace   the conquerd also and enslavd by warr   shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose   and feare of god from whom thir pietie feignd   in sharp contest of battel found no aide   against invaders therefore coold in zeale   thenceforth shall practice how to live secure   worldlie or dissolute on what thir lords   shall leave them to enjoy for th earth shall bear   more then anough that temperance may be trid   so all shall turn degenerate all depravd   justice and temperance truth and faith forgot   one man except the onely son of light   in a dark age against example good   against allurement custom and a world   offended fearless of reproach and scorn   or violence hee of thir wicked wayes   shall them admonish and before them set   the paths of righteousness how much more safe   and full of peace denouncing wrauth to come   on thir impenitence and shall returne   of them derided but of god observd   the one just man alive by his command   shall build a wondrous ark as thou beheldst   to save himself and houshold from amidst   a world devote to universal rack   no sooner hee with them of man and beast   select for life shall in the ark be lodgd   and shelterd round but all the cataracts   of heavn set open on the earth shall powre   raine day and night all fountaines of the deep   broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp   beyond all bounds till inundation rise   above the highest hills then shall this mount   of paradise by might of waves be moovd   out of his place pushd by the horned floud   with all his verdure spoild and trees adrift   down the great river to the opning gulf   and there take root an iland salt and bare   the haunt of seales and orcs and seamews clang   to teach thee that god attributes to place   no sanctitie if none be thither brought   by men who there frequent or therein dwell   and now what further shall ensue behold      he lookd and saw the ark hull on the floud   which now abated for the clouds were fled   drivn by a keen northwinde that blowing drie   wrinkld the face of deluge as decaid   and the cleer sun on his wide watrie glass   gazd hot and of the fresh wave largely drew   as after thirst which made thir flowing shrink   from standing lake to tripping ebbe that stole   with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt   his sluces as the heavn his windows shut   the ark no more now flotes but seems on ground   fast on the top of som high mountain fixt   and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer   with clamor thence the rapid currents drive   towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde   forthwith from out the arke a raven flies   and after him the surer messenger   a dove sent forth once and agen to spie   green tree or ground whereon his foot may light   the second time returning in his bill   an olive leafe he brings pacific signe   anon drie ground appeers and from his arke   the ancient sire descends with all his train   then with uplifted hands and eyes devout   grateful to heavn over his head beholds   a dewie cloud and in the cloud a bow   conspicuous with three lifted colours gay   betokning peace from god and covnant new   whereat the heart of adam erst so sad   greatly rejoycd and thus his joy broke forth      o thou that future things canst represent   as present heavnly instructer i revive   at this last sight assurd that man shall live   with all the creatures and thir seed preserve   farr less i now lament for one whole world   of wicked sons destroyd then i rejoyce   for one man found so perfet and so just   that god voutsafes to raise another world   from him and all his anger to forget   but say what mean those colourd streaks in heavn   distended as the brow of god appeasd   or serve they as a flourie verge to binde   the fluid skirts of that same watrie cloud   least it again dissolve and showr the earth      to whom th archangel  dextrously thou aimst   so willingly doth god remit his ire   though late repenting him of man depravd   grievd at his heart when looking down he saw   the whole earth filld with violence and all flesh   corrupting each thir way yet those remoovd   such grace shall one just man find in his sight   that he relents not to blot out mankind   and makes a covenant never to destroy   the earth again by flood nor let the sea   surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world   with man therein or beast but when he brings   over the earth a cloud will therein set   his triplecolourd bow whereon to look   and call to mind his covnant day and night   seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost   shall hold thir course till fire purge all things new   both heavn and earth wherein the just shall dwell   thus thou hast seen one world begin and end   and man as from a second stock proceed   much thou hast yet to see but i perceave   thy mortal sight to faile objects divine   must needs impaire and wearie human sense   henceforth what is to com i will relate   thou therefore give due audience and attend   this second sours of men while yet but few   and while the dread of judgement past remains   fresh in thir mindes fearing the deitie   with some regard to what is just and right   shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace   labouring the soile and reaping plenteous crop   corn wine and oyle and from the herd or flock   oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid   with large wineofferings pourd and sacred feast   shal spend thir dayes in joy unblamd and dwell   long time in peace by families and tribes   under paternal rule till one shall rise   of proud ambitious heart who not content   with fair equalitie fraternal state   will arrogate dominion undeservd   over his brethren and quite dispossess   concord and law of nature from the earth   hunting and men not beasts shall be his game   with warr and hostile snare such as refuse   subjection to his empire tyrannous   a mightie hunter thence he shall be styld   before the lord as in despite of heavn   or from heavn claming second sovrantie   and from rebellion shall derive his name   though of rebellion others he accuse   hee with a crew whom like ambition joyns   with him or under him to tyrannize   marching from eden towards the west shall finde   the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge   boiles out from under ground the mouth of hell   of brick and of that stuff they cast to build   a citie  towre whose top may reach to heavn   and get themselves a name least far disperst   in foraign lands thir memorie be lost   regardless whether good or evil fame   but god who oft descends to visit men   unseen and through thir habitations walks   to mark thir doings them beholding soon   comes down to see thir citie ere the tower   obstruct heavn towrs and in derision sets   upon thir tongues a various spirit to rase   quite out thir native language and instead   to sow a jangling noise of words unknown   forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud   among the builders each to other calls   not understood till hoarse and all in rage   as mockt they storm great laughter was in heavn   and looking down to see the hubbub strange   and hear the din thus was the building left   ridiculous and the work confusion namd      whereto thus adam fatherly displeasd   o execrable son so to aspire   above his brethren to himself affirming   authoritie usurpt from god not givn   he gave us onely over beast fish fowl   dominion absolute that right we hold   by his donation but man over men   he made not lord such title to himself   reserving human left from human free   but this usurper his encroachment proud   stayes not on man to god his tower intends   siege and defiance wretched man what food   will he convey up thither to sustain   himself and his rash armie where thin aire   above the clouds will pine his entrails gross   and famish him of breath if not of bread      to whom thus michael  justly thou abhorrst   that son who on the quiet state of men   such trouble brought affecting to subdue   rational libertie yet know withall   since thy original lapse true libertie   is lost which alwayes with right reason dwells   twinnd and from her hath no dividual being   reason in man obscurd or not obeyd   immediately inordinate desires   and upstart passions catch the government   from reason and to servitude reduce   man till then free  therefore since hee permits   within himself unworthie powers to reign   over free reason god in judgement just   subjects him from without to violent lords   who oft as undeservedly enthrall   his outward freedom tyrannie must be   though to the tyrant thereby no excuse   yet somtimes nations will decline so low   from vertue which is reason that no wrong   but justice and some fatal curse annext   deprives them of thir outward libertie   thir inward lost witness th irreverent son   of him who built the ark who for the shame   don to his father heard this heavie curse   servant of servants on his vitious race   thus will this latter as the former world   still tend from bad to worse till god at last   wearied with their iniquities withdraw   his presence from among them and avert   his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth   to leave them to thir own polluted wayes   and one peculiar nation to select   from all the rest of whom to be invokd   a nation from one faithful man to spring   him on this side euphrates yet residing   bred up in idolworship o that men   canst thou believe should be so stupid grown   while yet the patriark livd who scapd the flood   as to forsake the living god and fall   toworship thir own work in wood and stone   for gods yet him god the most high voutsafes   to call by vision from his fathers house   his kindred and false gods into a land   which he will shew him and from him will raise   a mightie nation and upon him showre   his benediction so that in his seed   all nations shall be blest hee straight obeys   not knowing to what land yet firm believes   i see him but thou canst not with what faith   he leaves his gods his friends and native soile   ur of chaldaea passing now the ford   to haran after him a cumbrous train   of herds and flocks and numerous servitude   not wandring poor but trusting all his wealth   with god who calld him in a land unknown   canaan he now attains i see his tents   pitcht about sechem and the neighbouring plaine   of moreb there by promise he receaves   gift to his progenie of all that land   from hamath northward to the desert south   things by thir names i call though yet unnamd   from hermon east to the great western sea   mount hermon yonder sea each place behold   in prospect as i point them on the shoare   mount carmel here the doublefounted stream   jordan true limit eastward but his sons   shall dwell to senir that long ridge of hills   this ponder that all nations of the earth   shall in his seed be blessed by that seed   is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise   the serpents head whereof to thee anon   plainlier shall be reveald  this patriarch blest   whom faithful abraham due time shall call   a son and of his son a grandchilde leaves   like him in faith in wisdom and renown   the grandchilde with twelve sons increast departs   from canaan to a land hereafter calld   egypt divided by the river nile   see where it flows disgorging at seaven mouthes   into the sea to sojourn in that land   he comes invited by a yonger son   in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds   raise him to be the second in that realme   of pharao there he dies and leaves his race   growing into a nation and now grown   suspected to a sequent king who seeks   to stop thir overgrowth as inmate guests   too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves   inhospitably and kills thir infant males   till by two brethren those two brethren call   moses and aaron sent from god to claime   his people from enthralment they return   with glory and spoile back to thir promisd land   but first the lawless tyrant who denies   to know thir god or message to regard   must be compelld by signes and judgements dire   to blood unshed the rivers must be turnd   frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill   with loathd intrusion and fill all the land   his cattel must of rot and murren die   botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss   and all his people thunder mixt with haile   haile mixt with fire must rend th egyptian skie   and wheel on th earth devouring where it rouls   what it devours not herb or fruit or graine   a darksom cloud of locusts swarming down   must eat and on the ground leave nothing green   darkness must overshadow all his bounds   palpable darkness and blot out three dayes   last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn   of egypt must lie dead  thus with ten wounds   this riverdragon tamd at length submits   to let his sojourners depart and oft   humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice   more hardnd after thaw till in his rage   pursuing whom he late dismissd the sea   swallows him with his host but them lets pass   as on drie land between two christal walls   awd by the rod of moses so to stand   divided till his rescud gain thir shoar   such wondrous power god to his saint will lend   though present in his angel who shall goe   before them in a cloud and pillar of fire   to guide them in thir journey and remove   behinde them while th obdurat king pursues   all night he will pursue but his approach   darkness defends between till morning watch   then through the firey pillar and the cloud   god looking forth will trouble all his host   and craze thir chariot wheels when by command   moses once more his potent rod extends   over the sea the sea his rod obeys   on thir imbattelld ranks the waves return   and overwhelm thir warr the race elect   safe towards canaan from the shoar advance   through the wilde desert not the readiest way   least entring on the canaanite allarmd   warr terrifie them inexpert and feare   return them back to egypt choosing rather   inglorious life with servitude for life   to noble and ignoble is more sweet   untraind in armes where rashness leads not on   this also shall they gain by thir delay   in the wide wilderness there they shall found   thir government and thir great senate choose   through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordaind   god from the mount of sinai whose gray top   shall tremble he descending will himself   in thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound   ordaine them lawes part such as appertaine   to civil justice part religious rites   of sacrifice informing them by types   and shadowes of that destind seed to bruise   the serpent by what meanes he shall achieve   mankinds deliverance  but the voice of god   to mortal eare is dreadful they beseech   that moses might report to them his will   and terror cease he grants them thir desire   instructed that to god is no access   without mediator whose high office now   moses in figure beares to introduce   one greater of whose day he shall foretell   and all the prophets in thir age the times   of great messiah shall sing  thus laws and rites   establisht such delight hath god in men   obedient to his will that he voutsafes   among them to set up his tabernacle   the holy one with mortal men to dwell   by his prescript a sanctuary is framd   of cedar overlaid with gold therein   an ark and in the ark his testimony   the records of his covnant over these   a mercieseat of gold between the wings   of two bright cherubim before him burn   seaven lamps as in a zodiac representing   the heavnly fires over the tent a cloud   shall rest by day a fierie gleame by night   save when they journie and at length they come   conducted by his angel to the land   promisd to abraham and his seed the rest   were long to tell how many battels fought   how many kings destroyd and kingdoms won   or how the sun shall in mid heavn stand still   a day entire and nights due course adjourne   mans voice commanding sun in gibeon stand   and thou moon in the vale of aialon   till israel overcome so call the third   from abraham son of isaac and from him   his whole descent who thus shall canaan win      here adam interposd  o sent from heavn   enlightner of my darkness gracious things   thou hast reveald those chiefly which concerne   just abraham and his seed now first i finde   mine eyes true opning and my heart much easd   erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom   of mee and all mankind but now i see   his day in whom all nations shall be blest   favour unmerited by me who sought   forbiddn knowledge by forbiddn means   this yet i apprehend not why to those   among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth   so many and so various laws are givn   so many laws argue so many sins   among them how can god with such reside      to whom thus michael  doubt not but that sin   will reign among them as of thee begot   and therefore was law given them to evince   thir natural pravitie by stirring up   sin against law to fight that when they see   law can discover sin but not remove   save by those shadowie expiations weak   the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude   some bloud more precious must be paid for man   just for unjust that in such righteousness   to them by faith imputed they may finde   justification towards god and peace   of conscience which the law by ceremonies   cannot appease nor man the moral part   perform and not performing cannot live   so law appears imperfet and but givn   with purpose to resign them in full time   up to a better covnant disciplind   from shadowie types to truth from flesh to spirit   from imposition of strict laws to free   acceptance of large grace from servil fear   to filial works of law to works of faith   and therefore shall not moses though of god   highly belovd being but the minister   of law his people into canaan lead   but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call   his name and office bearing who shall quell   the adversarie serpent and bring back   through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man   safe to eternal paradise of rest   meanwhile they in thir earthly canaan plact   long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins   national interrupt thir public peace   provoking god to raise them enemies   from whom as oft he saves them penitent   by judges first then under kings of whom   the second both for pietie renownd   and puissant deeds a promise shall receive   irrevocable that his regal throne   for ever shall endure the like shall sing   all prophecie that of the royal stock   of david so i name this king shall rise   a son the womans seed to thee foretold   foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust   all nations and to kings foretold of kings   the last for of his reign shall be no end   but first a long succession must ensue   and his next son for wealth and wisdom famd   the clouded ark of god till then in tents   wandring shall in a glorious temple enshrine   such follow him as shall be registerd   part good part bad of bad the longer scrowle   whose foul idolatries and other faults   heapt to the popular summe will so incense   god as to leave them and expose thir land   thir citie his temple and his holy ark   with all his sacred things a scorn and prey   to that proud citie whose high walls thou sawst   left in confusion babylon thence calld   there in captivitie he lets them dwell   the space of seventie years then brings them back   remembring mercie and his covnant sworn   to david stablisht as the dayes of heavn   returnd from babylon by leave of kings   thir lords whom god disposd the house of god   they first reedifie and for a while   in mean estate live moderate till grown   in wealth and multitude factious they grow   but first among the priests dissension springs   men who attend the altar and should most   endeavour peace thir strife pollution brings   upon the temple it self at last they seise   the scepter and regard not davids sons   then loose it to a stranger that the true   anointed king messiah might be born   barrd of his right yet at his birth a starr   unseen before in heavn proclaims him com   and guides the eastern sages who enquire   his place to offer incense myrrh and gold   his place of birth a solemn angel tells   to simple shepherds keeping watch by night   they gladly thither haste and by a quire   of squadrond angels hear his carol sung   a virgin is his mother but his sire   the power of the most high he shall ascend   the throne hereditarie and bound his reign   with earths wide bounds his glory with the heavns      he ceasd discerning adam with such joy   surchargd as had like grief bin dewd in tears   without the vent of words which these he breathd      o prophet of glad tidings finisher   of utmost hope now clear i understand   what oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain   why our great expectation should be calld   the seed of woman virgin mother haile   high in the love of heavn yet from my loynes   thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son   of god most high so god with man unites   needs must the serpent now his capital bruise   expect with mortal paine say where and when   thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel      to whom thus michael  dream not of thir fight   as of a duel or the local wounds   of head or heel not therefore joynes the son   manhood to godhead with more strength to foil   thy enemie nor so is overcome   satan whose fall from heavn a deadlier bruise   disabld not to give thee thy deaths wound   which hee who comes thy saviour shall recure   not by destroying satan but his works   in thee and in thy seed nor can this be   but by fulfilling that which thou didst want   obedience to the law of god imposd   on penaltie of death and suffering death   the penaltie to thy transgression due   and due to theirs which out of thine will grow   so onely can high justice rest appaid   the law of god exact he shall fulfill   both by obedience and by love though love   alone fulfill the law thy punishment   he shall endure by coming in the flesh   to a reproachful life and cursed death   proclaiming life to all who shall believe   in his redemption and that his obedience   imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits   to save them not thir own though legal works   for this he shall live hated be blasphemd   seisd on by force judgd and to death condemnd   a shameful and accurst naild to the cross   by his own nation slaine for bringing life   but to the cross he nailes thy enemies   the law that is against thee and the sins   of all mankinde with him there crucifid   never to hurt them more who rightly trust   in this his satisfaction so he dies   but soon revives death over him no power   shall long usurp ere the third dawning light   returne the starres of morn shall see him rise   out of his grave fresh as the dawning light   thy ransom paid which man from death redeems   his death for man as many as offerd life   neglect not and the benefit imbrace   by faith not void of works this godlike act   annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dyd   in sin for ever lost from life this act   shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength   defeating sin and death his two maine armes   and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings   then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel   or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep   a gentle wafting to immortal life   nor after resurrection shall he stay   longer on earth then certaine times to appeer   to his disciples men who in his life   still followd him to them shall leave in charge   to teach all nations what of him they learnd   and his salvation them who shall beleeve   baptizing in the profluent streame the signe   of washing them from guilt of sin to life   pure and in mind prepard if so befall   for death like that which the redeemer dyd   all nations they shall teach for from that day   not onely to the sons of abrahams loines   salvation shall be preacht but to the sons   of abrahams faith wherever through the world   so in his seed all nations shall be blest   then to the heavn of heavns he shall ascend   with victory triumphing through the aire   over his foes and thine there shall surprise   the serpent prince of aire and drag in chaines   through all his realme  there confounded leave   then enter into glory and resume   his seat at gods right hand exalted high   above all names in heavn and thence shall come   when this worlds dissolution shall be ripe   with glory and power to judge both quick  dead   to judge th unfaithful dead but to reward   his faithful and receave them into bliss   whether in heavn or earth for then the earth   shall all be paradise far happier place   then this of eden and far happier daies      so spake th archangel michael then pausd   as at the worlds great period and our sire   replete with joy and wonder thus replid      o goodness infinite goodness immense   that all this good of evil shall produce   and evil turn to good more wonderful   then that which by creation first brought forth   light out of darkness full of doubt i stand   whether i should repent me now of sin   by mee done and occasiond or rejoyce   much more that much more good thereof shall spring   to god more glory more good will to men   from god and over wrauth grace shall abound   but say if our deliverer up to heavn   must reascend what will betide the few   his faithful left among th unfaithful herd   the enemies of truth who then shall guide   his people who defend will they not deale   wors with his followers then with him they dealt      be sure they will said th angel but from heavn   hee to his own a comforter will send   the promise of the father who shall dwell   his spirit within them and the law of faith   working through love upon thir hearts shall write   to guide them in all truth and also arme   with spiritual armour able to resist   satans assaults and quench his fierie darts   what man can do against them not affraid   though to the death against such cruelties   with inward consolations recompenct   and oft supported so as shall amaze   thir proudest persecuters for the spirit   powrd first on his apostles whom he sends   to evangelize the nations then on all   baptizd shall them with wondrous gifts endue   to speak all tongues and do all miracles   as did thir lord before them  thus they win   great numbers of each nation to receave   with joy the tidings brought from heavn at length   thir ministry performd and race well run   thir doctrine and thir story written left   they die but in thir room as they forewarne   wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves   who all the sacred mysteries of heavn   to thir own vile advantages shall turne   of lucre and ambition and the truth   with superstitions and traditions taint   left onely in those written records pure   though not but by the spirit understood   then shall they seek to avail themselves of names   places and titles and with these to joine   secular power though feigning still to act   by spiritual to themselves appropriating   the spirit of god promisd alike and givn   to all beleevers and from that pretense   spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force   on every conscience laws which none shall finde   left them inrould or what the spirit within   shall on the heart engrave  what will they then   but force the spirit of grace it self and binde   his consort libertie what but unbuild   his living temples built by faith to stand   thir own faith not anothers for on earth   who against faith and conscience can be heard   infallible yet many will presume   whence heavie persecution shall arise   on all who in the worship persevere   of spirit and truth the rest farr greater part   will deem in outward rites and specious formes   religion satisfid truth shall retire   bestuck with slandrous darts and works of faith   rarely be found so shall the world goe on   to good malignant to bad men benigne   under her own waight groaning till the day   appeer of respiration to the just   and vengeance to the wicked at return   of him so lately promisd to thy aid   the womans seed obscurely then foretold   now amplier known thy saviour and thy lord   last in the clouds from heavn to be reveald   in glory of the father to dissolve   satan with his perverted world then raise   from the conflagrant mass purgd and refind   new heavns new earth ages of endless date   founded in righteousness and peace and love   to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss      he ended and thus adam last replyd   how soon hath thy prediction seer blest   measurd this transient world the race of time   till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss   eternitie whose end no eye can reach   greatly instructed i shall hence depart   greatly in peace of thought and have my fill   of knowledge what this vessel can containe   beyond which was my folly to aspire   henceforth i learne that to obey is best   and love with feare the onely god to walk   as in his presence ever to observe   his providence and on him sole depend   merciful over all his works with good   still overcoming evil and by small   accomplishing great things by things deemd weak   subverting worldly strong and worldly wise   by simply meek that suffering for truths sake   is fortitude to highest victorie   and to the faithful death the gate of life   taught this by his example whom i now   acknowledge my redeemer ever blest      to whom thus also th angel last replid   this having learnt thou hast attaind the summe   of wisdom hope no higher though all the starrs   thou knewst by name and all th ethereal powers   all secrets of the deep all natures works   or works of god in heavn air earth or sea   and all the riches of this world enjoydst   and all the rule one empire onely add   deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith   add vertue patience temperance add love   by name to come calld charitie the soul   of all the rest then wilt thou not be loath   to leave this paradise but shalt possess   a paradise within thee happier farr   let us descend now therefore from this top   of speculation for the hour precise   exacts our parting hence and see the guards   by mee encampt on yonder hill expect   thir motion at whose front a flaming sword   in signal of remove waves fiercely round   we may no longer stay go waken eve   her also i with gentle dreams have calmd   portending good and all her spirits composd   to meek submission thou at season fit   let her with thee partake what thou hast heard   chiefly what may concern her faith to know   the great deliverance by her seed to come   for by the womans seed on all mankind   that ye may live which will be many dayes   both in one faith unanimous though sad   with cause for evils past yet much more cheerd   with meditation on the happie end      he ended and they both descend the hill   descended adam to the bowre where eve   lay sleeping ran before but found her wakt   and thus with words not sad she him receavd      whence thou returnst  whither wentst i know   for god is also in sleep and dreams advise   which he hath sent propitious some great good   presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress   vvearied i fell asleep but now lead on   in mee is no delay with thee to goe   is to stay here without thee here to stay   is to go hence unwilling thou to mee   art all things under heavn all places thou   vvho for my wilful crime art banisht hence   this further consolation yet secure   i carry hence though all by mee is lost   such favour i unworthie am voutsaft   by mee the promisd seed shall all restore      so spake our mother eve and adam heard   vvell pleasd but answerd not for now too nigh   th archangel stood and from the other hill   to thir fixt station all in bright array   the cherubim descended on the ground   gliding meteorous as evning mist   risn from a river ore the marish glides   and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel   homeward returning  high in front advanct   the brandisht sword of god before them blazd   fierce as a comet which with torrid heat   and vapour as the libyan air adust   began to parch that temperate clime whereat   in either hand the hastning angel caught   our lingring parents and to th eastern gate   let them direct and down the cliff as fast   to the subjected plaine then disappeerd   they looking back all th eastern side beheld   of paradise so late thir happie seat   wavd over by that flaming brand the gate   with dreadful faces throngd and fierie armes   som natural tears they dropd but wipd them soon   the world was all before them where to choose   thir place of rest and providence thir guide   they hand in hand with wandring steps and slow   through eden took thir solitarie way       the end
