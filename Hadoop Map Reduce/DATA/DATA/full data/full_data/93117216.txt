93117216	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle  volume xiii     book xiii  first silesian war leaving the general european one ablaze all round gets ended  may 1741july 1742     chapter i  britannic majesty as paladin of the pragmatic  part first of his britannic majestys sorrows the britannic or domestic part is now perhaps conceivable to readers but as to the second the germanic or pragmatic partarticulate history after much consideration is content to renounce attempting these feels that these will remain forever inconceivable to mankind in the now altered times so small a gentleman and he feels dismally though with heroism that he has got the axis of the world on his shoulder poor majesty his eyes proud as joves are nothing like so perspicacious a pair of the poorest eyes and he has to scan with them and unriddle under pain of death such a waste of insoluble intricacies troubles and worldperils as seldom waseven in dreams in fact it is of the nature of a long nightmare dream all this of the pragmatic to his poor majesty and nation and wakeful history must not spend herself upon it beyond the essential  may 12th betimes this year his majesty got across to hanover harrington with him anxious to contemplate near at hand that camp of the old dessauers at gottin and the other fearful phenomena french prussian and other in that country his majesty as natural was much in germany in those years scanning the phenomena a long while not knowing what in the world to make of them bully belleisle having stept into the ring it is evident clear as the sun that one must act and act at once but it is a perfect sphinxenigma to say how seldom was sovereign or man so spurred and goaded on by the highest considerations and then so held down and chained to his place by an imbroglio of counterconsiderations and sphinxriddles thrice over at different dates which shall be given the first of them this year he starts up as in spasm determined to draw sword and plunge in twice he is crushed down again with sword half drawn and only the third time in 1743 does he get sword out and brandish it in a surprising though useless manner after which he feels better but up to that crisis his case is really tragicalhad idle readers any bowels for him which they have not one or two fractions snatched from the circumambient paper vortex must suffice us for the indispensable in this place     cunctations yet incessant and ubiquitous endeavorings of his britannic majesty 17411743   after the wonderful russian partitiontreaty which his english walpoles would not hear ofand which has produced the camp of gottin see your majestygeorge does nothing rashly far from it indeed except it be paying money he becomes again a miracle of cunctations and staggers about for years to come like theshall we say like the white hanover horse amid half a dozen sieves of beans alas no like the hanover horse with the shadows of half a dozen damoclesswords dangling into the eyes of itenough to drive any horse to its wits end  to do to dare thinks the britannic majestyyes and of daring there is a plenty but in which direction what how these are questions for a fussy little gentleman called to take the world on his shoulders we suppose it was by walpoles advice that he gave her hungarian majesty that 200000 pounds of secretservice moneyadvice sufficiently walpolean russian partitiontreaties horrible to think ofbeware of these again give her majesty that cash can be done it will keep matters afloat and spoil nothing that till the late subsidy payable within year and day hence was all of tangible his majesty had yet donetruly that is all her hungarian majesty has yet got by hawking the world pragmatic sanction in hand and if that were the bit of generosity which enabled neipperg to climb the mountains and be beaten at mollwitz that has helped little very big generosities to a frightful cipher of millions sterling through the coming years will go the same road and amount also to zero even for the receiving party not to speak of the giving for men and kings are wise creatures  but wise or unwise how great are his britannic majestys activities in this pragmatic business we may say they are prodigious incessant ubiquitous they are forgotten now fallen wholly to the spiders and the dustbinsthough friedrich himself was not a busier king in those days if perhaps a better directed it is a thing wonderful to us but sorrowful and undeniable we perceive the britannic majestys own little mind pulsing with this pragmatic matter as the biggest volcano would doshooting forth dust and smoke subsidies diplomatic emissaries treaties offers of treaty plans foolish futile exertions at an immense rate when the celestial balances are canting a man ought to exert himself but as to this of saving the house of austria from francesurely your britannic majesty the shortest way to that if that is so indispensable were that the house of austria should consent to give up its stolen goods better late than never and to make this king of prussia its friend as he offers to be joined with this king it would manage to give account of france and its balloon projects by and by could your britannic majesty but take mr viners hint and in the interim mind your own businesshis britannic majesty intends immediate fighting and both in england and hanover is making preparation loud and great nay he will in his own person fight if necessary and rather likes the thought of it he saw oudenarde in his young days and i am told traces in himself a talent for generalship were the britannic majesty to draw his own puissant swordhis own puissant purse he has already drawn and is subsidizing to right and left knocking at all doors with money in hand and the question any fighting done here in england itself there goes on much drilling enlisting camping proposing to camp which is noisy enough in the british newspapers much more in the foreign one actual camp there was on lexden heath near colchester from may till october of this 1741 manifold but insignificant details about it in the old newspapers of those monthscamp waiting always to be shipped across to the scene of action but never wasthis actual camp and several imaginary ones here which were alarming to the continental gazetteer in england his majesty is busy that way still more among his hanoverians now under his own royal eye and among his danes and hessians whom he has now brought over into hanover to combine with the others danes and hessians 6000 of each kind he for some time keeps back in stall upon subsidy ready for such an occasion their camp at hameln camp at nienburg will with the hanoverians be 30000 odd their swashing and blaring about intending to encamp at hameln at nienburg and other places but never doing it or doing it with any result this with the alarming english camps at lexden and in dreamland which also were void of practical issue filled europe with rumor this summereager enough to fight a noble martial ardor in our little herculesatlas but there lie such enormous difficulties on the threshold especially these two which are insuperable or nearly so  difficulty first is that of the laggard dutch a people apt to be heavy in the sternworks they are quite languid about pragmatic sanction these dutch they answer his britannic majestys enthusiasm with an obese torpidity and hope always they will drift through in some way buoyant in their own fat well ballasted astern and not need such swimming for life what a laggard notion thinks his majesty notion in ten pair of breeches so to speak this stirring up of the dutch which lasts year on year and almost beats lord stair lord carteret and our chief artists is itself a thing like few one of his britannic majestys great difficultiesinsuperable he never could admit it to be surely you are a seapower ye valiant dutch the other seapower bound by barrier treaty treaty of vienna and law of nature itself to rise with us against the fatal designs of france fatal to your dutch barrier first of all if the liberties of mankind were indifferent to you how is it that you will not the dutch cannot say how france rocks them in security by oilymouthed diplomatists fenelon and others would not touch a stone of your barrier for the world ye admirable dutch neighbors on our honor thrice and four times no they have an eloquent van hoey of their own at paris renowned in newspapers nothing but friendship here reports van hoey always and the dutch answer his britannic majesty hm rise well then if we mustbut sit always still  nowhere in political mechanics have i seen such a problem as this of hoisting to their feet the heavybottomed dutch the cunningest leverage every sort of diplomatic blockandtackle carteret and stair themselves running over to help in critical seasons is applied to almost no purpose pull long pull strong pull all togethersee the heavy dutch do stir some four inches of daylight fairly visible below them bear a hand oh bear a handpooh the dutch flap down again as low as ever as lowunless by diplomatic art you have wedged them at the four inches higher which after the first time or two is generally done at the long last partially in 1743 upon which his britannic majesty drew sword completely in 1747 the dutch were got to their feetunfortunately good for nothing when they were without them his britannic majesty durst not venture hidden in those dustbins there is nothing so absurd or which would be so wearisome did it not at last become slightly ludicrous as this of hoisting the dutch  difficulty second which in enormity of magnitude might be reckoned first as in order of time it ranks both first and last is the case of dear hanover case involved in mere insolubilities our own dear hanover which were there nothing more in it is liable from that camp at gottin to be slit in pieces at a moments warning no drawing sword against a nefarious prussia on those terms the camp at gottin holds george in checkmate and then finally in this same autumn 1741 when a maillebois with his 40 or 50000 french the leftward or western of those two belleisle armies threatening our hanover from another side crossed the lower rhinebut let us not anticipate the case of hanover which everybody saw to be his majestys vulnerable point was the constant open door of france and her machinations and a neverending theme of angry eloquences in the english parliament as well  so that the case of hanover proved insoluble throughout and was like a perpetual running sore oh the pamphleteerings the denouncings the complainings satirical and elegiac which grounded themselves on hanover the case of the hanover forces and innumerable other hanoverian cases griefs and difficulties so pungently vital to somnambulant mankind at that epoch to us fallen dead as carrion and unendurable to think of my friends if you send for gentlemen from hanover you must take them with hanover adhering more or less and ought not to quarrel with your bargain which you reckoned so divine no doubt it is singular to see a britannic majesty neglecting his own spanish war the one real business he has at present and running about over all the world busy soul body and breechespocket in other peoples wars egging on other fighting whispering every likely fellow he can meet wont you perhaps fight here is for you if sohand to breechespocket accompanying the word but it must be said and ought to be better known than in our day it is his majestys ministers and the english statedoctors generally were precisely of the same mind to them too the austrian quarrel was everything their own poor spanish quarrel nothing and the complaint they make of his majesty is rather that he does not rush rapidly enough with brandished sword as well as with guineas raining from him into this one indispensable business owing to his fears for hanover say they with indignation with no end of suspicion angry pamphleteering and covert eloquence within those walls and without  the suspicion of hanovers checking his majestys pragmatic velocity is altogether well founded and there need no more be said on that hanover score be it well understood and admitted hanover was the britannic majestys beloved son and the british empire his opulent milkcow richest of milkcows staff of ones life for grand purposes and small beautiful big animal not to be provoked but to be stroked and milkedfriends if you will do a glorious revolution of that kind and burn such an amount of tar upon it why eat sour herbs for an inevitable corollary therefrom and let my present readers understand at any rate thatexcept in wapping bristol and among the simple instinctive classes with whom it is true go pitt and some illustrious figurespolitical england generally whatever of england had parliamentary discourse of reason and did pamphlets despatches harangues went greatly along with his majesty in that pragmatic business and be the blame of delirium laid on the right back where it ought to lie not on the wrong which has enough to bear of its own and go not into that dustwhirlwind of extinct stupidities o readerwhat reader would except for didactic objects know only that it does of a truth whirl there and fancy always if you can that certain things and human figures a friedrich a chatham and some others have it for their lifeelement which i often think is their principal misfortune with posterity said lifeelement having gone to such an unutterable condition for gods and men  one other thing surprises us in those old pamphlets says my constitutional friend how the phrase cause of liberty ever and anon turns up with great though extinct emphasis evidently sincere after groping one is astonished to find it means support of the house of austria keeping of the hapsburgs entire in their old possessions among mankind that to our greatgrandfathers was the cause of libertysaid cause being with us again electoral suffrage and other things a notably different definition perhaps still wider of the mark  our greatgrandfathers lived in perpetual terror that they would be devoured by france that french ambition would overset the celestial balance and proceed next to eat the british nation stand upon your guard then one would have said look to your ships to your defences to your industries to your virtues first of allyour virtutes manhoods conformities to the divine law appointed you which are the great and indeed sole strength to any man or nation discipline yourselves wisely in all kinds more and more till there be no anarchic fibre left in you unanarchic disciplined at all points you might then i should say with supreme composure let france and the whole world at its back try what they could do upon you and the unique little island you are so lucky as to live infoolish mortals what potentiality of battle think you not against france only but against satanas and the ministers of chaos generally would a poor friedrich wilhelm not to speak of better have got out of such a possession had it been his to put in drill and drill is not of soldiers only though perhaps of soldiers first and most indispensably of all since without being as my friend oliver was wont to say wellbeing is not possible there is military drill there is industrial economic spiritual gradually there are all kinds of drill of wise discipline of peremptory mandate become effective everywhere obey the laws of heaven or else disappear from these latitudes ah me if one dealt in daydreams and prophecies of an england grown celestialcelestial she should be not in gold nuggets continents all of beef and seas all of beer abolition of pain and paradise to all and sundry but in that quite different fashion and there i should say there were the magnificent hope to indulge in that were to me the cause of liberty and any the smallest contribution towards that kind of liberty were a sacred thing  belleisle again may if he pleases call his the cause of sovereignty a sovereign louis it would appear has not governing enough to do within his own french borders but feels called to undertake germany as wella gentleman with an immense governing faculty it would appear truly good reader i am sick of heart contemplating those empty sovereign mountebanks and empty antagonist ditto with their causes of liberty and causes of antiliberty and cannot but wish that we had got the ashes of that worldexplosion of 1789 well riddled and smelted and the poor world were quit of a great many things  my constitutional historian of england musing on belleisle and his antipragmatic industries and grandiositieshow chiefbully belleisle stept down into the ring as a gay volunteer and foolish chiefdefender george had to follow dismally heroic as a conscript of fatedrops these words in regard to the wages they respectively had  nations that go into war without business there are sure of getting business as they proceed and if the beginning were phantasmsespecially phantasms of the hoping selfconceited kindthe results for them are apt to be extremely real as was the case with the french in this war and those following in which his britannic majesty played chief countertenor from 1741 in king friedrichs first war onwards to friedrichs third war 17561763 the volunteer french found a great deal of work lying ready for themgratuitous on their part from the beginning and the results to them came out first completely visible in the worldmiracles of 1789 and the years following  nations again may be driven upon war by phantasm terrors and go into it in sorrow of heart not gayety of heart and that is a shade better and one always pities a poor nation in such caseas the very destinies rather do and judge it more mercifully nay the poor bewildered nation may among its brainphantasms have something of reality and sanity inarticulately stirring it withal it may have a real ordinance of heaven to accomplish on those termsand if so it will sometimes in the most chaotic circuitous ways through endless hazards at a hundred or a hundred thousand times the natural expense ultimately get it done this was the case of the poor english in those wars  they were wars extraneous to england little less than to france neither nation had real business in them and they seem to us now a very mad object on the part of both but they were not gratuitously gone into on the part of england far from that england undertook them with its big heart very sorrowful strange spectralities bewildering it and managed them as men do sleepwalking with a gloomy solidity of purpose with a heavyladen energy and on the whole with a depth of stupidity which were very great yet look at the respective net results france lies down to rot into grand spontaneouscombustion apotheosis of sansculottism and much else which still lasts to her own great peril and the great affliction of neighbors poor england after such enormous stumbling among the chimneypots and somnambulism over all the world for twenty years finds on awakening that she is arrived after all where she wished to be and a good deal farther finds that her own important little errand is somehow or other doneand in short that jenkinss ear as she named the thing has been avenged and the ocean highways opened and a good deal more in a most signal way for the eternal providenceslittle as poor dryasdust now knows of it mumbling and maundering that sad stuff of hisdo rule and the great soul of the world i assure you once more is just and always for a nation as for a man it is very behooveful to be honest to be modest however stupid  by this time howevermollwitz having fallen out and belleisle being evidently on the stepshis britannic majesty recognizes clearly and insists upon it strengthened by his harringtons and everybody of discernment that nefarious or not this friedrich will require to be bargained with that far from breaking in upon him and partitioning him how far from it there is no conceivable method of saving the celestial balances till he be satisfied in some way this is the one step his britannic majesty has yet made out of these his choking imbroglios and truly this is one hyndford his best negotiator is on the road for friedrichs camp robinson at vienna has been directed to say and insist bargain with that man he must be bargained with if our cause of liberty is to be saved at all  and now having opened the dustbin so far that the readers fancy might be stirred without affliction to his lungs and eyes let us shut it down againmight we but hope forever that is too fond a hope but the background or sustaining element made imaginable the few events deserving memory may surely go on at a much swifter pace     chapter ii  camp of strehlen  friedrichs silesian camps this summer camp of strehlen chiefly were among the strangest places in the world friedrich as we have often noticed did not much pursue the defeated austrians at or near mollwitz or press them towards flat ruin in their silesian business it is clear he anxiously wished a bargain without farther exasperation and hoped he might get it by judicious patience brieg he took with that fine outburst of bombardment which did not last a week but brieg once his he fell quiet again kept encamping here there in that mollwitzneisse region for above three months to come not doing much beyond the indispensable negotiating much or rather negotiated with and waiting on events in camp of mollwitz nearer brieg than the battlefield was till 28th may after the battle seven weeks then to camp at grotkau 28th may9th june twelve days thence 9th june to friedewalde herrnsdorf to strehlen 21st june20th august nine or ten weeks in all see heldengeschichte i 924 ii 931 rodenbeck orlich c  both armies were reinforcing themselves and friedrichs for obvious reasons in the first weeks especially became much the stronger once in may and again afterwards weary of the pace things went at he had resolved on having neisse at once on attacking neipperg in his strong camp there and cutting short the tedious janglings and uncertainties he advanced to grotkau accordingly some twelve or fifteen miles nearer neisse 28th maystayed till 9th june quite within wind of neipperg and his outposts but found still on closer inspection that he had better waitand do so withal at a greater distance from neipperg and his pandour swarms he drew back therefore to strehlen northwestward rather farther from neisse than before and lay encamped there for nine or ten weeks to come not till the beginning of august did there fall out any military event pandour skirmishing in plenty but nothing to call an event and not till the end of august any that pointed to conclusive results as it was at strehlen where mostly these diplomacies went on and the camp of strehlen was the final and every way the main one it may stand as the representative of these diplomatizing camps to us and figure as the sole one which in fact it nearly was  strehlen is a pleasant little town nestled prettily among its granite hills the steeple of it visible from mollwitz some twentyfive miles west of brieg some thirty south of breslau and about as far northwest of neisse there friedrich and his prussians lie under canvas mainly with outposts and detachments sprinkled about under roofsa camp of strehlen more or less imaginable by the reader and worth his imagining such a camp if not for soldiering yet for negotiating and wagging of diplomatic wigs as there never was before here strangely shifted hither is the centre of european politics all summer from the utmost ends of europe come ambassadors to strehlen from spain france england denmark hollandthere are sometimes nine at once how many successively and in total i never knew heldengeschichte i 932 they lodge generally in breslau but are always running over to strehlen there sits properly speaking the general secret parliament of europe and from most countries except austria representatives attend at strehlen or go and come between breslau and strehlen submissive to the evils of fieldlife when need is a surprising thing enough to mankind and big as the world in its own day though gone now to small bulkone human figure pretty much all that is left of memorable in it to mankind and us  french belleisle we have seen who is gone again long since on his wide errands fat valori too we have seen who is assiduously here the other figures except the english can remain dark to us of montijos the eminent spaniard a brown little man magnificent as the kingdom of the incas with half a page of titles half a peck fiveandtwenty or more of handles to his little name if you should ever require it who finding matters so backward at frankfurt and nothing to do there has been out in the interim touring to while away the tedium and is here only as sequel and corroboration of belleislesay as bottleholder or as highwrought peacockstail to belleisleof the eminent montijos i have to record next to nothing in the shape of negotiation treaty with the termagant was once proposed by him here which friedrich in his politest way declined and shall mention only that his domestic arrangements were sumptuous and commodious in the extreme let him arrive in the meanest village destitute of human appliances and be directed to the hut where he is to lodgestraightway from the fourgons and baggagechests of montijos is produced first of all a round of arras hangings portable tables portable stove gold plate and silver thus with waxlights wines of richest vintage exquisite cookeries montijos lodges a king everywhere creating an aladdins palace everywhere able to say like the sage bias omnia mea naecum porto these things are recorded of montijos what he did in the way of negotiation has escaped mens memory as it could well afford to do  of hyndfords appurtenances for lodging we already had a glimpse through busching oncepointing towards solid dinnercomforts rather than arras hangings and justifying the english genius in that respect the weight of the negotiations fell on hyndford it is between him and french valori that the matter lies montijos and the others being mere satellites on their respective sides much battered upon this hyndford by refractory hanoverians pitting george as elector against the same george as king and egging these two identities to woful battle with each otherlay me at his majestys feet full length and let his majesty say which is which then a heavy eating haggling unpleasant kind of mortal this hyndford bites and grunts privately in a stupid ferocious manner against this young king one of the worst of men who will not take up the cause of liberty at all and is not made in the image of hyndford at all they are dreadfully stiff reading those despatches of hyndford but they have particles of current news in them interesting glimpses of that same young kinglikewise of hyndford laid at his majestys feet and begging for self and brothers any good benefice that may fall vacant we can discern too a certain rough tenacity and horsedealer finesse in the man a broadbased shrewdly practical scotch gentleman wide awake and can conjecture that the diplomatic function in that element might have been in worse hands he is often laid metaphorically at the kings feet king of englands and haunts personally the king of prussias elbow at all times watching every glance of him like a british housedog that will not be taken in with suspicious travellers if he can help it and casting perpetual horoscopes in his dull mind  of friedrich and his demeanor in this strange scene centre of a world all drawing sword and jumbling in huge diplomatic and other delirium about his ears the reader will desire to see a direct glimpse or two as to the sad general imbroglio of diplomacies which then weltered everywhere readers can understand that it has at this day fallen considerably obscure as it deserved to do and that even friedrichs share of it is indistinct in parts the game wide as europe and one of the most intricate ever played by diplomatic human creatures was kept studiously dark while it went on and it has not since been a pleasant object of study many of the documents are still unpublished inaccessible so that the various moves in the game especially what the exact dates and sequence of them were upon which all would turn are not completely ascertainablenor in truth are they much worth hunting after through such an element one thing we could wish to have out of it the one thing of sane that was in it the demeanor and physiognomy of friedrich as there manifested friedrich alone or pretty much alone of all these diplomatic conjurers having a solid veritable object in hand the restthe spiders are very welcome to it who of mortals would read it were it made never so lucid to him such traits of friedrich as can be sifted out into the conceivable and indubitable state the reader shall have the extinct bedlam that begirdled friedrich far and wide need not be resuscitated except for that object of friedrichs fairness or of friedrichs trickiness machiavelism and attorneyism readers will form their own notion as they proceed on one point they will not be doubtful that here is such a sharpness of steady eyesight like the lynxs like the eagles and privately such a courage and fixity of resolution as are highly uncommon  april 26th 1741 in the same days while belleisle arrived in the camp at mollwitz and witnessed that fine opening of the cannonade upon brieg excellency hyndford got to berlin and on notifying the event was invited by the king to come along to breslau and begin business england has been profuse enough in offering her good offices with austria towards making a bargain for his prussian majesty but is busy also at the hague concerting with the dutch some strong joint resolutionresolution openly to advise friedrich to withdraw his troops from silesia by way of starting fair towards a bargain a very strong resolution they and the gazetteers think it and ask themselves is it not likely to have some effect their high mightinesses have been screwing their courage and under english urgency have decided april 24th heldengeschichte i 964 the advice itself a very mildspoken piece but of riskish nature think the dutch is given ib 965 966 yes we will jointly so advise and friedrich has got inkling of it from rasfeld his minister there hyndfords first business were the dutch excellency once come up but those dutch are always hanging astern is to present said advice and try what will come of that an advice now fallen totally insignificant to the universe and to usonly that readers will wish to see how friedrich takes it and if any feature of friedrich discloses itself in the affair     excellency hyndford has his first audience camp of mollwitz may 7th and friedrich makes a most important treatynot with hyndford  may 2d hyndford arrived in breslau and after some preliminary flourishings and difficulties about posthorses and furnitures in a seat of war got to brieg and thence may 7th to the camp camp of mollwitz still which is about an english mile offpodewils escorting him from brieg and what we note farther pollnitz too our poor old pollnitz some kind of chief goldstick whom we did not otherwise know to be on active duty in those rude scenes belleisle had passed through breslau while hyndford was theream unable to inform your lordship what success he has had brieg siege is done only three days ago castle all lying black and the new trenching and fortifying hardly begun in a word may 7th 1741 about 11 am excellency hyndford is introduced to the kings tent and has his first audience goldstick having done his motions none but podewils is left present who sits at a table taking notes of what is said podewilss notes are invisible to me but here in authentic though carefully compressed state is hyndfords minute narrative  excellency hyndford mentioned the instructions he had as to good offices friendship and so forth but his prussian majesty had hardly patience to hear me out and said in a passion we rise where possible hyndfords own wording readers will allow for the leaden quality in some partsking in a passion how is it possible my lord to believe things so contradictory it is mighty fine all this that you now tell me on the part of the king of england but how does it correspond to his last speech to his parliament 19th april last when mr viner was in such minority of one and to the doings of his ministers at petersburg a pretty partitiontreaty that and the excellency finch still busy as i know and at the hague excellency trevor there and this beautiful jointresolution and advice which is coming to stir up allies against me i have reason rather to doubt the sincerity of the king of england they perhaps mean to amuse me that is friedrichs real opinion his letter to podewils ranke ii 268 but by god they are mistaken i will risk everything rather than abate the least of my pretensions  poor hyndford said and mumbled what he could knew nothing what instructions finch had trevor had andking my lord there seems to be a contradiction in all this the king of england in his letter tells me you are instructed as to everything and yet you pretend ignorance but i am perfectly informed of all and i should not be surprised if after all these fine words you should receive some strong letter or resolution for mejointresolution to advise for example  hyndford not in the strength of conscious innocence stands silent the king in his heat of passion said to podewilsking to podewils on the sudden write down that my lord would be surprised as he should be to receive such instructions a mischievous sparkle half quizzical half practical considerably in the friedrich stylehyndford quite struck my lord with this strange way of acting and of poking into one protests with angry grunt and was put extremely upon my guard of course podewils did net write  hyndford europe is under the necessity of taking some speedy resolution things are in such a state of crisis like a fever in a human body got to such a height that quinquina becomes necessary  that expression made him smile and he began to look a little cooler shall we apply to vienna your majesty  friedrich follow your own will in that  hyndford would your majesty consent now to stand by his excellency gotters original offer at vienna on your part agree namely in consideration of lower silesia and breslau to assist the queen with all your troops for maintenance of pragmatic sanction and to vote for the grandduke as kaiser  king yes what the reader may take notice of and date for himself  hyndford what was the sum of money then offered her hungarian majesty  king hesitated as if he had forgotten podewils answered three million florins 300000 pounds  king i should not value the money if money would content her majesty i would give more here was a long pause which i did not breaknor would the king podewils reminded me of an idea we had been discoursing of together on his suggestion my lord which i really think is of importance and worth your lordships consideration whereupon on such hint  hyndford would your majesty consent to an armistice  friedrich yes but counts on his fingers may june till he comes to december not for less than six monthstill december 1st by that time they could do nothing the season out by that time  hyndford his excellency podewils has been taking notes if i am to be bound by them might i first see that he has mistaken nothing  king certainlypodewilss noteprotocol is found to be correct in every point hyndford with some slight flourish of compliments on both sides bows himself away invited to dinner which he accepts will surely have that honor before returning to breslauand so the first audience has ended hyndfords despatches breslau 5th and 13th may 1741 are in statepaper office like the rest of hyndfords also in british museum additional mss 11365 c the rough draughts of them baronay and pandours are aboutthis is ten days before the ziethen feat on baronaybut no pandour now or afterwards will harm a british excellency  these utterances of friedrichs the more we examine them by other lights that there are become the more correctly expressive of what friedrichs real feelings were on the occasion much contrary perhaps to expectation of some readers and indeed we will here advise our readers to prepare for dismissing altogether that notion of friedrichs duplicity mendacity finesse and the like which was once widely current in the world and to attend always strictly to what friedrich says if they wish to guess what he is thinkingthere being no such thing as mendacity discoverable in friedrich when you take the trouble to inform yourself mendacity my friends how busy have the owls been with friedrichs memory in different countries of the worldperhaps even more than their sad wont is in such cases for indeed he was apt to be of swift abrupt procedure disregardful of owleries and gave scope for misunderstanding in the course of his life but a veracious man he was at all points not even conscious of his veracity but had it in the blood of him and never looked upon mendacity but from a very great height indeed he does not except where suitable at least he never should express his whole meaning but you will never find him expressing what is not his meaning reticence not dissimulation and as to finessedo not believe in that either in the vulgar or bad sense truly you will find his finesse is a very fine thing and that it consists not in deceiving other people but in being right himself in well discerning for his own behoof what the facts before him are and in steering which he does steadily in a most vigilant nimble decisive and intrepid manner by monition of the same no salvation but in the facts facts are a kind of divine thing to friedrich much more so than to common men this is essentially what religion i have found in friedrich and let me assure you it is an invaluable element in any mans religion and highly indispensable though so often dispensed with readers especially in our time english readers who would gain the least knowledge about friedrich in the extinct bedlam where his work now lay have a great many things to forget and sad strata of owldroppings ancient and recent to sweep away  to friedrich a bargain with austria which would be a getting into port in comparison to going with the french in that distracted voyage of theirs is highly desirable shall i join with the english in hope of some tolerable bargain from austria shall i have to join with the french in despair of any readers may consider how stringent upon friedrich that question now was and how ticklish to solve and it must be solved soonunder penalty of being left with no ally at all as friedrich expresses himself while the whole world is grouping itself into armed heaps for and against if the english would but get me a bargain friedrich dare not think they will nay scanning these english incoherences these contradictions between what they say here and what they do and say elsewhere he begins to doubt if they zealously wish itand at last to believe that they sincerely do not wish it that they mean to amuse me as he said to hyndfordtill my french chance too is over to amuse me but par dieu his notes to podewils of which ranke who has seen them gives us snatches are vivid in that sense i should be ashamed if the cunningest italian could dupe me but that a lout of a hanoverian should do itand podewils has great difficulty to keep him patient yet a little valori being so busy on the other side and the time so pressing here are some dates and some comments which the reader should take with himhere is a very strange issue to the jointresolution of a strong nature now on hand  a few days after that first audience ginkel the dutch excellency with the due papers in his pocket did arrive excellency hyndford who is not without rough insight into what lies under his nose discovers clearly that the grand dutchenglish resolution or jointexhortation to evacuate silesia will do nothing but mischief and at his own risk persuading ginkel also to delay sends a courier to england before presenting it and from england in about a fortnight gets for answer do harm think you hm hapresent it all the same and modify by assurances afterwardsas if these would much avail this is not the only instance in which st jamess rejects good advice from its hyndford the pity would be greater were not the business what it is podewils has the greatest difficulty to keep friedrich quiet till hyndfords courier get back and on his getting back with such answer present it all the same friedrich will not wait for that ceremony or delay a moment longer friedrich has had his valori at work all this while valori and podewils and endless correspondence and consultation going on and things hypothetically almost quite ready so that  june 5th 1741 friedrich spurring podewils to the utmost speed and ordering secrecy on pain of death signs his treaty with france a kind of provisional offandon treaty i take it to be which was never published and is thought to have had many ifs in it signs this treatyand next day june 6th such is the impetuosity of haste instructs his rasfeld at the hague you will beforehand inform the high mightinesses in regard to that advice of april 24th which they determined on giving me through the excellency herr von ginkel along with excellency hyndford that such advice can by me only be considered as a blind complaisance to the court of viennas improper urgencies improper in such a matter that for certain i will not quit silesia till my claims be satisfied and the longer i am forced to continue warring for them here wasting more resource and risk upon them the higher they will rise heldengeschichte i 963 and this is what comes of that terribly courageous dutchenglish jointresolution of a strong nature it has literally cut before the point the exhortation is not yet presented but the treaty with france is signed in virtue of it  undoubtedly this of june 5th is the most important treaty in the austriansuccession war and the cardinal element of friedrichs procedure in that adventure and it has never been published nor till herr professor ranke got access to the prussian archives has even the date of signing it been rightly known but is given two or three ways in different express collections of treaties scholl ii 297 copying flassan hist de la diplom franc v 142 gives 5th july as the date adelung ii 357 390 441 guesses that it was in august valori i 108 who was himself in it gives the correct datebut then his editor thought inquiring readers was such a sloven and ignoramus see stenzel iv 143 ranke ii 274 herr ranke knows this treaty and the correspondences especially friedrichs correspondence with podewils preparatory to it and speaks as his wont is several exact things about it thanks to him in the circumstances i wish it could be made even with his help fully intelligible to the reader for were the treaty never so express surely the mode of keeping it on both parts was very strange and that latter concerns us somewhat  a very fastandloose treaty to all appearance outwardly it is a mere treaty of alliance each party guaranteeing the other for fifteen years without mention made of the joint belleisle adventure now in the wind but then like the postscript to a ladys letter there come secret articles bearing upon that essential item how france in the course of this current season 1741 is to bring an army across the rhine in support of its friend kurbaiern versus austria is in the same term of time to make sweden declare war on russia important for friedrich who is never sure a moment that those russians will not break in upon him and finally most important of all that france guarantees lower silesia with breslau to his prussian majesty in return for which his prussian majestywill do what it is really difficult to say what be a true ally and second to france in its grand german adventure not at all friedrich does not yet know nor does belleisle himself quite precisely what the grand german adventure is and friedrichs wishes never were nor will be for the prosperity of that support france at least in its small bavarian antiaustrian adventure by no means definitely even that maintain myself in lower silesia with breslau and fight my best to such end really that you might say is in substance the most of what friedrich undertakes though inarticulately he finds himself bound to much moreand will frankly go into it if you do as you have said and unless you do will not never was a more contingent treaty unless you stir up sweden messieurs unless you produce that rhine army unless such is steadily friedrichs attitude long after this he refuses to say whom he will vote for as kaiser fortune of war will decide it answers he in regard to that and to many other things and keeps himself to an incomprehensible extent loose ready for weeks and months after to make bargain on his own silesian affair with anybody that can ranke ii 271 275 280  for indeed the french also are very contingent fleury hanging one way belleisle pushing another and know not how far they will go on the grand german adventure nor conclusively whether at all here is an anecdote by friedrich himself valori was one night with him and on rising to take leave the fat hand sticking probably in the big waistcoatpocket twitched out a little diplomaticlooking note which friedrich with gentle adroitness permissible in such circumstances set his foot upon till valori had bowed himself out the note was from amelot french minister of the foreign department dont give his prussian majesty glatz if it can possibly be helped very well thought friedrich and did not forget the fine little note on burning it oeuvres de frederic ii 90 there went in french couriers bags a great many such to austria some of them of far more questionable tenor within the next twelve months  two things we have to remark first that friedrich with an eye to real business on his part in the bavarian adventure in which kurpfalz is sure to accompany volunteered like a real man of business and much to belleisles surprise to renounce the bergjulich controversy and let kurpfalz have his way that there might be no quarrelling among allies this too is contingent but was gladly accepted by belleisle second that belleisle had instructed valori not to insist on active help from friedrich in the german adventure but merely to stipulate for his neutrality throughout in case they could get no more how joyfully would friedrich have accepted thishad valori volunteered with it which he did not ranke ii 280 but after all in result it was the same and had to beplus only a great deal of clamor by and by from the french and the gazetteers about the article in question  was there ever so contingent a treaty before it is signed breslau 5th june 1741 and both parties have their hands loose and make use of their liberty for months to come nay in some sort all along feeling how contingent it was friedrich did not definitely tie himself till 4th november next five months after when he signed the frenchbavarian treaty renounced bergjulich controversies and fairly went into the frenchbavarian smaller french adventure into the greater or widewinged belleisle one he never went nor intended to goperhaps even the contrary if needful readers may try to remember these elucidative items riddled from the immensities of dryasdust i have no more to give nor can afford to return upon it may not we well say as above a treaty thought to have many ifs in itand now 8th june comes solemnly the jointresolution itself like mustard under a flourish of trumpets three days after dinner  camp of grotkau 8th june hyndford and ginkel the same respectable old ginkel whom we used to know in friedrich wilhelms time having according to renewed order got out from breslau with that formidable dutchenglish advice or jointexhortation in their pocket did this day in the camp at grotkau present the same a very mildspoken piece though it had required such courage and which is not now worth speaking of things having gone as we see friedrich received it with a gracious mien infinitely sensible to the trouble his britannic majesty and their high mightinesses took with his affairs document should receive his best considerationwhich indeed it has already done and its answer withal a french treaty signed three days ago in virtue of it might i request a short private audience of your majesty solicits hyndford intending to modify by new assurances as biddensurely answers friedrich  the two excellencies dine with the king who is in high spirits after dinner hyndford gets his private audience does his best in the way of new assurances which produce what effect we can fancy among other things he appeals to the kings magnanimity how grand and generous it will be to accept moderate terms from austria to king interrupting my lord dont talk to me of magnanimity a prince acting not for himself but for his nation ought to consult his interest in the first place i am not against peace but i expect to have four duchies given me statepaper office hyndford breslau 12th june 1741  hyndford and ginkel slept that night in grotkau town at 4 next morning the king sent us word that if we had a mind to see the army on march just moving off strehlen way we might come out by the north gate we accordingly saw the whole army leave camp and march in four columns towards friedewald where marshal neipperg is encamped not a bit of it your excellency neipperg is safe at neisse amid inaccessible embankments and artificial mud and these are mere hussarpandour rabble out here whom a push or two sends home againwould it could keep them there but they are of sylvan or salvage nature affecting the shade and burst out for theft and arson sometimes at great distances no calculating where the kings army lay all that night upon their arms and encamped next morning the 10th i believe nothing happened that day for we were obliged to stay at grotkau for want of posthorses a good part of it  hyndford hears in secret opposition circles and lays the flattering unction to his soul and your lordships the king of prussias army as i am informed unless he will take counsel another campaign will go near to ruin everything is in the greatest disorder utmost dejection amongst the officers from highest to lowestfact being that the king has important improvements and new drillings in view to go on at strehlen cavalry improvements artillery improvements unknown to hyndford and the opposition and will not be ruined next campaign i hope the news we have here of the taking of carthagena is true concludes he alas your excellency  by a different hand from the southward hungarian regions far over the hills take this

miles down the fine donau country and is celebrating her coronation there as queen of hungary in a very sublime manner sunday 25th june 1741 that is the day of putting on your crowniron crown of st stephen as readers know the chivalry of hungary from palfy and esterhazy downward and all the world are there shining in loyalty and barbaric gold and pearl a truly beautiful young woman beautiful to soul and eye devout too and noble though illinformed in political or other science is in the middle of it and makes the scene still more noticeable to us see as the finish of the ceremonies she has mounted a high swift horse sword girt to her sidea great rider always this young queenand gallops hungary following like a comettail to the konigsberg kingshill so called no great things of a hill o reader made by barrow you can see to the top of the konigsberg there draws sword and cuts grandly flourishing to the four quarters of the heavens let any mortal from whatever quarter coming meddle with hungary if he dare adelung ii 293 294 chivalrous hungary bursts into passionate acclaim old palfy i could fancy into tears and all the world murmurs to itself with moistgleaming eyes rex noster this is in fact the beautifulest king or queen that now is this radiant young woman beautiful things have been and are to be reported of her and she has a terrible voyage just aheadlittle dreaming of it at this grand moment i wish his britannic majesty or robinson who has followed out hither could persuade her to some compliance on the silesian matter what a thing were that for herself and for all mankind just now but she will not hear of that and is very obstinate and her stupid hofraths equally and much more blamably so deaf to hard facts knocking at their door ignorant what noahsdeluges have broken out upon them and are rushing on inevitable  by a notable coincidence precisely while those swordflourishings go on at presburg marechal excellency belleisle is making his public entry into frankfurtonmayn 25th june 1741 adelung ii 399 frankfurt too is in cheery emotion streets populous with sunday gazers and critics of the sublime in spectacle this is not belleisles first entrance he himself has been here some time settling his household and a good many things but today he solemnly leads in his countess and appendages over from metz where madame and he officially reside in common times governor of metz one of his many officesleads in madame in suitably resplendent manner to kindle household fire as it were and indicate that here is his place till he have got a kaiser to his mind twin phenomena these two going on 500 miles apart unconscious of one another or of what kinship they happen to have     excellency robinson busy in the vienna hofrath circles to produce a compliance  britannic george both for pragmatics sake and for dear hanovers desires much there were a bargain made with friedrich how is the pragmatic to be saved at all if friedrich join france in its belleisle machinations thinks george and already here is that camp of gottin glittering in view like a drawn sword pointed at ones throat or at ones hanover nay in a month or two hence as the belleisle schemes got above ground in the shape of facts this desire became passionate and a bargain with prussia seemed the one thing needful for alas the reader will see there comes about that time a second sword the maillebois army namely pointed at ones throat from the french side of things so that a paladin of the pragmatic and hanoverian king of england knows not which way to turn georges sincerity of wish is perhaps underrated by friedrich who indeed knows well enough on which side georges wishes would fall if they had liberty which they have not but much overrates the astucity of poor george and his english ascribing as is often done to finespun attorneyism what is mere cunctation ignorance negligence and other forms of a stupidity perhaps the most honest in the world by degrees friedrich understood better but he never much liked the english ways of doing business georges desire is abundantly sincere not wholly resting on sublime grounds and grows more and more intense every day but could not be gratified for a good while yet  cooperating with hyndford from the vienna side is excellency robinson who has a still harder job of it there pity poor robinson o english reader if you can for indignation at the business he is in saving the liberties of europe thinks robinson confidently founding the english national debt answers fact and doing bottom the weaver with long ears in the miserablest pickleherring tragedy that ever wasthis is the same robinson who immortalized himself nine or ten years ago by the first treaty of vienna thricesalutary treaty which disjoined austria from bourbonspanish alliances and brought her into the arms of the grateful seapowers again imminent downfall of the universe was thus glory to robinson arrested for that time and now we have the same robinson instructed to sharpen all his faculties to the cutting pitch and do the impossible for this new and reverse face of matters what a change from 1731 to 1741 bugbear of dreadful austrianspanish alliance dissolves now into sunlit clouds encircling a beautiful austrian andromeda about to be devoured for us and the downfall of the universe is again imminent from spain and others joining against austria oh ye wigs and eximious wigblocks called righthonorable if a man sovereign or other were to stay well at home and mind his own visible affairs trusting a good deal that the universe would shift for itself might it not be better for him robinson who writes rather a heavy style but is full of inextinguishable heavy zeal withal will have a great deal to do in these coming years ancestor of certain valuable earls that now are author of immeasurable quantities of the diplomatic cobwebs that then were  to a modern english reader it is very strange that austrian scene of things in which poor robinson is puffing and laboring the ineffable pride the obstinacy impotency ponderous pedantry and helplessness of that dull old court and its hofraths is nearly inconceivable to modern readers stupid dilapidation is in all departments and has long been all things lazily crumbling downwards sometimes stumbling down with great plunges cash is done the world rising all round with plunderous intentions and hungry ruin you would say coming visibly on with sevenleague boots here is little room for carrying your head high among mankind high nevertheless they do carry it with a grandly mournful though stolid insolent air as if born superior to this earth and its wisdoms and successes and multiplicationtables and iron ramrodsreally with a certain greatness says somebody greatness as of great blockheadism in themselves and their neighborsand like some absurd old hindoo idol crockery idol of somnauth for instance with the belly of him smashed by battleaxes and the cartload of gold coin all run out persuade mankind that they are a god though in dilapidated condition that is our first impression of the thing  but again better seen into there is not wanting a certain worthily steadfast conservative and broadbased high air reminding you of kill our own mutton sir and the ancient english tory species solid and loyal though stolid ancient austrian tories that definition will suffice for usand toryism too the reader may rely on it is much patronized by the upper powers and goes a long way in this world nay without a good solid substratum of that what thing with never so many ballotboxes stumporators and liberties of the subject is capable of going at all except swiftly to perdition these austrians have taken a great deal of ruining first and last their relation to the then seapowers especially to england embarked on the cause of liberty fills one with amazement by no means of an idolatrous nature and is difficult to understand at all or to be patient with at all  of disposition to comply with prussia robinson finds in spite of mollwitz and the sad experiences no trace at vienna the humor at vienna is obstinately defiant simply to regard friedrich as a housebreaker or thief in the night whom they will soon deal with were they once on foot and implements in their hand swift ye seapowers where are the implements the cash that means implements the young hungarian majesty herself is magnificently of that opinion which is sanctioned by her bartensteins and wisest hofraths with hardly a dissentient old sinzendorf almost alone in his contrary notion and he soon dies robinson urges the dangers from france no hofrath here will allow himself to believe them to believe them would be too horrible depend upon it frances intentions are not that way and at the worst if france do rise against us it is but bargaining with france better so than bargaining with prussia surely france will be contentable with something in the netherlands what else can she want of us parings from that outskirt what are these compared with silesia a horrid gash into the vital parts and what is yielding to the king of france compared with yielding to your prussian king  it is true they have no money these blind dull people but are not the seapowers england especially there created by nature to supply money what else is their purpose in creation by natures law as the sun mounts in the ecliptic and then falls these seapowers in the cause of liberty will furnish us money no surrender talk not to me of silesia or surrender i will die defending my inheritances what are the seapowers about that they do not furnish more money in a prompt manner these are the things poor robinson has to listen to robinson and england it is selfevident at vienna have one duty that of furnishing money and in a prompt manner if you please sir why not prompt and abundant  an english soul has small exhilaration looking into those old expenditures and bullyings for want of promptitude but if english souls will solemnly under high heaven constitute a duke of newcastle and a george ii their captains of the march heavenward and say without blushing for it nay rejoicing at it in the face of the sun you are the most godlike two we could lay hold of for that objectwhat have english souls to expect my consolation is and alas it is a poor one the money would have been mostly wasted any way buy men and gunpowder with your money to be shot away in foreign parts without renown or use is that so much worse than buying ridiculous upholsteries idle luxuries frivolities and in the end unbeautiful potbellies corporeal and spiritual with it here at home i am struck silent looking at much that goes on under these starsand find that misappointment of your captains of your exemplars and guiding and governing individuals higher and lower is a fatal business always and that especially as highest instance of it which includes all the lower ones this of solemnly calling chief captain and king by the grace of god a gentleman who is not so and seems to be so mainly by malice of the devil and by the very great and nearly unforgivable indifference of mankind to resist the devil in that particular province for the present is the deepest fountain of human wretchedness and the head mendacity capable of being done  as for the brave young queen of hungary my admiration goes with that of all the world not in the language of flattery but of evident fact the royal qualities abound in that high young lady had they left the world and grown to mere costume elsewhere you might find certain of them again here most brave high and piousminded beautiful too and radiant with goodnature though of temper that will easily catch fire there is perhaps no nobler woman then living and she fronts the roaring elements in a truly grand feminine manner as if heaven itself and the voice of duty called her the inheritances which my fathers left me we will not part with these death if it so must be but not dishonorlisten not to that thief in the night maria theresa has not studied at all the history of the silesian duchies she knows only that her father and grandfather peaceably held them it was not she that sent out seckendorf to ride 25000 miles or broke the heart of friedrich wilhelm and his household pity she had not complied with friedrich and saved such rivers of bitterness to herself and mankind but how could she see to do itespecially with little george at her back and abundance of money this for the present is her method of looking at the matter this magnanimous heroic and occasionally somewhat female one  her husband the grand duke an inert but goodtempered wellconditioned duke after his sort goes with her him we shall see try various things and at length take to banking and merchandise and even mealdealing on the great scale our armies had most part of their meal circuitously from him says friedrich of times long subsequent now as always he follows loyally his wifes lead never she his wife being intrinsically as well as extrinsically the better man what other can he doof compliance with friedrich in this court there is practically no hope till after a great deal of beating have enlightened it out of deference to george and his ardors they pretend some intention that way and are willing to bargain your excellencyno doubt of it provided only the price were next to nothing  and so while the watchful edacious hyndford is doing his best at strehlen poor robinson blown into triple activity corresponds in a boundless zealous manner from vienna and at last takes to flying personally between strehlen and vienna praying the inexorable young queen to comply a little and then the inexorable young king to be satisfied with imaginary compliance and has a breathless time of it indeed his despatches passionately longwinded are exceedingly stiff reading to the like of us o reader what things have to be read and carefully forgotten what mountains of dust and ashes are to be dug through and tumbled down to orcus to disengage the smallest fraction of truly memorable well if in ten cubic miles of dust and ashes you discover the tongue of a shoebuckle that has once belonged to a man in the least heroic and wipe your brow invoking the supernal and the infernal gods my hearts desire is to compress these strehlen diplomatic horsedealings into the smallest conceivable bulk and yet how much that is not metal that is merely cinders has got through

but not all the folly by a great deal now however is robinsons time to ply them     excellency robinson has audience of friedrich camp of strehlen 7th august 1741  by unheardof entreaties and conjurations aided by these strokes of fate robinson has at length extorted from his queen of hungary and her wise hofraths something resembling a phantasm of compliance with which he hurries to breslau and hyndford hoping against hope that friedrich will accept it as a reality gets to breslau on the 3d of august thence to strehlen consulting much with hyndford upon this phantasm of a compliance hyndford looks but heavily upon itfrom us in this place far be it to look at allalas this is the famed scene they two had at strehlen with friedrich on monday august 7th reported by the faithful pen of robinson and vividly significant of friedrich were it but compressed to the due pitch we will give it in the form of dialogue the thing of itself falls naturally into the dramatic when the flabby parts are cut awayand was perhaps worthier of a shakspeare than of a robinson all facts of it considered in the light they have since got  scene is friedrichs tent prussian camp in the neighborhood of the little town of strehlen time 11 oclock am personages of it two british subjects in the high diplomatic line ponderous scotch lord of an edacious gloomy countenance florid yorkshire gentleman with important proposals in his pocket costume frizzled peruke powdered frills wristfrills and other shoebuckles flapped waistcoat courtcoat of antique cut and much trimming all this shall be conceived by the reader tight young gentleman in prussian military uniform blue coat buff breeches boots with alert flashing eyes and careless elegant bearing salutes courteously raising his plumed hat podewils in common dress who has entered escorting the other two sits rather to rearward taking refuge beside the writing apparatusfirst passages of the dialogue i omit mere pickeerings and beatings about the bush before we come to close quarters for robinson the florid yorkshire gentleman is charged to offerwhat thinks the readertwo million guilders about 200000 pounds if that will satisfy this young military king with the alert eyes  robinson two hundred thousand pounds sterling if your majesty will be pleased to retire out of silesia and renounce this enterprise  king retire out of silesia and for money do you take me for a beggar retire out of silesia which has cost me so much treasure and blood in the conquest of it no monsieur no that is not to be thought of if you have no better proposals to make it is not worth while talking these words were accompanied with threatening gestures and marks of great anger considerably staggering to the two diplomatic british gentlemen and of evil omen to robinsons phantasm of a compliance robinson apologetically hums and hahs flounders through the bad bit of road as he can flounderingly indicates that he has more to offer  king let us see then voyons what is there more  robinson with preliminary flourishings and flounderings yet confidently as now tabling his best card permitted to offer your majesty the whole of austrian guelderland lies contiguous to your majestys possessions in the rhine country important completion of these i am permitted to say the whole of austrian guelderland important indeed a dirty stripe of moorland if you look in busching about equivalent to half a dozen parishes in connemara  king what do you mean turning to podewilsquestce que nous manque de toute la gueldre how much of guelderland is theirs and not ours already  podewils almost nothing presque rien  king to robinson voici encore de gueuseries more rags and rubbish yet quoi such a paltry scraping bicoque as that for all my just claims in silesia monsieur his majestys indignation increased here all the more as i kept a profound silence during his hot expressions and did not speak at all except to beg his majestys reflection upon what i had saidreflection asks the king with eyes dangerous to beholdmy lord continues robinson heavily narrative his contempt of what i had said was so great kicking his boot through guelderland and the guilders as the most contemptible of objects and was expressed in such violent terms that now if ever as your lordship perceives it was time to make the last effort play our trumpcard down at once a moment longer was not to be lost to hinder the king from dismissing us which sad destiny is still too probable after the trumpcard trumpcard is this  robinson the whole duchy of limburg your majesty it is a duchy which i extolled the duchy to the utmost described it in the most favorable terms and added that the elector palatine old kurpfalz on one occasion had been willing to give the whole duchy of berg for it  podewils pardon monsieur that is not so the contrary of so kurpfalz was not ready to give berg for itwe are not deep in german history we british diplomatic gentlemen who are squandering now and of old so much money on it the aulic council falls into our arms like dead men but it is certain the elector palatine was not ready to give berg in that kind of exchange  king it is inconceivable to me how austria should dare to think of such a thing limburg are there not solemn engagements upon austria sanctioned and again sanctioned by all the world which render every inch of ground in the netherlands inalienable  robinson engagements good as against the french your majesty otherwise the barrier treaty confirmed at utrecht was for our behoof and hollands  king that is your present interpretation but the french pretend it was an arrangement more in their favor than against them  robinson your majesty by a little engineer art could render limburg impregnable to the french or others  king have not the least desire to aggrandize myself in those parts or spend money fortifying there useless to me am not i fortifying brieg and glogau these are enough for one who intends to live well with his neighbors neither the dutch nor the french have offended me nor will i them by acquisitions in the netherlands besides who would guarantee them  robinson the proposal is to give guarantees at once  king guarantees who minds or keeps guarantees in this age has not france guaranteed the pragmatic sanction has not england why dont you all fly to the queens succorrobinson inclined to pout if he durst intimates that perhaps there will be succorers one day yet  king and pray monsieur who are they  robinson hm hm your majesty russia for example which power with reference to turkey  king good sir good beau monsieur beau the russians it is not proper to explain myself but i have means for the russians a swedish war just coming upon russia to keep its hand in use so diligent have the french been in that quarter  robinson with some emphasis as a britannic gentleman russia is not the only power that has engagements with austria and that must keep them too so that however averse to a breach  king laying his finger on his nose mark himaloud and with such eyes no threats sir if you please no threats in a loud voice finger to nose and with such eyes looking in upon me  hyndford heavily coming to the rescue am sure his excellency is far from such meaning sire his excellency will advance nothing so very contrary to his instructionspodewils too put in something proper in the appeasing way  robinson sire i am not talking of what this power or that means to do but of what will come of itself to prophesy is not to threaten sire it is my zeal for the public that brought me hither and  king the public will be much obliged to you monsieur but hear me with respect to russia you know how matters stand from the king of poland i have nothing to fear as for the king of englandhe is my relation dear uncle in the pawnbroker sense he is my all if he dont attack me i wont him and if he do the prince of anhalt old dessauer out at gottin yonder will take care of him  robinson the common news now is rumor in diplomatic circles rather below the truth this time your majesty after the 12th of august will join the french king looks fixedly at him in silence sire i venture to hope not austria prefers your friendship but if your majesty disdain austrias advances what is it to do austria must throw itself entirely into the hands of franceand endeavor to outbid your majesty king quite silent  king was quite silent upon this head says robinson reporting silence guesses robinson founded most probably upon his consciousness of guiltwhat i florid yorkshire gentleman call guilt as being against the cause of liberty and usfrom time to time he threw out remarks on the advantageousness of his situation  king at the head of such an army which the enemy has already made experience of and which is ready for the enemy again if he have appetite with the country which alone i am concerned with conquered and secured behind me a country that alone lies convenient to me which is all i want which i now have which i will and must keep shall i be bought out of this country never i will sooner perish in it with all my troops with what face shall i meet my ancestors if i abandon my right which they have transmitted to me my first enterprise and to be given up lightlywith more of the like sort which friedrich in writing of it long after seems rather ashamed of and would fain consider to have been mock fustian provoked by the real fustian of sir thomas robinson who negotiated in a wordy highdroning way as if he were speaking in parliament says friedrich a friedrich not taken with that style of eloquence and hoping he rather quizzed it than was serious with it oeuvres de frederic ii 84though robinson and hyndford found in him no want of vehement seriousness but rather the reversehe concludes have i need of peace let those who need it give me what i want or let them fight me again and be beaten again have not they given whole kingdoms to spain naples at one swoop to the termagant as broken glass in that polishelection freak and to me they cannot spare a few trifling principalities if the queen does not now grant me all i require i shall in four weeks demand four principalities more nay i now do it being in sibylline tune i now demand the whole of lower silesia breslau includedand with that answer you can return to vienna  robinson with that answer is your majesty serious  king with that a most vehement young king no negotiating with him sir thomas it is like negotiating for the sibyls books the longer you bargain the higher he will rise in four weeks time he will demand four principalities more nay already demands them the whole of lower silesia and breslau a precious negotiation i have made of it sir thomas wideeyed asks a second time  robinson is that your majestys deliberate answer  king yes i say that is my answer and i will never give another  hyndford and robinson much flurried to podewils your excellency please to comprehend the proposals from vienna were  king messieurs messieurs it is of no use even to think of it and taking off his hat slightly raising his hat as salutation and finale he retired precipitately behind the curtain of the interior corner of the tent says the reporter exit king  robinson totally flurried to podewils your

7th august 1741friedrich has vanished into the interior of his tent and the two diplomatic gentlemen the wind struck out of them in this manner remain gazing at one another here truly is a young royal gentleman that knows his own mind while so many do not unspeakable imbroglio of negotiations mostly insane welters over all the earth the belleisles the aulic councils the british georges heaping coil upon coil and here notably in that now so extremely sordid murk of wiggeries inane diplomacies and solemn deliriums dark now and obsolete to all creatures steps forth one little human figure with something of sanity in it like a star like a gleam of steelshearing asunder your big balloons and letting out their diplomatic hydrogensalutes with his hat gentlemen gentlemen it is of no use and vanishes into the interior of his tent it is to excellency robinson among all the sons of adam then extant that we owe this interesting passage of historyauthentic glimpse face to face of the young friedrich in those extraordinary circumstances every feature substantially as above and recognizable for true many despatches his excellency wrote in this worldsixty or eighty volumes of them still leftbut among them is this one the angriest of mankind cannot say that his excellency lived and embassied quite in vain  the two britannic gentlemen both on that distressing monday and the day following had the honor to dine with the king who seemed in exuberant spirits cutting and bantering to right and left upon the court of vienna among other topics in a way which i robinson will not repeat to your lordship bade me for example as you pass through neisse make my compliments to marshal neipperg and you can say excellency robinson that i hope to have the pleasure of calling one of these dayspodewils who was civil pressed us much to stay over wednesday the 9th on thursday is to be a grand review one of the finest military sights to which the excellencies from breslau one and all are coming out but we having our despatches and expresses on hand pleaded business and declined in spite of podewilss urgencies and set off for breslau wednesday morningmeeting various excellencies by degrees all the excellencies on the road for that review we had heard of  readers must accept this robinsoniad as the last of friedrichs diplomatic performances at strehlen which in effect it nearly was and from these instances imagine his way in such things various letters there are to jordan principally some to algarotti both of whom he still keeps at breslau and sends for if there is like to be an hour of leisure the letters indicate cheerfulness of humor even levity in the writer which is worth noting in this wild clash of things now tumbling round him and looking to him as its centre but they otherwise though heartily and frankly written are to jordan and us as if written from the teeth outward and throw no light whatever either on things befalling or on friedrichs humor under them reading diligently we do notice one thing that the talk about fame gloire has died out not the least mention now of gloireperception now most probably that there are other things than gloire to be had by taking arms and that war is a terribly grave thing lightly as one may go into it at first this small inference we do negatively draw from the friedrich correspondence of those months and except this and the levity of humor noticeable we practically get no light whatever from it the practical soul and souls business of friedrich being entirely kept veiled there as usual  and veiled too in such a way that you do not notice any veilthe young king being as we often intimate a master in this art which useful circumstance has done him much ill with readers and mankind for if you intend to interest readersthat is to say idle neighbors and fellowcreatures in need of gossipthere is nothing like unveiling yourself witness jeanjacques rousseau and many other poor waste creatures going off in selfconflagration for amusement of the parish in that manner but may not a man have something other on hand with his existence than that of setting fire to it such the process terribly is to show the people a fine play of colors and get himself applauded and pathetically blubbered over alas my friends  it is certain there was seldom such a lifeelement as this of friedrichs in summer 1741 here is the enormous jumbling of a world broken loose boiling as in very chaos asking of him him more than any other how what enough to put gloire out of his head and awaken thoughtsterrors if you were of apprehensive turn surely no young man of twentynine more needed all the human qualities than friedrich now the threatenings the seductions big belleisle hallucinationsthe perils to you infinite if you miss the road friedrich did not miss it as is well known he managed to pick it out from that enormous jumble of the elements and victoriously arrived by it he alone of them all which is evidence of silent or latent faculty in him still more wonderful than the loudresounding ones of which the world has heard probably there was not in his history any chapter more significant of human faculty than this which is not on record at all     chapter iii  grand review at strehlen neipperg takes aim at breslau but another hits it  a day or two before that famous audience of hyndford and robinsons neipperg had quitted his impregnable camp at neisse and taken the field again in the hope of perhaps helping robinsons negotiation by an inverse method should robinsons offers not prove attractive enough as is to be feared a push from behind may have good effects neipperg intends to have a stroke on breslau to twitch breslau out of friedrichs hands by a private manoeuvre on new resources that have offered themselves  heldengeschichte i 982 and ii 227  in breslau which is by great majority protestant in creed and warmly prussian in temper there has been no oppression or unfair usage heard of to any class of persons and certainly in the matter of protestant and catholic there has been perfect equality observed true the change from favor and ascendency to mere equality is not in itself welcome to human creaturesone conceives for various reasons of lower and higher nature a minority of discontented individuals in breslau zealous for their creed and old perquisites sacred and profane who long in secret sometimes vocally to one another for the good old timeswhen souls were not liable to perish wholesale and people guilty only of loyalty and orthodoxy to be turned out of their offices on suspicion friedrich says it was mainly certain zealous old ladies of quality who went into this adventure and from whispering to one another got into speaking into meeting in one anothers houses for the purpose of concerting and contriving oeuvres ii 82 83 zealous old ladies of qualitythese we consider were the talkingapparatus or secretparliament of the thing but it is certain one or two official gentlemen syndic guzmar for instance and others not yet become exofficial had active hand in it and furnished the practical ideas  continual correspondence there was with vienna by those old ladies guzmar and the others shy of putting pen to paper and only doing it where indispensable zealous addresses go to her hungarian majesty oh may the blessed virgin assist your majestyaccompanied it is said with subscriptions of money poor old souls and what is much more dangerous and feasible there goes prompt notice to neipperg of everything the prussian army undertakes and the postscript always come and deliver us your excellency of these latter documents i have heard of some with syndic guzmars and other official hands to them generally such things can through accidental pandour channels were there no other easily reach neipperg though they do not always enough could neipperg appear at the gates of breslau in some concerted nighthour or push out suitable detachment on forcedmarch that wayit is evident to him he would be let in might smother the few prussians that are in the dom island and get possession of the enemys principal magazine and the metropolis of the province might not the enemy grow more tractable to robinsons seductions in such case  neipperg marches from neisse 1st6th august with his whole army first some thirty miles westward up the right or southern bank of the neisse then crosses the neisse and circles round to northward giving friedrich wide room orlich i 130 133 that night of robinsons audience when friedrich was so merry at dinner neipperg was engaged in crossing the river the second night after neipperg lay encamped and intrenched at baumgarten old scene of friedrichs pandour adventure while hyndford and robinson had got back to breslau in another day or so he may hope to be within forcedmarch of breslau to detach feldmarschall browne or some sharp head and to do a highly considerable thing  unluckily for neippergs adventure the prussians had wind of it some time ago they have got a false sister smuggled into that oldladies committee who has duly reported progress nay they have intercepted something in syndic guzmars own hand and everything is known to friedrich the protestant population and generally the practical quiet part of the breslauers are harassed with suspicion of some such thing but can gain no certainty nor understand what to do protestants especially who have been so zealous who were seen dropping down on the streets to pray while the muffled thunder came from mollwitz that day ranke ii 289fancy how it would now be were the tables suddenly turned and indignant orthodoxy made supreme again with memory fresh but in fact there is no danger whatever to them schwerin has orders about breslau schwerin and the young dessauer are maturely considering how to manage  readers recollect how podewils pressed the two britannic excellencies to stay in strehlen a day or two longer grand review with festivities just on hand whole of the foreign ministers in breslau invited out to see itthough hyndford and robinson would not consent but left on the 9th meeting the others at different points of the road next day thursday 10th august was in fact a great day at strehlen grand muster manoeuvring of cavalry above all whom friedrich is delighted to find so perfect in their new methods riding as if they were centaurs horse and man one entity capable of plunging home at full gallop in coherent masses upon an enemy and doing some good with him neippergs croatpeople and outpickets on the distant hillsides witnessed these manoeuvres ranke ii 288 i know not with what criticism furthermore about noontime there was heard mark it reader a distant cannonshot one and no more from the northern side which gave his majesty a lively pleasure though he treated it as nothing all the foreign ministers were on the ground doubtless with praises so far as receivable and in the afternoon came festivities not a few a great day in strehlenbut in breslau a much greater which explained to our two excellencies why podewils had been so pressing  august 10th at six in the morning schwerin and under him the young dessauerwho had arrived in the southwestern suburbs of breslau overnight with 8000 foot and horse and had posted themselves in a vigilant antineipperg manner there and laid all their plansappear at the nicolai gate and demand in the common way transit for their regiments and baggages bound northward as appears to leubus where something of pandour sort has fallen out so many troops or companies at a time that is the rule one quantity of companies you admit then close and bolt till it have marched across and out at the opposite gate after which open again for a second lot but in this caseowing to accident very unusual of a baggagewagon breaking down and people hurrying to help it forwardthe whole regiment gets in escorted as

general population an enthusiastic one es lebe konig friedrich rising to the welkin with insatiable emphasis seven times over on the least signal given neippergs adventure and orthodox female

have been waiting in agony of suspense will friedrich bargain on those gentle terms and help us with 100000 men far from it my friends how far my most important intelligence writes the russian envoy there some days ago 5 august 1741 not said to whom in ranke ii 324 n is that a bavarian war has broken out that kurbaiern is in passau god grant that monsieur robinson may succeed in his negotiation all here are in the completest irresolution and total inactivity till monsieur robinson return or at least send news of himself     chapter iv  friedrich takes the field again intent on having neisse  this breslau adventure which had yielded friedrich so important an acquisition was furthermore the cause of ending these strehlen inactivities and of recommencing field operations august 11th neipperg provoked by the grievous news just come from breslau pushes suddenly forward on schweidnitz by way of consolation schweidnitz not so strong as it might be made where the prussians have a principal magazine one might at least seize that thinks neipperg in his vexed humor but here too friedrich was beforehand with him broke out rapidly enough to reichenbach westward which bars the neipperg road to schweidnitz upon whichor even before which on rumor of it coming which was not yet trueneipperg half done with his first days march called halt prudently turned back and hastened baumgarten way to his strong camp at frankenstein again his hope in the schweidnitz direction had lasted only a few hours a hope springing on the mere spur of pique soon recognizable by him as futile and now anxieties for selfpreservation had succeeded it on neippergs part for now friedrich actually advances on him in a menacing manner hardly hoping neipperg will fight but determined to have done with the neisse business in spite of strong camps and cunctations if it be possible orlich i 137 138  it was august 16th when friedrich stirred out of strehlen august 21st when he encamped at reichenbach till september 7th he kept manoeuvring upon neipperg who countermanoeuvred with vigilance good judgment and would not come to action september 7th friedrich weary of these hagglings dashed off for neisse itself hoped to be across neisse river and be between neisse town and neipperg before neipperg could get up there would then be no method of preventing the siege of neisse except by a battle so friedrich had hoped but neipperg again proved vigilant  accordingly september 11th friedrichs vanguard was actually across the neisse had crossed at a place called woitz and had there got two pontoon bridges ready when friedrich in the evening came up with the main army intending to crossand was astonished to find neipperg taking up position in intricate ground near by on the opposite side ground so intricate hills bogs bushes of wood and so close upon the river there was no crossing possible and friedrichs vanguard had to be recalled two days of waiting of earnest ocular study no possibility visible on the third day friedrich gathering in his pontoons overnight marched off down stream neissewards but on the left or north bank of the river passed neisse town the river between him and it and encamped at gross neundorf several miles from neipperg and the river neipperg at an equal step has been wending towards his old camp which lies behind neisse between neisse and the hills there a river in front dams and muddy inundations all round him begirt with plentiful pandours neipperg waits what friedrich will attempt from gross neundorf  from gross neundorf friedrich persists twelve days 13th25th september studying endeavoring mere impossibility ahead and by this time what is much worth noting hyndford silently quitting breslau has got back to these scenes of war occasionally visible in friedrichs camp againon important mysterious business which will have results valori also is here in camp these two excellencies jealously eying one another both of them with teeth rather on edgeeurope having suddenly got into such a plunge as if the highest mountains were falling into the deepest seas since friedrich began this neipperg problem of hisin which after twelve days he sees mere impossibility ahead  on the twelfth day friedrich privately collects himself for a new method marches soon after midnight 26th september 2 am orlich i 144 fifteen miles down the river which goes northward in this part as the reader may remember crosses with all his appurtenances unmolested and takes camp a few miles inland or on the right bank and facing towards neisse again he intends to be in upon neipperg front the rear quarter and cut him off from mahren and his daily convoys of food daily food cut offthe thickestskinned rhinoceros the wildest lion cannot stand that here for neipperg is one point on which all his embankments and muddams will not suffice him thinks friedrich certain preliminary operations and military indispensabilities there first are for friedrichtown of oppeln to be got which commands the oder our rearward highway castle of friedland and the country between oder and neisse riverswhile these preliminary things are being done september 28thoctober 3d friedrich in person gradually pushes forward towards neipperg reconnoitring bickering with croats october 3d preliminaries done neippergs rear had better look to itself  neipperg well enough seeing what was meant has by this time come out of his muddams and impregnabilities and advanced a few miles towards friedrich neipperg lies now encamped in the hamlet of griesau a little way behind steinaupoor steinau which the reader saw on fire one night when friedrich and we were in those parts in spring last friedrichs camp is about five miles from neippergs on the other side of steinau a tolerable champaign country i should think mostly in stubble at this season nearly midway between these two camps is a pretty schloss called kleinschnellendorf occupied by neippergs croats just now of which prince lobkowitz he if i remember but it matters nothing an austrian general of mark far away at present is proprietor  friedrichs oppeln preparations are about complete and he intends to advance straightway hold for heavens sake your majesty exclaims hyndford getting hold of him one day waylaying him in fact for it is difficult owing to valori wait wait i have just been to theto the camp of neipperg silently gesticulates hyndford within a week all shall be right and not a drop of blood shed friedrich answers by silence chiefly to the effect tush tush but not quite negatively and does in effect wait we had better give the snatch of dialogue in primitive authentic form date is camp of neundorf september 22d  friedrich pausing impatiently on the way towards his tent milord de quoi sagitil a present what is it now then  hyndford should much desire to have some assurance from your majesty with regard to that neutrality of hanover you were pleased to promise all else is coming right hastening towards beautiful settlement were that settled  friedrich have not i great reason to be dissatisfied with your court britannic majesty as king of england and as elector of hanover is wonderful milord when you say a thing is white schweichelt the hanoverian excellency calls it black and vice versa but i will do your king no harm none i say follow me to dinner dinner is cold by this time and we have made more than one person think of us swift and exit hyndfords despatch neisse 4th october 1741  this is a strange motion on the part of hyndford but friedrich severely silent to it understands it very well as readers soon will when they hear farther but marvellous things have happened on the sudden in these three weeks since the camp of strehlen broke up there have been such events strategic diplomatic a very avalanche of ruin hurling austria down to the nadir of which it is now fit that the reader have some faint conception an adequate not being possible for him or me  august l5th 1741 robinson reappears in presburg and precious surely are the news he brings to an aulic council fallen back in its chairs and staring with the wind struck out of it their expected seizure of breslau gone heels over head in that way friedrich imperiously resolute gleaming like the flash of steel amid these murky imbecilities and without the cession of silesia no peace to be made with him and all this is as nothing to news which arrives just on the back of robinson from another quarter  august 15th21st french army of 40000 men special army of belleisle sedulously equipt and completed visibly crosses the rhine at fort louis an island fortress in the rhine thirty miles below strasburg stones of it are from the old schloss of hagenausteps over deliberately there and on the sixth day is all on german ground these troops to be commanded by belleisle so soon as he can join them are to be the elector of bavarias troops kurbaiern generalissimo over belleisle and them fastes de louis xv ii 264 and they are on rapid march to join that ambitious kurfurst in his passau expedition and probably submerge vienna itself  and what is this we hear farther o robinson o excellencies hyndford schweichelt and company that another french army of the same strength under maillebois has in the selfsame days gone across the lower rhine at kaisersworth an hours ride below dusseldorf at kaisersworth ostensibly for comforting and strengthening kurkoln the lanky ecclesiastical gentleman kurbaierns brother their excellent ally should anybody meddle with him ostensibly for this but in reality to keep the seapowers and especially george of england quiet it marches towards osnabruck this maillebois army quarters itself up and down looking over into hanoverable to eat hanover especially if joined by the prussians and old leopold at any moment  these things happen in this month of august close upon the rear of that steelshiny scene in the tent at strehlen where friedrich lifted his hat saying t is of no use messieurswhich was followed by the seizure of breslau the wrong way never came such a cataract of evil news on an aulic council before the poor proud people all these months they have been sitting torpid helpless loftily stupid like dumb idols in flat despair as robinson says once only without the strength to be desperate  sure enough the seapowers are checkmated now let them make the least attempt in favor of the queen if they dare holland can be overrun from osnabruck quarter at a days warning little george has his hanoverians his subsidized hessians danes in hanover his english on lexden heath let him come one step over the marches maillebois and the old dessauer swallow him it is a surprising stroke of theatricalpractical art brought about to old fleurys sorrow by the genius of belleisle aud they say of madame chateauroux enough to strike certain governing persons breathless for some time and denotes that the universal hurricane or worldtornado has broken out it is not recorded of little george that he fell back in his chair or stared wider than usual with those fisheyes but he discerned well glorious little man that here is left no shadow of a chance by fighting that he will have to sit stockstill under awful penalties and that if maria theresa will escape destruction she must make her peace with friedrich at any price  this fine event 80000 french actually across the rhine happened in the very days while friedrich and neipperg had got into wrestle againneipperg just off from that rash march for schweidnitz and whirling back on rumor 15th august while the first instalment of the french were getting over friedrich must admit that the french fulfil their promises so far a week ago or more they made the swedes declare war against russia as covenanted war is actually declared at stockholm august 4th the faction of hats prevailing over that of nightcaps after terrible debates and efforts about the mere declaring of it as if that alone were the thing needed we mentioned this war already and would not willingly again one of the most contemptible wars ever declared or carried on but useful to friedrich as keeping russia off his hands at a critical time and conclusively forbidding help to austria from that quarter  marechal de belleisle wrapt in diplomatic and electioneering business cannot personally take command for the present but has excellent lieutenantsone of whom is comte de saxe moritz our old friend afterwards marechal de saxe among the finest french armies this of belleisles is thought to be that ever took the field so many of our nobility in it and what best officers segurs saxes future marechals we have army full of spirit and splendor come to cut germany in four and put france at last in its place in the universe here is courage here is patriotism of a sort and if this is not the good sort the divinely pious the humanly noblefashionable society feels it to be so and can hit no nearer newfashioned army of the oriflamme one might call this of belleisles kind of shamsacred french army quite in earnest as it thinksled on not by st denis and the virgin but by sungod belleisle and the chateauroux under these sad new conditions which did not prosper as expected  let the holy german reich take no offence said this army eager to conciliate we come as friends merely our intentions charitable and that only bavarian treaty of nymphenburg 18th may last binds us especially this time treaty of westphalia binds us sacredly at all times peaceable to you nay brotherly if only you will be peaceable which the poor reich all but austria and the seapowers strove what it could to believe  on reaching the german shore out of elsass every officer put the bavarian colors

deadly efforts on his part has mended her offers in these terrible circumstances and robinson is here again half of silesia or almost half provided his majesty will turn round and help against the french these secretly are robinsons rich offers the queen on consenting to these new offers had wrung her hands like one in despair and said passionately unless accepted within a fortnight i will not be bound by them admit his excellency to the honor of an interview solicits hyndford his offers are much mended notable to witness friedrich will not see robinson at all this time nor even permit podewils to see him signifies plainly that he wants to hear no more of his offers and that in fact the sooner he can take himself away from breslau it will be the better to that effect robinson rushing back in mortified astonished manner reports progress at presburg to that and no better high madam urges robinson still indefatigable the king of prussias help would be life his hostility is death at this crisis peace must be with him at any price price answers her majesty once if austria must fall it is indifferent to me whether it be by kurbaiern or kurbrandenburg stenzel iv 156

practical and the practicable strikes intoreaders from the following fragments of correspondence now first made public will gather for themselves what new course veiled in triple mystery hyndford had struck into four bits of notes well worth reading under their respective dates  1 excellency hyndford to secretary harrington two notes breslau 2d september 1711 on the heel of robinsons second miscarriage my lord all these contretemps are very unlucky at present when time is so precious for france is pressing the king of prussia in the strongest manner to declare himself but whatever eventual preliminaries may be probably agreed between them i still doubt if they have any treaty signedhave had one any time these three months since 5th june last signed sufficiently but of a most fastandloose nature neither party intending to be rigorous in keeping it i wish to god the court of vienna may be brought to think before it is too late hyndford papers brit mus additional mss 11366 ii fol 91  2 breslau 6th september i am not without hopes of succeeding in a project which has occurred to me on this occasion and which seems to be pretty well relished by some people properly by one individual goltz the kings adjutant and factotum who are in great confidence about the king of prussias person and i think it is the only thing that now remains to be tried and as it is the least of two evils i hope i shall have the king my masters approbation in attempting it and if the court of vienna will open their eyes they must see it is the only thing left to save them from utter destructionand finally here it is  since mr robinson left this placesooner you go the better siri have been sounding the people afore mentioned the individual afore hinted at whether the king of prussia would hearken to a neutrality with respect to the queen of hungary and at the same time fulfil his engagements to his majesty with respect to the defence of his majestys german dominions if she would give him the lower silesia with breslau at first they rejected it saying it was a thing they dared not propose however i have reason to believe by a letter i saw this day that it has been proposed to the king and that he is not absolutely averse to it i shall know more in a few days but if it can be done at all it must be done in the very greatest secrecy for neither the king nor his ministers wish to appear in it and i question if his minister podewils will be informed of it hyndford papers fol 97 98  3 excellency robinson in a flutter of excitement temporary hope and excitement about goltz to hyndford at breslau  presburg 8th september ns 1741 my lord i could desire your lordship to summon up if it were necessary the spirit of all your lordships instructions and the sense of the king of the parliament and of the whole british nation it is upon this great moment that depends the fate not of the house of austria not of the empire but of the house of brunswick of great britain and of all europe i verily believe the king of prussia does not himself know the extent of the present danger with whatever motive he may act there is not one not that of the mildest resentment that can blind him to this degree of himself perishing in the ruin he is bringing upon others with his concurrence the french will in less than six weeks be masters of the german empire the weak elector of bavaria is but their instrument prague and vienna may and probably will be taken in that short time will even the king of prussia himself be reserved to the last  upon this single transaction of your lordships affair with the mysterious individual depend the cita mors or the victoria laeta of all europe nothing will equal the glory of your lordship in the latter case but that to be acquired by the king of prussia in his immediate imitation of the great sobieskireputed savior of vienna o your excellency prince lichtenstein will if found in time upon his estates in bohemia be i believe the person to repair to the king of prussia the moment your lordship shall have signed the preliminaries once again give me leave my lord to express my most ardent wishes myt robinson

the campprussian majestys camp or bivouac in the munsterberg hillcountry on that march towards woitz for crossing the neisse upon neipperg which proved impracticableand that he could with pleasure tell me that the king agreed to this last trial although he would not nor could appear in it then this person read to me a paper but i could not see whether it was the kings hand or not for when i desired to take a copy he said he could not show me the original but dictated as follows  toute la basse silesie la riviere de neisse pour limite la ville de neisse a nous aussi bien que glatz de

which there are now needed two narratives the generally received in part mythical going first in the following strain  the queen has been in presburg mainly where the hungarian diet is sitting ever since her coronationceremony on the 11th september or 11th and 21st together the afflicted lady makes an appearance there which for theatrical reality has become very celebrated alas it is but three months since she galloped to the top of the konigsberg and cut defiantly with bright sabre towards the four points of the universe and already it has come to this hungarian magnates in high session the high queen enters beautiful and sadand among her ministers is noticeable a nurse with the young archduke some six months old a fine thriving child perhaps too wise for his age who became kaiser joseph ii in after time  the hungarian session is not on record for me hall of meeting magyar parliamentary eloquence unknown nor is any point conspicuously visible exact and certain except these alas not even these that it was the 11th of september that her majesty coming forward to speak took the child in her arms and there in a clear and melodiously piercing voice sorrow and courage on her noble face beautiful as the moon riding among wet stormy clouds spake as the hungarian archives still have it a short latin harangue in substance as follows hostile invasion of austria imminent peril to this kingdom of hungary to our person to our children to our crown forsaken by allab omnibus derelicti britannic majesty himself standing stockstillblamably one thinks the two swords being only at his throat and a good way offi have no resource but to throw myself on the loyalty and help of your renowned body and invoke the ancient hungarian virtue to rise swiftly and save me whereat the assembled

decreed what the magyars call their insurrection which is by no means of rebellious nature and many noblemen old count palfy himself a chief among them though past threescore and ten took the field at their own cost and the noise of the hungarian insurrection spread like a voice of hope over all pragmatic countries  a very beautiful heroic scene which has gone about the world circulating triumphantly through all hearts for above a century past and has only of late acknowledged itself mythicalnot true except as toned down to the following stingy prose pitch  presburg september 21st maria theresa since that fine coronationscene june 28th has had a mixed time of it with her hungarian diet soft passages alternating with hard a chivalrous people most consciously chivalrous but a constitutional withal very stiff upon their charter pacta conventa or whatever the name is who wrangle much upon privileges upon taxes and are difficult to keep long in tune ten days ago september 11th her majesty tried them on a new tack summoned them to her palace threw herself upon their nobleness no allies but you in the world and other fine things authentically as above legible in the archives to this dayso spake the beautiful young queen her eyes filling with tears as she went on and yet a noble fire gleaming through them which melted the hungarian heart a good deal and produced fine cheering some persons even shedding tears and voices of life and fortune to your majesty being heard in it in which humor the diet returned to its sessionhouse and voted the insurrectionor general arming of hungary county by county each according to its own contingentwith all speed in pursuance of her majestys implied desire this was voted in rapid manner but again in the detail of executing it was liable to haggles from this day however matters did decidedly improve pacta conventa or any remainder of them are got adjustedthe good queen yielding on many points so that september 20th grandduke franz is elected coregentlet him start from vienna instantly for instalmentand it is hoped the insurrection will go well and not prove haggly or hang fire in the details  at any rate

8 solemnity proceeds at the height of the solemnity when duke franz who is really risen now to something of a heroic mood in these emergencies and perils has just taken his oath and will have to speak a fit word or twothe nurse doubtless on hint given steps forward holds up baby a fine noticing fellow i have no doubtweighed sixteen pounds avoirdupois when born as if baby too fine mutual product of the two coregents were mutually swearing and appealing enough to touch any heart life and blood vitam et sanguinem for our queen and kingdom exclaims the grandduke among other things yes vitam et

neither more nor less it was some vienna pamphleteer of theatrical imaginative turn finding the thing apt a year or two afterwardswho by kneading different dates and objects into one boldly annihilating time and space and adding a little paintgave it that seductive mythical form from whom voltaire adopted it with improvements especially in the little harangue and from voltaire gratefully

means a bad thing still that of bringing in baby was a pretty touch in the domesticroyal wayand surely very natural and has no art in it or none to blame and not love rather on the part of the bright young mother now girdled in such tragic outlooks and so glad to have baby back at least and papa with him it is certain the insurrection was voted with enthusiasm and even became rapidly a fact and there was in few months hence an immense mounted force of hungarians raised which galloped and plundered having almost no pay and occasionally fenced and fought very diligently during all these wars hussars croats pandours tolpatches warasdins uscocks never heard of in war before who were found very terrible to look upon once in the imagination or with the naked eye but whose fighting talent against regular troops was next to worthless and who gradually became hateful rather than terrible in the military world  hanover september 27th britannic majesty reduced to that frightful pinch has at last given way treaty of neutrality for hanover engagement again to stick ones puissant pragmatic sword into its scabbard to be perfectly quiescent and contemplative in these frenchbavarian

humiliations he was just issuing from osnabruck by the eastern gate when mailleboiss people entered by the westernthe ugly shoes of them insulting his kibes in this manner and a furious antiwalpole parliament most perturbed of national palavers is waiting him at st jamess heavyladen little hercules that he is  karl albert lay at linz for a month longer till october 24th six weeks in all pausing in uncertainties in a pleasant dream of victory and sovereignty not pouncing on vienna as friedrich urged on the french and him to cut the matter by the root he does push forward certain troops comte de saxe with three horse regiments as vanguard ever nearer to vienna at last to within forty miles of it nay lighthorse parties came within twentyfive miles and there was skirmishing with mentzel a sanguinary fellow of whom we shall hear more who had got 1000 tolpatches under him and stood ruggedly at bay  karl albert has been sending out sovereign messages from linz letters to viennaone letter addressed to the archduchess maria theresa which came back unopened no such person known here october 2d he is getting homaged at linz by the stande of the provinceon summons sent some time beforemany of whom attend with a willing enough appearance kurbaiern rather a favorite in upper austria say some much fine processioning melodious haranguing there now is for karl albert and a pleasant dream of sovereignty at linz but if he do not pounce upon vienna till khevenhuller get it fortified khevenhuller is drawing home italian garrisons gradually gathering something like an army round him in khevenhullers imperturbable military head one of the clearest and hardest there is some hope above all if neippergs army were to disengage itself and be let loose into those parts     excellency hyndford brings about a meeting at kleinschnellendorf 9th october 1741  it was the second day after that homaging at linz when hyndford sept 22d with mysterious negotiations now nearly ripe for disengaging neipperg waylaid his prussian majesty and was answered as we saw with tush tush dinner is already cold  it must be owned these friedrichhyndford negotiations following on an express frenchprussian treaty of june 5th which have to proceed in such threefold mystery now and afterwards are of questionable distressing nature nor can the fact that they are escorted copiously enough by a correspondent sort on the french side and indeed on the austrian and on all sides be a complete consolationfar otherwise to the ingenuous reader smelfungus indignantly calls it an immorality and a dishonor a playing with loaded dice which in good part it surely was nor can even friedrich who has many pleas for himself obtain spoken acquittal unspoken accompanied with regrets and pity is all even friedrich can aspire to my own impression is smelfungus if candid would on clearer information and consideration have revoked much of what he says here in censure of friedrich at all events if asked where then is the specifical not superstitious want of veracity you ever found in friedrich and how otherwise than even as friedrich did would you most veracious smelfungus have plucked out your silesia from such an element and such a timehe would be puzzled to answer i give his fragment as i find it with these deductions  what negotiating we have had and shall have exclaims smelfungus my sad foregoerfit rather to be omitted from a serious history which intends to be read by human creatures bargaining promising nonperforming false in general as dicers oaths false on this side and on that from beginning to end intercepted letters from fleury letter dropping from valoris waistcoatpocket upon which friedrich claps his foot alas alas we are in the middle of a whole world of that friedrich knows that the french are false to him he by no means intends to be romantically true to them and that also they know what is the use to human creatures of recording all that melancholy stuff if sovereign persons want their diplomacies not to be swept into the ashpit there are two conditions especially one which is peremptory first that they should not be liessecond that they should be of some importance some wisdom which with known lies is not a possible condition to unravel cobwebs and register laboriously and date and sort in the sorrow of your soul the oaths of crowned dicerswhat use is it to gods or men having well dressed and sliced your cucumber the next clear human duty is throw it out of window in that foul laplandwitch world of seething diplomacies and monstrous wigged mendacities horribly wicked and despicably unwise i find nothing notable memorable even in a small degree except this aspect of a young king who does know what he means in it clear as a star sharp as cutting steel very dangerous to hydrogen balloons he stands in the middle of it and means to extort his own from it by such methods as there are  magnanimous i can by no means call friedrich to his allies and neighbors nor even superstitiously veracious in this business but he thoroughly understands he alone what just thing he wants out of it and what an enormous wigged mendacity it is he has got to deal with for the rest he is at the gamingtable with these sharpers their dice all coggedand he knows it and ought to profit by his knowledge of it and in short to win his stake out of that foul weltering mellay and go home safe with it if he can  very well my friend let us keep to windward of the diplomatic wizardscaldron let hyndford valori and company preside over it throwing in their eye of newt and limb of toad as occasion may be enough if the reader can be brought to conceive it and how the young kingwho perhaps alone had real business in this foul element and did not volunteer into it like the others though it now unexpectedly envelops him like a worldwhirlwind frightful enough if one spoke of that to anybody is struggling with his whole soul to get well out of it as supremely adroit all readers already know him his appearance what we called starlikealways something definite fixed and lucid in it  he is dexterously holding aloof from hyndford at present clinging to french valori as his chosen companion we may fancy what a time he has of it like a polygamist amid jealous wives it will quicken hyndford he perceives in these ulterior stages to leave him well alone hyndford accordingly as we have noticed could not see the king at all had to try every plan to watch waylay the king for a bit of interview when indispensable however hyndford with his neipperg in sight of the peril manages better than robinson with his aulic council at a distance besides he is a longheaded dogged kind of man with a surly edacious strength not inexpert in negotiation nor easily turned aside from any purpose he may have  between the two camps nearly midway lies a hamlet called kleinschnellendorf little schnellendorf to distinguish it from another schnellendorf called great which is a mile or two northwestward out of the straight line not far from the first of these poor hamlets lies a schloss or noble mansion likewise called kleinschnellendorf belonging to a certain count von sternberg who is not there at present but whose servants are and a party of croats over them for some days back a pleasant airy mansion among pleasant gardens well shut out from the intrusion of the world upon this castle of kleinschnellendorf judicious hyndford has cast his eyeand neipperg now come to a state of readiness approves the suggestion of hyndford and promptly at the due moment converts it into a fact arrests namely on a given morning the last act of his croats there who withdrew directly with their batch of prisoners every living soul within or about the mansionsuspected of treason only for one dayand in this way has it reduced to the comfortable furnished solitude of sleeping beautys castle a place fit for high persons to hold a meeting in which shall remain secret as the grave such a thing was indispensable for friedrich keeping shy of hyndford as he well may with a valori watching every step has by words by silences when hyndford could waylay him for a moment sufficiently indicated what he will and what he will not and for one indispensable condition in the present thricedelicate adventure he will not sign anything will give and take word of honor and fully bind himself but absolutely not put pen to paper at all neipperg being willing too judicious hyndford finds a medium let the parties meet at kleinschnellendorf and judicious hyndford be there with pen and paper orlich i 146 heldengeschichte i 1009  monday 9th october 1741 accordingly there is meeting to be held hyndford neipperg with his general lentulus a swissaustrian general whose son served under friedrich afterwards these wait for friedrich on the one handto fix some cartel for exchange of prisoners it is saidin these precincts of kleinschnellendorf which are silent vacant yet comfortably furnished like sleeping beautys castle and friedrich on the other hand is actually riding that way with goltzvisiting outposts reconnoitring so to speak dine you with prince leopold the young dessauer my fine valori i fear i shant be home to dinner he had said when going off hoodwinking his fine valori who suspects nothing at a due distance from kleinschnellendorf the very groom is left behind and friedrich with goltz only pushes on to the schloss all ready there salutations soon done business set about perfectedand hyndford with pen and ink in his hand he by way of protocol or summary of what had been agreed on on mutual word of honor most brief but most clear on this occasion writes a state paper which became rather famous afterwards this is the paper in condensed state though clear it is very dull  kleinschnellendorf 9th october 1741 britannic excellency hyndford testifies that here and now his majesty of prussia and neipperg on behalf of her hungarian majesty do solemnly though only verbally agree to the following four things  first that general neipperg on the 16th of the month this day week shall have liberty to retire through the mountains towards moravia unmolested or with nothing but shamattacks in the rear of him second that in consequence his prussian majesty on making shamsiege of neisse shall have the place surrendered to him on the fifteenth day third that there shall be nay in a sense there hereby is a peace made his majesty retaining neisse and silesia according to the limits known to usnothing said of glatz and that a complete treaty to that effect shall be perfected signed and ratified before the year is out fourth that these shamhostilities but only sham shall continue and that his majesty wintering in bohemia and carrying on shamhostilities to the satisfaction of the french shall pay his own expenses and do no mischief given in heldengeschichte i 1009 in c  to these four things they pledge their word of honor and hyndford signs and delivers each a copy unwritten a fifth thing is settled that the present transaction in all parts of it shall be secret as deathhis majesty expressly insisting that if the least inkling of it ooze out he shall have right to deny it and refuse in any way to be bound by it which likewise is assented to  here is a pretty piece of work done for ourself and our allies while valori is quietly dining with the prince of dessau the king stayed about two hours was extremely polite and even frank and communicative a very highspirited young king thinks neipperg reporting of it will not stand contradiction but a great deal can be made of him if you go into his ideas and humor him in a delicate dexterous way he did not the least hide his engagements with france bavaria saxony but would really so far as i neipperg could judge prefer friendship with austria on the given terms and seems to have secretly a kind of pique at saxony and no favor for the french and their plans orlich i 149 in condensed state  business being done this is hyndfords report the king who had been politeness itself took neipperg aside beckoning hyndford to be of the party i wish you too my lord to hear every wordhis britannic majesty knows or should know my intentions never were to do him hurt but only to take care of myself and pray inform him what is the fact that i have ordered my army in brandenburg to go into winterquarters and break up that camp at gottin friedrichs talk to neipperg is how he may assault the french with advantage join lobkowitz and what force he has in bohmen go right into your enemies before they can unite there if the queen prosper i shallperhaps i shall have no objection to join her by and by if her majesty fail well every one must look to himself these words hyndford listened to with an edacious solid countenance and greedily took them down hyndfords despatch breslau 14th october 1741  once more a curious glimpse perhaps imprudently allowed us in the circumstances into the real inner man of friedrich he had at this time now that the belleisle adventure is left in such a state no essential reason to wish the french ruinednor probably did he but only stated both chances as in the way of unguarded soliloquy and was willing to leave neipperg a sweet morsel to chew secret mode of corresponding with the court of austria is agreed upon not direct but through certain commandants till the peacetreaty be perfectedat latest by december 24th we hope and so bon voyage and well across the mountains m le marechal till we meet again and you excellency hyndford be so good you as write to mefor valoris behoofcomplaining that i am deaf to all proposals that nothing can be had of me and other letters pray of the like tenor all round to presburg to england to dresdenif the couriers are seized it shall be well your letter to myself let a trumpet come with it while i am at dinner and valori beside mecertainly your majesty answers hyndford and does it does all this which produces a soothing effect on valori poor soul     friedrich takes neisse by sham siege capture not sham gets homaged in breslau and returns to berlin  thus if the austrians hold to their bargain has friedrich in a most compendious manner got done with a business which threatened to be infinite by this short cut he for his part is quite out of the wastehowling jungle of enchanted forest and his foot again on the firm free earth if only the austrians hold to their bargain but probably he doubts if they will well even in that case he has got neisse stands prepared for meeting them again and in the mean while has freedom to deny that there ever was such a bargain  of the political morality of this game of fastandloose what have we to sayexcept that the dice on both sides seem to be loaded that logic might be chopped upon it forever that a candid mind will settle what degree of wisdom which is always essentially veracity and what of folly which is always falsity there was in friedrich and the others whether or to what degree there was a better course open to friedrich in the circumstancesand in fine it will have to be granted that you cannot work in pitch and keep hands evidently clean friedrich has got into the enchanted wilderness populous with devils and their worksand alas it will be long before he get out of it again his life waning towards night before he get victoriously out and bequeath his conquest to luckier successors it is one of the tragic elements of this kings life little contemplated by him when he went lightly into the silesian adventure looking for honor bright what he called gloire as one principal consideration hardly a year ago  neipperg

dessauer took the road for glatz country and the adjoining circles of bohemia there to canton himself peaceably according to contract and especially to have an eye upon glatz should the kleinschnellendorf engagement go awry in any point the king in his dialogue with neipperg had said several things about glatz and what a sacrifice he made there for the sake of speedy pace the french

marechal schwerin was lodged in a village about threequarters of a mile from headquarters one day he did me the honor to invite me to dinner and even offered me a horse to ride thither with him i found excellent company a superb repast and wine of the gods host and guests were in high spirits and the pleasures of the table were kept up so late that it was midnight when we rose i was obliged to return to headquarters having still to wait upon the king as usual the marechal was kind enough to lend me another horse but the groom mischievously gave me the charger which the marechal rode at the battle of mollwitz a very powerful animal and which from that day had grown very skittish  i was made aware of this circumstance before we were fairly out of the village and the night being of the darkest i twenty times ran the risk of breaking my neck we had to pass over a hill to get to headquarters when i reached the top a shudder came over me and my hair stood on end i had nobody with me but a strange groom the country all around was infested with troops and marauders i was mounted on an unmanageable horse under my feet so to say i saw the bombardment of the town of neisse i heard the roar of cannon and doleful shrieks above our batteries the whole atmosphere was inflamed and to complete the calamity i missed the way and got lost in the darkness finally in descending the hill my horse frightened made a terrible swerve or sidejump i did not know the cause but after having with difficulty got him into the road again i found myself opposite to a deserter who had been hanged that day i was horribly disgusted by the sight the gallows being very low and the head of the malefactor almost parallel with mine i spurred on and galloped away from such unpleasant nightcompany at last i arrived at headquarters all in a perspiration i sent my horse back and went in to the king who asked me at once why i was so heated i made his majesty a faithful report of all my disasters he laughed

gone tourists note of 1858 at landshut as in some other towns it had been found good to remodel the town magistracy a little to make it partly protestant for one thing instead of catholic and austrian which it had formerly been details about the high controversies and discrepancies which had risen there we have absolutely none nor have the special functions of the magistracy what powers they had what work they did in the least become distinct to us we gather only that a certain nameless burgermeister probably austrian and catholic had by most gracious royal specialorder been at length relieved from his labors and therewith the much by him persecuted and afflicted herr theodorus spener been named burgermeister instead which respectable herr theodorus spener and along with him herr johann david fischer as rathssenior and herr johann caspar ruffer and also herr johann jacob umminger as new raths how many of the old being left i cannot say were accordingly on the 4th of december 1741 publicly installed and with proper solemnity took their places all landshut looking on with the conceivable interest and astonishment almost as at a change in the obliquity of the eclipticchange probably for the better  respectable herr theodorus spener we hope it is spener for they print him speer in one of the two places and we have to go by guess is ready with an installation speech on the occasion and his speech was judged so excellent that they have preserved it in print us it by no means strikes by its demosthenic or other qualities meanwhile we listen to it with the closest attention hoping in our great ignorance to gather from it some glimmerings of instruction as to the affairs humors disposition and general outlook and condition of landshut and silesia in that junctureand though a good deal disappointed have made an abstract of it in the english language which perhaps the reader too in his great ignorance will accept in defect of better scene is landshut among the giant mountains on the bohemian border of silesia an old stone town where there is from of old a busy trade in thread and linen town consisting as is common there of various narrow winding streets comparable to spiderlegs and of a roomy central marketplace comparable to the body of the spider wide irregular marketplace with the wooden spouts dry for the moment all projecting round it

burgermeister spener loquitur heldengeschichte ii 416 liable to abridgment here and there on warning given  i enter then in the name of the most holy trinity upon an office to which divine providence has appointed and the gracious and potent hand of a great king has raised me great as is the dignity giddy height of mayoralty in landshut though undeserved which the evermerciful has thus conferred upon me equally great and much greater is the burden connected therewith i confesshe confesses in highstalking earnest wooden language very foreign to us in every way 1 that his shoulders are too weak but that he trusts in god for 2 it is gods doing and he that has called spener will give spener strength the essential work being to do gods will to promote his honor and the common weal 3 that he comes out of a smaller office office not farther specified probably exterior to the rathscollege and subaltern to the late tyrannous mayor and it and has taken upon him the mayoralty of this town an evident fact but that the labor and responsibility are dreadfully increased and that the point is not increase of honor of respectability or income but of heavy duties a sonorous piousminded spener much more in earnest than readers now think  it is easy intimates he to govern a town if as some have perhaps done you follow simply your own will regardless of the sighs and complaints your subjects utter for injustice undergoneindifferent to the thought that the caprice of one town sovereign is to be glorified by so many thousand tears dim glance into the past history of landshut such town sovereign persecutes innocence stops his ears to its cry flourishes his sharp scourgeno one shall complain for is it not justice thinks such a town sovereign the reason is he does not know himself poor man has had his eye always on the duties of his subjects towards him and rarely or never on his towards them a sovereign mayor that governs by fearhe must live in continual fear of every one and of himself withal a weak basis and capable of total overturn in one day on the contrary the love of your burgher subjects that if you can kindle it will go on like a house on fire ausbruch eines feures and streams of water wont put it out and let us now take speners very words if a man keep the fear of god before his eyes there will be no need for any other kind of fear  i will therefore you especially highhonored gentlemen study to direct all my judicial endeavors to the honor of the great god and to inviolable fidelity towards my most gracious king and lord friedrich by decision of providenceat mollwitz and elsewhere  to the citizens of this town from of old so dear to me and now by royal grace committed to my charge and therefore doubly and trebly to be held dear i mean to devote myself altogether i will on every occasion and occurrence still more expressly than aforetime stand by them and when need is not fail to bring their case before the just throne of our anointed friedrich by decision of providence justice and fairness i will endeavor under whatever complexities to make my loadstar yes i shall and will by means of this my office equip myself with weapons whereby i may be capable to damp such humors intelligentien should such still be but i believe there are now none such as may repugn against the royal interest with possibility of being dangerous and to put a bridle on mouths that are unruly and to say much in little compass i will be faithful to god to my king and to this town  having now the honor and happiness to be put into official friendship with those gentlemen who as burgermeisters and as old and as new members of council have for long years made themselves renowned among us i will entertain in respect of the former the old a firm confidence that the zeal they have so strongly manifested for behoof of the most serene archducal house of austria will henceforth burn in them for our most beloved lands prince whom god has now given us that the fire of their lately plighted truth and devotion towards his royal majesty shall shine not in words only but in works and be extinguished only with their lives can that be o spener or speer are we alarmclocks that need only to be wound up and told at what hour and for whom god who puts kings in and casts them out has given to us a no less potent sovereign than supremely loving landsfather who by the renown of his more than royal virtues had taken captive the hearts of his future subjects and children still sooner than even by his arms familiar otherwise to victory he did the land and who shall be puissant and mighty enough now to lead mens minds in a contrary direction to control the most high power ruler over hearts and lands who had decreed it should be so and again to change this change hear spener he has taken great pains with his discourse and understands composition  this change highhonored gentlemen of the catholic persuasion is also for you a not unhappy one for our now as pious as wise king will especially in one most vital point take pattern by the king of all kings and means to be lord of his subjects only not of the consciences of his subjects he requires nothing from you but what you are already bound by god by conscience and duty to render to wit obedience and inviolable unbroken fidelity and by that and without more asked than that you will render yourselves worthy of his protection and become partakers of the royal favor nay you will render yourselves all the worthier in that high quarter and the more meritorious towards our civic commonweal the more you highhonored gentlemen of the catholic persuasion accept with all frankness of colleaguelove and amity me and the evangelical brother raths now introduced by royal grace and power and make the new position generously tenable and available to usand thereby bind with us the more firmly the band of peace and colleagueunity for helping up this dear and for some years greatly fallen town along with us  we for our poor part will one and all strive only to surpass each other in obedience and faith to our most gracious king we will as regents of the citizenry committed to us

drawing out their yarns  as well i as 1 the titular herr johann david fischer distinguished trader and merchant of this town who by his tradings in and beyond our silesian countries has made himself

citizenry of our townthat we bring a heart sincere and intent only on aiming at the welfare of a citizenry so loveworthy we have the firm purpose by gods grace so to order our walk and so to conduct our government that we may one day when summoned from our judgmentseats to answer before the universal judgmentseat of christ be able to say with that pious king and judge of israel lord thou knowest if we have walked uprightly before thee and we hope to understand that the rewards of justice in that life will be much more than those of injustice in this  we believe that the most high will in so far bless these our honest purposes and wholesome endeavors as that the actual fruits thereof will in time coming and when peace now soon expected which god grant has returned to us be manifest and that if in our office as is common we should rather have thorns of persecution than roses of recompense to expect yet to each of us there will at last accrue praise in the earth and reward in heaven hear spener  meanwhile we will unite all our wishes that the almighty may vouchsafe to his royal majesty our now alldearest duke and landsfather many long years of life and of happy reign and maintain

friedrich purposes to mend the kleinschnellendorf failure fortunes of the belleisle armament  we shall not dwell upon the movements of the french into germany for the purpose of overwhelming austria and setting up four subordinate little sovereignties to take their orders from louis xv the plan was of the mad sort not recognized by nature at all the diplomacy was wide expensive grandiose but vain and baseless nor did the soldiering that followed take permanent hold of mens memory human nature cannot afford to follow out these loud inanities and at a certain distance of time is bound to forget them as ephemera of no account in the general sum difficult to say what profit human nature could get out of such transaction there was no good soldiering on the part of the french except by gleams here and there bad soldiering for the most part and the cause was radically bad let us be brief with it try to snatch from it huge rotten heap of old exuviae and forgotten noises and deliriums what fractions of perennial may turn up for us carefully forgetting the rest  maillebois with his 40000 we have seen how they got to osnabruck and effectually stilled the warfervor of little george ii sent him home in fact to england a checkmated man he riding out of osnabruck by one gate the french at the same moment marching in by the other there lies maillebois ever since and will lie cantoned over westphalia not nearer than three leagues to the boundary of hanover for a year and more there let maillebois lie till we see him called away elsewither upon which the gallant little george checkmate being lifted will get into notable military activity and attempt to draw his sword againthough without success owing to the laggard dutch which also as british subjects if not otherwise the readers of this book will wish to see something of maillebois did not quite keep his stipulated distance of three leagues from the boundary being often short of victual and was otherwise no good neighbor among his fieldofficers there is visible sometimes in trouble about quarters and the like a marquis du chateletwho i find is husband or exhusband to the divine emilie if readers care to think of that

army army of the oriflamme as we have called itwhich would be belleisles were not he so overwhelmed with embassying and persuading the powers of germanythis since we last saw it has struck into a new course which it is essential to indicate the major part of it four rear divisions if readers recollect lay at ingolstadt its place of arms while the vanward three divisions under maurice comte de saxe flowed onward joining with bavaria at passau down the donau country to linz and farther terrifying vienna itself and driving all the court to presburg with fabulous moriamur pro rege nostro maria theresia but with actual armament of tolpatches pandours warasdins uscocks and the like unsightly beings of a predatory centaur nature which fine hungarian armament and others still more ominous have been diligently going on while karl albert sat enjoying his homagings at linz his pisgahviews viennaward and asking himself shall we venture forward and capture vienna then  the question is intricate and there are many secret biasings concerned in the solution of it friedrich before kleinschnellendorf time had written eagerly had sent schmettau with eager message push forward it is feasible even easy cut the matter by the root this they say was karl alberts own notion had not the french overruled himnot willing some guess he should get austria and become too independent of them all at once nay it appears karl albert had inducements of his own towards bohemia rather the french have had kursachsen to manage withal and there are interests in bohemia of his and theirsclippings of bohemia promised him as bribes besides that kingdom of moravia to get his 21000 set on march clippings of bohemia interests of kursachsens in that country asks karl albert with alarm and thinks it will be safer were he himself present there while saxony and france do the clippings in question sure enough he did not push on belleisle from the distance strongly opined otherwise karl albert himself had jealous fears about bohmen friedrichs importunities and urgencies were useless and the one chance there ever was for karl albert for belleisle and the ruin of austria vanished without return  karl albert has turned off leftwards towards his bohemian enterprises french bavarians saxons by their several routes since the last days of october are all on march that way we will mark an exact date here and there as fixed point for the readers fancy poor karl albert he had sat some six weeks at linzabout three weeks since that homaging there october 2dimaginary sovereign of upper austria looking over to vienna and the promised land in general and that fine pisgahview was all he ever had of it of austrian or other conquests earthly or heavenly there came none to him in this adventuremere minus quantities they all proved for a few weeks more there are blended with awful portents an imaginary gleam or two in other quarters after which nothing but black horror and disgrace deepening downwards into utter darkness for the poor man belleisle is an imaginary sungod but the poor icarus tempted aloft in that manner into the earnest elements and melting at once into quills and rags is a tragic realitylet us to our dates  october 24th the bavarian troops who had lain at mautern on the donau some time forty miles from vienna and the promised land got under way againnot forward but sharp to left or northward towards the bohemian parts thither all the belleisle armaments are now bound and a general rallying of them is to be at prag for conquest of that country as more inviting than austria at present comte de saxe who had lain at st polten a march to southward of mautern he with the vanward of the great belleisle army bestirred himself at the same time and followed steadily karl albert in person was with saxe at a handy distance by parallel roads to prag may be about 200 miles across the mannhartsberg country clear out of austria into bohmen towards prag at budweis or between that and tabor towns of our old friend ziscas of which we shall hear farther in these wars towns important by their intricate environment of rock and bog far up among the springs of the moldauthere can these bavarians and this french vanward of belleisle halt a little till the other parties who are likewise on march get within distance  for in these same days as hinted above the rearward of the belleisle army four divisions strength not accurately given pushes forward from donauworth well rested through the bavarian passes towards bohemia and prag these have a longer march say 250 miles to northeast and the leader of them is one polastron destined unhappily to meet us on a future occasion with them go certain other bavarians accompanying or preceding as in the vanward case and then the saxons 21000 strong a fine little army all that saxony has are at the same time come across the metal mountains erzgebirge in quest of those bohemian clippings of that kingdom of moravia and march from the westward upon pragrutowsky leading them comte de rutowsky comte de saxes halfbrother one of the three hundred and fiftyfourwith whom is chevalier de saxe a second younger ditto and i think there is still a third who shall go unnamed in this grand oriflamme expedition four of the royalsaxon bastards altogether who cost us more distinguishing than they are worth  chief general of these saxons says an authentic author is rutowsky got from a polish mother i should guess he commands in chief hereonce had a regiment under friedrich wilhelm for a while but has not much head for strategy it may be feared but mark that fourth individual of the three hundred and fiftyfour who has a great deal fourth individual called comte de saxe who is now in that french vanward a good way to east was must i again remind you the produce of the fair aurora von konigsmark sister of the konigsmark who vanished instantaneously from the light of day at hanover long since and has never reappeared more it was in search of him that aurora who was indeed a shining creature terribly insolvent all her life whose charms even charles xii durst not front came to dresden andin this comte de saxe men see the result tall enough restless enough most eupeptic brisk with a great deal of wild facultyrunning to waste nearly all there with his black arched eyebrows black swift physically smiling eyes stands monseigneur le comte one of the strongestbodied and most dissoluteminded men now living on our planet he is now turned of forty no man has been in such adventures has swum through such seas of transcendent eupepticity determined to have its fill in this new quasisacred french enterprise under the banner of belleisle and the chateauroux he has at last after many trials unconsciously found his culmination and will do exploits of a wonderful naturevery worthy of said banner and its patrons  here then are three streams or armaments pouring forward upon prag perhaps some 60000 men in alla good deal uncertain what they are to do at prag except arrive simultaneously so far as possible belleisle far off has fallen sick in these critical days comte de saxe cannot see his way in the matter at all what are we to live upon asks comte de saxe were there nothing morefor simultaneously with these three armaments on march there is an important austrian one likewise on the road for prag that of grandduke franz who has left presburg with say 30000 including the pandour element and duly meets the neipperg or late silesian armywell capable now to do a stroke upon the three armaments if he be speedy november 7th it was when grandduke franz picked up neipperg at frating deep in moravia november 7th the very day while friedrich was getting homaged in breslau and turned him northwestward again the grandduke in such strength marches ragward what he can might be there before the french were he swift and is at any rate in disagreeable proximity to that budmeistabor country appointed as ones haltingplace  and belleisle in these critical days isconsider itpoor belleisle he has all the election votes ready he has done unspeakable labors in the diplomatic way and leaves europe in ebullition and conflagration behind him he has all these armies in motion and has got rid of that moraviagiven it to saxony who adds the title king of moravia to his other dignities and has set on march those 21000 men would he were ready with them belleisle had been saying ever since the treaty for themtreaty was september 19th belleisle to expedite him came to dresden what day is not said but deep in october intending next for the prag country there to commence general the diplomacies being satisfactorily done valori ran over from berlin to wait upon him there alas the saxons are on march or nearly so but the great man himself worn down with these herculean labors has fallen into rheumatic fever is in bed out at hubertsburg serene country palace of his moravian polish majesty and cannot get the least well to march in person with the three armaments with the flood of things he has set reeling and whirling at such rate  the sympathies of valori go deep at this spectacle the alcides who was carrying the axis of the world fallen down in physical rheumatism but what can sympathies avail the great man sees the saxons march without him the great man getting no alleviation from physicians determines in his patriotic heroism to surrender glory itself writes home to court that he is lamed disabled utterly that they must nominate another general and they nominate another nominate broglio the fat choleric marshal of italian breed and physiognomy whom we saw at strasburg last year when friedrich was there broglio will quit strasburg too soon and come a man fierce in fighting skilled too in tactics totally incompetent in strategy or the art of leading armies and managing campaignsdefective in intelligence indeed not wise to discern dim of vision violent of temper subject to sudden cranks a headlong very positive loud dull and angry kind of man with whose tumultuous imbecilities the great belleisle will be sore tried by and by i reckon this valori says the root of all our woes this letter which the great belleisle wrote home to court let men mark it therefore as a cardinal pointand snatch out the date when they have opportunity upon the archives of france see valori i 131  monseigneur the comte de saxe before quitting the vienna countries had left some 10000 french and bavarians posted chiefly in linz under a comte de segur to maintain those donau conquests which have cost only the trouble of marching into them count khevenhuller has ceased working at the ramparts of vienna nothing of siege to be apprehended now civic terror joyfully vanishing again and busies himself collecting an army at vienna with intent of looking into those same french segurs before long it is probable the socalled conquests on the donau will not be very permanent  november 19th21st the three belleisle armaments karl alberts first have simultaneously enough for the case arrived on three sides of prag and lie looking into itextremely uncertain what to do when there to comte de saxe to schmettau who is still here the outlook of this grand belleisle army standing shelterless provisionless grim winter at hand long hundreds of miles from home or help is in the highest degree questionable though the others seem to make little of it fight the grandduke when he comes say they beat him and or suppose he wont fight or suppose we are beaten by him answer saxe and schmettau like men of knowledge in the same boat with men of none we have no strong place or footing in this country what are we to do take prag advises comte de saxe with earnestness day after day his letters on it to karl albert and others in espagnac i 9499 take prag but how answer they by escalade by surprise and sword in hand answers he ogilvy their general has but 3000 and is perhaps no wizard at his trade we can do it thus and thus and then farther thus and i perceive we are a lost army if we dont so counsels maurice comte de saxe brilliant fervent in his military viewsand before it is quite too late schmettau and he persuade karl albert persuade rutowsky chief of the saxons and count polastron gaisson or whatever subaltern counts there are of french type have to accede and be saved in spite of themselves and so  saturday night 25th november 1741 brightest of moonshiny nights our dispositions are all made several attacks three if i remember one of them false under some polastron gaisson from the south side a couple of them true from the northwest and the southeast sides under maurice with his french and rutowsky with his saxons these two and there is great marching on the side of the karlthor charlesgate where rutowsky is and by count maurice behind the wischeradand shortly after midnight the grand game begins that frenchpolastron attack false though with dreadful cannonade from the south attracts poor ogilvy with almost all his forces to that quarter while the couple of saxon captains rutowsky not at once successful maurice with his french completely so break in upon ogilvy from rearward on the right flank and on the left and ruin the poor man military readers will find the whole detail of it well given in espagnac looser account is to be had in the book they call mauvillons derniere guerre de boheme i 252264 saxes own account letter to chevalier de folard is in espagnac i 89 et seqq  one thing i remember always the bright moonlight steeples of prag towering serene in silvery silence and on a sudden the wreaths of volcanic fire breaking out all round them the opposition was but trifling null in some places poor ogilvy being nothing of a wizard and his garrison very small it fell chiefly on rutowsky who met it with creditable vigor till relieved by the others comte maurice too did a shifty thing circling round by the outside of the wischerad by rural roads in the bright moonshine he had got to the wall at last hollow slope and sheer wall and was puttingto his scalingladderswhen by ill luck they proved too short ten feet or so hopelessly too short casting his head round maurice notices the gallows hard by there see you are a few short ladders mes enfans bring me these and we will splice with rope supplemented by the gallows maurice soon gets in cuts down the one poor sentry rushes to the marketplace finds all his brothers rushing embraces them with victoire and you see i am eldest bound to be foremost of you  no point in all the war made a finer blaze in the french imagination or figured better in the french gazettes than this of the scalade of prag 25th november 1741 and surely it was important to get hold of prag nevertheless intrinsically it is no great thing but an opportune small thing done by the comte de saxe in spite of such contradiction as we saw  it was while news of this exploit was posting towards berlin but not yet arrived there that friedrich passing through the apartment intimated to hyndford milord all is divulged our kleinschnellendorf mystery public as the housetops and vanished with a shrug of the shouldersthinking doubtless to himself what is our next move to be in consequence treaty with kurbaiern november 4th he had already signed in consequence expressly declaring for kurbaiern and the french intentions towards him this news from pragprag handsomely captured if vienna had been foolishly neglectedput him upon a new adventure of which in following chapters we shall hear more     the french safe in prag kaiserwahl just coming on  grandduke franz with that respectable amount of army under him ought surely to have advanced on prag and done some stroke of war for relief of it while time yet was grandduke franz his brother karl with him and his old tutor neipperg both of whom are thought to have some skill in war did advance accordingly but then withal there was risk at prag and he always paused again and waited to consider from frating on the 16th espagnac i 87 he had got to neuhaus quite across mahren into bohemian ground and there joined with lobkowitz and what bohemian force there was by this time an army which you would have called much stronger than the french forward therefore yes but with pauses with considerations pause of two days at neuhaus thence to tabor famed ziscas tabor a safe post where again pause three days from tabor is broad highway to prag only sixty miles off nowscrewing their resolution to the stickingpoint grandduke and consorts advance at length with fixed determination all friday all saturday november 24th 25th part of sunday too not thinking it shall be only part and their light troops are almost within sight of prag whenthey learn that prag is scaladed the night before and quite settled that there is nothing except destruction to be looked for in prag back again therefore to the taborandbudweis land they strike into that boggy broken country about budweis some 120 miles south of prag and will there wait the signs of the times  grandduke franz had seen war under seckendorf under wallis and otherwise in the disastrous turk countries but though willing enough was never much of a soldier as to neipperg among his own men especially the one cry is he ought to go about his business out of austrian armies as an imbecile and even a traitor is it conceivable that friedrich could have beaten us in that manner except by buying neipperg in the first place neipperg and the generality of them in that luckless silesian business glogau scaladed with the loss of half a dozen men brieg gone within a week neisse ditto and mollwitz above all where in spite of romer and such horsecharging as was never seen we had to melt dissolve and roll away in the glitter of the evening sun the common notion is they are traitors partialtraitors one and all guerre de boheme saepius poor neipperg he has seen hard service had ugly work to do it was he that gave away belgrade to the turks so interpreting his orders and the grand vizier calling him dog of a giaour spat in his face not far from hanging him and the kaiser and vienna people on his coming home threw him into prison and were near cutting off his head and again after such sleety marchings through the mountains he has had to dissolve at mollwitz float away in military deluge in the manner we saw and now next winter here is he lodged among the upland bogs at budweis escorted by mere curses what a life is the soldiers like other mens what a master is the world aulic cabinet is not allwise but may readily be wiser than the vulgar and with a maria theresa at his head it is incapable of truculent impiety like that neipperg guilty of not being a eugene is not hanged as a traitor but placed quietly as commandant in luxemburg spends there the afternoon of his life in a more commodious manner friedrich had of late rather admired his movements on the neisse river and found him a stiff article to deal with  the french now with prag for their place of arms stretched themselves as far as pisek some seventy miles southwestward occupied pisek pilsen and other towns and posts on the southwest side some seventy miles from prag looking towards the bavarian passes and homeward succors that might come the saxons a while after got as far as teutschbrod eighty miles on the southeastward or moravian hand behind these outposts prag may be considered to hang on silesia and have friedrich for security this in front or as forecourt of friedrichs silesia this inconsiderable section was all of bohemian country the french and confederates ever held and they did not hold this long as for karl albert he had his new pleasant dream of sovereignty at prag titular of upper austria and now of bohmen as well and enjoyed his feast of the barmecide and glorious repose in the captured metropolis after difficulty overcome december 7th he was homaged a good few of the nobility attending for which they smarted afterwards with much processioning blaring and tedeuming on the 19th he rolled off home to munchen there to await still higher romishimperial glories which it is hoped are now at hand  a day or two after the capture of prag marechal de belleisle partially cured of his rheumatisms had hastened to appear in that city and for above four weeks he continued there settling arranging ordering all things in the most consummate manner with that fine military head of his about christmas time arrived marechal de broglio his unfortunate successor or substitute to whom he made everything over and hastened off for frankfurt where the final crisis of kaiserwahl is now at hand and the topstone of his work is to be brought out with shouting marechal de broglio had an unquiet winter of it in his new command and did not extend his quarters but the contrary     broglio has a bivouac of pisek khevenhuller looks in upon the donau conquests  grandduke franz edged himself at last a little out of that taborbudweis region and began looking pragward againhung about for some time with his hungarian lighttroops scouring the country but still keeping prag respectfully to right at seventy miles distance december 28th to broglios alarm he tried a nightattack on pisek the chief french outpost which lies franceward too and might be vital but he found the french broglio having got warning unexpectedly ready for him at pisekdrawn up in the dark streets there with torrents of musketry ready for his pandours and himand entirely failed of pisek upon which he turned eastward to the budweistabor fastnesses again left brother karl as commander in those parts who soon leaves lobkowitz as substitute vienna in the idle wintertime being preferableleft brother karl and proceeded in person south towards the donau countries to see how khevenhuller might be prospering who is in the field there as we shall hear  of pisek and the nightskirmish at pisek glorious to france think all the gazettes i should have said nothing were it not that marechal broglio finding what a narrow miss he had made established a nightwatch there or bivouac for six weeks to come such as never was before or since cavalry and infantry in quantity bivouacking there in the environs of pisek on the grim bohemian snow or snowslush in the depth of winter nightly for six weeks without whisper of an enemy at any time whereby the marechal did save pisek if pisek was ever again in danger but froze horse and man to the edge of destruction or into it so that the bivouac of pisek became proverbial in french messrooms for a generation coming guerre de boheme ii 23 c and one hears in the mind a clangorous nasal eloquence from antique gesticulative mustachiofigures witty and indignantwho are now gone to silence again and their fruitless bivouacs and frosty and fiery toils tumbling pellmell after them this of pisek was but one of the many unwise hysterical things poor broglio did in that difficult position which indeed was too difficult for any mortal and for broglio beyond the average  one other thing we note graf von khevenhuller solid austrian man issued from vienna december 31st last day of the year with an army of only some 15000 but with an excellent military head of his own to look into those conquests on the donau which he finds as he expected to be mere conquests of stubble capable of being swept home again at a very rapid rate khevenhuller here as always was consummate in his choice of posts says lloyd general lloyd history of sevenyears war c incidentally somewherediscovered where the arteries of the business lay and how to handle the same by choice of posts by silent energy and military skill khevenhuller very rapidly sweeps segur back and shuts him up in linz there segur since the first days of january is strenuously barricading himself wedging beams from house to house across the streetsand hopes to get provision the donau and the bavarian streams being still open behind him and to hold out a little it will be better if he doespecially for poor karl albert and his poor bavaria khevenhuller has also detached through the tyrol a general von barenklau bearsclaw much heard of henceforth in these wars who has 12000 regulars and much hussarfolk under bloody mentzelacross the tyrol we say to fall in upon bavaria and munchen itself which they are too like doing with effect ought not karl albert to be upon the road again what a thing were the kaiser elect taken prisoner by pandours  in fine within a short two weeks or so karl albert quits munchen as no safe place for him comes across to mannheim to his cousin philip old kurpfalz whom we used to know now extremely old but who has marriages of granddaughters and other gayeties on hand which a cousin and prospective kaiserespecially if in peril of his lifemight as well come and witness this is the excuse karl albert makes to an indulgent public and would fain make to himself but cannot barenklau and khevenhuller are too indisputable nay this rumor of friedrichs peace with austria divulged bargain of kleinschnellendorf if this also horrible to think were true which friedrich assures him it is not karl albert writes to friedrich and again writes conjuring him for the love of god to make some thrust then some inroad or other on those mandevouring khevenhullers and take them from his karl alberts throat and his poor countrys which friedrich on his own score is already purposing to do     chapter viii  friedrich starts for moravia on a new scheme he has  the austrian court had not kept friedrichs secret of kleinschnellendorf hardly even for a day it was whispered to the dowager empress or empresses who whispered it or wrote it to some other high party by whom again as usualin fact the austrian court having once got their neipperg safe to hand took no pains to keep the secret but had probably an interest rather in letting it filter out to set friedrich and his allies at variance at all events in the space of a few weeks as we have seen the rumor of a treaty between austria and friedrich was everywhere rife friedrich as he had engaged everywhere denying it and indeed clearly perceiving that there was like to be no ground for acknowledging it the austrian court instead of completing the treaty before newyearsday had broken the previous bargain evidently not meaning to complete intent rather to wait upon their hungarian insurrection and the luck of war  there is now therefore a new turn in the game and for this also friedrich has been getting the fit card ready and is not slow to play it some time ago november 4thproperly november 1st hardly three weeks since that of kleinschnellendorffinding the secret already out whispered of at breslau 28th october casually testifies hyndford he had tightened his bands with france had on november 4th formally acceded to karl alberts treaty with france accession agreed to frankfurt nov 1st 1741 ratified nov 4th glatz to be his he will not hear of wanting glatz nor of wanting elsewhere the proper boundary for schlesien neisse river both banks which neipperg had agreed to in his late shambargainquite strict on these preliminaries  and furthermore kursachsen being now a partner in that frenchbavarian treatyand a highly active one with 21000 in the field for him who is king of moravia withal and has some considerable northern paring of bohemia thrown in by way of road to moraviafriedrich made at the same time special treaty with kursachsen on the points specially mutual to them on the boundary point first of all which latter treaty is dated also november 1st and was ratified november 8th  treaty otherwise not worth reading except perhaps as it shows us friedrich putting in his brief direct way kursachsen at once into austrias place in regard to oberschlesien boundary between your polish majesty and me to be the river neisse plus a full german milewhich to belleisles surprise the polish majesty is willing to accept and consents farther friedrich being of succinct turn that commissioners go directly and put down the boundarystones and so an end let the silesian matter stand where it stood thinks friedrich since austria will not will you put down the boundarypillars thenan interesting little glance into friedrichs inner man and a prussian boundary commissioner our friend nussler the man did duly appearwhom perhaps we shall meetthough no saxon one quite did busching beitrage i 339  nussler it is this boundary clause it is friedrichs little decision put down the pillars then that alone can now interest any mortal in this saxon bargain the clause itself and the bargain itself having quite broken down on the saxon side and proved imaginary as a covenant made in dreams could not be helped in the sequel  meanwhile the preliminary diplomacies being done in this manner friedrich had ordered certain of his own forces to get in motion a little ordered leopold who has had endless nicety of management since the french and saxons came into those bohemian circles of his to go upon glatz to lay fast hold of glatz for one thing and farther eastward schwerin by order has lately gone across the mountains seized troppau friedenthal nay olmutz itself the capital of mahrenin one day december 27th garrison of olmutz being too weak to resist and the works in disrepair in heavens name what are your intentions then asked the austrians there peaceable in the extreme answered schwerin if only yours are and if they are not there sits schwerin ever since busy strengthening himself and maintains the best discipline waiting farther orders  the austrians will not complete their bargain of kleinschnellendorf thinks this young king very well we will not press them to completion we will not ourselves complete should they now press we will try another method and that without loss of timeit was a pungent reflection with friedrich that karl albert had not pushed forward on vienna from linz that time but had blindly turned off to the left and thrown away his one chance cannot one still mend it cannot one still do something of the like thinks friedrich now schwerin in olmutz prussian troops cantoned in the highlands of silesia or over in bohemia itself near the scene of action the saxons eastward as far as teutschbrod still nearer the french triumphant at prag and reinforcement on the road for them a combined movement on vienna done instantly and with an impetus that is the thing friedrich is now bent

the time of opera was come whither the two majesties had to proceed together and suspend business for a while polish majesty himself was very easily satisfied but with the others as valori reports it

money for it oeuvres de frederic ii 85 and is determined to have it when the austrians next take to bargaining of glatz fortress now getting hungered out by leopolds prussian detachment i will say farther though friedrich heeds these circumstances little at present that it stands on a scarped rock girt by the grim intricate hills and that in the arsenal in dusty fabulous condition lies a

determined manner and was the first of all the bavarian kurfursts mere dukes till then having got for himself the poor winterkings electorship or split it into two as ultimately settled out of that bad businessgreatgrandson we say of that forcible questionable first kurfurst max and descends from kaiser ludwig ludwig the baier if that is much advantage to him  in his young time he had a hard upcoming seven years old at the battle of blenheim and papa living abroad under louis xivs shelter the poor boy was taken charge of by the victorious austrian kaisers and brought up in remote austrian towns as a young graf von wittelsbach nothing but his family name left him mere graf and private nobleman henceforth however fortune took the turn we know and he became prince again nothing the worse for this spartan part of his breeding he made the grand tour italy france perhaps more than once saw felt and tasted served slightly at a siege of belgrade one of the many sieges of belgradewedded in 1722 a daughter of the late kaiser josephs niece of the late kaiser karls cousin of maria theresas making the due renunciations as was thought and has been kurfurst himself for the last fourteen years ever since 1726 when his father died a thrifty kurfurst they say or at least has occasionally tried to be so conscious of the load of debts left on him fond of pomps withal extremely polite given to devotion and to billetsdoux of gracious address generous temper if he had the means and great skill in speaking languages likes hunting a littlelikes several things we seehas lived tolerably with his wife and children tolerably with his neighbors though sour upon the late kaiser now and then and is an ornament to munchen and well liked by the population there a lean elegaut middlesized gentleman descended direct from ludwig the ancient kaiser from maximilian the first kurfurst who walked by the light of father lammerlein lambkin and company thinking it light from heaven and lastly is son of maximilian the third kurfurst whom learned english readers know as the antimarlborough one ruined out by the battle of blenheim  his most important transaction hitherto has been the marriage with kaiser josephs daughterof which in pollnitz somewhere there is sublime account forgettable all except the date vienna 5th october 1722 if by chance that should concern anybody karl albert kurprinz electoral prince or heirapparent at that time made free renunciation of all right to austrian inheritances in such terms as pleased karl vi the then kaiser the due complete renunciations of inheriting in austria and it was hoped he would at once sign the pragmatic sanction when published but he has steadily refused to do so i renounced for my wife says kurfurst karl and will never claim an inch of austrian land on her account but my own right derived from kaiser ferdinand of blessed memory who was father of my greatgrandmother i did not do not never will renounce and i appeal to his pragmatic sanction the much older and alone valid one according to which it is not you it is i that am the real and sole heir of austria  this he says and has steadily said or meant it is i that am to be king of bohemia i that shall and will inherit all your austrias upper under your swabian brisgau or hither austria and what of the tyrol remained wanting to me your archduchess will have hungary the styriancarinthian territories florence i suppose and the italian ones what is hers by right i will be one of those that defend for her what is not hers but mine i will defend against her to the best of my ability this was privately what it is now publicly his argument from which he never would depart refusing always to accept kaiser karls new pragmatic sanction getting saxony who likewise had a ferdinand greatgrandmother to refusetill polish election compelled poor saxony for a time karl albert had likewise secretly in past years got his abstruse old cousin of the pfalz who mended the heidelberg tun to back him in a treaty nay still better still more secretly had got france itself to promise eventual hackingand on the whole lived generally on rather bad terms with the late kaiser karl his wifes uncle any reconciliation they had proving always of temporary nature in the rhenish war 1734 karl albert far from assisting the kaiser raised large forces of his own kept drilling them in four or three camps in an alarming manner and would not even send his reichs contingent small body of 3000 he is by law bound to send till he perceived the war was just expiring he was in angry controversy with the kaiser claiming debtsdebts contracted in the last generation and debts going back to the thirtyyears war amounting to hundreds of millionswhen the poor kaiser died refusing payment to the last nay claiming lands left him he says by margaret mouthpoke michaelis ii 260 buchholz ii 9 hormayr anemonen ii 182 c cannot pay your serene highness having no money and would not if i could leaving karl albert to protest to the uttermostwhich as we ourselves saw in vienna he at once honorably did  karl alberts subsequent history is known to readers except the following small circumstance which occurred in his late transit flight or whatever we may call it to mannheim and is pleasantly made notable to us by wilhelmina his highness on the way from munchen intimates our princess passed through baireuth in a very bad postchaise this as we elsewhere pick out was on january 16th karl albert in posthaste for the marriageceremony which takes place at mannheim tomorrow adelung iii a 51 my margraf accidentally hearing galloped after him came up with him about fifteen miles away they embraced talked half an hour very content both wilhelmina ii 334  and eight days afterwards 24th january 1742 busy belleisle how busy for this year past since we saw him in the oeildeboeuf gets him elected kaiserand segur in the selfsame hours is packing out of linz and ones donau conquests not to say ones munchen ones baiern itself are in a fine way the marriageceremony witnessed on the 17th was one of the sublimest for kurpfalz and kindred and it too had secretly a touch of tragedy in it for the poor karl albert a double marriage two young princesses granddaughters priceless heiresses to old kurpfalz married one of them to duke clement of baiern karl alberts nephew which is well enough but married the other and elder of them to theodor of deuxponts who will one daycould we pierce the merciful veilbe kurfurst of baiern and succeed our own childless son michaelis ii 265  kaiser karl vii such the style he took is to be crowned february 12th makes sublime public entry into frankfurt with that view january 31stboth ceremonies splendid to a wonder in spite of finance considerations which circumstance should little concern us were it not that wilhelmina hearing the great news though in a dim illdated state decided to be there and see did goand has recorded her experiences there in a shrill human manner wishful to see our fellowcreatures especially if bound to look at them even when they are fallen phantasmal and to make persons of them again we will give this piece sorry that it is the last we have of that fine hand how welcome in the murky puddle of dryasdust is any glimpse by a lively glib wilhelmina which we can discern to be human hear what wilhelmina says in a very condensed form     wilhelmina at the coronation  wilhelmina in the end of january 1742karl albert having shot past one day lately in a bad postchaise and kindled the thought in herresolved to go and see him crowned at frankfurt by way of pleasureexcursion we will struggling to be briefer speak in her person and indicate withal where the very words are hers and where ours  the marwitz elder marwitz her poor father being wounded at mollwitz militairlexikon iii 23 and preussische adelslexikon iii 365 had gone to berlin to nurse him but she returned just nownot much to my joy i being with some cause jealous of that foolish minx the duchess dowager of wurtemberg also came sorrow on her a foolish talking woman always cutting jokes making eyes giggling and coquetting has some wit and manner but wearies you at last her charms now on the decline were never so considerable as rumor said in the longrun she bores you with her french gayeties and sprightliness her character for gallantry is too notorious she quite corrupted marwitz in this and a subsequent visit turned the poor girls head into a french whirligig and undermined any little moral principle she had she was on the road to berlinof which anon for it is not quite nothing to usbut she was in no hurry and would right willingly have gone with us and it required all our female diplomacy to get her under way again and fairly out of our course january 28th she off to berlin we same day to frankfurtonmayn wilhelmina ii 334 see pp 335 338 347 c for the other salient points that follow  coronation was to have been or we countryfolk thought it was january 31st let us be there incognito the night before see it and return the day after that was our plan bad roads waters all out we had to go night and dayreached the gates of frankfurt 30th january late berghover our legationsrath there says we are known everywhere coronation is not to be till february 12th i was fatigued to death a bad cold on me too we turned back to the last village stayed there overnight back again to berghover in secret a la sourdine next night will see the public entry of karl albert which is to be tomorrow not quite my princess january 31st for certain adelung iii a 63 c c did one the least care it was a very grand thing indeed des plus superbes but i will not stop describing it masked ball that night where i had much amusement tormenting the masks not being known to anybody we next day retired to a small private house which berghover had got for us out of town for fear of being discovered and lodged there waiting february 12th under difficulties  the weather was bitterly cold we had brought no clothes my dames and i nothing earthly but a black andrienne each whatever that may be to spare bulk of luggage strictest incognito was indispensable the marwitzes for giggling raillery french airs and absolute impertinence were intolerable in that solitary place we return to frankfurt again have balls and theatres at least of these latter i missed none one evening my headdress got accidentally shoved awry and exposed my face for a moment prince george of hessencassel who was looking that way recognized me told the prince of orange of itthey are in our box next minute  prince george of hessencassel did readers ever hear of him before transiently perhaps in friedrichs letters to his father but have forgotten him again can know him only as the outline of a shadow a fat solid military man of fifty junior brother of that solid wilhelm viceregent and virtual landgraf of hessenvice an elder and eldest brother friedrich the now majesty of sweden who is actual hereditary landgraf but being old childless idle takes no hold of it and quite leaves it to wilhelmof whom english readers may have heard and will hear for it is wilhelm that hires us those subsidized 6000 who go blaring about on english pay prince george merely commandant of them and wilhelm furthermore has wedded his heirapparent to an english princess lately princess mary age only about seventeen 28th june 1740 princes name was friedrich became catholic 1749 wife made familymanager in consequence c c which also as the poor young fellow became papist by and by costs certain english people among others a good deal of trouble uncle george we say is merely commandant of those blaring 6000 has had his own real soldierings before this his own labors contradictions in his time but has borne all patiently and grown fat upon it not quarrelling with his burdens or his nourishments perhaps we may transiently meet him again  as to the prince of orange him we have seen more than once in times past a young fellow in comparison sprightly reckoned clever but somewhat humpbacked married an english princess years ago papa if he were as ugly as a baboonwhich fine princess we find has stopt short at cassel too fatigued on the present occasion his esprit continues wilhelmina and his conversation delighted me his wife he said was at cassel he would persuade her to come and make my acquaintancecould not too far in this cold season these two serene highnesses would needs take me home in their carriage they asked the margraf to let them stay supper from that hour they were never out of our house next morning by means of them the secret had got abroad kurkoln lanky hooknosed gentleman richest pluralist in the church had set spies on us next evening he came up to me and said madam i know your highness you must dance a measure with me that comes of ones headgear getting awry we had nothing for it but to give up the incognito and take our fate  this dancing elector of koln a man still only entering his forties is the new emperors brother clement august hubner t 134 do readers wonder to see him dance being an archbishop the fact is certainlet the three kings and the eleven thousand virgins say to it what they will he talked a long time with me presented to me the princess clemence his niece that is to say wife of his nephew clement one of the two whom his now imperial majesty saw married the other day michaelis ii 256 123 hubner tt 141 134 and then the princessin fact presented all the three sulzbach princesses for there is a youngest still to wedand then prince theodor happy husband of the eldest and prince clement ditto of the younger and was very polite indeed how keep our incognito with all these people heaping civilities upon us let us send to baireuth for clothes equipages and retire to our country concealment till they arrive  just as we were about setting off thither i waiting till the margraf were ready the xargraf entered and a lady with him who he informed me was madame de belleisle the french ambassadors wifewife of the great belleisle the soul of all these high congregatings consultations coronations who is not kaiser but maker of kaisers what is to be donei had carefully avoided her reckoning she would have pretensions i should not be in the humor to grant i took my resolution at the moment being a swift decisive creature and received her like any other lady that might have come to me her visit was not long the conversation turned altogether upon praises of the king my brother i found madame de belleisle very different from the notion i had formed of her you could see she had moved in high company sentait son monde but her air appeared to me that of a waitingmaid soubrette and her manners insignificant let madame take that  monseigneur himself when our equipages had come waited on me several timesmonseigueur the grand marechal de belleisle among the other principalities and lordships but of this lean man in black who has done such famous things and will have to do the retreat of prag within year and day there is not a word farther said old seckendorf too is here reichsgovernor of philipsburg very ill with austria no wonder and striving to be well with the new kaiser doubtless old seckendorf made his visit too being of baireuth kin withal and snuffled his respects much unworthy of mention not lovely to wilhelmina prince of orange hunchbacked but sprightly and much the prince bore me faithful company all the coronation time nor was george of hessencassel wanting good fat man  of the coronation itself though it was truly grand and even of an oriental splendoranemonen ubi supra i will say nothing the poor kaiser could not enjoy it much he was dying of gout and gravel and could scarcely stand on his feet poor gentleman and the french are driven dismally out of linz and the austrians are spreading like a lavaflood or general conflagration over baierndemon mentzel whom they call colonel mentzel he if we knew it is in munchen itself just as we are getting crowned here and unless king friedrich who is falling into mahren in the flank of them call back this infernal chase a little what hope is there in those partsthe poor kaiser oftenest in his bed is courting all manner of german princesconsulting with seckendorfs with cunning old stagers he has managed to lead my margraf into a foolish bargain about raising men for him which bargain i on fairly getting sight of it persuade my margraf to back out of and in the end he does so meanwhile it detains us some time longer in frankfurt which is still full of principalities busy with visitings and ceremonials  among other things by way of forwarding that bargain i was so averse to our official people had settled that i could not well go without having seen the empress after her crowning foolish people entangling me in new intricacies for if she is a kaisers daughter and kaisers spouse am not i somewhat too how a kings daughter and an empress are to meet was probably never settled by example what number of steps down stairs does she come the armchair fauteuil is that to be denied me and numerous other questions the official people baireuthers especially are in despair and in fact there were scenes but i held firm and the berlin ambassadors tempering a medium was struck steps of stairs to the due number are conceded me armchair no but the empress to take a very small armchair and i to have a big common chair grand dossier so we meet and i have sight of this princess next day  in her place i confess i would have invented all manner of etiquettes or any sort of contrivance to save myself from showing face heavens the empress is below middle size and so corpulent puissante she looks like a ball she is ugly to the utmost laide au possible and without air or grace kaiser josephs youngest daughterthe gods it seems have not been kind to her in figure or feature and her mind corresponds to her appearance she is bigoted to excess passes her nights and days in her oratory with mere rosaries and gaunt superstitious platitudes of that nature a dark fat dreary little empress she was all in a tremble in receiving me and had so discountenanced an air she could nt speak a word we took seats after a little silence i began the conversation in french she answered me in her austrian jargon that she did not well understand that language and begged i would speak to her in german our conversation was not long her austrian dialect and my lowersaxon are so different that till you have practised you are not mutually intelligible in them accordingly we were not a bystander would have split with laughing at the babel we made of it each catching only a word here and there and guessing the rest this princess was so tied to her etiquette she would have reckoned it a crime against the reich to speak to me in a foreign language for she knew french well enough  the kaiser was to have been of this visit but he had fallen so ill he was considered even in danger of his life poor prince what a lot had he achieved for himself reflects wilhelmina as we often do he was soft humane affable had the gift of captivating hearts not without talent either but then of an ambition far disproportionate to it would have shone in the second rank but in the first went sorrowfully eclipsed as they say he could not be a great man nor had about him any one that could and he needed now to be so this is the service a belleisle can do inflating a poor man to kaisership beyond his natural size crowned kaiser and mentzel just entering his munchen the while a kaiser bedrid stranded lying ill there of gout and gravel with the demon mentzels eating himwell may his poor little bullet of a kaiserinn pray for him night and day if that will avail     the duchess dowager of wurtemberg returning from berlin favors us with another visit  i am sorry to say this is almost the last scene we shall get out of wilhelmina she returns to baireuth breaks there conclusively that unwise frankfurt bargain receives by and by after several months when much has come and gone in the world the returning duchess of wurtemberg effulgent dowager spoken of only as a lais and has other adventures alluded to up and down but not put in record by herself any farthersorrowfully let us hear wilhelmina yet a little on this lais duchess who will concern us somewhat dowager much too effulgent of the late karl alexander a reichsfeldmarschall or fourthpart of one if readers could remember and duke of wurtembergwhom we once dined with at prag in old friedrichwilhelm and princeeugene times  this princess very famous on the bad side had been at berlin to see her three boys settled there whose education she and the stande of wurtemberg she being regent had committed to the king these princes had been with us on their road thither just before their mamma last time the eldest age fourteen had gone quite agog setoit amourache about my little girl age only nine and had greatly diverted us by his little gallantries mark that with an alas the duchess following somewhat at leisure had missed the king that time who was gone for mahren january 18th  i found this princess wearing pretty well her features are beautiful but her complexion is faded and very yellow her voice is so high and screechy it cuts your ears she does not want for wit and expresses herself well her manners are engaging for those whom she wishes to gain and with men are very free her way of thinking and acting offers a strange contrast of pride and meanness her gallantries had brought her into such repute that i had no pleasure in her visits wilhelmina ii 335 no pleasure though she often came and her eldest prince and my little girlwell who knows  besides her three boys one of whom as reigning duke will become notorious enough to wilhelmina and mankind the lais duchess has left at berlinat least i guess she has now left him in exchange perhaps for some othera certain very gallant vagabond young marquis dargens from constantinople last originally from the provence countries extremely dissolute creature still young whom papa has had to disinherit but full of goodhumor of gesticulative loyal talk and frothy speculation of an antijesuit turn has written many frothy books too in that strain which are now forgotten who became a very great favorite with friedrich and will be much mentioned in subsequent times  in the end of july continues wilhelmina we went to stouccard stuttgard capital of wurtemberg o beautiful glib tongue whither the duchess had invited us but and there we are on blank paper our dear wilhelmina has ceased speaking to us her memoirs end and oblivious silence wraps the remainder  concerning this effulgent dowager of wurtemberg and her late ways at berlin here from bielfeld is another snatch which we will excerpt under the usual conditions  berlin february 1742 real date of all that is not fabulous in bielfeld who chaotically dates it 6th december of that year  a day or two after this no matter what i went to the german play the only spectacle which is yet fairly afoot in berlin in passing in i noticed the duchess dowager of wurtemberg who had arrived during my absence with a numerous and brilliant suite as well to salute the king and the queens king off on his moravian business before she came and to unite herself more intimately with our court as to see the three princes her children settled in their new place where by consent of the states of wurtemberg they are to be educated henceforth  as i had not yet had myself presented to the duchess i did not presume to approach too near and passed up into the theatre but she noticed me in the sidescenes asked who i was such a handsome fashionable fellow and sent me order to come immediately and pay my respects to be sure i did so was most graciously received and of course called early next day at her palace her grandchamberlain had appointed me the hour of noon he now introduced me accordingly but what was my surprise to find the princess in bed in a negligee all new from the laundress and the gallantest that art could imagine on a table ready to her hand at the dossier or bedbead stood a little basin silvergilt filled with holy water the rest was decorated with extremely precious relics with a crucifix and a rosary of rockcrystal her dress the cushions quilt all was of marseilles stuff in the finest series of colors garnished with superb lace her cap was of alencon lace knotted with a ribbon of green and gold figure to yourself in this gallant deshabille a charming princess who has all the wit perfection of mannerand is still only thirtyseven with a beauty that was once so brilliant round the celestial bed were courtiers doctors almoners mostly in devotional postures the three young princes and a dame datours who seemed to look slightly ennuyee or bored i had the honor to kiss her serene highnesss hand and to talk a great many peppered insipidities suitable to the occasion  dinner followed more properly supper with lights kindled only i cannot dress you know her highness had said i never do except for the queenmothers partiesand rang for her maids so that you are led out to the anteroom and go grinning about till a new and still more charming deshabille be completed and her most serene highness can receive you again now messieurs pshaw one is always stupid no esprit at all except by candlelightafter which such a dinner unmatchable for elegance for exquisite gastronomy for atticpaphian brilliancy and charm and indeed there followed hereupon for weeks on weeks a series of such unmatchable little dinners chief parts under that charming presidency being done by grandchamberlain baron de somethingorother by your humble servant bielfeld m jordan and a marquis dargens famous provencal gentleman now in the suite of her highness bielfeld ii 7478feasts of the barmecide i much doubt poor bielfeld being in this chapter very fantastic misdateful to a mad extent and otherwise except as to general effect worth little serious belief  we shall meet this paphian dowager again crucifix and myrtle joined meet especially her dargens and her three little princes more or lesswherefore mark slightly besides the dargens as above  1 the eldest little prince karl eugen made reigning duke within three years hence mamma falling into trouble with the stande a man still gloomily famous in germany poet schillers duke of wurtemberg of inarticulate extremely arbitrary turnmarried wilhelminas daughter by and by with horrible usage of her and otherwise gave friedrich and the world cause to think of him  2 the second little prince friedrich eugen prussian general of some mark who will incidentally turn up again he was afterwards successor to the dukedom karl eugen dying childless and married his daughter to paul of russia from whom descend the autocrats there to this day  3 youngest little prince ludwig eugen a respectable prussian officer and later a french one he is that duc de wirtemberg who corresponds with voltaire inscrutable to readers in most of the editions and need not be mentioned farther see michaelis iii 449 preuss i 476 c c  but enough of all this it is time we were in mahren where the expedition must be blazing well ahead if things have gone as expected     chapter x  friedrich does his moravian expedition which proves a mere moravian foray   while these coronation splendors had been going on friedrich in the moravian regions was making experiences of a rather painful kind his expedition prospering there far otherwise than he had expected this winter expedition to mahren was one of the first friedrich had ever undertaken on the jointstock principle and it proved of a kind rather to disgust him with that method in affairs of war  a deeply disappointing expedition the country hereabouts was in bad posture of defence nothing between us and vienna itself in a manner rushing briskly forward living on the country where needful on that iglau magazine on ones own sechelles resources rushing on with the saxons with the french emulous on the right hand and the left a captain like friedrich might have gone far vienna itselfwho knowsnot yet quite beyond the reach of him here was a way to check khevenhuller in his bavarian operations and whirl him back doublequick for another object nearer homebut alas neither the saxons nor the french would rush on in the least emulous the saxons dragged heavily arear the french detachment a poor 5000 under polastron all that a captious broglio could be persuaded to grant would not rush at all but paused on the very frontier of moravia broglio so ordering and there hung supine or indeed went home  friedrich remonstrated argued turned back to encourage but it was in vain the saxon bastard princes lived for days in any schloss they found comfortable complaining always that there was no victual for their troops that the prussians always ahead had eaten the country no end to haggling and except on friedrichs part no hearty beginning to real business if you wish at all to be king of moravia what is this thinks friedrich justly broglio too was unmanageablepiqued that valori not broglio had started the thingshowed himself captious dark hysterically effervescent now overcautious and again capable of rushing blindly headlong  to broglio the fact at linz which everybody saw to be momentous was overwhelming magnanimous segur and his linz all wedged with beams what a road have they gone said so valiantly they would make defence and did it scarcely for four days january 24th before this expedition could begin true m le marechal too trueand is that a reason for hanging back in this mahren business or for pushing on in it doublequick with all ones strength but our conquests on the donau thinks broglio what will become of themand of us to broglio justly apprehensive about his own posture at prag and on the donau there never was such a chance of at once raking back all austrians homewards posthaste out of those countries but broglio could by no means see it soheadstrong blusterous overcautious and hysterically headlong old gentleman whose conduct at prag here brought strasburg vividly to friedrichs memory upon which as upon the ghost of broglios breeches valori had to hear incessant sarcasms at this time  in a word from february 5th when friedrich according to bargain rendezvoused his prussians at wischau to begin this expedition till april 5th when he rerendezvoused them at the same wischau as chanced for the purpose of ending it and going homefriedrich wrestling his utmost with human stupidity mit der dummheit as schiller sonorously says against which the very gods are unvictorious had probably two of the most provoking months of his life or of this first silesian war which was fruitful in such to him for the common cause he accomplished nearly nothing by this moravian expedition but to his own mind it was rich in experiences as to the jointstock principle as to the partners he now had and it doubtless quickened his steps towards getting personally out of this imbroglio of big frenchgerman warshome to berlin with peace and silesia in his pocketwhich had all along been the goal of his endeavors as a feat of war it is by no means worth detailing in this placethough succinct stille and bulkier german books give lucid account should anybody chance to be curious stille campaigns of the king of prussia i 155 heldengeschichte ii 548611 oeuvres de frederic ii 110114 orlich ii c c only under the other aspect as friedrichs experience of partnership and especially of his now partners are present readers concerned to have in brief form some intelligible notion of it     iglau is got but not the magazine at iglau  friedrich was punctual at wischau headquarters there midway between olmutz and brunn prussians all assembled 5th february 1742 wischau is some eighty miles east or inward of iglau the french and saxons are to meet us about trebitsch a couple of marches from that teutschbrod of theirs and well within one march of iglau on our route thither the french and saxons are at trebitsch accordingly but their minds and wills seem to be far elsewhere rutowsky and the chevalier de saxe command the saxons 20000 strong on paper 16000 in reality comte de polastron the french who are 5000 all horse along with whom professedly as french volunteer has come the comte de saxe capricious maurice marechal de saxe that will be who has always viewed this expedition with disfavor excellency valori is with the french detachment or rather poor valori is everywhere running about from quarter to quarter sometimes to prag itself assiduous to heal rents everywhere clapping cement into manifold cracks from day to day through valori we get some interesting glimpses into the secret humors and manoeuvres of comte maurice it is known otherwise comte maurice was no friend to belleisle but looked for his promotion from the opposite or noailles party in the french court at present as valori perceives he has got the ear of broglio and put much sad stuff into the loud foolish mind of him  to these saxon gentlemen being bastardroyal and important to conciliate friedrich has in a highflown way assigned the schloss of budischau for quarters an excellent superbly magnificent mansion in the neighborhood of trebitsch nothing like it to be seen except in theatres on the dropscene of the enchanted island stille campaigns p 14 where they make themselves so comfortable says friedrich there is no getting them roused to do anything for three days to come and yet the work is urgent and plenty of it iglau first of all urges friedrich where the austrians 10000 or so under prince lobkowitz have posted themselves right flank of that long straggle of winter cantonments which goes leftwards to budweis and farther and made magazines possession of iglau is the foundationstone of our affairs and if we would have iglau with the magazines and not without surely there is not a moment to be wasted in vain the saxon bastard princes feel themselves very comfortable it was sunday the 11th of february when our junction with them was completed and instead of next morning early it is wednesday afternoon before prince dietrich of anhaltdessau with the saxon and french party roused to join his prussians and him can at last take the road for iglau prince dietrich makes now the reverse of delay marches all night bivouacs in woods near iglau warming himself at stickfires till the day break takes iglau by merely marching into it and scattering 2000 pandours so soon as day has broken but finds the magazines not there lobkowitz carted off what he could then burnt seventeen barns yesterday and is himself off towards budweis headquarters and the bohemian bogs again this comes of lodging saxon royal gentlemen too well     the saxons think iglau enough the french go home  nay iglau taken the affair grows worse than ever our saxons now declare that they understand their orders to be completed that their court did not mean them to march farther but only to hold by iglau a solid footing in moravia which will suffice for the present fancy friedrich fancy valori and the cracks he will have to fill friedrich in astonishment and indignation sends a messenger to dresden would the polish majesty be king of moravia then or not be remonstrances at budischau rise higher and higher valori to prevent total explosion flies over once in the dead of the night to deal with rutowsky and brothers rutowsky himself seems partly persuadable though dreadfully ill of rheumatism they rouse comte maurice and valori by this comtes caprices is driven out of patience he talked with a flippant sophistry almost with an insolence says valori nay at last he made me a gesture in speakingwhat gesture thumb to nose or what the shuddering imagination dare not guess but valori nettled to the quick repeated it and otherwise gave him as good as he brought he ended by a gesture which displeased meand went to bed valori i 148 149 this is the night of february 18th third night after iglau was had and the magazines in it gone to ashes which the saxons think is conquest enough  poor polish majesty poor karl albert above all now kaiser karl vii with nothing but those french for breath to his nostrils with his fine french army of the oriflamme karl albert should have pushed along last autumn and not merely read the paper which friedrich sent him to that effect and then laid it aside they will never have another chance his french and heunless we call this again a chance which they are again squandering linz went by capitulation january 24th the very day of ones election as they called it and ever since that day of linz the series of disasters has continued rapid and uniform in those parts linz gone the rest of the french posts did not even wait to capitulate but crackled all off they and our conquests on the donau like a train of gunpowder and left the ground bare and general von barenklau bearsclaw with the hideous fellow called mentzel colonel of pandours they have broken through into bavaria itself from the tyrol climbing by berchtesgaden and the wild salzburg mountains regardless of winter and of poor bavarian militiafolkand have taken munchen ones very capital ones very house and homepoor karl albertand what is again remarkable it was the very day while he was getting crowned at frankfurt with oriental pomp that mentzel was about entering munchen with his pandours coronation was february 12th capitulation to mentzel munchen february 13th is in  guerre de boheme ii 5659 and this poor archduke of the austrian king of bohemia kaiser of the holy romish reich teutsch by nation is becoming titular merely and owns next to nothing in these extensive sovereignties judge if there is not call for despatch on all sidesthe polish majesty sent instant rather angry order to his saxons forward with you what else we would be king in mahren  the saxons then have to march forward but we can fancy with what a will rutowsky flings up his command on this order let us hope from rheumatism partly and goes home leaving the chevalier de saxe to preside in room of him as for polastron he produces order from broglio iglau got return straightway must and will cross over into bohemia again and does nay the comte de saxe had privately in his pocket a commission to supersede polastron and take command himself should polastron make difficulties about turning back poor polastron made no difficulties maurice and he vanish accordingly from this adventure and only the unwilling saxons remain with friedrich poor polastron a poor weak creature says friedrich fitter for his breviary than anything else fell sick from the hardships of campaigning and soon died in those bohemian parts maurice is heard of some weeks hence besieging egervery handsomely capturing eger 19th april 1742 guerre de boheme ii 7865on which service broglio had ordered him after his return the former commandant of the siege not very progressive had just died and broglio with reason all the more for his late moravian procedures was passionate to have done there one of the first auspicious exploits of maurice that of eger which paved the way to his french fortunes and more or less sublime glories in this war friedrich recognizes his ingenuities impetuosities and superior talent in war wrote highflown letters of praises now and then in years coming but we may guess would hardly wish to meet maurice in the way of jointstock business again     friedrich submerges the moravian countries but cannot brunn which is the indispensable point  february 19th these sad iglau matters once settled friedrich followed by the saxons plunges forward into moravia spreads himself over the country levying heavy contributions with strict discipline nevertheless intent to get hold of brunn and its spielberg if he could brunn is the strong place of moravia has a garrison of 6 or 7000 still better has the valiant roth whom we knew in neisse once for commandant brunn will not be had gratis  schwerin with a detachment of 6000 horse and foot posadowsky ziethen schmettau junior commanding under him has dashed along far in the van towards upper austria through the town of horn towards vienna itself levying he also heavy contributionswith a hand of iron and not much of a glove on it as we judge there is a grim enough proclamation in the name of a frightfully injured kaiser as well as kaisers ally still extant bearing schwerins signature and the date stein 26th feb 1742 in heldengeschichte ii 556 stein is on the donau a mile or two from krems and twice as far from mautern where the now kaiser was in autumn last forty and odd miles short of vienna this proved the pisgah of schwerin in that direction as it had done of karl albert ziethen with his hussars coursed some 20 miles farther on the vienna highway and got the length of stockerau a small town notable slightly ever since as the prussian nonplusultra in that line  meanwhile prince lobkowitz is rallying has quitted budweis and the bohemian bogs for some check of these insolences lobkowitz rallying to himself what vienna force there is comes now in good strength to waidhofen rearward of horn far rearward of stein and stockerau so that ziethen and schwerin have to draw homeward again lobkowitz fortifies himself in waidhofen gathers magazines there as if towards weightier enterprises for indeed much is rallying in a dangerous manner and moravia is now far other than when friedrich planned this expedition and at vienna 25th february last there was held secret council and much to robinsons regret a quite high resolution come towhich friedrich gets to know of and does not forget again     the saxons have no cannon for brunn cannot afford any there is a high resolution taken at vienna february 25th friedrich quits the moravian enterprise  friedrich keeps his headquarter all this while closer and closer upon brunn first chiefly at a town called znaim on the river taya manybranched river draining all those northwestern parts which sends its widening waters down to presburglatterly in junction with those of the morawa from north which washes olmutz drains the northern and eastern parts and gives the country its name of moravia brunn lies northeast of friedrich while in znaim some fifty miles the saxon headquarter is at kromau midway towards that city after znaim he shifts inward to selowitz still in the same taya valley but much nearer brunn and there continues at znaim 19th february9th march at selowitz 13th march5th april rodenbeck i 65  striving hard for brunn striving hard under difficulties for so many things distant and near we may fancy him busy enoughand are surprised at the fractions of light jordan correspondence which he still finds time for pretty bits of letters in prose and doggerel from and to those moravian villages jordan twice a week bearing the main weight friedrich oftener than one could hope flinging some word of answervery intent on berlin gossip we can notice vattel is still here your majesty oeuvres xvii 163 c insinuates jordanyoung vattel afterwards of the droit des gens whom his majesty might have kept but did notwhat more of your dargens then anything in your dargens friedrich will ask for certain dargens is full of esprit answers jordan in a dexterous way and how the effulgent of wurtemberg has quarrelled outright with her dargens and will not eat off silver dargent lest she have to name him by accidentwith other gossip in a fine brief airy form at which jordan excels cheering the rare leisure hour in ones tent at selowitz pohrlitz irrlitz far awaythere are also orders about cicero and books of business for most part or of private feelings nothing berlin gossip and books for ones reading are the staple but to return  out from headquarters diligent operations shoot forth far enough along those tayamorawa valleys where hungarian insurgents are beginning to be dangerous south of brunn all round brunn are diligent operations frequent skirmishings constant strict levyings of contributions the saving operation friedrich well sees would be to get hold of brunn but unluckily how vigilant roth scorns all summoning sallies continually in a dangerous manner and at length when closer pressed burns all the villages round him we counted as many as sixteen villages laid in ashes says friedrich here is small comfort of outlook  and then the saxons at kromau or wherever they may be no end of trouble and vexation with these saxons their quarters are not fairly allotted they say we make exchange of quarters without improvement noticeable one fine day on some slight alarm they came rushing over to us all in panic ruined merely by pandour noises had not we marched them back and reinstated them friedrich sends to silesia for reinforcements of his own which he can depend upon sends to silesia to glatz and the young dessauernay to brandenburg and the old dessauer ultimately finding roth would not yield he has sent to dresden for siegeartillery polish majesty there titular king of moravia answers that he cannot meet the expense of carriage he had just purchased a green diamond which would have carried them thither and back again what can be done with such a manand by this time early in march hungarian moriamur pro rege begins to show itself clouds of hungarian insurgents of the tolpatch pandour sort mount over the carpathians on us all round the east from south to north and threaten to penetrate silesia itself so that we have to sweep laboriously the morawataya valleys and undertake first one and then another outroad or sharp swift sally against

returning from vienna and its consultations took command 4th march heldengeschichte ii 557 with whom has come old graf von konigseck an experienced head to advise with prince karl is in motion skirting us southward about waidhofen where lobkowitz lay waiting him with magazines ready rumor says the force in those parts is already 40000 with more daily coming in friedrich has of his own apart from the saxons some 24000 prince karl with so many heavy troops and with unlimited supply of light is very capable of doing mischief he has orders and friedrich now knows of it to go in upon ussuch their decision in secret council at vienna on the 25th of february last that he must go and fight usbetter we met him with fewer thrums on our hands thinks friedrich and beckons the old dessauer out of brandenburg withal swift your serenity hitherward with 20000 which the old dessauer having 30000 to pick from late campofgottin people at once sets about will be a security in any event orlich i

swift surrender is it not the one thing needful chevalier de saxe admits half promises does not perform being again urged why have not you performed he answers alas your majesty here are orders for me to join marshal broglio at prag and retire altogether out of this  altogether out of it thinks friedrich to himself may all the powers be thanked then i too without disgrace can go altogether out of itand it shall be a sharp eye that sees me in jointstock with you again m le chevalier friedrich has written in his history and valori used to hear him often say in words never were tidings welcomer than these that the saxons were about to desert him in this manner go and may all the devilsbut we will not fall into profane swearing it is proper to get out of this enterprise at ones best speed and never get into the like of it again friedrich on this strange saxon revelation 30th march takes instant order for assembling at wischau again for departing towards olmutz thence homewards with deliberate celerity by the landskron mountaincountry tribau zwittau leutomischl and the way he came he has countermanded his silesian reinforcements these and the rest shall rendezvous at chrudim in bohemia whitherwards the two dessauers are boundin brunn with its wrecked environs famed spielberg looking down from its conical height and sixteen villages in ashes roth shall do his own way henceforth  the saxons pushed straight homewards did not rejoin broglio rejoin anybodyhad in fact done with this first silesian war as it proved and were ready for the opposite side on a second

indignant humor and much disposed to blame somebody to the poor polish nonmoravian majesty enlightened by his bruhls and staffofficers it became a fixed truth that the blame was all friedrichsstarving us marching us aboutthat friedrichs conduct to us was abominable and deserved fixed resentment which accordingly it got from the simple polish majesty otherwise a goodnatured creaturegot and kept to friedrichs very great astonishment and to his considerable disadvantage long after  friedrichs look when valori met him again coming home from this moravian futility was farouche fierce and dark his laugh bitter sardonic harsh mockery contempt and suppressed rage looking through all he said a proud young king getting instructed in several things by the stripes of experience look in that young

with a separate corps bent elsewhither than to chrudim keeps off the pandours a march laborious mountainous on roads of such quality but except baggagedifficulties and the like nothing material going wrong on the 13th april we marched to zwittau over the mountain of schonhengst the passage over this mountain is very steep but not so impracticable as it had been represented because the cannon and wagons can be drawn round the sides of it stille p 86 yesand readers may in fancy look about them from the top for we shall go this road again sixteen years hence hardly in happier circumstances  friedrich gets to chrudim april 17th there meets the young dessauer with his forces by and by the old dessauer too comes to an interview there of which shortly the old dessauerhis 20000 not with him at the moment but resting some way behind till he returnis to go eastward with part of them eastward troppaujablunka way and drive those pandour insurgencies to their own side of the mountains a job old leopold likes better than that of the gottin camp of last year other part of the 20000 is to reinforce young leopold and the king and go into cantonments and refreshmentquarters here at chrudim here living on bohemia with silesia at their back shall the troops repose a little and be ready for prince karl if he will come on that is what friedrich looks to as the main consolation left  in moravia now overrun with pandours precursors of prince karl he has left prince dietrich of anhalt able still to maintain himself with olmutz as headquarters for a calculated term of days dietrich is with all diligence to collect magazines for that jablunkatroppau service and march thither to his father with the same cutting his way through those pandour swarms and leaving mahren as bare as possible for prince karls behoof all which prince dietrich does in a gallant soldierlike prudent and valiant mannerwith details of danger well fronted of prompt dexterity of difficulty overcome which might be interesting to soldier students if there were among us any such species but cannot be dwelt upon here it is a march of 60 or 70 miles northeast not northwest as friedrichs had been through continual pandours perils and difficultiesmet in the due way by prince dietrich whose toils and valors had been of distinguished quality in this moravian business take one example not of very serious nature in the present march to troppau  olischau evening of april 21st just as we were getting into olischau still only in the environs of olmutz the vanguard of prince karls army appeared on the heights it did not attack but retired olmutz way for the night prince dietrich not doubting but it would return next day made the necessary preparations overnight nothing of it returned next day prince dietrich therefore in the night of april 22d pushed forward his sickwagons mealwagons heavy baggage peaceably to sternberg and at dawn on the morrow followed with his army cavalry ahead infantry to rear nothing whatever happeningunless this be a kind of thingour infantry had scarcely got the last bridge broken down after passing it when the roofs of olischau seemed as it were to blow up the inhabitants simultaneously seizing that moment and firing with violent diligence a prodigious number of shot at usno one of which owing to their hurry and the distance took any effect stille p

insurgency and there is the following minute phenomenonfit for a picturesque human memory as this from skalitz to ungarischbrod is a long march and the roads were almost impassable prince dietrich with his corps did not arrive till after dark so that having sufficiently blocked the place with parties of horse and foot he had in spite of thickfalling snow to wait under the open sky for daylight

beylage i p 508 when day broke and they shook themselves to their feet againto the astonishment of ungarischbrod  there had been fine passages of arms throughout in this business round brunn in the march home and elsewhere and friedrich is well contented with the conduct of his men and generalsand dwells afterwards with evident satisfaction on some of the feats they did for instance truchsess

home in a huff not to reappear in active life for some years to come the little marlboroughso they call him for he was at blenheim and has abrupt hot wayswill not participate in prince karls consolatory visit then better so thinks friedrich perhaps remembering mollwitz this is the freak of an imitation anglais sneers he in mentioning it to jordanfriedrichs synopsis of this moravian failure of an expedition in answer to jordans curiosity about itcuriosity implied not expressed by the modest jordan is characteristic  moravia which is a very bad country could not be held owing to want of victual and the town of brunn could not be taken because the saxons had no cannon and when you wish to enter a town you must first make a hole to get in by besides the country has been reduced to such a state that the enemy cannot subsist in it and you will soon see him leave it there is your little military lesson i would not have you at a loss what to think of our operations or what to say should other people talk of them in your presence friedrich to jordan oeuvres xvii 196 chrudim 5th may 1742  winter campaigns says friedrich elsewhere much in earnest and looking back on this thing long afterwards winter campaigns are bad and should always be avoided except in cases of necessity the best army in the world is liable to be ruined by them i myself have made more winter campaigns than any general of this age but there were reasons thus  in 1740 winter campaign which we saw there were hardly above two austrian regiments in silesia at karl vis death being determined to assert my right to that duchy i had to try it at once in winter and carry the war if possible to the banks of the neisse had i waited till spring we must have begun the war between crossen and glogau what was now to be gained by one march would then have cost us three or four campaigns a sufficient reason this for campaigning in winter  if i did not succeed in the winter campaign of 1742 campaign which we have just got out of which i made with a design to deliver the elector of bavarias country then overrun by austria it was because the french acted like fools and the saxons like traitors mark that deliberate opinion  in 174546 winter campaign which we expect to see the austrians having got silesia it was necessary to drive them out the saxons and they had formed a design to enter my hereditary dominions to destroy them with fire and sword i was beforehand with them i carried the war into the heart of saxony military instructions written by c translated by an officer london 1762 pp 171 172 one of the best or altogether the best of friedrichs excellent little books written successively thriceprivate could they have been kept so for the instruction of his officers is to be found now in oeuvres de frederic xxviii that is vol i of the oeuvres militaires which occupy 3 vols pp 4 et seqq  digesting many bitterenough thoughts friedrich has cantoned about chrudim expecting in grim composed humor the one consolation there can now be february 25th as readers well know the majesty of hungary and her aulic council had decided one stroke more o excellency robinson one battle more for our silesian jewel of the crown if beaten we will then give it up oh not till then robinson and hyndfordimagination may faintly represent their feelings on the wilful downbreak of kleinschnellendorf or what clamor and urgency the majesty of britain and they have been making ever since but they could carry it no further one stroke more  at chrudim and to the right and the left of it sprinkled about in long very thin elliptic shape thirty or forty miles long but capable of coalescing within eightandforty hours there lies friedrich the elbe river is behind him beyond elbe are his magazines at konigsgratz nimburg podiebrad pardubitz the giant mountains and world of bohemian hills closingin the background far off that is his position if readers will consult their map the consolatory visit he privately thinks cannot be till the grass come that is not till june two months hence but there also he was a little mistaken     chapter xi nussler in neisse with the old dessauer and walrave  the old dessauer with part of his 20000aided by boy dietrich knabe knave dietrich as one might fondly call him and the moravian mealwagonsaccomplished his troppaujablunka problem perfectly well cleaning the mountains and keeping them clean of that pandour rabble as he was the man to do nor would his expedition require mentioning fartherwere it not for some slight passages of a purely biographical character first of all for certain rubs which befell between his majesty and him for example once before that interview at chrudim just on entering bohemia thitherward old leopold had seen good to alter his marchroute andon better information as he thought it which proved to be worsehad taken a road not prescribed to him hearing of which friedrich reins him up into the right course in this sharp manner  chrudim 21st april i am greatly surprised that your serenity as an old officer does not more accurately follow my orders which i give you if you were skilfuler than caesar and did not with strict accuracy observe my orders all else were of no help to me i hope this notice once for all will be enough and that in time coming you will give no farther causes to complain king to furst leopold orlich i 219221  friedrich on their meeting at chrudim was the same man as ever but the old son of gunpowder stood taciturn rigorous in military business attitude in the kings presence had not forgotten the passage and indeed he kept it in mind for long months after and during all this oberschlesien time had the hidden grudge in his heartdoing his days work with scrupulous punctuality all the more scrupulous they say friedrich tried privately through leopold junior some slight touches of assuagement but without effect and left the senior to time and to his own methods of cooling again  besides that of keeping down hungarian enterprises in the mountains old leopold had as would appear to take some general superintendence in oberschlesien and especially looks after the new fortificationwork going on in those parts which latter function brought him often to neisse and into contact with the ugly walrave engineerinchief there a much older and much worthier acquaintance of ours herr boundarycommissioner nussler happens also to be in neissewaiting for those saxon gentlemen who are unpunctual to a degree and never come nor in fact ever will if nussler knew it luckily nussler kept a notebook and busching ultimately got it condensed it printed itwhereby what is rare in these dryasdust labyrinths inane spectralities and cindermountains there is sudden eyesight vouchsafed and we discern veritably far off brought face to face for an instant this and that i must translate some passagesstill farther condensed     how nussler happened to be in neisse may 1742  nussler had been in this country off and on almost since christmas last ready here if the saxons had been ready as the saxons were not ready and always broke their appointment nussler had gone into the mountains to pass time usefully and take preliminary view of the ground   from berlin 20th december 1741 by breslauwhere some pause and correspondencethence on neisse way as far as lowen so well known to friedrich that mollwitz night from berlin to lowen nussler had come in a carriage but as there was much snow falling he here took a couple of sledges in which along with his attendants he proceeded some fifty miles to jauernik a stage beyond neisse to the southwest jauernik is a little town lying at the foot of a hill on the top of which is the schloss of johannisberg here it began to rain and the getting up the hill on sledges was a difficult matter the drost steward of this castle was a nobleman from brunswickluneburg who for the sake of a marriage and this drostship for dowry had changed from protestant to roman catholicpoor soul his wife and he were very polite and showed nussler a great deal of kindness nussler remarked on the left side of this johannisberg western side a good few miles off the pass which leads from glatz to upper and lower schlesienwhere the reader too has been in that baumgarten skirmish if he could remember itwith a little blockhouse in the bottom and no doubt prussian soldiers in it at the moment nussler intent always on the useful did not institute picturesque reflections but considered that his king would wish to have this pass and blockhouse and determined privately though it perhaps lay rather beyond the boundarymark that his master must have it when the bargaining should come  on the homeward survey of these borders nussler arrived at steinau little village with schloss which we saw once on the march to mollwitz and how accident of fire devoured it that night and at sight of the burnt schloss standing black there he remembered with great emotion the story of grafin von callenberg dead since with her pistols and brandybottle and of the grafins daughter in which he had been concerned as a muchinterested witness in old times for the rest the journey amid ice and snow was not only troublesome in the extreme but he got a lifelong gout by it and no profit to speak of having sunk once on thin ice sledge and he into a halffrozen stream and got wetted to the loins splashing about in such cold mannerhappily not quite drowned the indefatigable nussler working still like a very artist wherever bidden on wages miraculously low  the saxon gentlemen never cameprivately the saxons were quite off from the silesian bargain and from friedrich altogetherso that this border survey of nusslers came to nothing on the present occasion but it served him and friedrich well on a new boundarysettling which did take effect and which holds to this day nussler during these operations and vain waitings for the saxons had neisse for headquarters and going and returning was much about neisse walrave marwitz father of wilhelminas baggage marwitz feldmarschall schwerin in earlier stages and other high figures being prominent in his circle there  the old prince of dessau came thither for some days busching beitrage i 347 beginning of may as we guess but there is no date given he was very gracious to nussler who had been at his court and known him before this the old dessauer made use of walraves plate usually had walrave nussler and other principal figures to dinner walraves plate every piece of it was carefully marked with a raven on the rimthat being his crest wallraven his name old dessauer at sight of so many images of that bird threw out the observation loud enough from the top of the table hah walrave i see you are making yourself acquainted with the ravens in time that they may not be strange to you at lastwhen they come to eat you on the gibbet not a soft tongue the old dessauers another day seeing walrave seated between two jesuit guests the prince said ah there you are right walrave there you sit safe the devil cant get you there as the prince kept continually bantering him in this strain walrave determined not to come sulkily absented himself one day but the prince sent the ordinanz soldier in waiting to fetch him no refuge in sulks  they had romancatholic victual for walrave and others of that faith on the meagredays but walrave eat right before himevidently nothing but the name of catholic indeed he was a man hated by the catholics for his special rapacity on them he is of no religion at all said the catholic prelate of neisse one day to nussler greedy to plunder the monasteries here has wrung gold silver aud jewels from themnay from the pope himselfby threatening to turn protestant and use the monasteries still worse and the pope hearing of this had to send him a valuable gift which you may see some day nussler did one day see this preciosity a crucifix ebony bordered with gold and the body all of that metal on the smallest of altarsin walraves bedroom but it was the bedroom itself which nussler looked at with a shudder nussler and we in the middle of it stood walraves own bed on his right hand that of his wife and on his left that of his mistressa brutish polygamous walrave this mistress was a certain quartermasters wifequartermaster willing it is probable to get rid of such an article gratis much more on terms of profit walrave had begged for him the title of hofrath from king friedrichwhich though it was but a clipping of ribbon contemptible to friedrich and the brute of an engineer had excellent talents in his business i rather wish friedrich had refused in this instance but he did not he answered in gibing tone i grant you the hofrath title for your quartermaster thinking it but fit that a generalswhat shall we call her friedrich uses the direct wordshould have some handle to her name busching beitrage i 343348  it was this mistress one is happy to know that ultimately betrayed the unbeautiful walrave and brought him to magdeburg for the rest of his lifeand now let us over the mountains to chrudim again a hundred and fifty miles at one step     chapter xii  prince karl does come on  it was before the middle of may not of june as friedrich had expected that serious news reached chrudim may 11th from that place there is a letter to jordan which for once has no verse no bantering in it prince karl actually coming on hussar precursors in quantity stealing across to attack our magazines beyond elbeand in consequence orders are out this very day cantonments cease immediate rendezvous and encampment at chrudim here which takes effect two days hence monday 13th may one of the finest sights stille ever saw his majesty rode to a height you never beheld such a scene bright columns foot and horse streaming in from every point of the compass their clear arms glittering in the sun lost now in some hollow then emerging winding out with longdrawn glitter again till at length their blue uniforms and actual faces come home to you near upon 30000 of all arms trim exact of stout and silently goodhumored aspect well rested by this timelikely fellows for their work who will do it with a will the king seemed to be affected by so glorious a spectacle and what i admired his majesty though fatigued would not rest satisfied with reports or distant view but personally made the tour of the whole camp to see that everything was right and posted the pickets himself before retiring stille p 57 or letter x  prince karl since we last heard of him had hung about in the brunn and other moravian regions rallying his forces pushing out croat parties upon prince dietrichs homemarch and the like very ill off for food for draughtcattle in a wasted country so that he had soon quitted mahren made for budweis and neighborhooddangerous to broglios outposts there to a castle of frauenberg across the moldau from budweis which is broglios bulwark there and has cost broglio much revictualling reinforcing and flurry for the last two months prince karl did not meddle with brauenberg or broglio on this occasion leaves lobkowitz with some reserveparty hovering about in those partsand himself advances by teutschbrod well known to the poor retreating saxons latcey towards chrudim on his grand problem that of 25th february last cautiously not too willingly old konigseck and he but they were inflexibly urged to it by the heads at vienna who what with their bavarian successes what with their moravian and other had got into a high keyand scorned the notion of peace when hyndford getting friedrichs permission in the late chrudim interval had urged it again orlich i 226  broglio is in

not to be called well off friedrich and he are in correspondence by no means mutually pleasant on the princekarl phenomenon evidently intending towards prag your majesty perceives thinks broglio if not towards chrudim first of all which is 80 miles nearer him on his rode to prag urges friedrich at this stage help me with a few regiments in this chrudim circle lest i prove too weak here is not this the bulwark of your prag just now in vain broglio who indeed has orders that way cannot spare a man very well thinks friedrich and has girded up his own strength for the chrudim phenomenon but does not forget this new illustration of the jointstock principle and the advantages of broglio partnership  friedrichs beautiful encampment at chrudim lasted only two days precursor tolpatcheries and in fact prince karls vanguard if we knew it come storming about rifer and rifer attempting the bridge of kolin road to our magazines attempting this and that meaning to get between us and prag and what is worse to seize the magazines podiebrad nimburg which we have in that quarter tuesday may 15th accordingly friedrich himself gets on march with a strong swift vanguard horse and foot grenadiers hussars dragoons pragwardprobably as far as kuttenberg a fine highlying post which commands those kodin partswill march with despatch and see how that matter is the main army is to follow under leopold of anhaltdessau tomorrow wednesday so soon as their loaves have come from konigsgratzfor an army goes on its belly says friedrich often loaves do not come owing to evil chance on this occasion leopolds people take meal instead but will follow next morning all the same according to bidding readers may as well take their map and accompany in these movements which issue in a notable conclusive thing  tuesday morning 15th may friedrich marches from chrudim on which same morning of the 15th prince karl steadily on the advance he too is startingand towards the same pointfrom a place called chotieborz only fifteen miles to southward of chrudim in this way mutually unaware but prince karl getting soonest aware the vanguards of the two armies prince karls vanguard being in many branches of tolpatch nature are cast athwart each other and make both to friedrich and prince karl an enigmatic business of it for the next two days tuesday 15th friedrich marching along vigilantly observant on both hands some fifteen miles space came that evening to a village called podhorzan with height near by stille pp 60 61 height which he judged unattackable and on the side of which he pitches his camp accordinglyhimself mounting the height to look for news news sure enough there south of us on the heights of ronnow three or four miles off are the enemy camped or pickeering about 7 or 8000 as we judge lobkowitz surely not lobkowitz he has been gliding about on the french outskirts far in the southwest lately can this be lobkowitz about to join prince karl in these partstruly your majesty this is not lobkowitz at all this is prince karls vanguard and prince karl himself actually in it for the momentanxiously taking view of your vanguard recognizing and admitting to himself pooh they will be at kuttenberg before us no use in hastening headquarters at willimow tonight here at ronnow tomorrow that is all we can do orlich i 233  tomorrow 16th may before sunrise at podhorzan the supposed lobkowitz is clean vanished there is no enemy visible to friedrich at ronnow or elsewhere leaving friedrich in considerable uncertainty clear only that there are enemies copiously about that he himself will hold on for kuttenberg that young leopold must get hitherward with steady celerity at the top of his effortparts of the ground being difficult especially a muddy stream called dobrowa which has only one bridge on it fit for artillery the bridge of sbislau a mile or two ahead of this instructions are sent leopold to that effect and farther that leopold must quarter in czaslau a substantial little town with bogs about it and military virtues and on the whole keep close to heel of us the enemy in force being near upon which his majesty pushes on for kuttenberg prince leopold following with best diligence according to program his majesty passed a little place called neuhof that afternoon wednesday 16th may and encamped a short way from kuttenberg behind or north of that townout of which on his approach there fled a considerable cloud of austrian irregulars and left a large baking of bread bread just about ready to their order and coming hot out of the ovens which was very welcome to his majesty that night and will yield refreshment partial refreshment next morning to prince leopold not too comfortable on his mealdiet just now  poor prince leopold had his own difficulties this day rough ground very difficult to pass and coming on the height of podhorzan where his majesty was yesterday leopold sees crowds of hussars needing a cannonshot or two sees evident symptoms to southward that the whole force of the enemy is advancing upon him speed then for sbislau bridge yonder across the dobrowa with our artillerywagons or we are lost prince karl with hussarparties all about is fully aware of prince leopold and his movements and is rolling on ronnowward all day to cut him off in his detached state if possible prince karl might with ease have broken this dobrowa bridge and leopold and military men recognize it as a capital neglect that he did not  leopold overloaded with such intricacies and anxieties sends off three messengers officers of mark schmettau junior one of them to apprise the king the officers return unable to get across to his majesty leopold sends proper detachment of horse with themuncertain still whether they will get through and night is falling we shall evidently be too late for getting czaslau well if we can occupy chotusitz and the environs a small clay hamlet three miles nearer us it was 11 at night before the rearguard got into chotusitz czaslau three miles south of us we cannot attend to till tomorrow morning orlich pp 236239 and the three messengers despatched with escort send back no word have they ever got to his majesty leopold sends off a fourth this fourth one does get through reports to his majesty that by all appearance there will be battle on the morrow early that not czaslau but only chotusitz is ours and that instructions are wanted deep in the night this fourth messenger returns a welcome awakening for prince leopold who studies his majestys instructions and will make his dispositions accordingly  it is 2 or 3 in the morning ib p 238 in leopolds campbivouac rather with its face to the south and chotusitz ahead thursday 17th may 1742 a furiously important day about to dawn high problem of the 23th february last britannic majesty and his hyndfords and robinsons vainly protestingit had to be tried hungarian majesty having got from britannic the sinews for trying it and this is to be the day     chapter xiii battle of chotusitz  kuttenberg czaslau chotusitz and all these other places lie in what is called the valley of the elbe but what to the eye has not the least appearance of a hollow but of an extensive plain rather dimpled here and there and if anything rather sloping from the elbewere it not that dull bushless brooks one or two sauntering to northward not southward warn you of the contrary conceive a flat tract of this kind some three or four miles square with czaslau on its southern border chotusitz on its northern flanked on the west by a straggle of lakelets ponds and quagmires which in our time are drained away all but a tenth part or so of remainder flanked on the east by a considerable puddle of a stream called the dobrowa and cut in the middle by a nameless poor brook brtlinka some write it if anybody could pronounce running parallel and independentwhich latter of more concernment to us here springs beyond czaslau and is got to be of some size and more intricate than usual with islands and the like as it passes chotusitz a little to east of chotusitzthis is our field of battle sixty or more miles to eastward of prag eight miles or more to southward of elbe river and the ford of elbeteinitz which we shall hear of in years coming a scene worth visiting by the curious though it is by no means of picturesque character  uncomfortably bare like most german plains mean little hamlets which are full of litter when you enter them lie sprinkled about little churchspires like suffragans to chotusitz spire which is near you a ragged untrimmed country beyond the brook towards the dobrowa two or more miles from chotusitz is still noticeable something like a deerpark with umbrageous features bushy clumps and shadowy vestiges of a mansion the one regular edifice within your horizon schuschitz is the name of this mansion and deerpark farther on lies sbislau where leopold happily found his bridge unbroken yesterday  the general landscape is scrubby littery illtilled scratched rather than ploughed physiognomic of czech populations who are seldom trim at elbows any beauty it has is on the farther side of the dobrowa which does not concern prince leopold prince karl or us at present prince leopolds camp lies east and west short way to north of chotusitz schuschitz hamlet a good mile northward of sbislau covers his left the chain of lakelets covers his right and chotusitz one of his outposts lies centrally in front prince karl is coming on in four columns from the hills and intricacies south of czaslauhas been on march all night intending a nightattack or camisado if he could but could not in the least owing to the intricate roadways and the discrepancies of pace between his four columns the sun was up before anything of him appeareddrawing out visibly yonder by the east side of czaslau 30000 strong they say friedrichs united force were friedrich himself on the ground will be about 28000  friedrichs orders which leopold is studying were hold by chotusitz for centre your left wing see you lean it on something towards dobrowa sideon that intricate brook brtlinka or parkwall of schuschitz sbislau friedrich hastily calls it oeuvres ii 121126 stille p 63 is more exact which i think is there then your right wing westwards till you lean again on something two lines leave room for me and my force on the corner nearest here i will start at four be with you between seven and eightand even bring a proportion of austrian bread hot from these ovens of kuttenberg to refresh part of you leopold of anhalt a muchcomforted man waits only for the earliest gray of the morning to be up and doing from chotusitz he spreads out leftwards towards the brtlinka brookdifficult ground that unfit for cavalry with its bogholes islands gullies and broken surface better have gone across the brtlinka with mere infantry and leant on the wall of that deerpark of schuschitz with perhaps only 1000 horse to support well rearward of the infantry and this difficult ground so men thinkafter the action is over stille pp 63 67 and indeed there was certainly some misarrangement there done by leopolds subordinates which had its effects shortly  leopold was not there in person arranging that left wing leopold is looking after centre and right he perceives the right wing will be his best chance knows that in general cavalry must be on both wings on a little eminence in front of his right he sees how the enemy comes on czaslau lately on their left is now getting to rear of themand you stout old general buddenbrock spread yourself out to right a little hidden behind this rising ground i think we may outflank their left wing by a few squadrons which will be an advantage  buddenbrock spreads himself out as bidden had buddenbrock been reinforced by most of the horse that could do no good on our left wing it is thought the battle had gone better buddenbrock in this way secretly outflanks the austrians to his right all forward he has that string of marshy pools lakes of czirkwitz so called outflowings from the brook of neuhof and cannot be taken in flank by any means brook of neuhof which his majesty crossed yesterday farther northand ought to have recrossed by this timesaid brook hereabouts a mere fringe of quagmires and marshy pools is our extreme boundary on the west or right brook of brtlinka unluckily not wall of the deerpark bounds us eastward or on our left prince karl drawn up by this time is in two lines cavalry on right and left but rather in bent order bent towards us at both ends being dainty of his ground i suppose and comes on in hollowcrescent formwhich is not reckoned orthodox by military men what all these villages human individuals and terrified deer are thinking i never can conjecture thicksoled peasants terrified nursingmothers better to run and hide i should say mount your garron ploughhorses hide your butterpots mealbarrels run at least ten miles or so  it is now past seven a hot may morning the austrians very nearand yonder of a surety is his majesty coming majesty has marched since four and is here at his time loaves and all his men rank at once in the corner left for them one of his horsegenerals lehwald is sent to the left to put straight what my be awry there cannot quite do it he eitherand the attack by buddenhrock who secretly outflanks here on the right this shall at once take effect no sooner has his majesty got upon the little eminence or rising ground and scanned the austrian lines for an instant or two than his cannonbatteries awaken here give the austrian horse a good blast by way of morning salutation and overture to the concert of the day and buddenbrock deploying under cover of that charges first at a trot then at a gallop to see what can be done upon them with the white weapon old uuddenbrock surely did not himself ride in the charge he is an old man of seventy has fought at oudenarde malplaquet nay at steenkirk and been run through the body under dutch william is an old acquaintance of charles xiis even and sat solemnly by friedrich wilhelms coffin after so much attendance during life the special leader of the charge was bredow also a veteran gentleman but still only in the fifties he i conclude made the charge first at a trot then at a gallopwith swords flashing hideous and eyebrows knit  the dust was prodigious says friedrich weather being dry and ground sandy for a space of time you could see nothing but one huge whirlpool of dust with the gleam of steel flickering madly in it however buddenbrock outflanking the austrian first line of horse did hurl them from their place by and by you see the dusttempest running south faster and faster souththat is to say the austrian horse in flight for buddenbrock outflanking them by three squadrons has tumbled their first line topsyturvy and they rush to rearward he following away and away oeuvres de frederic ii 123 now were the time for a fresh force of prussian cavalryfor example those you have standing useless behind the gullies and quagmires on your left wing says stille after the eventdue support to buddenbrock and all that austrian cavalry were gone and their infantry left bare  but now again see do not the dustclouds pause they pause mounting higher and higher they dance wildly then roll back towards us too evidently back buddenbrock has come upon the secoud line of austrian horse in too loose order buddenbrock by this time and they have broken himand it is a mutual defeat of horse on this wing the prussian rather the worse of the two and might have been serioushad not rothenburg plunged furiously in at this crisis quite through to the austrian infantry and restored matters or more making a confused result of it in this quarter austrian horseregiments there now were that fled quite away as did even one or two footregiments while the prussian infantry dashed forward on them escorted by rothenburg in this mannerwho got badly wounded in the business and was long an object of solicitude to friedrich and contrariwise certain prussian horse also it was too visible did not compose themselves till fairly arear of our foot this is shock first in the battle there are three shocks in all  partial charging fencing and flourishing went on but nothing very effectual was done by the horse in this quarter farther nor did the fire or effort of the prussian infantry in this their right wing continue austrian fury and chief effort having by this time broken out in an opposite quarter so that the strain of the fight lies now in the other wing over about chotusitz and the brtlinka brook and thither i perceive his majesty has galloped being always in the thickest of the danger this day shock second is now on the austrians have attacked at chotusitz and are threatening to do wonders there  prince leopolds left wing as we said was entirely defective in the eye of tacticians after the event far from leaning on the wall of the deerpark he did not even reach the brookor had to weaken his force in chotusitz village for that object so that when the austrian foot comes storming upon chotusitz there is but half a regiment to defend it and as for cavalry what is to become of cavalry slowly threading under cannonshot and musketry these intricate quagmires and gullies and dangerously breaking into files and strings before ever it can find ground to charge accordingly the austrian foot took chotusitz after obstinate resistance and old konigseck very ill of gout got seated in one of the huts there and the prussian cavalry embarrassed to get through the gullies could not charge except piecemeal and then though in some cases with desperate valor yet in all without effectual result konigseck sits in chotusitzand yet withal the russians are not out of it will not be driven out of it but cling obstinately whereupon the austrians set fire to the place its dry thatch goes up in flame and poor old konigseck quite lame of gout narrowly escaped burning they say  and see the austrian horse have got across the brtlinka are spread almost to the deerpark and strive hard to take us in flankdid not the brook the bad ground and the platoonfiring fearfully swift from discipline and the iron ramrods hold them back in some measure they make a violent attempt or two but the problem is very rugged nor can the austrian infantry behind or to the west of burning chotusitz make an impression though they try it with levelled bayonets and deadly energy again and again the prussian ranks are as if built of rock and their fire is so sure and swift here is one austrian regiment came rushing on like lions would not let go death or nodeathand here it lies shot down in ranks whole swaths of dead men and their muskets by themas if they had got the word to take that posture and had done it hurriedly a small transitory gleam of proud rage is visible deep down in the soul of friedrich as he records this fact shock second was very violent  the austrian horse after such experimenting in the brtlinka quarter gallop off to try to charge the prussians in the rearpleasanter by far judge many of them to plunder the prussian camp which they descry in those regions whither accordingly they rush too many of them and the hussars as one man to the sorrowful indignation of prince karl whose right arm or wing is fallen paralytic in this manner after the fight they repented in dust and ashes and went to say so as if with the rope about their neck upon which he pardoned them  nor is prince karls left wing gaining garlands just at this moment shock third is awakeningand will be decisive on prince karl chotusitz set on fire an hour since about 9 am still burns cutting him in two as it were or disjoining his left wing from his right and it is on his right wing that prince karl is depending for victory at present his left wing ruffled by those first prussian charges of horse with occasional prussian swift musketry ever since being left to its own inferior luck which is beginning to produce impression on it and lo on the sudden what brought finis to the business friedrich seizing the moment commands a united charge on this left wing friedrichs right wing dashes forward on it doublequick takes it furiously on front and flank fifteen fieldpieces preceding and intolerable musketry behind them so that the austrian left wing cannot stand it at all  the austrian left wing stormed in upon in this manner swags and sways threatening to tumble pellmell upon the right wing which latter has its own hands full no chotusitz or point of defence to hold by prince karl is eminently ill off and will be hurled wholly into the brtlinka and the islands and gullies unless he mind prince karlwhat a moment for himnoticing this undeniable phenomenon rapidly gives the word for retreat to avoid worse it is near upon noon four hours of battle very fierce on both the wings together or alternately in the centre westward of chotusitz mostly insignificant more than half the prussians standing with arms shouldered prince karl rolls rapidly away through czaslau towards southwest again loses guns in czaslau goes not quite broken but at doublequick time for five miles cavalry prussian and austrian bickering in the rear of him and vanishes over the horizon towards willimow and haber that night the way he had come  this is the battle of chotusitz called also of czaslau thursday 17th may 1742 vehemently fought on both sidescalculated one may hope to end this silesian matter the results in killed and wounded were not very far from equal nay in killed the prussians suffered considerably the worse the exact austrian cipher of killed being 1052 while that of the prussians was 1905owing chiefly to those fierce ineffectual horsecharges and bickerings on the right wing and left above 1200 prussian cavalry were destroyed in these but in fine the general loss including wounded and missing amounted on the austrian side prisoners being many and deserters very many to near seven thousand and on the prussian to between four and five orlich i 255 feldzuge der preussen p 113

were unexpectedly bestirring themselves and threatening to capture that castle of frauenberg mythic old hillcastle among woods broglios chief post in those regions broglio may 24th has fought a handsome skirmish thanks partly to belleisle who chanced to arrive from frankfurt just in the nick of time and joined broglio skirmish of sahay magnified in all the french gazettes into a victory of sahay victory little short of pharsalia says friedrichthe complete account of which forgotten now by all creatures is to be read in him they call mauvillon guerre de boheme ii 204 and makes a pretty enough piece of fence on the small scale lobkowitz had to give up the frauenberg enterprise and cross to budweis again till new force should come  why not drive him out of budweis think the two french marshals him and whatever force can come if those lucky prussians would cooperate and those unlucky saxons how easy were itbelleisle sets off to persuade friedrich to persuade saxony and we shall see him on the route broglio waiting sublime on the hither side of the moldau well within wind of budweis till belleisle prevail and return with said cooperation what became of broglio waiting in this sublime manner we shall also have to see but perhaps not for a great while yet cannot pause on such absurd phenomena yetthough broglios catastrophe is itself a thing imminent and within some ten days

chotusitz affair were not of decisive nature but it had been fought with obstinacy with great fury on the austrian side who as it were had a bet upon it ever since february 25th britannic george and all the world looking on and in dispiritment and discredit to the beaten party its results were considerable the voice of all the world declaring through its gazetteer editors you cannot beat those

hopeless to poor pallandt calling one day at pallandts sickcouch friedrich was so sympathetic humane and noble that pallandt was touched by it and said what a pity your noble majesty and my noble queen should ruin one another for a set of french intruders who play false even to your majesty false friedrich inquires farther pallandt a man familiar at court has seen a letter from fleury to the queen of hungary conclusive as to fleurys good faith will undertake if permitted to get his majesty a sight of it friedrich permits the fleury letter comes to the effect make peace with us o queen

hormayr anemonen ii 186 adelung iii a 149 n actual copy of this letter the most ardent gazetteer curiosity could not attain to at that epoch but the pallandt story seems to have been trueand as to the fleury letter in such circumstances copies of various fleury letters to the like purport are still public enough and fleurys private intentions already guessed at by friedrich are in our time a secret

pandours hovering about everywhere in prince karls rear pouncing down upon prussian outposts convoys mostly to little purpose hoping what proves quite futile they may even burn a prussian magazine here or there contemptible to the prussian soldier though very troublesome to him friedrich regards the pandour sort with their jingling savagery as a kind of military vermin not conceivable a prussian formed corps should yield to any odds of pandour tolpatch tagraggery nor does the prussian soldier yield though sometimes like the mastiff galled by inroad of distracted weasels in too great quantity he may have his own difficulties witness colonel retzow and the magazine at pardubitz daybreak may 24th versus the infinitude of sudden tolpatchery bursting from the woods rabid enough for

cooperate thinks belleisle your king of prussia will not m le marechal answers brogliono indeed he has tried that trade already m le marechal think broglio and we the suspicions that friedrich so quiescent after his chotusitz is making peace are rife everywhere especially in broglios head and old fleurys though belleisle persists with emphasis officially and privately in the opposite opinion husht messieurs better go and see however  belleisle does go starts for kuttenberg for dresden his beautiful budweis project now ready french reinforcements streaming towards us heart high againif

that can be called authenticand we learn only that friedrich with considerable distinctness gave him to know clearly say all the books except friedrichs own that cooperation was henceforth a thing of the preterpluperfect tense all that i ever wanted more than i ever demanded austria now offers can any one blame me that i close such a business as ours has all along been on such terms as these now offered me are  it is said and is likely enough the pallandtfleury letter came up as probably the moravian foray and various broglio passages would in the train of said letter to all which and to the
