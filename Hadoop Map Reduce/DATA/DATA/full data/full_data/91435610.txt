91435610	told after supper  by jerome k jerome     contents  introductory how the stories came to be told teddy biffles storyjohnson and emily or the faithful ghost interludethe doctors story mr coombes storythe haunted mill or the ruined home interlude my uncles storythe ghost of the blue chamber a personal explanation my own story     introductory    it was christmas eve  i begin this way because it is the proper orthodox respectable way to begin and i have been brought up in a proper orthodox respectable way and taught to always do the proper orthodox respectable thing and the habit clings to me  of course as a mere matter of information it is quite unnecessary to mention the date at all  the experienced reader knows it was christmas eve without my telling him  it always is christmas eve in a ghost story  christmas eve is the ghosts great gala night  on christmas eve they hold their annual fete  on christmas eve everybody in ghostland who is anybodyor rather speaking of ghosts one should say i suppose every nobody who is any nobodycomes out to show himself or herself to see and to be seen to promenade about and display their windingsheets and graveclothes to each other to criticise one anothers style and sneer at one anothers complexion  christmas eve parade as i expect they themselves term it is a function doubtless eagerly prepared for and looked forward to throughout ghostland especially the swagger set such as the murdered barons the crimestained countesses and the earls who came over with the conqueror and assassinated their relatives and died raving mad  hollow moans and fiendish grins are one may be sure energetically practised up  bloodcurdling shrieks and marrowfreezing gestures are probably rehearsed for weeks beforehand  rusty chains and gory daggers are overhauled and put into good working order and sheets and shrouds laid carefully by from the previous years show are taken down and shaken out and mended and aired  oh it is a stirring night in ghostland the night of december the twentyfourth  ghosts never come out on christmas night itself you may have noticed  christmas eve we suspect has been too much for them they are not used to excitement  for about a week after christmas eve the gentlemen ghosts no doubt feel as if they were all head and go about making solemn resolutions to themselves that they will stop in next christmas eve while lady spectres are contradictory and snappish and liable to burst into tears and leave the room hurriedly on being spoken to for no perceptible cause whatever  ghosts with no position to maintainmere middleclass ghosts occasionally i believe do a little haunting on offnights  on allhallows eve and at midsummer and some will even run up for a mere local eventto celebrate for instance the anniversary of the hanging of somebodys grandfather or to prophesy a misfortune  he does love prophesying a misfortune does the average british ghost  send him out to prognosticate trouble to somebody and he is happy  let him force his way into a peaceful home and turn the whole house upside down by foretelling a funeral or predicting a bankruptcy or hinting at a coming disgrace or some other terrible disaster about which nobody in their senses want to know sooner they could possibly help and the prior knowledge of which can serve no useful purpose whatsoever and he feels that he is combining duty with pleasure  he would never forgive himself if anybody in his family had a trouble and he had not been there for a couple of months beforehand doing silly tricks on the lawn or balancing himself on somebodys bedrail  then there are besides the very young or very conscientious ghosts with a lost will or an undiscovered number weighing heavy on their minds who will haunt steadily all the year round and also the fussy ghost who is indignant at having been buried in the dustbin or in the village pond and who never gives the parish a single nights quiet until somebody has paid for a firstclass funeral for him  but these are the exceptions  as i have said the average orthodox ghost does his one turn a year on christmas eve and is satisfied  why on christmas eve of all nights in the year i never could myself understand  it is invariably one of the most dismal of nights to be out incold muddy and wet  and besides at christmas time everybody has quite enough to put up with in the way of a houseful of living relations without wanting the ghosts of any dead ones mooning about the place i am sure  there must be something ghostly in the air of christmassomething about the close muggy atmosphere that draws up the ghosts like the dampness of the summer rains brings out the frogs and snails  and not only do the ghosts themselves always walk on christmas eve but live people always sit and talk about them on christmas eve whenever five or six englishspeaking people meet round a fire on christmas eve they start telling each other ghost stories nothing satisfies us on christmas eve but to hear each other tell authentic anecdotes about spectres  it is a genial festive season and we love to muse upon graves and dead bodies and murders and blood  there is a good deal of similarity about our ghostly experiences but this of course is not our fault but the fault ghosts who never will try any new performances but always will keep steadily to old safe business  the consequence is that when you have been at one christmas eve party and heard six people relate their adventures with spirits you do not require to hear any more ghost stories  to listen to any further ghost stories after that would be like sitting out two farcical comedies or taking in two comic journals the repetition would become wearisome  there is always the young man who was one year spending the christmas at a country house and on christmas eve they put him to sleep in the west wing  then in the middle of the night the room door quietly opens and somebodygenerally a lady in her nightdresswalks slowly in and comes and sits on the bed  the young man thinks it must be one of the visitors or some relative of the family though he does not remember having previously seen her who unable to go to sleep and feeling lonesome all by herself has come into his room for a chat  he has no idea it is a ghost  he is so unsuspicious  she does not speak however and when he looks again she is gone  the young man relates the circumstance at the breakfasttable next morning and asks each of the ladies present if it were she who was his visitor  but they all assure him that it was not and the host who has grown deadly pale begs him to say no more about the matter which strikes the young man as a singularly strange request  after breakfast the host takes the young man into a corner and explains to him that what he saw was the ghost of a lady who had been murdered in that very bed or who had murdered somebody else thereit does not really matter which  you can be a ghost by murdering somebody else or by being murdered yourself whichever you prefer  the murdered ghost is perhaps the more popular but on the other hand you can frighten people better if you are the murdered one because then you can show your wounds and do groans  then there is the sceptical guestit is always the guest who gets let in for this sort of thing bythebye  a ghost never thinks much of his own family  it is the guest he likes to haunt who after listening to the hosts ghost story on christmas eve laughs at it and says that he does not believe there are such things as ghosts at all and that he will sleep in the haunted chamber that very night if they will let him  everybody urges him not to be reckless but he persists in his foolhardiness and goes up to the yellow chamber or whatever colour the haunted room may be with a light heart and a candle and wishes them all goodnight and shuts the door  next morning he has got snowwhite hair  he does not tell anybody what he has seen  it is too awful  there is also the plucky guest who sees a ghost and knows it is a ghost and watches it as it comes into the room and disappears through the wainscot after which as the ghost does not seem to be coming back and there is nothing consequently to be gained by stopping awake he goes to sleep  he does not mention having seen the ghost to anybody for fear of frightening themsome people are so nervous about ghostsbut determines to wait for the next night and see if the apparition appears again  it does appear again and this time he gets out of bed dresses himself and does his hair and follows it and then discovers a secret passage leading from the bedroom down into the beercellar a passage which no doubt was not unfrequently made use of in the bad old days of yore  after him comes the young man who woke up with a strange sensation in the middle of the night and found his rich bachelor uncle standing by his bedside  the rich uncle smiled a weird sort of smile and vanished  the young man immediately got up and looked at his watch  it had stopped at halfpast four he having forgotten to wind it  he made inquiries the next day and found that strangely enough his rich uncle whose only nephew he was had married a widow with eleven children at exactly a quarter to twelve only two days ago  the young man does not attempt to explain the circumstance  all he does is to vouch for the truth of his narrative  and to mention another case there is the gentleman who is returning home late at night from a freemasons dinner and who noticing a light issuing from a ruined abbey creeps up and looks through the keyhole  he sees the ghost of a grey sister kissing the ghost of a brown monk and is so inexpressibly shocked and frightened that he faints on the spot and is discovered there the next morning lying in a heap against the door still speechless and with his faithful latchkey clasped tightly in his hand  all these things happen on christmas eve they are all told of on christmas eve  for ghost stories to be told on any other evening than the evening of the twentyfourth of december would be impossible in english society as at present regulated  therefore in introducing the sad but authentic ghost stories that follow hereafter i feel that it is unnecessary to inform the student of anglosaxon literature that the date on which they were told and on which the incidents took place waschristmas eve  nevertheless i do so    now the stories came to be told    it was christmas eve  christmas eve at my uncle johns christmas eve there is too much christmas eve about this book  i can see that myself  it is beginning to get monotonous even to me  but i dont see how to avoid it now at no 47 laburnham grove tooting christmas eve in the dimlylighted there was a gasstrike on front parlour where the flickering firelight threw strange shadows on the highly coloured wallpaper while without in the wild street the storm raged pitilessly and the wind like some unquiet spirit flew moaning across the square and passed wailing with a troubled cry round by the milkshop  we had had supper and were sitting round talking and smoking  we had had a very good suppera very good supper indeed unpleasantness has occurred since in our family in connection with this party  rumours have been put about in our family concerning the matter generally but more particularly concerning my own share in it and remarks have been passed which have not so much surprised me because i know what our family are but which have pained me very much  as for my aunt maria i do not know when i shall care to see her again  i should have thought aunt maria might have known me better  but although injusticegross injustice as i shall explain later onhas been done to myself that shall not deter me from doing justice to others even to those who have made unfeeling insinuations  i will do justice to aunt marias hot veal pasties and toasted lobsters followed by her own special make of cheesecakes warm there is no sense to my thinking in cold cheesecakes you lose half the flavour and washed down by uncle johns own particular old ale and acknowledge that they were most tasty  i did justice to them then aunt maria herself could not but admit that  after supper uncle brewed some whiskypunch  i did justice to that also uncle john himself said so  he said he was glad to notice that i liked it  aunt went to bed soon after supper leaving the local curate old dr scrubbles mr samuel coombes our member of the county council teddy biffles and myself to keep uncle company  we agreed that it was too early to give in for some time yet so uncle brewed another bowl of punch and i think we all did justice to thatat least i know i did  it is a passion with me is the desire to do justice  we sat up for a long while and the doctor brewed some ginpunch later on for a change though i could not taste much difference myself  but it was all good and we were very happyeverybody was so kind  uncle john told us a very funny story in the course of the evening oh it was a funny story  i forget what it was about now but i know it amused me very much at the time i do not think i ever laughed so much in all my life  it is strange that i cannot recollect that story too because he told it us four times  and it was entirely our own fault that he did not tell it us a fifth after that the doctor sang a very clever song in the course of which he imitated all the different animals in a farmyard  he did mix them a bit  he brayed for the bantam cock and crowed for the pig but we knew what he meant all right  i started relating a most interesting anecdote but was somewhat surprised to observe as i went on that nobody was paying the slightest attention to me whatever  i thought this rather rude of them at first until it dawned upon me that i was talking to myself all the time instead of out aloud so that of course they did not know that i was telling them a tale at all and were probably puzzled to understand the meaning of my animated expression and eloquent gestures  it was a most curious mistake for any one to make  i never knew such a thing happen to me before  later on our curate did tricks with cards  he asked us if we had ever seen a game called the three card trick  he said it was an artifice by means of which low unscrupulous men frequenters of racemeetings and such like haunts swindled foolish young fellows out of their money  he said it was a very simple trick to do  it all depended on the quickness of the hand  it was the quickness of the hand deceived the eye  he said he would show us the imposture so that we might be warned against it and not be taken in by it and he fetched uncles pack of cards from the teacaddy and selecting three cards from the pack two plain cards and one picture card sat down on the hearthrug and explained to us what he was going to do  he said  now i shall take these three cards in my handsoand let you all see them  and then i shall quietly lay them down on the rug with the backs uppermost and ask you to pick out the picture card  and youll think you know which one it is  and he did it  old mr coombes who is also one of our churchwardens said it was the middle card  you fancy you saw it said our curate smiling  i dont fancy anything at all about it replied mr coombes i tell you its the middle card  ill bet you half a dollar its the middle card  there you are thats just what i was explaining to you said our curate turning to the rest of us thats the way these foolish young fellows that i was speaking of are lured on to lose their money  they make sure they know the card they fancy they saw it they dont grasp the idea that it is the quickness of the hand that has deceived their eye  he said he had known young men go off to a boat race or a cricket match with pounds in their pocket and come home early in the afternoon stone broke having lost all their money at this demoralising game  he said he should take mr coombess halfcrown because it would teach mr coombes a very useful lesson and probably be the means of saving mr coombess money in the future and he should give the twoandsixpence to the blanket fund  dont you worry about that retorted old mr coombes  dont you take the halfcrown out of the blanket fund  thats all  and he put his money on the middle card and turned it up  sure enough it really was the queen  we were all very much surprised especially the curate  he said that it did sometimes happen that way thoughthat a man did sometimes lay on the right card by accident  our curate said it was however the most unfortunate thing a man could do for himself if he only knew it because when a man tried and won it gave him a taste for the socalled sport and it lured him on into risking again and again until he had to retire from the contest a broken and ruined man  then he did the trick again  mr coombes said it was the card next the coalscuttle this time and wanted to put five shillings on it  we laughed at him and tried to persuade him against it  he would listen to no advice however but insisted on plunging  our curate said very well then  he had warned him and that was all that he could do  if he mr coombes was determined to make a fool of himself he mr coombes must do so  our curate said he should take the five shillings and that would put things right again with the blanket fund  so mr coombes put two halfcrowns on the card next the coal scuttle and turned it up  sure enough it was the queen again  after that uncle john had a florin on and he won  and then we all played at it and we all won  all except the curate that is  he had a very bad quarter of an hour  i never knew a man have such hard luck at cards  he lost every time  we had some more punch after that and uncle made such a funny mistake in brewing it  he left out the whisky  oh we did laugh at him and we made him put in double quantity afterwards as a forfeit  oh we did have such fun that evening  and then somehow or other we must have got on to ghosts because the next recollection i have is that we were telling ghost stories to each other    teddy biffles story    teddy biffles told the first story i will let him repeat it here in his own words  do not ask me how it is that i recollect his own exact words whether i took them down in shorthand at the time or whether he had the story written out and handed me the ms afterwards for publication in this book because i should not tell you if you did it is a trade secret  biffles called his story    johnson and emily or the faithful ghost teddy biffles story   i was little more than a lad when i first met with johnson  i was home for the christmas holidays and it being christmas eve i had been allowed to sit up very late  on opening the door of my little bedroom to go in i found myself face to face with johnson who was coming out  it passed through me and uttering a long low wail of misery disappeared out of the staircase window  i was startled for the momenti was only a schoolboy at the time and had never seen a ghost beforeand felt a little nervous about going to bed  but on reflection i remembered that it was only sinful people that spirits could do any harm to and so tucked myself up and went to sleep  in the morning i told the pater what i had seen  oh yes that was old johnson he answered  dont you be frightened of that he lives here  and then he told me the poor things history  it seemed that johnson when it was alive had loved in early life the daughter of a former lessee of our house a very beautiful girl whose christian name had been emily  father did not know her other name  johnson was too poor to marry the girl so he kissed her goodbye told her he would soon be back and went off to australia to make his fortune  but australia was not then what it became later on  travellers through the bush were few and far between in those early days and even when one was caught the portable property found upon the body was often of hardly sufficiently negotiable value to pay the simple funeral expenses rendered necessary  so that it took johnson nearly twenty years to make his fortune  the selfimposed task was accomplished at last however and then having successfully eluded the police and got clear out of the colony he returned to england full of hope and joy to claim his bride  he reached the house to find it silent and deserted  all that the neighbours could tell him was that soon after his own departure the family had on one foggy night unostentatiously disappeared and that nobody had ever seen or heard anything of them since although the landlord and most of the local tradesmen had made searching inquiries  poor johnson frenzied with grief sought his lost love all over the world  but he never found her and after years of fruitless effort he returned to end his lonely life in the very house where in the happy bygone days he and his beloved emily had passed so many blissful hours  he had lived there quite alone wandering about the empty rooms weeping and calling to his emily to come back to him and when the poor old fellow died his ghost still kept the business on  it was there the pater said when he took the house and the agent had knocked ten pounds a year off the rent in consequence  after that i was continually meeting johnson about the place at all times of the night and so indeed were we all  we used to walk round it and stand aside to let it pass at first but when we grew at home with it and there seemed no necessity for so much ceremony we used to walk straight through it  you could not say it was ever much in the way  it was a gentle harmless old ghost too and we all felt very sorry for it and pitied it  the women folk indeed made quite a pet of it for a while  its faithfulness touched them so  but as time went on it grew to be a bit a bore  you see it was full of sadness  there was nothing cheerful or genial about it you felt sorry for it but it irritated you  it would sit on the stairs and cry for hours at a stretch and whenever we woke up in the night one was sure to hear it pottering about the passages and in and out of the different rooms moaning and sighing so that we could not get to sleep again very easily  and when we had a party on it would come and sit outside the drawingroom door and sob all the time  it did not do anybody any harm exactly but it cast a gloom over the whole affair  oh im getting sick of this old fool said the pater one evening the dad can be very blunt when he is put out as you know after johnson had been more of a nuisance than usual and had spoiled a good game of whist by sitting up the chimney and groaning till nobody knew what were trumps or what suit had been led even  we shall have to get rid of him somehow or other  i wish i knew how to do it  well said the mater depend upon it youll never see the last of him until hes found emilys grave  thats what he is after you find emilys grave and put him on to that and hell stop there  thats the only thing to do  you mark my words  the idea seemed reasonable but the difficulty in the way was that we none of us knew where emilys grave was any more than the ghost of johnson himself did  the governor suggested palming off some other emilys grave upon the poor thing but as luck would have it there did not seem to have been an emily of any sort buried anywhere for miles round  i never came across a neighbourhood so utterly destitute of dead emilies  i thought for a bit and then i hazarded a suggestion myself  couldnt we fake up something for the old chap i queried  he seems a simpleminded old sort  he might take it in  anyhow we could but try  by jove so we will exclaimed my father and the very next morning we had the workmen in and fixed up a little mound at the bottom of the orchard with a tombstone over it bearing the following inscription   sacred to the memory of emily her last words were  tell johnson i love him   that ought to fetch him mused the dad as he surveyed the work when finished  i am sure i hope it does  it did  we lured him down there that very night andwell there it was one of the most pathetic things i have ever seen the way johnson sprang upon that tombstone and wept  dad and old squibbins the gardener cried like children when they saw it  johnson has never troubled us any more in the house since then  it spends every night now sobbing on the grave and seems quite happy  there still  oh yes  ill take you fellows down and show you it next time you come to our place  10 pm to 4 am are its general hours 10 to 2 on saturdays    interludethe doctors story    it made me cry very much that story young biffles told it with so much feeling  we were all a little thoughtful after it and i noticed even the old doctor covertly wipe away a tear  uncle john brewed another bowl of punch however and we gradually grew more resigned  the doctor indeed after a while became almost cheerful and told us about the ghost of one of his patients  i cannot give you his story  i wish i could  they all said afterwards that it was the best of the lotthe most ghastly and terriblebut i could not make any sense of it myself  it seemed so incomplete  he began all right and then something seemed to happen and then he was finishing it  i cannot make out what he did with the middle of the story  it ended up i know however with somebody finding something and that put mr coombes in mind of a very curious affair that took place at an old mill once kept by his brotherinlaw  mr coombes said he would tell us his story and before anybody could stop him he had begun  mr coombes said the story was called    the haunted mill or the ruined home mr coombess story   well you all know my brotherinlaw mr parkins began mr coombes taking the long clay pipe from his mouth and putting it behind his ear  we did not know his brotherinlaw but we said we did so as to save time and you know of course that he once took a lease of an old mill in surrey and went to live there  now you must know that years ago this very mill had been occupied by a wicked old miser who died there leavingso it was rumoured all his money hidden somewhere about the place  naturally enough every one who had since come to live at the mill had tried to find the treasure but none had ever succeeded and the local wiseacres said that nobody ever would unless the ghost of the miserly miller should one day take a fancy to one of the tenants and disclose to him the secret of the hidingplace  my brotherinlaw did not attach much importance to the story regarding it as an old womans tale and unlike his predecessors made no attempt whatever to discover the hidden gold  unless business was very different then from what it is now said my brotherinlaw i dont see how a miller could very well have saved anything however much of a miser he might have been  at all events not enough to make it worth the trouble of looking for it  still he could not altogether get rid of the idea of that treasure  one night he went to bed  there was nothing very extraordinary about that i admit  he often did go to bed of a night  what was remarkable however was that exactly as the clock of the village church chimed the last stroke of twelve my brotherinlaw woke up with a start and felt himself quite unable to go to sleep again  joe his christian name was joe sat up in bed and looked around  at the foot of the bed something stood very still wrapped in shadow  it moved into the moonlight and then my brotherinlaw saw that it was the figure of a wizened little old man in kneebreeches and a pigtail  in an instant the story of the hidden treasure and the old miser flashed across his mind  hes come to show me where its hid thought my brotherinlaw and he resolved that he would not spend all this money on himself but would devote a small percentage of it towards doing good to others  the apparition moved towards the door  my brotherinlaw put on his trousers and followed it  the ghost went downstairs into the kitchen glided over and stood in front of the hearth sighed and disappeared  next morning joe had a couple of bricklayers in and made them haul out the stove and pull down the chimney while he stood behind with a potatosack in which to put the gold  they knocked down half the wall and never found so much as a four penny bit  my brotherinlaw did not know what to think  the next night the old man appeared again and again led the way into the kitchen  this time however instead of going to the fireplace it stood more in the middle of the room and sighed there  oh i see what he means now said my brotherinlaw to himself its under the floor  why did the old idiot go and stand up against the stove so as to make me think it was up the chimney  they spent the next day in taking up the kitchen floor but the only thing they found was a threepronged fork and the handle of that was broken  on the third night the ghost reappeared quite unabashed and for a third time made for the kitchen  arrived there it looked up at the ceiling and vanished  umph he dont seem to have learned much sense where hes been to muttered joe as he trotted back to bed i should have thought he might have done that at first  still there seemed no doubt now where the treasure lay and the first thing after breakfast they started pulling down the ceiling they got every inch of the ceiling down and they took up the boards of the room above  they discovered about as much treasure as you would expect to find in an empty quartpot  on the fourth night when the ghost appeared as usual my brother inlaw was so wild that he threw his boots at it and the boots passed through the body and broke a lookingglass  on the fifth night when joe awoke as he always did now at twelve the ghost was standing in a dejected attitude looking very miserable  there was an appealing look in its large sad eyes that quite touched my brotherinlaw  after all he thought perhaps the silly chaps doing his best maybe he has forgotten where he really did put it and is trying to remember  ill give him another chance  the ghost appeared grateful and delighted at seeing joe prepare to follow him and led the way into the attic pointed to the ceiling and vanished  well hes hit it this time i do hope said my brotherinlaw and next day they set to work to take the roof off the place  it took them three days to get the roof thoroughly off and all they found was a birds nest after securing which they covered up the house with tarpaulins to keep it dry  you might have thought that would have cured the poor fellow of looking for treasure  but it didnt  he said there must be something in it all or the ghost would never keep on coming as it did and that having gone so far he would go on to the end and solve the mystery cost what it might  night after night he would get out of his bed and follow that spectral old fraud about the house  each night the old man would indicate a different place and on each following day my brother inlaw would proceed to break up the mill at the point indicated and look for the treasure  at the end of three weeks there was not a room in the mill fit to live in  every wall had been pulled down every floor had been taken up every ceiling had had a hole knocked in it  and then as suddenly as they had begun the ghosts visits ceased and my brotherinlaw was left in peace to rebuild the place at his leisure  what induced the old image to play such a silly trick upon a family man and a ratepayer  ah thats just what i cannot tell you  some said that the ghost of the wicked old man had done it to punish my brotherinlaw for not believing in him at first while others held that the apparition was probably that of some deceased local plumber and glazier who would naturally take an interest in seeing a house knocked about and spoilt  but nobody knew anything for certain    interlude    we had some more punch and then the curate told us a story  i could not make head or tail of the curates story so i cannot retail it to you  we none of us could make head or tail of that story  it was a good story enough so far as material went  there seemed to be an enormous amount of plot and enough incident to have made a dozen novels  i never before heard a story containing so much incident nor one dealing with so many varied characters  i should say that every human being our curate had ever known or met or heard of was brought into that story  there were simply hundreds of them  every five seconds he would introduce into the tale a completely fresh collection of characters accompanied by a brand new set of incidents  this was the sort of story it was  well then my uncle went into the garden and got his gun but of course it wasnt there and scroggins said he didnt believe it  didnt believe what  whos scroggins  scroggins  oh why he was the other man you knowit was wife  what was his wifewhats she got to do with it  why thats what im telling you  it was she that found the hat shed come up with her cousin to londonher cousin was my sister inlaw and the other niece had married a man named evans and evans after it was all over had taken the box round to mr jacobs because jacobs father had seen the man when he was alive and when he was dead joseph  now look here never you mind evans and the box whats become of your uncle and the gun  the gun  what gun  why the gun that your uncle used to keep in the garden and that wasnt there  what did he do with it  did he kill any of these people with itthese jacobses and evanses and scrogginses and josephses  because if so it was a good and useful work and we should enjoy hearing about it  nooh nohow could hehe had been built up alive in the wall you know and when edward iv spoke to the abbot about it my sister said that in her then state of health she could not and would not as it was endangering the childs life  so they christened it horatio after her own son who had been killed at waterloo before he was born and lord napier himself said  look here do you know what you are talking about we asked him at this point  he said no but he knew it was every word of it true because his aunt had seen it herself  whereupon we covered him over with the tablecloth and he went to sleep  and then uncle told us a story  uncle said his was a real story    the ghost of the blue chamber my uncles story    i dont want to make you fellows nervous began my uncle in a peculiarly impressive not to say bloodcurdling tone of voice and if you would rather that i did not mention it i wont but as a matter of fact this very house in which we are now sitting is haunted  you dont say that exclaimed mr coombes  whats the use of your saying i dont say it when i have just said it retorted my uncle somewhat pettishly  you do talk so foolishly  i tell you the house is haunted  regularly on christmas eve the blue chamber they called the room next to the nursery the blue chamber at my uncles most of the toilet service being of that shade is haunted by the ghost of a sinful mana man who once killed a christmas wait with a lump of coal  how did he do it asked mr coombes with eager anxiousness was it difficult  i do not know how he did it replied my uncle he did not explain the process  the wait had taken up a position just inside the front gate and was singing a ballad  it is presumed that when he opened his mouth for b flat the lump of coal was thrown by the sinful man from one of the windows and that it went down the waits throat and choked him  you want to be a good shot but it is certainly worth trying murmured mr coombes thoughtfully  but that was not his only crime alas added my uncle  prior to that he had killed a solo cornetplayer  no  is that really a fact exclaimed mr coombes  of course its a fact answered my uncle testily at all events as much a fact as you can expect to get in a case of this sort  how very captious you are this evening  the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming  the poor fellow the cornetplayer had been in the neighbourhood barely a month  old mr bishop who kept the jolly sand boys at the time and from whom i had the story said he had never known a more hardworking and energetic solo cornetplayer  he the cornetplayer only knew two tunes but mr bishop said that the man could not have played with more vigour or for more hours in a day if he had known forty  the two tunes he did play were annie laurie and home sweet home and as regarded his performance of the former melody mr bishop said that a mere child could have told what it was meant for  this musicianthis poor friendless artist used to come regularly and play in this street just opposite for two hours every evening one evening he was seen evidently in response to an invitation going into this very house but was never seen coming out of it  did the townsfolk try offering any reward for his recovery asked mr coombes  not a hapenny replied my uncle  another summer continued my uncle a german band visited here intendingso they announced on their arrivalto stay till the autumn  on the second day from their arrival the whole company as fine and healthy a body of men as one could wish to see were invited to dinner by this sinful man and after spending the whole of the next twentyfour hours in bed left the town a broken and dyspeptic crew the parish doctor who had attended them giving it as his opinion that it was doubtful if they would any of them be fit to play an air again  youyou dont know the recipe do you asked mr coombes  unfortunately i do not replied my uncle but the chief ingredient was said to have been railway refreshmentroom porkpie  i forget the mans other crimes my uncle went on i used to know them all at one time but my memory is not what it was  i do not however believe i am doing his memory an injustice in believing that he was not entirely unconnected with the death and subsequent burial of a gentleman who used to play the harp with his toes and that neither was he altogether unresponsible for the lonely grave of an unknown stranger who had once visited the neighbourhood an italian peasant lad a performer upon the barrel organ  every christmas eve said my uncle cleaving with low impressive tones the strange awed silence that like a shadow seemed to have slowly stolen into and settled down upon the room the ghost of this sinful man haunts the blue chamber in this very house there from midnight until cockcrow amid wild muffled shrieks and groans and mocking laughter and the ghostly sound of horrid blows it does fierce phantom fight with the spirits of the solo cornet player and the murdered wait assisted at intervals by the shades of the german band while the ghost of the strangled harpist plays mad ghostly melodies with ghostly toes on the ghost of a broken harp  uncle said the blue chamber was comparatively useless as a sleepingapartment on christmas eve  hark said uncle raising a warning hand towards the ceiling while we held our breath and listened hark  i believe they are at it nowin the blue chamber    the blue chamber    i rose up and said that i would sleep in the blue chamber  before i tell you my own story howeverthe story of what happened in the blue chamberi would wish to preface it with     a personal explanation    i feel a good deal of hesitation about telling you this story of my own  you see it is not a story like the other stories that i have been telling you or rather that teddy biffles mr coombes and my uncle have been telling you  it is a true story  it is not a story told by a person sitting round a fire on christmas eve drinking whisky punch  it is a record of events that actually happened  indeed it is not a story at all in the commonly accepted meaning of the word  it is a report  it is i feel almost out of place in a book of this kind  it is more suitable to a biography or an english history  there is another thing that makes it difficult for me to tell you this story and that is that it is all about myself  in telling you this story i shall have to keep on talking about myself and talking about ourselves is what we modernday authors have a strong objection to doing  if we literary men of the new school have one praiseworthy yearning more ever present to our minds than another it is the yearning never to appear in the slightest degree egotistical  i myself so i am told carry this coynessthis shrinking reticence concerning anything connected with my own personality almost too far and people grumble at me because of it  people come to me and say   well now why dont you talk about yourself a bit  thats what we want to read about  tell us something about yourself  but i have always replied no  it is not that i do not think the subject an interesting one  i cannot myself conceive of any topic more likely to prove fascinating to the world as a whole or at all events to the cultured portion of it  but i will not do it on principle  it is inartistic and it sets a bad example to the younger men  other writers a few of them do it i know but i will notnot as a rule  under ordinary circumstances therefore i should not tell you this story at all  i should say to myself no  it is a good story it is a moral story it is a strange weird enthralling sort of a story and the public i know would like to hear it and i should like to tell it to them but it is all about myselfabout what i said and what i saw and what i did and i cannot do it  my retiring antiegotistical nature will not permit me to talk in this way about myself  but the circumstances surrounding this story are not ordinary and there are reasons prompting me in spite of my modesty to rather welcome the opportunity of relating it  as i stated at the beginning there has been unpleasantness in our family over this party of ours and as regards myself in particular and my share in the events i am now about to set forth gross injustice has been done me  as a means of replacing my character in its proper lightof dispelling the clouds of calumny and misconception with which it has been darkened i feel that my best course is to give a simple dignified narration of the plain facts and allow the unprejudiced to judge for themselves  my chief object i candidly confess is to clear myself from unjust aspersion  spurred by this motiveand i think it is an honourable and a right motivei find i am enabled to overcome my usual repugnance to talking about myself and can thus tell     my own story    as soon as my uncle had finished his story i as i have already told you rose up and said that i would sleep in the blue chamber that very night  never cried my uncle springing up  you shall not put yourself in this deadly peril  besides the bed is not made  never mind the bed i replied  i have lived in furnished apartments for gentlemen and have been accustomed to sleep on beds that have never been made from one years end to the other  do not thwart me in my resolve  i am young and have had a clear conscience now for over a month  the spirits will not harm me  i may even do them some little good and induce them to be quiet and go away  besides i should like to see the show  saying which i sat down again  how mr coombes came to be in my chair instead of at the other side of the room where he had been all the evening and why he never offered to apologise when i sat right down on top of him and why young biffles should have tried to palm himself off upon me as my uncle john and induced me under that erroneous impression to shake him by the hand for nearly three minutes and tell him that i had always regarded him as fatherare matters that to this day i have never been able to fully understand  they tried to dissuade me from what they termed my foolhardy enterprise but i remained firm and claimed my privilege  i was the guest  the guest always sleeps in the haunted chamber on christmas eve it is his perquisite  they said that if i put it on that footing they had of course no answer and they lighted a candle for me and accompanied me upstairs in a body  whether elevated by the feeling that i was doing a noble action or animated by a mere general consciousness of rectitude is not for me to say but i went upstairs that night with remarkable buoyancy it was as much as i could do to stop at the landing when i came to it i felt i wanted to go on up to the roof  but with the help of the banisters i restrained my ambition wished them all good night and went in and shut the door  things began to go wrong with me from the very first  the candle tumbled out of the candlestick before my hand was off the lock  it kept on tumbling out of the candlestick and every time i picked put it up and put it in it tumbled out again  i never saw such a slippery candle  i gave up attempting to use the candlestick at last and carried the candle about in my hand and even then it would not keep upright  so i got wild and threw it out of window and undressed and went to bed in the dark  i did not go to sleepi did not feel sleepy at alli lay on my back looking up at the ceiling and thinking of things  i wish i could remember some of the ideas that came to me as i lay there because they were so amusing  i laughed at them myself till the bed shook  i had been lying like this for half an hour or so and had forgotten all about the ghost when on casually casting my eyes round the room i noticed for the first time a singularly contentedlooking phantom sitting in the easychair by the fire smoking the ghost of a long clay pipe  i fancied for the moment as most people would under similar circumstances that i must be dreaming  i sat up and rubbed my eyes  no  it was a ghost clear enough  i could see the back of the chair through his body  he looked over towards me took the shadowy pipe from his lips and nodded  the most surprising part of the whole thing to me was that i did not feel in the least alarmed  if anything i was rather pleased to see him  it was company  i said good evening  its been a cold day  he said he had not noticed it himself but dared say i was right  we remained silent for a few seconds and then wishing to put it pleasantly i said i believe i have the honour of addressing the ghost of the gentleman who had the accident with the wait  he smiled and said it was very good of me to remember it  one wait was not much to boast of but still every little helped  i was somewhat staggered at his answer  i had expected a groan of remorse  the ghost appeared on the contrary to be rather conceited over the business  i thought that as he had taken my reference to the wait so quietly perhaps he would not be offended if i questioned him about the organgrinder  i felt curious about that poor boy  is it true i asked that you had a hand in the death of that italian peasant lad who came to the town once with a barrelorgan that played nothing but scotch airs  he quite fired up  had a hand in it he exclaimed indignantly who has dared to pretend that he assisted me  i murdered the youth myself  nobody helped me  alone i did it  show me the man who says i didnt  i calmed him  i assured him that i had never in my own mind doubted that he was the real and only assassin and i went on and asked him what he had done with the body of the cornetplayer he had killed  he said to which one may you be alluding  oh were there any more then i inquired  he smiled and gave a little cough  he said he did not like to appear to be boasting but that counting trombones there were seven  dear me i replied you must have had quite a busy time of it one way and another  he said that perhaps he ought not to be the one to say so but that really speaking of ordinary middlesociety he thought there were few ghosts who could look back upon a life of more sustained usefulness  he puffed away in silence for a few seconds while i sat watching him  i had never seen a ghost smoking a pipe before that i could remember and it interested me  i asked him what tobacco he used and he replied the ghost of cut cavendish as a rule  he explained that the ghost of all the tobacco that a man smoked in life belonged to him when he became dead  he said he himself had smoked a good deal of cut cavendish when he was alive so that he was well supplied with the ghost of it now  i observed that it was a useful thing to know that and i made up my mind to smoke as much tobacco as ever i could before i died  i thought i might as well start at once so i said i would join him in a pipe and he said do old man and i reached over and got out the necessary paraphernalia from my coat pocket and lit up  we grew quite chummy after that and he told me all his crimes  he said he had lived next door once to a young lady who was learning to play the guitar while a gentleman who practised on the bass viol lived opposite  and he with fiendish cunning had introduced these two unsuspecting young people to one another and had persuaded them to elope with each other against their parents wishes and take their musical instruments with them and they had done so and before the honeymoon was over she had broken his head with the bassviol and he had tried to cram the guitar down her throat and had injured her for life  my friend said he used to lure muffinmen into the passage and then stuff them with their own wares till they burst and died  he said he had quieted eighteen that way  young men and women who recited long and dreary poems at evening parties and callow youths who walked about the streets late at night playing concertinas he used to get together and poison in batches of ten so as to save expense and park orators and temperance lecturers he used to shut up six in a small room with a glass of water and a collectionbox apiece and let them talk each other to death  it did one good to listen to him  i asked him when he expected the other ghoststhe ghosts of the wait and the cornetplayer and the german band that uncle john had mentioned  he smiled and said they would never come again any of them  i said why isnt it true then that they meet you here every christmas eve for a row  he replied that it was true  every christmas eve for twentyfive years had he and they fought in that room but they would never trouble him nor anybody else again  one by one had he laid them out spoilt and utterly useless for all haunting purposes  he had finished off the last germanband ghost that very evening just before i came upstairs and had thrown what was left of it out through the slit between the windowsashes  he said it would never be worth calling a ghost again  i suppose you will still come yourself as usual i said  they would be sorry to miss you i know  oh i dont know he replied theres nothing much to come for now  unless he added kindly you are going to be here  ill come if you will sleep here next christmas eve  i have taken a liking to you he continued you dont fly off screeching when you see a party and your hair doesnt stand on end  youve no idea he said how sick i am of seeing peoples hair standing on end  he said it irritated him  just then a slight noise reached us from the yard below and he started and turned deathly black  you are ill i cried springing towards him tell me the best thing to do for you  shall i drink some brandy and give you the ghost of it  he remained silent listening intently for a moment and then he gave a sigh of relief and the shade came back to his cheek  its all right he murmured i was afraid it was the cock  oh its too early for that i said  why its only the middle of the night  oh that doesnt make any difference to those cursed chickens he replied bitterly  they would just as soon crow in the middle of the night as at any other timesooner if they thought it would spoil a chaps evening out  i believe they do it on purpose  he said a friend of his the ghost of a man who had killed a water rate collector used to haunt a house in long acre where they kept fowls in the cellar and every time a policeman went by and flashed his bullseye down the grating the old cock there would fancy it was the sun and start crowing like mad when of course the poor ghost had to dissolve and it would in consequence get back home sometimes as early as one oclock in the morning swearing fearfully because it had only been out for an hour  i agreed that it seemed very unfair  oh its an absurd arrangement altogether he continued quite angrily  i cant imagine what our old man could have been thinking of when he made it  as i have said to him over and over again have a fixed time and let everybody stick to itsay four oclock in summer and six in winter  then one would know what one was about  how do you manage when there isnt any cock handy i inquired  he was on the point of replying when again he started and listened  this time i distinctly heard mr bowless cock next door crow twice  there you are he said rising and reaching for his hat thats the sort of thing we have to put up with  what is the time  i looked at my watch and found it was halfpast three  i thought as much he muttered  ill wring that blessed birds neck if i get hold of it  and he prepared to go  if you can wait half a minute i said getting out of bed ill go a bit of the way with you  its very good of you he rejoined pausing but it seems unkind to drag you out  not at all i replied i shall like a walk  and i partially dressed myself and took my umbrella and he put his arm through mine and we went out together  just by the gate we met jones one of the local constables  goodnight jones i said i always feel affable at christmas time  goodnight sir answered the man a little gruffly i thought may i ask what youre adoing of  oh its all right i responded with a wave of my umbrella im just seeing my friend part of the way home  he said what friend  oh ah of course i laughed i forgot  hes invisible to you he is the ghost of the gentleman that killed the wait  im just going to the corner with him  ah i dont think i would if i was you sir said jones severely  if you take my advice youll say goodbye to your friend here and go back indoors  perhaps you are not aware that you are walking about with nothing on but a nightshirt and a pair of boots and an operahat  wheres your trousers  i did not like the mans manner at all  i said jones  i dont wish to have to report you but it seems to me youve been drinking  my trousers are where a mans trousers ought to beon his legs  i distinctly remember putting them on  well you havent got them on now he retorted  i beg your pardon i replied  i tell you i have i think i ought to know  i think so too he answered but you evidently dont  now you come along indoors with me and dont lets have any more of it  uncle john came to the door at this point having been awaked i suppose by the altercation and at the same moment aunt maria appeared at the window in her nightcap  i explained the constables mistake to them treating the matter as lightly as i could so as not to get the man into trouble and i turned for confirmation to the ghost  he was gone  he had left me without a wordwithout even saying goodbye  it struck me as so unkind his having gone off in that way that i burst into tears and uncle john came out and led me back into the house  on reaching my room i discovered that jones was right  i had not put on my trousers after all  they were still hanging over the bedrail  i suppose in my anxiety not to keep the ghost waiting i must have forgotten them  such are the plain facts of the case out of which it must doubtless to the healthy charitable mind appear impossible that calumny could spring  but it has  personsi say personshave professed themselves unable to understand the simple circumstances herein narrated except in the light of explanations at once misleading and insulting  slurs have been cast and aspersions made on me by those of my own flesh and blood  but i bear no illfeeling  i merely as i have said set forth this statement for the purpose of clearing my character from injurious suspicion
