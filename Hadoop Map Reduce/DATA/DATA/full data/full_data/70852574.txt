70852574	captains courageous  a story of the grand banks  by rudyard kipling     chapter i  the weather door of the smokingroom had been left open to the north atlantic fog as the big liner rolled and lifted whistling to warn the fishingfleet  that cheyne boys the biggest nuisance aboard said a man in a frieze overcoat shutting the door with a bang he isnt wanted here hes too fresh  a whitehaired german reached for a sandwich and grunted between bites i know der breed ameriga is full of dot kind i dell you you should imbort ropes ends free under your dariff  pshaw there isnt any real harm to him hes more to be pitied than anything a man from new york drawled as he lay at full length along the cushions under the wet skylight theyve dragged him around from hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid i was talking to his mother this morning shes a lovely lady but she dont pretend to manage him hes going to europe to finish his education  education isnt begun yet this was a philadelphian curled up in a corner that boy gets two hundred a month pocketmoney he told me he isnt sixteen either  railroads his father aindt it said the german  yep that and mines and lumber and shipping built one place at san diego the old man has another at los angeles owns half a dozen railroads half the lumber on the pacific slope and lets his wife spend the money the philadelphian went on lazily the west dont suit her she says she just tracks around with the boy and her nerves trying to find out whatll amuse him i guess florida adirondacks lakewood hot springs new york and round again he isnt much more than a secondhand hotel clerk now when hes finished in europe hell be a holy terror  whats the matter with the old man attending to him personally said a voice from the frieze ulster  old mans piling up the rocks dont want to be disturbed i guess hell find out his error a few years from now pity because theres a heap of good in the boy if you could get at it  mit a ropes end mit a ropes end growled the german  once more the door banged and a slight slimbuilt boy perhaps fifteen years old a halfsmoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his mouth leaned in over the high footway his pasty yellow complexion did not show well on a person of his years and his look was a mixture of irresolution bravado and very cheap smartness he was dressed in a cherrycoloured blazer knickerbockers red stockings and bicycle shoes with a red flannel cap at the back of the head after whistling between his teeth as he eyed the company he said in a loud high voice say its thick outside you can hear the fishboats squawking all around us say wouldnt it be great if we ran down one  shut the door harvey said the new yorker shut the door and stay outside youre not wanted here  wholl stop me he answered deliberately did you pay for my passage mister martin guess ive as good right here as the next man  he picked up some dice from a checkerboard and began throwing right hand against left  say genelmen this is deadern mud cant we make a game of poker between us  there was no answer and he puffed his cigarette swung his legs and drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers then he pulled out a roll of bills as if to count them  hows your mamma this afternoon a man said i didnt see her at lunch  in her stateroom i guess shes most always sick on the ocean im going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her i dont go down more n i can avoid it makes me feel mysterious to pass that butlerspantry place say this is the first time ive been on the ocean  oh dont apologise harvey  whos apologising this is the first time ive crossed the ocean genelmen and except the first day i havent been sick one little bit no sir he brought down his fist with a triumphant bang wetted his finger and went on counting the bills  oh youre a highgrade machine with the writing in plain sight the philadelphian yawned youll blossom into a credit to your country if you dont take care  i know it im an americanfirst last and all the time ill show em that when i strike europe pif my cigs out i cant smoke the truck the steward sells any genelman got a real turkish cig on him  the chief engineer entered for a moment red smiling and wet say mac cried harvey cheerfully how are we hitting it  vara much in the ordinary way was the grave reply the young are as polite as ever to their elders an their elders are een tryin to appreciate it  a low chuckle came from a corner the german opened his cigarcase and handed a skinny black cigar to harvey  dot is der broper apparatus to smoke my young friendt he said you vill dry it yes den you vill be efer so happy  harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish he felt that he was getting on in grownup society  it would take more n this to keel me over he said ignorant that he was lighting that terrible article a wheeling stogie  dot we shall bresently see said the german where are we now mr mactonal   just there or thereabouts mr schaefer said the engineer well be on the grand bank tonight but in a general way o speakin were all among the fishingfleet now weve shaved three dories an near skelped the boom off a frenchman since noon an thats close sailin ye may say  you like my cigar eh the german asked for harveys eyes were full of tears  fine full flavour he answered through shut teeth guess weve slowed down a little havent we ill skip out and see what the log says  i might if i vhas you said the german  harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail he was very unhappy but he saw the decksteward lashing chairs together and since he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick his pride made him go aft to the secondsaloon deck at the stern which was finished in a turtleback the deck was deserted and he crawled to the extreme end of it near the flagpole there he doubled up in limp agony for the wheeling stogie joined with the surge and jar of the screw to sieve out his soul his head swelled sparks of fire danced before his eyes his body seemed to lose weight while his heels wavered in the breeze he was fainting from seasickness and a roll of the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the turtleback then a low grey motherwave swung out of the fog tucked harvey under one arm so to speak and pulled him off and away to leeward the great green closed over him and he went quietly to sleep  he was roused by the sound of a dinnerhorn such as they used to blow at a summerschool he had once attended in the adirondacks slowly he remembered that he was harvey cheyne drowned and dead in midocean but was too weak to fit things together a new smell filled his nostrils wet and clammy chills ran down his back and he was helplessly full of salt water when he opened his eyes he perceived that he was still on the top of the sea for it was running round him in silvercoloured hills and he was lying on a pile of halfdead fish looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey  its no good thought the boy im dead sure enough and this thing is in charge  he groaned and the figure turned its head showing a pair of little gold rings half hidden in curly black hair  aha you feel some pretty well now it said lie still so we trim better  with a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boathead on to a foamless sea that lifted her twenty full feet only to slide her into a glassy pit beyond but this mountainclimbing did not interrupt bluejerseys talk fine good job i say that i catch you eh whaat better good job i say your boat not catch me how you come to fall out  i was sick said harvey sick and couldnt help it  just in time i blow my horn and your boat she yaw a little then i see you come all down eh whaat i think you are cut into baits by the screw but you dreeftdreeft to me and i make a big fish of you so you shall not die this time  where am i said harvey who could not see that life was particularly safe where he lay  you are with me in the dorymanuel my name and i come from schooner were here of gloucester i live to gloucester byandby we get supper eh whaat  he seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of castiron for not content with blowing through a big conchshell he must needs stand up to it swaying with the sway of the flatbottomed dory and send a grinding thuttering shriek through the fog how long this entertainment lasted harvey could not remember for he lay back terrified at the sight of the smoking swells he fancied he heard a gun and a horn and shouting something bigger than the dory but quite as lively loomed alongside several voices talked at once he was dropped into a dark heaving hole where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink and took off his clothes and he fell asleep  when he waked he listened for the first breakfastbell on the steamer wondering why his stateroom had grown so small turning he looked into a narrow triangular cave lit by a lamp hung against a huge square beam a threecornered table within arms reach ran from the angle of the bows to the foremast at the after end behind a wellused plymouth stove sat a boy about his own age with a flat red face and a pair of twinkling grey eyes he was dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber boots several pairs of the same sort of footwear an old cap and some wornout woolen socks lay on the floor and black and yellow oilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks the place was packed as full of smells as a bale is of cotton the oilskins had a peculiarly thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the smells of fried fish burnt grease paint pepper and stale tobacco but these again were all hooped together by one encircling smell of ship and salt water harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets on his bedplace he was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of lumps and nubbles then too the boats motion was not that of a steamer she was neither sliding nor rolling but rather wriggling herself about in a silly aimless way like a colt at the end of a halter waternoises ran by close to his ear and beams creaked and whined about him all these things made him grunt despairingly and think of his mother  feelin better said the boy with a grin hev some coffee he brought a tin cup full and sweetened it with molasses  is nt there milk said harvey looking round the dark double tier of bunks as if he expected to find a cow there  well no said the boy ner there aint likely to be till baout midseptember taint bad coffee i made it  harvey drank in silence and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces of crisp fried pork which he ate ravenously  ive dried your clothes guess theyve shrunk some said the boy they aint our style muchnone of em twist round an see ef youre hurt any  harvey stretched himself in every direction but could not report any injuries  thats good the boy said heartily fix yerself an go on deck dad wants to see you im his sondan they call mean im cooks helper an everything else aboard thats too dirty for the men there aint no boy here cep me sence otto went overboardan he was only a dutchy an twenty year old at that howd you come to fall off in a dead flat caam  twasnt a calm said harvey sulkily it was a gale and i was seasick guess i must have rolled over the rail  there was a little common swell yesday an last night said the boy but ef thets your notion of a gale he whistled youll know more fore youre through hurry dads waitin  like many other unfortunate young people harvey had never in all his life received a direct ordernever at least without long and sometimes tearful explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the request mrs cheyne lived in fear of breaking his spirit which perhaps was the reason that she herself walked on the edge of nervous prostration he could not see why he should be expected to hurry for any mans pleasure and said so your dad can come down here if hes so anxious to talk to me i want him to take me to new york right away itll pay him  dan opened his eyes as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him say dad he shouted up the focsle hatch he says you kin slip down an see him ef youre anxious that way hear dad  the answer came back in the deepest voice harvey had ever heard from a human chest quit foolin dan and send him to me  dan sniggered and threw harvey his warped bicycle shoes there was something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually unfolding the tale of his own and his fathers wealth on the voyage home this rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for life he hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder and stumbled aft over a score of obstructions to where a small thickset cleanshaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step that led up to the quarterdeck the swell had passed in the night leaving a long oily sea dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen fishingboats between them lay little black specks showing where the dories were out fishing the schooner with a triangular ridingsail on the mainmast played easily at anchor and except for the man by the cabinroofhouse they call itshe was deserted  morningood afternoon i should say youve nigh slep the clock around young feller was the greeting  mornin said harvey he did not like being called young feller and as one rescued from drowning expected sympathy his mother suffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet but this mariner did not seem excited  naow lets hear all abaout it its quite providential first an last fer all concerned what might be your name where from we mistrust its noo york an where baound we mistrust its europe  harvey gave his name the name of the steamer and a short history of the accident winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to new york where his father would pay anything any one chose to name  hm said the shaven man quite unmoved by the end of harveys speech i cant say we think special of any man or boy even that falls overboard from that kind o packet in a flat caam least of all when his excuse is thet hes seasick  excuse cried harvey dyou suppose id fall overboard into your dirty little boat for fun  not knowin what your notions o fun may be i cant rightly say young feller but if i was you i wouldnt call the boat which under providence was the means o savin ye names in the first place its blame irreligious in the second its annoyin to my feelinsan im disko troop o the were here o gloucester which you dont seem rightly to know  i dont know and i dont care said harvey im grateful enough for being saved and all that of course but i want you to understand that the sooner you take me back to new york the better itll pay you  meaninhaow troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously mild blue eye  dollars and cents said harvey delighted to think that he was making an impression cold dollars and cents he thrust a hand into a pocket and threw out his stomach a little which was his way of being grand youve done the best days work you ever did in your life when you pulled me in im all the son harvey cheyne has  hes bin favoured said disko drily  and if you dont know who harvey cheyne is you dont know muchthats all now turn her around and lets hurry  harvey had a notion that the greater part of america was filled with people discussing and envying his fathers dollars  mebbe i do an mebbe i dont take a reef in your stummick young feller its full o my vittles  harvey heard a chuckle from dan who was pretending to be busy by the stumpforemast and the blood rushed to his face well pay for that too he said when do you suppose we shall get to new york  i dont use noo york any ner boston we may see eastern point about september an your paim real sorry i haint heerd tell of himmay give me ten dollars efter all your talk then o course he maynt  ten dollars why see here i harvey dived into his pocket for the wad of bills all he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes  not lawful currency an bad for the lungs heave em overboard young feller and try agin  its been stolen cried harvey hotly  youll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me then  a hundred and thirtyfour dollarsall stolen said harvey hunting wildly through his pockets give them back  a curious change flitted across old troops hard face what might you have been doin at your time o life with one hundred an thirtyfour dollars young feller  it was part of my pocketmoneyfor a month this harvey thought would be a knockdown blow and it wasindirectly  oh one hundred and thirtyfour dollars is only part of his pocketmoneyfor one month only you dont remember hittin anything when you fell over do you crack agin a stanchion les say old man hasken o the east windtroop seemed to be talking to himselfhe tripped on a hatch an butted the mainmast with his headhardish baout three weeks afterwards old man hasken he

darkening  how you know how well enough on top of all that you want me to do menial workharvey was very proud of that adjectivetill the fall i tell you i will not you hear  troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while as harvey harangued fiercely all around him  hsh he said at last im figurin out my responsibilities in my own mind its a matter o jedgment  dan stole up and plucked harvey by the elbow dont go to tamperin with dad any more he pleaded youve called him a thief two or three times over an he dont take that from any livin bein  i wont harvey almost shrieked disregarding the advice and still troop meditated  seems kinder unneighbourly he said at last his eye travelling down to harvey i dont blame you not a mite young feller nor you wont blame me when the biles out o your systim be sure you sense what i say ten an a haaf fer second boy on the schooneran all fundfer to teach you an fer the sake o your health yes or no  no said harvey take me back to new york or ill see you  he did not exactly remember what followed he was lying in the scuppers holding on to a nose that bled while troop looked down on him serenely  dan he said to his son i was sot agin this young feller when i first saw him on account o hasty jedgments never you be led astray by hasty jedgments dan naow im sorry for him because hes clear distracted in his upper works he aint responsible fer the names hes give me nor fer his other statements nor fer jumpin overboard which im abaout haaf convinced he did you be gentle with him dan r ill give you twice what ive give him them hemmeridges clears the head let him sluice it off  troop went down solemnly into the cabin where he and the older men bunked leaving dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions    chapter ii  i warned ye said dan as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark oiled planking dad aint noways hasty but you fair earned it pshaw theres no sense takin on so harveys shoulders were rising and falling in spasms of dry sobbing i know the feelin first time dad laid me out was the lastand that was my first trip makes ye feel sickish an lonesome i know  it does moaned harvey that mans either crazy or drunk andand i cant do anything  dont say that to dad whispered dan hes set agin all liquor anwell he told me you was the madman what in creation made you call him a thief hes my dad  harvey

once a week and never miss it  you dont know what the were heres worth your dad must hey a pile o money how did he git it dad sez loonies cant shake out a straight yarn go ahead  in goldmines and things west  ive read o that kind o business out west too does he go around with a pistol on a trickpony same ez the circus they call that the wild west and ive heard that their spurs an bridles was solid silver  you are a chump said harvey amused in spite of himself my father hasnt any use for ponies when he wants to ride he takes his car  haow lobstercar  no his own private car of course youve

dad an i haaf looked youd be swallered up sames jonah  harvey protested himself red in the face dan was a shrewd young person along his own lines and ten minutes questioning convinced him that harvey was not lyingmuch besides he had bound himself by the most terrible oath known to boyhood and yet he sat alive with a redended nose in the scuppers recounting marvels upon marvels  gosh said dan at last from the very bottom of his soul when harvey had completed an inventory of the car named in his honour then a grin of mischievous delight overspread his broad face i believe you harvey dads made a mistake fer once in his life  he has sure said harvey who was meditating an early revenge  hell be mad clear through dad jest hates to be mistook in his jedgments dan lay back and slapped his thigh oh harvey dont you spile the catch by lettin on  i dont want to be knocked down again ill get even with him though  never heard any man ever got even with dad but hed knock ye down again sure the more he was mistook the more hed do it but goldmines and pistols  i never said a word about pistols harvey cut in for he was on his oath  thets so no more you did two private cars then one named fer you an one fer her an two hundred dollars a month pocketmoney all knocked into the scuppers fer not workin fer ten an a haaf a month its the top haul o the season he exploded with noiseless chuckles  then i was right said harvey who thought he had found a sympathiser  you was wrong the wrongest kind o wrong you take right hold an pitch in longside o me or youll catch it an ill catch it fer backin you up dad always gives me double helps cause im his son an he hates favourin folk guess youre kinder mad at dad ive been that way time an again but dads a mighty jest man all the fleet says so  looks like justice this dont it harvey pointed to his outraged nose  thets nothin lets the shore blood outer you dad did it for yer health say though i cant have dealins with a man that thinks me or dad or any one on the were heres a thief  we aint any common wharfend crowd by any manner o means were fishermen an weve shipped together for six years an more dont you make any mistake on that i told ye dad dont let me swear he calls em vain oaths and pounds me but ef i could say what you said baout your pap an his fixins id say that baout your dollars i dunno what was in your pockets when i dried your kit fer i didnt look to see but id say using the very same words ez you used jest now neither me nor dadan we was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboardknows anythin baout the money thets my say naow  the bloodletting had certainly cleared harveys brain and maybe the loneliness of the sea had something to do with it thats all right he said then he looked down confusedly seems to me that for a fellow just saved from drowning i havent been over and above grateful dan  well you was shook up and silly said dan anyway there was only dad an me aboard to see it the cook he dont count  i might have thought about losing the bills that way harvey said half to himself instead of calling everybody in sight a thief wheres your father  in the cabin what d you want o him again  youll see said harvey and he stepped rather groggily for his head was still singing to the cabin steps where the little ships clock hung in plain sight of the wheel troop in the chocolateandyellow painted cabin was busy with a notebook and an enormous black pencil which he sucked hard from time to time  i havent acted quite right said harvey surprised at his own meekness  whats wrong naow said the skipper walked into dan hev ye  no its about you  im here to listen  well iim here to take things back said harvey very quickly when a mans saved from drowning he gulped  ey youll make a man yet ef you go on this way  he oughtnt begin by calling people names  jest an rightright an jest said troop with the ghost of a dry smile  so im here to say im sorry another big gulp  troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held out an eleveninch hand i mistrusted twould do you sights o good an this shows i werent mistook in my jedgments a smothered chuckle on deck caught his ear i am very seldom mistook in my jedgments the eleveninch hand closed on harveys numbing it to the elbow well put a little more gristle to that fore weve done with you young feller an i dont think any worse of ye fer anythin thets gone by you wasnt fairly responsible go right abaout your business an you wont take no hurt  youre white said dan as harvey regained the deck flushed to the tips of his ears  i dont feel it said he  i didnt mean that way i heard what dad said when dad allows he dont think the worse of any man dads give himself away he hates to be mistook in his jedgments too ho ho onct dad has a jedgment hed sooner dip his colours to the british than change it im glad its settled right eend up dads right when he says he cant take you back its all the livin we make herefishin the menll be back like sharks after a dead whale in haaf an hour  what for said harvey supper o course dont your stummick tell you youve a heap to learn  guess i have said harvey dolefully looking at the tangle of ropes and blocks overhead  shes a daisy said dan enthusiastically misunderstanding the look wait till our mainsails bent an she walks home with all her salt wet theres some work first though he pointed down into the darkness of the open mainhatch between the two masts  whats that for its all empty said harvey  you an me an a few more hev got to fill it said dan thats where the fish goes  alive said harvey  well no theyre sos to be ruther deadan flatan salt theres a hundred hogshead o salt in the bins an we haint moren covered our dunnage to now  where are the fish though  in the

well sluice that out when theyre through send well hev full pens tonight ive seen her down haaf a foot with fish waitin to clean an we stood to the tables till we was splittin ourselves instid o them we was so sleepy yes theyre comin in naow dan looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them over the shining silky sea  ive never seen the sea from so low down said harvey its fine  the low sun made the water all purple and pinkish with golden lights on the barrels of the long swells and blue and green mackerel shades in the hollows each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories towards her by invisible strings and the little black figures in the tiny boats pulled like clockwork toys  theyve struck on good said dan between his halfshut eyes manuel haint room fer another fish low ez a lilypad in still water aint he  which is manuel i dont see how you can tell em way off as you do  last boat to the southard he fund you last night said dan pointing manuel rows portugoosey ye cant mistake him east o himhes a heap bettern he rowsis pennsylvania loaded with saleratus by the looks of him east o himsee how pretty they string out all along with the

platt manowars man he was on the old ohiofirst of our navy he says to go araound the horn he never talks of much else cept when he sings but be has fair fishin luck there what did i tell you  a melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory harvey heard something about somebodys hands and feet being cold and then    bring forth the chart the doleful chart   see where them mountings meet   the clouds are thick around their heads   the mists around their feet   full boat said dan with a chuckle if he gives us o captain its toppin full  the bellow continued    and naow to

im going to try to work anyway harvey replied stoutly only its all dead new  lay aholt o that tackle then behind ye  harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the stays of the mainmast while dan pulled down another that ran from something he called a toppinglift as manuel drew alongside in his loaded dory the portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that harvey learned to know well later and a shorthandled fork began to throw fish into the pen on deck two hundred and thirtyone he shouted  give him the hook said dan and harvey ran it into manuels hands he slipped it through a loop of rope at the dorys bow caught dans tackle hooked it to the sternbecket and clambered into the schooner  pull shouted dan and harvey pulled astonished to find how easily the dory rose  hold on she dont nest in the crosstrees dan laughed and harvey held on for the boat lay in the air above his head  lower away dan shouted and as harvey lowered dan swayed the light boat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast they dont weigh nothin empty thet was right smart fer a passenger theres more trick to it in a seaway  ah ha said manuel holding out a brown hand you are some pretty well now this time last night the fish they fish for you now you fish for fish eh whaat  imim ever so grateful harvey stammered and his unfortunate hand stole to his pocket once more but he remembered that he had no money to offer when he knew manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he might have made would cover him with hot uneasy blushes in his bunk  there is no to be thankful for to me said manuel how shall i leave you dreeft dreeft all around the banks now you are a fisherman eh whaat ouh auh he bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips to get the kinks out of himself  i have not cleaned boat today too busy they struck on queek danny my son clean for me  harvey moved forward at once here was something he could do for the man who had saved his life  dan threw him a swab and he leaned over the dory mopping up the slime clumsily but with great goodwill hike out the footboards they slide in them grooves said dan swab em an lay em down never let a

whack came another dory alongside and more fish shot into the pen  two hundred and three lets look at the passenger the speaker was even larger than the galway man and his face was made curious by a purple cut running slantways from his left eye to the right corner of his mouth  not knowing what else to do harvey swabbed each dory as it came down pulled out the footboards and laid them in the bottom of the boat  hes caught on good said the scarred man who was tom platt watching him critically there are two ways o doin everything ones fisherfashionany end first an a slippery hitch over

boston clamdigger fore long he laid the knives tastefully on the table cocked his head on one side and admired the effect  i think its fortytwo said a small voice overside and there was a roar of laughter as another voice answered then my lucks turned fer onct caze im fortyfive though i be stung outer all shape  fortytwo or fortyfive ive lost count the small voice said  its penn an uncle

murmured them two are ony jest beginnin  mother av delight hes forkin them wan by wan howled long jack as uncle salters got to work laboriously the little man in the other dory counting a line of notches on the gunwale  that was last weeks catch he said looking up plaintively his forefinger where he had left off  manuel nudged dan who darted to the aftertackle and leaning far overside slipped the hook into the sternrope as manuel made her fast forward the others pulled gallantly and swung the boat inman fish and all  one two fournine said tom platt counting with a practised eye fortyseven penn youre it dan let the aftertackle run and slid him out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish  hold on roared uncle salters bobbing by the waist hold on im a bit mixed in my caount  he had no time to protest but was hove inboard and treated like pennsylvania  fortyone said tom platt beat by a farmer salters an you sech a sailor too  twerent fair caount said he stumbling out of the pen an im stung up all to pieces  his thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white  some folks will find strawberrybottom said dan addressing the newly risen moon ef they hev to dive fer it seems to me  an others said uncle salters eats the fat o the land in sloth an mocks their own bloodkin  seat ye seat ye a voice harvey had not heard called from the focsle disko troop tom platt long jack and salters went forward on the word little penn bent above his square deepsea reel and the tangled codlines manuel lay down full length on the deck and dan dropped into the hold where harvey heard him banging casks with a hammer  salt he said returning soon as were through supper we git to dressingdown youll pitch to dad tom platt an dad they stow together an youll hear em arguin were second haaf you an me an manuel an pennthe youth an beauty o the boat  whats the good of that said harvey im hungry  theyll be through in a minute sniff she smells good tonight dad ships a good cook ef he do suffer with his brother its a full catch today aint it he pointed at the pens piled high with cod what water did ye hev manuel  twentyfife father said the portuguese sleepily they strike on good an queek some day i show you harvey  the moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men came aft the cook had no need to cry second half dan and manuel were down the hatch and at table ere tom platt last and most deliberate of the elders had finished wiping his mouth with the back of his hand harvey followed penn and sat down before a tin pan of cods tongues and sounds mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato a loaf of hot bread and some black and powerful coffee hungry as they were they waited while pennsylvania solemnly asked a blessing then they stoked in silence till dan drew breath over his tin cup and demanded of harvey how he felt  most full but theres just room for another piece  the cook was a huge jetblack negro and unlike all the negroes harvey had met did not talk contenting himself with smiles and dumbshow invitations to eat more  see harvey said dan rapping with his fork on the table its jest as i said the young an handsome menlike me an pennsy an you an manuelwe re second haaf an we eats when the first haaf are through theyre the old fish and theyre mean an humpy an their stummicks has to be humoured so they come first which they dont deserve aint that so doctor  the cook nodded  cant he talk said harvey in a whisper  nough to git along not much o anything we know his natural tongues kinder curious comes from the inards of cape breton he does where the farmers speak homemade scotch cape bretons full o niggers whose folk run in there durin aour war an they talk like the farmersall huffychuffy  that is not scotch said pennsylvania that is gaelic so i read in a book  penn reads a heap most of what he says is socep when it comes to a caount o fisheh  does your father just let them say how many theyve caught without checking them said harvey  why yes wheres the sense of a man lyin fer a few old cod  was a man once lied for his catch manuel put in lied every day fife ten twentyfife more fish than come he say there was  where was that said dan none o aour folk  frenchman of anguille  ah them west shore frenchmen dont caount anyway stands to reason they cant caount ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks harvey youll know why said dan with an awful contempt    always more and never less   every time we come to dress  long jack roared down the hatch and the second haaf scrambled up at once  the shadow of the masts and rigging with the neverfurled ridingsail rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight and the pile of fish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver in the hold there were tramplings and rumblings where disko troop and tom platt moved among the saltbins dan passed harvey a pitchfork and led him to the inboard end of the rough table where uncle salters was drumming impatiently with a knifehaft a tub of salt water lay at his feet  you pitch to dad an tom platt down the hatch an take keer uncle salters dont cut yer eye out said dan swinging himself into the hold ill pass salt below  penn and manuel stood kneedeep among cod in the pen flourishing drawn knives long jack a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands faced uncle salters at the table and harvey stared at the pitchfork and the tub  hi shouted manuel stooping to the fish and bringing one up with a finger under its gill and a finger in its eye he laid it on the edge of the pen the knifeblade glimmered with a sound of tearing and the fish slit from throat to vent with a nick on either side of the neck dropped at long jacks feet  hi said long jack with a scoop of his mittened hand the cods liver dropped in the basket another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying and the empty fish slid across to uncle salters who snorted fiercely there was another sound of tearing the backbone flew over the bulwarks and the fish headless gutted and open splashed in the tub sending the salt water into harveys astonished mouth after the first yell the men were silent the cod moved along as though they were alive and long ere harvey had ceased wondering at the miraculous dexterity of it all his tub was full  pitch grunted uncle salters without turning his head and harvey pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch  hi pitch em bunchy shouted dan dont scatter uncle salters is the best splitter in the fleet watch him mind his book  indeed it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting magazine pages against time manuels body cramped over from the hips stayed like a statue but his long arms grabbed the fish without ceasing little penn toiled valiantly but it was easy to see he was weak once or twice manuel found time to help him without breaking the chain of supplies and once manuel howled because he had caught his finger in a frenchmans hook these hooks are made of soft metal to be rebent after use but the cod very often get away with them and are hooked again elsewhere and that is one of the many reasons why the gloucester boats despise the frenchmen  down below the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh sounded like the whirring of a grindstonea steady undertune to the clicknick of the knives in the pen the wrench and schloop of torn heads dropped liver and flying offal the caraaah of uncle salterss knife scooping away backbones and the flap of wet opened bodies falling into the tub  at the end of an hour harvey would have given the world to rest for fresh wet cod weigh more than you would think and his back ached with the steady pitching but he felt for the first time in his life that he was one of a working gang of men took pride in the thought and held on sullenly  knife oh shouted uncle salters at last penn doubled up gasping among the fish manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself and long jack leaned over the bulwarks the cook appeared noiseless as a black shadow collected a mass of backbones and heads and retreated  bloodends for breakfast an headchowder said long jack smacking his lips  knife oh repeated uncle salters waving the flat curved splitters weapon  look by your foot harve cried dan below  harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing he dealt these around taking over the dulled ones  water said disko troop  scuttlebutts forard an the dippers alongside hurry harve said dan  he was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which tasted like nectar and loosed the jaws of disko and tom platt  these are cod said disko they aint damarskus figs tom platt nor yet silver bars ive told you that every single time sence weve sailed together  a matter o seven seasons returned tom platt coolly good stowins good stowin all the same an theres a right an a wrong way o stowin ballast even if youd ever seen four hundred ton o iron set into the  hi with a yell from manuel the work began again and never stopped till the pen was empty the instant the last fish was down disko troop rolled aft to the cabin with his brother manuel and long jack went forward tom platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere he too disappeared in half a minute harvey heard deep snores in the cabin and he was staring blankly at dan and penn  i did a little better that time danny said penn whose eyelids were heavy with sleep but i think it is my duty to help clean  wouldnt hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal said dan turn in penn youve no call to do boys work draw a bucket harvey oh penn dump these in the gurrybutt fore you sleep kin you keep awake that long  penn took up the heavy basket of fishlivers emptied them into a cask with a hinged top lashed by the focsle then he too dropped out of sight in the cabin  boys clean up after dressin down an first watch in caam weather is boys watch on the were here dan sluiced the pen energetically unshipped the table set it up to dry in the moonlight ran the red knifeblades through a wad of oakum and began to sharpen them on a tiny grindstone as harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under his direction  at the first splash a silverywhite ghost rose bolt upright from the oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh harvey started back with a shout but dan only laughed grampus said he beggin fer fishheads they upeend thet way when theyre hungry breath on him like the doleful tombs haint he a horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of white sank and the water bubbled oilily haint ye never seen a grampus upeend before youll see em by hundreds fore yere through say its good to hev a boy aboard again otto was too old an a dutchy at that him an me we fought considble wouldnt ha keered fer thet ef hed hed a christian tongue in his head sleepy  dead sleepy said harvey nodding forward  mustnt sleep on watch rouse up an see ef our anchorlights bright an shinin youre on watch now harve  pshaw whats to hurt us brights day snorrr  jest when things happen dad says fine weathers good sleepin an fore you know mebbe youre cut in two by a liner an seventeen brassbound officers all genelmen lift their hand to it that your lights was aout an there was a thick fog harve ive kinder took to you but ef you nod onct more ill lay into you with a ropes end  the moon who sees many strange things on the banks looked down on a slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey staggering around the cluttered decks of a seventyton schooner while behind him waving a knotted rope walked after the manner of an executioner a boy who yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt  the lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly the ridingsail slatted a little in the shifts of the light wind the windlass creaked and the miserable procession continued harvey expostulated threatened whimpered and at last wept outright while dan the words clotting on his tongue spoke of the beauty of watchfulness and slashed away with the ropes end punishing the dories as often as he hit harvey at last the clock in the cabin struck ten and upon the tenth stroke little penn crept on deck he found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side on the mainhatch so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to their berths    chapter iii  it was the fortyfathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart and sends you to breakfast ravening they emptied a big tin dish of juicy fragments of fishthe bloodends the cook had collected overnight they cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess who were out fishing sliced pork for the midday meal swabbed down the focsle filled the lamps drew coal and water for the cook and investigated the forehold where the boats stores were stacked it was another perfect daysoft mild and clear and harvey breathed to the very bottom of his lungs  more schooners had crept up in the night and the long blue seas were full of sails and dories far away on the horizon the smoke of some liner her hull invisible smudged the blue and to eastward a big ships topgallantsails just lifting made a square nick in it disko troop was smoking by the roof of the cabinone eye on the craft around and the other on the little fly at the mainmasthead  when dad kerflummoxes that way said dan in a whisper hes doin some highline thinkin fer all hands ill lay my wage an share well make berth soon dad he knows the cod an the fleet they know dad knows see em comin up one by one lookin fer nothin in particular o course but scrowgin on us all the time theres the prince leboa shes a chatham boat shes crep up sence last night an see that big one with a patch in her foresail an a new jib shes the carrie pitman from west chatham she wont keep her canvas long on less her lucks changed since last season she dont do much cep drift there aint an anchor madell hold her    when the smoke puffs up in little rings like that dads studyin the fish ef we speak to him now hell git mad las time i did he jest took an hove a boot at me  disko troop stared forward the pipe between his teeth with eyes that saw nothing as his son said he was studying the fishpitting his knowledge and experience on the banks against the roving cod in his own sea he accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the horizon as a compliment to his powers but now that it was paid he wished to draw away and make his berth alone till it was time to go up to the virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the waters so disko troop thought of recent weather and gales currents foodsupplies and other domestic arrangements from the point of view of a twentypound cod was in fact for an hour a cod himself and looked remarkably like one then he removed the pipe from his teeth  dad said dan weve done our chores cant we go overside a piece its good catchin weather  not in that cherrycoloured rig ner them haafbaked brown shoes give him suthin fit to wear  dads pleasedthat settles it said dan delightedly dragging harvey into the cabin while troop pitched a key down the steps dad keeps my spare rig where he kin overhaul it cause ma sez im keerless he rummaged through a locker and in less than three minutes harvey was adorned with fishermans rubber boots that came half up his thigh a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows a pair of flippers and a souwester  naow ye look somethin like said dan hurry  keep nigh an handy said troop an dont go visitin raound the fleet ef any one asks you what im callatin to do speak the truthfer ye dont know  a little red dory labelled hattie s lay astern of the schooner dan hauled in the painter and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards while harvey tumbled clumsily after  thats no way o gettin into a boat said dan ef there was any sea youd go to the bottom sure you got to learn to meet her  dan fitted the tholepins took the forward thwart and watched harveys work the boy had rowed in a ladylike fashion on the adirondack ponds but there is a difference between squeaking pins and wellbalanced rowlockslight sculls and stubby eightfoot seaoars they stuck in the gentle swell and harvey grunted  short row short said dan ef you cramp your oar in any kind o sea youre liable to turn her over aint she a daisy mine too  the little dory was specklessly clean in her bows lay a tiny anchor two jugs of water and some seventy fathoms of thin brown doryroding a tin dinnerhorn rested in cleats just under harveys right hand beside an uglylooking maul a short gaff and a shorter wooden stick a couple of lines with very heavy leads and double codhooks all neatly coiled on square reels were stuck in their place by the gunwale  wheres the sail and mast said harvey for his hands were beginning to blister  dan chuckled ye dont sail fishindories much ye pull but ye neednt pull so hard dont you wish you owned her  well i guess my father might give me one or two if i asked em harvey replied he had been too busy to think much of his family till then  thats so i forgot your dads a millionaire you dont act millionary any naow but a dory an craft an geardan spoke as though she were a whaleboat costs a heap think your dad ud give you one ferfer a pet like  shouldnt wonder it would be most the only thing i havent stuck him for yet  must be an expensive kinder kid to home dont slitheroo thet way harve shorts the trick because no seas ever dead still an the swellsll  crack the loom of the oar kicked harvey under the chin and knocked him backward  that was what i was goin to say i hed to learn too but i wasnt more than eight years old when i got my schoolin  harvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown  no good gettin mad at things dad says its our own fault ef we cant handle em he says les try here manuelll give us the water  the portugee was rocking fully a mile away but when dan upended an oar he waved his left arm three times  thirty fathom said dan stringing a salt clam on to the hook over with the doughboys bait sames i do harve an dont snarl your reel  dans line was out long before harvey had mastered the mystery of baiting and heaving out the leads the dory drifted along easily it was not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground  here we come dan shouted and a shower of spray rattled on harveys shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside muckle harvey muckle under your hand quick  evidently muckle could not be the dinnerhorn so harvey passed over the maul and dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it inboard and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he called a gobstick then harvey felt a tug and pulled up zealously  why these are strawberries he shouted look  the hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries red on one side and white on the otherperfect reproductions of the land fruit except that there were no leaves and the stem was all pipy and slimy  dont tech em slat em off dont  the warning came too late harvey had picked them from the hook and was admiring them  ouch he cried for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped many nettles  naow ye know what strawberrybottom means nothin cep fish should be teched with the naked fingers dad says slat em off agin the gunnel an bait up harve lookin wont help any its all in the wages  harvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month and wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over the edge of a fishingdory in midocean she suffered agonies whenever he went out on saranac lake and by the way harvey remembered distinctly that he used to laugh at her anxieties suddenly the line flashed through his hand stinging even through the flippers the woolen circlets supposed to protect it  hes a logy give him room accordin to his strength cried dan ill help ye  no you wont harvey snapped as he hung on to the line its my first fish isis it a whale  halibut mebbe dan peered down into the water alongside and flourished the big muckle ready for all chances something white and oval flickered and fluttered through the green ill lay my wage an share hes over a hundred are you so everlastin anxious to land him alone harveys knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been banged against the gunwale his face was purpleblue between excitement and exertion he dripped with sweat and was half blinded from staring at the circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line the boys were tired long ere the halibut who took charge of them and the dory for the next twenty minutes but the big flat fish was gaffed and hauled in at last  beginners luck said dan wiping his forehead hes all of a hundred  harvey looked at the huge greyandmottled creature with unspeakable pride he had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore but it had never occurred to him to ask how they came inland now he knew and every inch of his body ached with fatigue  ef dad was along said dan hauling up hed read the signs plains print the fish arc runnin smaller an smaller an youve took baout as logy a halibuts were apt to find this trip yesterdays catchdid ye notice itwas all big fish an no halibut dad hed read them signs right off dad says everythin on the banks is signs an can be read wrong er right dads deepern the whalehole  even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the were here and a potatobasket was run up in the forerigging  what did i say naow thats the call fer the whole crowd dads onter something er hed never break fishin this time o day reel up harve an well pull back  they were to windward of the schooner just ready to flirt the dory over the still sea when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to penn who was careering around a fixed point for all the world like a gigantic waterbug the little man backed away and came down again with enormous energy but at the end of each manoeuvre his dory swung round and snubbed herself on her rope  well hey to help him else hell root an seed here said dan  whats the matter said harvey this was a new world where he could not lay down the law to his elders but had to ask questions humbly and the sea was horribly big and unexcited  anchors fouled penns always losing em lost two this trip areadyon sandy bottom tooan dad says next one he loses sures fishin hell give him the kelleg that ud break penns heart  whats a kelleg said harvey who had a vague idea it might be some kind of marine torture like keelhauling in the storybooks  big stone instid of an anchor you kin see a kelleg ridin in the bows furs you can see a dory an all the fleet knows what it means theyd guy him dreadful penn couldnt stand that no moren a dog with a dipper to his tail hes so everlastin sensitive hello penn stuck again dont try any more o your patents come up on her and keep your rodin straight up an down  it doesnt move said the little man panting it doesnt move at all and indeed i tried everything whats all this hurrahsnest forard said dan pointing to a wild tangle of spare oars and doryroding all matted together by the hand of inexperience  oh that said penn proudly is a spanish windlass mr salters showed me how to make it but even that doesnt move her  dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile twitched once or twice on the roding and behold the anchor drew at once  haul up penn he said laughing er she ll git stuck again  they left him regarding the weedhung flukes of the little anchor with big pathetic blue eyes and thanking them profusely  oh say while i think of it harve said dan when they were out of earshot penn aint quite all caulked he aint nowise dangerous but his minds give out see  is that so or is it one of your fathers judgments harvey asked as he bent to his oars he felt he was learning to handle them more easily  dad aint mistook this time penns a surenuff loony no he aint thet exactly so much ez a harmless ijjit it was this way youre rowin quite so harve an i tell you cause its

pleased boys were too crowded he went on addressing the crew as they clambered inboard well leave em to bait big an catch small he looked at the catch in the pen and it was curious to see how little and level the fish ran save for harveys halibut there was nothing over fifteen pounds on deck  im waitin on the weather he added  yell have to make it yourself disko for theres no sign i can see said long jack sweeping the clear horizon  and yet half an hour later as they were dressingdown the bank fog dropped on them between fish and fish as they say it drove steadily and in wreaths curling and smoking along the colourless water the men stopped dressingdown without a word long jack and uncle salters slipped the windlassbrakes into their sockets and began to heave up the anchor the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel manuel and tom platt gave a hand at the last the anchor came up with a sob and the ridingsail bellied as troop steadied her at the wheel up jib and foresail said he  slip em in the smother shouted long jack making fast the jibsheet while the others raised the clacking rattling rings of the foresail and the foreboom creaked as the were here looked up into the wind and dived off into blank whirling white  theres wind behind this fog said troop  it was all wonderful beyond words to harvey and the most wonderful part was that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from troop ending with thats good my son  never seen anchor weighed before said tom platt to harvey gaping at the damp canvas of the foresail  no where are we going  fish and make berth as youll find out fore youve bin a week aboard its all new to you but we never know what may come to us now take metom plattid never ha thought  its better than fourteen dollars a month an a bullet in your belly said troop from the wheel ease your jumbo a grind  dollars an cents better returned the manowars man doing something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it but we didnt think o that when we manned the windlassbrakes on the miss jim buck1 outside beaufort harbor with fort macon heavin hot shot at our stern an a livin gale atop of all where was you then disko  jest here or hereabouts disko replied earnin my bread on the deep waters and dodgin reb privateers sorry i cant accommodate you with redhot shot tom platt but i guess well come aout all right on wind fore we see eastern point  there was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now varied by a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the focsle the rigging dripped clammy drops and the men lounged along the lee of the houseall save uncle salters who sat stiffly on the mainhatch nursing his stung hands   1 the gemsbok u s n   guess shed carry staysl said disko rolling one eye at his brother  guess she wouldnt to any sorter profit whats the sense o wastin canvas the farmersailor replied  the wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in diskos hands a few seconds later a hissing wavetop slashed diagonally across the boat smote uncle salters between the shoulders and drenched him from head to foot he rose sputtering and went forward only to catch another  see dad chase him all around the deck said dan uncle salters he thinks his quartershares our canvas dads put this duckin act up on him two trips runnin hi that found him where he feeds uncle salters had taken refuge by the foremast but a wave slapped him over the knees diskos face was as blank as the circle of the wheel  guess shed lie easier under staysl salters said disko as though he had seen nothing  set your old kite then roared the victim through a cloud of spray only dont lay it to me if anything happens penn you go below right off an git your coffee you ought to hev more sense than to bum araound on deck this weather  now theyll swill coffee an play checkers till the cows come home said dan as uncle salters hustled penn into the forecabin looks to me likes if wed all be doin so fer a spell theres nothin in creation deaderlimpseyidlern a banker when she aint on fish  im glad ye spoke danny cried long jack who had been casting round in search of amusement id clean forgot wed a passenger under that twharf hat theres no idleness for thim that dont know their ropes pass him along tom platt an well larn him  taint my trick this time grinned dan youve got to go it alone dad learned me with a ropes end  for an hour long jack walked his prey up and down teaching as he said things at the sea that ivry man must know blind dhrunk or asleep there is not much gear to a seventyton schooner with a stumpforemast but long jack had a gift of expression when he wished to draw harveys attention to the peakhalyards he dug his knuckles into the back of the boys neck and kept him at gaze for half a minute he emphasised the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing harveys nose along a few feet of the boom and the lead of each rope was fixed in harveys mind by the end of the rope itself  the lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free but there appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a man forward lay the windlass and its tackle with the chain and hemp cables all very unpleasant to trip over the focsle stovepipe and the gurrybutts by the focslehatch to hold the fishlivers aft of these the foreboom and booby of the mainhatch took all the space that was not needed for the pumps and dressingpens then came the nests of dories lashed to ringbolts by the quarterdeck the house with tubs and oddments lashed all around it and last the sixtyfoot mainboom in its crutch splitting things lengthwise to duck and dodge under every time  tom platt of course could not keep his oar out of the business but ranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails and spars on the old ohio  niver mind fwhat he says attind to me innocince tom platt this ballyhoos not the ohio an youre mixing the bhoy bad  hell be ruined for life beginnin on a foreanafter this way tom platt pleaded give him a chance to know a few leadin principles sailins an art harvey as id show you if i had ye in the foretop o the  i know

no the boom then run that rope you showed me back there  thats no way tom platt burst in  quiet hes larnin an has not the names good yet go on harve  oh its the reefpennant id hook the tackle on to the reefpennant and then let down  lower the sail child lower said tom platt in a professional agony  lower the throatand peakhalyards harvey went on those names stuck in his head  lay your hand on thim said long jack  harvey obeyed lower till that ropeloopon the afterleachkrisno its cringletill the cringle was down on the boom then id tie her up the way you said and then id hoist up the peakand throathalyards again  youve forgot to pass the tackearing but wid time and help yell larn theres good and just reason for ivry rope aboard or else twould be overboard dye follow me tis dollars an cents im puttin into your pocket ye skinny little supercargo so that fwhin yeve filled out ye can ship from boston to cuba an tell thim long jack larned you now ill chase ye around a piece callin the ropes an youll lay your hand on thim as i call  he began and harvey who was feeling rather tired walked slowly to the rope named a ropes end licked round his ribs and nearly knocked the breath out of him  when you own a boat said tom platt with severe eyes you can walk till then take all orders at the run once moreto make sure  harvey was in a glow with the exercise and this last cut warmed him thoroughly now he was a singularly smart boy the son of a very clever man and a very sensitive woman with a fine resolute temper that systematic spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy he looked at the other men and saw that even dan did not smile it was evidently all in the days work though it hurt abominably so he swallowed the hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin the same smartness that led him to take such advantage of his mother made him very sure that no one on the boat except maybe penn would stand the least nonsense one learns a great deal from a mere tone long jack called over half a dozen more ropes and harvey danced over the deck like an eel at ebbtide one eye on tom platt  ver good ver good done said manuel after supper i show you a little schooner i make with all her ropes so we shall learn  fustclass fera passenger said dan dad hes jest allowed youll be wuth your salt maybe fore youre draownded thets a heap fer dad ill learn you more our next watch together  taller grunted disko peering through the fog as it smoked over the bows there was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging jibboom while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn pale waves whispering and upping one to the other  now ill learn you something long jack cant shouted tom platt as from a locker by the stern he produced a battered deepsea lead hollowed at one end smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton tallow and went forward ill learn you how to fly the blue pigeon shooo  disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooners way while manuel with harvey to help and a proud boy was harvey let down the jib in a lump on the boom the lead sung a deep droning song as tom platt whirled it round and round  go ahead man said long jack impatiently were not drawin twentyfive fut off fire island in a fog theres no trick to ut  dont be jealous galway the released lead plopped into the sea far ahead as the schooner surged slowly forward  soundin is a trick though said dan when your dipsey leads all the eye youre like to hev for a week what dyou make it dad  diskos face relaxed his skill and honour were involved in the march he had stolen on the rest of the fleet and he had his reputation as a master artist who knew the banks blindfold sixty mebbeef im any judge he replied with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of the house  sixty sung out tom platt hauling in great wet coils  the schooner gathered way once more heave said disko after a quarter of an hour  what dyou make it dan whispered and he looked at harvey proudly but harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just then  fifty said the father i mistrust were right over the nick o green bank on old sixtyfifty  fifty roared tom platt they could scarcely see him through the fog shes bust within a yardlike the shells at fort macon  bait up harve said dan diving for a line on the reel  the schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother her headsail banging wildly the men waited and looked at the boys who began fishing  heugh dans lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail now haow in thunder did dad know help us here harve its a big un pokehooked too they hauled together and landed a goggleeyed twentypound cod he had taken the bait right into his stomach  why hes all covered with little crabs cried harvey turning him over  by the great hookblock theyre lousy already said long jack disko ye kape your spare eyes under the keel  splash went the anchor and they all heaved over the lines each man taking his own place at the bulwarks  are they good to eat harvey panted as he lugged in another crabcovered cod  sure when theyre lousy its a sign theyve all been herdin together by the thousand and when they take the bait that way theyre hungry never mind how the bait sets theyll bite on the bare hook  say this is great harvey cried as the fish came in gasping and splashingnearly all pokehooked as dan had said why cant we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories  allus can till we begin to dressdaown efter thet the heads and offals ud scare the fish to fundy boatfishin aint reckoned progressive though unless ye know as much as dad knows guess well run aout aour trawl tonight harder on the back this than frum the dory aint it  it was rather backbreaking work for in a dory the weight of a cod is waterborne till the last minute and you are so to speak abreast of him but the few feet of a schooners freeboard make so much extra deadhauling and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach but it was wild and furious sport so long as it lasted and a big pile lay aboard when the fish ceased biting  wheres penn and uncle salters harvey asked slapping the slime off his oilskins and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the others  gits coffee and see  under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawlpost the focsle table down and opened utterly unconscious of fish or weather sat the two men a checkerboard between them uncle salters snarling at penns every move  whats the matter naow said the former as harvey one hand in the leather loop at the head of the ladder hung shouting to the cook  big fish and lousyheaps and heaps harvey replied quoting long jack hows the game  little penns jaw dropped twerent none o his fault snapped uncle salters penns deef  checkers werent it said dan as harvey staggered aft with the steaming coffee in a tin pail that lets us out o cleanin up tonight dads a jest man theyll have to do it  an two young fellers i knowll bait up a tub or so o trawl while theyre cleanin said disko lashing the wheel to his taste  urn guess id ruther clean up dad  dont doubt it ye wunt though dressdaown dressdaown pennll pitch while you two bait up  why in thunder didnt them blame boys tell us youd struck on said uncle salters shuffling to his place at the table this knifes gumblunt dan  ef stickin out cable dont wake ye guess youd better hire a boy o your own said dan muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of trawlline lashed to windward of the house oh harve dont ye want to slip down an gits bait  bait ez we are said disko i mistrust shagfishin will pay better ez things go  that meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the fish were cleanedan improvement on paddling barehanded in the little baitbarrels below the tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a big hook each few feet and the testing and baiting of every single hook with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear when shot from the dory was a scientific business dan managed it in the dark without looking while harvey caught his fingers on the barbs and bewailed his fate but the hooks flew through dans fingers like tatting on an old maids lap i helped bait up trawl ashore fore i could well walk he said but its a putterin job all the same oh dad this shouted towards the hatch where disko and tom platt were salting how many skates you reckon well need  baout three hurry  theres three hundred fathom to each tub dan explained moren enough to lay out tonight ouch slipped up there i did he stuck his finger in his mouth i tell you harve there aint money in gloucesterud hire me to ship on a reglar trawler it may be progressive but barrin that its the putterinest slimjammest business top of earth  i dont know what this is if tisnt regular trawling said harvey sulkily my fingers are all cut to frazzles  pshaw this is jest one o dads blame experiments he dont trawl less theres mighty good reason fer it dad knows thets why hes baitin ez he is well hev her saggin full when we take her up er we wont see a fin  penn and uncle salters cleaned up as disko had ordained but the boys profited little no sooner were the tubs furnished than tom platt and long jack who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern snatched them away loaded up the tubs and some small painted trawlbuoys and hove the boat overboard into what harvey regarded as an exceedingly rough sea theyll be drowned why the dorys loaded like a freightcar he cried  well be back said long jack an in case youll not be lookin for us well lay into you both if the trawls snarled  the dory surged up on the crest of a wave and just when it seemed impossible that she could avoid smashing against the schooners side slid over the ridge and was swallowed up in the damp dusk  take ahold here an keep ringin steady said dan passing harvey the lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass  harvey rang lustily for he felt two lives depended on him but disko in the cabin scrawling in the logbook did not look like a murderer and when he went to supper he even smiled drily at the anxious harvey  this aint no weather said dan why you an me could set thet trawl theyve only gone out jest far nough sos not to foul our cable they dont need no bell reelly  clang cling clang harvey kept it up varied with occasional rubadubs for another halfhour there was a bellow and a bump alongside manuel and dan raced to the hooks of the dorytackle long jack and tom platt arrived on deck together it seemed one half the north atlantic at their backs and the dory followed them in the air landing with a clatter  nary snarl said tom platt as he dripped danny youll do yet  the pleasure av your compny to the banquit said long jack squelching the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and stuck an oilskinned arm into harveys face we do be condescending to honour the second half wid our presence and off they all four rolled to supper where harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fishchowder and fried pies and fell fast asleep just as manuel produced from a locker a lovely twofoot model of the lucy holmes his first boat and was going to show harvey the ropes harvey never even twiddled his fingers as penn pushed him into his bunk  it must be a sad thinga very sad thing said penn watching the boys face for his mother and his father who think he is dead to lose a childto lose a manchild  git out o this penn said dan go aft and finish your game with uncle salters tell dad ill stand harves watch ef he dont keer hes played aout  ver good boy said manuel slipping out of his boots and disappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk expec he make good man danny i no see he is any so mad as your parpa he says eh whaat  dan chuckled but the chuckle ended in a snore  it was thick weather outside with a rising wind and the elder men stretched their watches the hours struck clear in the cabin the nosing bows slapped and scuffled with the seas the focsle stovepipe hissed and sputtered as the spray caught it and the boys slept on while disko long jack tom plait and uncle salters each in turn stumped aft to look at the wheel forward to see that the anchor held or to veer out a little more cable against chafing with a glance at the dim anchorlight between each round    chapter iv  harvey waked to find the first half at breakfast the focsle door drawn to a crack and every square inch of the schooner singing its own tune the black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over the glare of the stove and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge up and up the focsle climbed yearning and surging and quivering and then with a clear sicklelike swoop came down into the seas he could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch and there was a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above like a volley of buckshot followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawsehole a grunt and squeal of the windlass a yaw a punt and a kick and the were here gathered herself together to repeat the motions  now ashore he heard long jack saying yeve chores an ye must do thim in any weather here were well clear of the fleet an weve no choresan thats a blessin good night all he passed like a big snake from the table to his bunk and began to smoke tom platt followed his example uncle salters with penn fought his way up the ladder to stand his watch and the cook set for the second half  it came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs with a shake and a yawn it ate till it could eat no more and then manuel filled his pipe with some terrible tobacco crotched himself between the pawlpost and a forward bunk cocked his feet up on the table and smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke dan lay at length in his bunk wrestling with a gaudy giltstopped accordion whose tunes went up and down with the pitching of the were here the cook his shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies dan was fond of fried pies peeled potatoes with one eye on the stove in event of too much water finding its way down the pipe and the general smell and smother were past all description  harvey considered affairs wondered that he was not deathly sick and crawled into his bunk again as the softest and safest place while dan struck up i dont want to play in your yard as accurately as the wild jerks allowed  how long is this for harvey asked of manuel  till she get a little quiet and we can row to trawl perhaps tonight perhaps two days more you do not like eh whaat  i should have been crazy sick a week ago but it doesnt seem to upset me nowmuch  that is because we make you fisherman these days if i was you when i come to gloucester i would give two three big candles for my good luck  give who  to be surethe virgin of our church on the hill she is very good to fishermen all the time that is why so few of us portugee men ever are drowned  youre a roman catholic then  i am a madeira man i am not a porto pico boy shall i be baptist then eh whaat i always give candlestwo three more when i come to gloucester the good virgin she never forgets me manuel  i dont sense it that way tom platt put in from his bunk his scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe it stands to reason the seas the sea and youll git jest about whats goin candles or kerosene fer that matter  tis a mighty good thing said long jack to have a frind at coort though im o manuels way o thinkin about tin years back i was crew to a sou boston marketboat we was off minots ledge wid a northeaster butt first atop of us thickern burgoo the ould man was dhrunk his chin waggin on the tiller an i sez to myself if iver i stick my boathuk into twharf again ill show the saints fwhat manner o craft they saved me out av now im here as ye can well see an the model of the dhirty ould kathleen that took me a month to make i gave ut to the priest an he hung ut up forninst the altar theres more sense in givin a model thats by way o bein a work av art than any candle ye can buy candles at store but a model shows the good saints yeve tuk trouble an are grateful  dyou believe that irish said tom platt turning on his elbow  would i do ut if i did not ohio  waal enoch fuller he made a model o the old ohio and shes to salem museum now mighty pretty model too but i guess enoch he never done it fer no sacrifice an the way i take it is  there were the makings of an hourlong discussion of the kind that fishermen love where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one proves anything at the end had not dan struck up this cheerful rhyme    up jumped the mackerel with his striped back   reef in the mainsail and haul on the tack   for its windy weather  here long jack joined in    and its blowy weather   when the winds begin to blow pipe all hands together  dan went on with a cautious look at tom plait holding the accordion low in the bunk    up jumped the cod with his chucklehead   went to the mainchains to heave at the lead   for its windy weather etc  tom platt seemed to be hunting for something dan crouched lower but sang louder    up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground   chucklehead chucklehead   mind where ye sound  tom platts huge rubber boot whirled across the focsle and caught dans uplifted arm there was war between the man and the boy ever since dan had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would make him angry as he heaved the lead  thought id fetch yer said dan returning the gift with precision ef you dont like my music git out your fiddle i aint goin to lie here all day an listen to you an long jack arguin baout candles fiddle tom platt or ill learn harve here the tune  tom platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle manuels eye glistened and from somewhere behind the pawlpost he drew out a tiny guitarlike thing with wire strings which he called a machette  tis a concert said long jack beaming through the smoke a reglar boston concert  there was a burst of spray as the hatch opened and disko in yellow oilskins descended  yere just in time disko fwhats she doin outside  jest this he dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of the were here  were singin to kape our breakfasts down yell lead av course disko said long jack  guess there aint moren baout two old songs i know an yeve heerd them both  his excuses were cut short by tom platt launching into a most dolorous tune like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts with his eyes fixed on the beams above disko began this ancient ancient ditty tom platt flourishing all round him to make the tune and words fit a little    there is a crack packetcrack packet o fame   she hails from noo york an the dreadnoughts her name   you may talk o your fliersswallowtail and black ball   but the dreadnoughts the packet that can beat them all    now the dreadnought she lies in the river mersey   because of the tugboat to take her to sea   but when shes off soundings you shortly will know   chorus   shes the liverpool packeto lord let her go    now the dreadnought shes howlin crost the banks o newfoundland   where the waters all shallow and the bottoms all sand   sez all the little fishes that swim to an fro   chorus   shes the liverpool packeto lord let her go  there were scores of verses for he worked the dreadnought every mile of the way between liverpool and new york as conscientiously as though he were on her deck and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked beside him tom platt followed with something about the rough and tough mcginn who would pilot the vessel in then they called on harvey who felt very flattered to contribute to the entertainment but all that he could remember were some pieces of skipper iresons ride that he had been taught at the campschool in the adirondacks it seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place but he had no more than mentioned the title when disko brought down one foot with a bang and cried dont go on young feller thats a mistaken jedgmentone o the worst kind too becaze its catchin to the ear  i orter ha warned you said dan thet allus fetches dad  whats wrong said harvey surprised and a little angry  all youre goin to say said disko all dead wrong from start to finish an whittier hes to blame i have no special call to right any marblehead man but twerent no fault o iresons my father he told me the tale time an again an this is the way twuz  for the wan hundreth time put in long jack under his breath  ben ireson he was skipper o the betty young feller comin home frum the banksthat was before the war of 1812 but jestice is jestice at all times they fund the active o portland an gibbons o that town he was her skipper they fund her leakin off cape cod light there was a terrble gale on an they was gettin the betty homes fast as they could craowd her well ireson he said there warnt any sense to reskin a boat in that sea the men they wouldnt hev it and he laid it before them to stay by the active till the sea run daown a piece they wouldnt hev that either hangin araound the cape in any sech weather leak or no leak they jest up staysl an quit natrally takin ireson with em folks to marblehead was mad at him not runnin the risk and becaze nex day when the sea was caam they never stopped to think o that some of the actives folk was took off by a truro man they come into marblehead with their own tale to tell sayin how ireson had shamed his town an so forth an so on an iresons men they was scared seem public feelin agin em an they went back on ireson an swore he was responsble for the hull act twerent the women neither that tarred and feathered himmarblehead women dont act that waytwas a passel o men an boys an they carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout an ireson he told em theyd be sorry for it some day well the facts came aout later sames they usually do too late to be any ways useful to an honest man an whittier he come along an picked up the slack eend of a lyin tale an tarred and feathered ben ireson all over onct more after he was dead twas the only time whittier ever slipped up an twerent fair i whaled dan good when he brought that piece back from school you dont know no better o course but ive give you the facts hereafter an evermore to be remembered ben ireson werent no sech kind o man as whittier makes aout my father he knew him well before an after that business an you beware o hasty jedgments young feller next  harvey had never heard disko talk so long and collapsed with burning cheeks but as dan said promptly a boy could only learn what he was taught at school and life was too short to keep track of every lie along the coast  then manuel touched the jangling jarring little machette to a queer tune and sang something in portuguese about nina innocente ending with a fullhanded sweep that brought the song up with a jerk then disko obliged with his second song to an oldfashioned creaky tune and all joined in the chorus this is one stanza    now aprile is over and melted the snow   and outer noo bedford we shortly must tow   yes out o noo bedford we shortly must clear   were the whalers that never see wheat in the ear  here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself and then    wheatintheear my trueloves posy blowin   wheatintheear were goin off to sea   wheatintheear i left you fit for sowin   when i come back a loaf o bread youll be  that made harvey almost weep though he could not tell why but it was much worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands for the fiddle still leaning against the locker door he struck into a tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you did after a little he sang in an unknown tongue his big chin down on the fiddletail his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight harvey swung out of his bunk to hear better and amid the straining of the timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on like lee surf in a blind fog till it ended with a wail  jimmy christmas thet gives me the blue creevles said dan  what in thunder is it  the song of fin mccoul said the cook when he wass going to norway his english was not thick but all clearcut as though it came from a phonograph  faith ive been to norway but i didnt make that unwholesim noise tis like some of the old songs though said long jack sighing  dont lets hev another thout somethin between said dan and the accordion struck up a rattling catchy tune that ended    its six an twenty sundays sence las we saw the land   with fifteen hunder quintal   an fifteen hunder quintal teen hunder toppin quintal   twix old queereau an grand  hold on roared tom plait dye want to nail the trip dan thats jonah sure less you sing it after all our salts wet  no taint is it

remembering what tom platt had said about candles and models havent we all got to take whats served  a mutter of dissent ran round the bunks outboard yes inboard things can happen said disko dont you go makin a mock of jonahs young feller  well harve aint no jonah day after we catched him dan cut in we had a toppin good catch  the cook threw up his head and laughed suddenlya queer thin laugh he was a most disconcerting nigger murder said long jack dont do that again doctor we aint used to ut  whats wrong said dan aint he our mascot and didnt they strike on good after wed struck him  oh yess said the cook i know that but the catch iss not finish yet  he aint goin to do us any harm said dan hotly where are ye hintin an edgin to hes all right  no harm no but one day he will be your master

it master and manman and master  how in thunder dye work that out said tom platt  in my head where i can see  haow this from all the others at once  i do not know but so it will be he dropped his head and went on peeling the potatoes and not another word could they get out of him  well said dan a heap o thingsll hev to come abaout fore harves any master o mine but im glad the doctor aint choosen to mark him for a jonah now i mistrust uncle salters fer the jonerest jonah in the fleet regardin his own special luck dunno ef its spreadin sames smallpox he ought to be on the carrie pitman that boats her own jonah surecrews an gear make no differ to her driftin jimmy christmas shell etch loose in a flat caam  were well dear o the fleet anyway said disko carrie pitman an all there was a rapping on the deck  uncle salters has catched his luck said dan as his father departed  its blown clear disko cried and all the focsle tumbled up for a bit of fresh air the fog had gone but a sullen sea ran in great rollers behind it the were here slid as it were into long sunk avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they would only stay still but they changed without rest or mercy and flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand grey hills while the wind hooted through her rigging as she zigzagged down the slopes far away a sea would burst in a sheet of foam and the others would follow suit as at a signal till harveys eyes swam with the vision of interlacing whites and greys four or five mother careys chickens stormed round in circles shrieking as they swept past the bows a rainsquall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste ran down wind and back again and melted away  seems to me i saw somethin flicker jest naow over yonder said uncle salters pointing to the northeast  cant be any of the fleet said disko peering under his eyebrows a hand on the focsle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the troughs seas oilin over dretful fast danny dont you want to skip up a piece an see how aour trawlbuoy lays  danny in his big boots trotted rather than climbed up the main rigging this consumed harvey with envy hitched himself around the reeling crosstrees and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black buoyflag on the shoulder of a mileaway swell  shes all right he hailed sail o dead to the nothard comin down like smoke schooner she be too  they waited yet another halfhour the sky clearing in patches with a flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of olivegreen water then a stumpforemast lifted ducked and disappeared to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with oldfashioned wooden snailshorn davits the sails were redtanned  frenchmen shouted dan no taint neither daad  thats no french said disko salters your blame luck holds tightern a screw in a keghead  ive eyes its uncle abishai  you cant nowise tell fer sure  the headking of all jonahs groaned tom platt oh salters salters why wasnt you abed an asleep  how could i tell said poor salters as the schooner swung up  she might have been the very flying dutchman so foul draggled and unkempt was every rope and stick aboard her oldstyle quarterdeck was some four or five feet high and her rigging flew knotted and tangled like weed at a wharfend she was running before the windyawing frightfullyher staysail let down to act as a sort of extra foresailscandalised they call itand her foreboom guyed out over the side her bowsprit cocked up like an oldfashioned frigates her jibboom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond further repair and as she hove herself forward and sat down on her broad tail she looked for all the world like a blowzy frousy bad old woman sneering at a decent girl  thats abishai said salters full o gin an judique men an the judgments o providence layin fer him an never takin good holt hes run in to bait miquelon way  hell run her under said long jack thats no rig fer this weather  not he r hed a done it long ago disko replied lookss if he callated to run us under aint she daown by the head moren natural tom platt  ef its his style o loadin her she aint safe said the sailor slowly ef shes spewed her oakum hed better git to his pumps mighty quick  the creature thrashed up wore round with a clatter and rattle and lay head to wind within earshot  a greybeard wagged over the bulwark and a thick voice yelled something harvey could not understand but diskos face darkened hed resk every stick he hez to carry bad news says were in fer a shift o wind hes in fer worse abishai abishai he waved his arm up and down with the gesture of a man at the pumps and pointed forward the crew mocked him and laughed  jounce ye an strip ye an trip ye yelled uncle abishai a livin galea livin gale yah cast up fer your last trip all you gloucester haddocks you wont see gloucester no more no more  crazy fullas usual said tom platt wish he hadnt spied us though  she drifted out of hearing while the greyhead yelled something about a dance at the bay of bulls and a dead man in the focsle harvey shuddered he had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savageeyed crew  an thats a fine little floatin hell fer her draught said long jack i wondher what mischief hes been at ashore  hes a trawler dan explained to harvey an he runs in fer bait all along the coast oh no not home he dont go he deals along the south an east shore up yonder he nodded in the direction of the pitiless newfoundland beaches dad wont never take me ashore there theyre a mighty tough crowdan abishais the toughest you saw his boat well shes nigh seventy year old they say the last o the old marblehead heeltappers they dont make them quarterdecks any more abishai dont use marblehead though he aint wanted there he jes drifs araound in debt trawlin an cussin like youve heard bin a jonah fer years an years he hez gits liquor frum the feecamp boats fer makin spells an selling winds an such truck crazy i guess  twont be any use underrunnin the trawl tonight said tom platt with quiet despair he come alongside special to cuss us id give my wage an share to see him at the gangway o the old ohio fore we quit floggin jest abaout six dozen an sam mocatta layin em on crisscross  the dishevelled heeltapper danced drunkenly down wind and all eyes followed her suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice it wass his own death made him speak so he iss feyfey i tell you look she sailed into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant the patch dulled and faded out and even as the light passed so did the schooner she dropped into a hollow andwas not  run under by the great hookblock shouted disko jumping aft drunk or sober weve got to help em heave short and break her out smart  harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of the jib and foresail for they hove short on the cable and to save time jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom heaving in as they moved away this is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in matters of life and death and the little were here complained like a human they ran down to where abishais craft had vanished found two or three trawltubs a ginbottle and a stovein dory but nothing more let em go said disko though no one had hinted at picking them up i wouldnt hev a match that belonged to abishai aboard guess she run clear under must ha been spewin her oakum fer a week an they never thought to pump her thats one more boat gone along o leavin port all hands drunk  glory be said long jack wed ha been obliged to help em if they was top o water  thinkin o that myself said tom platt  fey fey said the cook rolling his eyes he hass taken his own luck with him  ver good thing i think to tell the fleet when we see eh whaat said manuel if you runna that way before the wind and she work open her seams he threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture while penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and pity of it all harvey could not realise that he had seen death on the open waters but he felt very sick  then dan went up the crosstrees and disko steered them back to within sight of their own trawlbuoys just before the fog blanketed the sea once again  we go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go was all he said to harvey you think on that for a spell young feller that was liquor  after dinner it was calm enough to fish from the deckspenn and uncle salters were very zealous this timeand the catch was large and large fish  abishai has shorely took his luck with him said salters the wind haint backed ner riz ner nothin how abaout the trawl i despise superstition anyway  tom platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a new berth but the cook said the luck iss in two pieces you will find it so when you look i know this so tickled long jack that he overbore tom platt and the two went out together  underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory picking off the fish rebaiting the hooks and passing them back to the sea again something like pinning and unpinning linen on a washline it is a lengthy business and rather dangerous for the long sagging line may twitch a boat under in a flash but when they heard and naow to thee o capting booming out of the fog the crew of the were here took heart the dory swirled alongside well loaded tom platt yelling for manuel to act as reliefboat  the lucks cut square in two pieces said long jack forking in the fish while harvey stood openmouthed at the skill with which the plunging dory was saved from destruction one half was jest punkins tom platt wanted to haul her an ha done wid ut but i said ill back the doctor that has the second sight an the other half come up sagging full o big uns hurry mannle an brings a tub o bait theres luck afloat tonight  the fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had just been taken and tom platt and long jack moved methodically up and down the length of the trawl the boats nose surging under the wet line of hooks stripping the seacucumbers that they called pumpkins slatting off the freshcaught cod against the gunwale rebaiting and loading manuels dory till dusk  ill take no risks said disko thennot with him floatin around so near abishai wont sink fer a week heave in the dories an well dressdaown after supper  that was a mighty dressingdown attended by three or four blowing grampuses it lasted till nine oclock and disko was thrice heard to chuckle as harvey pitched the split fish into the hold  say youre haulin ahead dretful fast said dan when they ground the knives after the men had turned in theres somethin of a sea tonight an i haint heard you make no remarks on it  too busy harvey replied testing a blades edge come to think of it she is a highkicker  the little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the silvertipped waves backing with a start of affected surprise at the sight of the strained cable she pounced on it like a kitten while the spray of her descent burst through the hawseholes with the report of a gun shaking her head she would say well im sorry i cant stay any longer with you im going north and would sidle off halting suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging as i was just going to observe she would begin as gravely as a drunken man addressing a lamppost the rest of the sentence she acted her words in dumbshow of course was lost in a fit of the fidgets when she behaved like a puppy chewing a string a clumsy woman in a sidesaddle a hen with her head cut off or a cow stung by a hornet exactly as the whims of the sea took her  see her sayin her piece shes patrick henry naow said dan  she swung sideways on a roller and gesticulated with her jibboom from port to starboard  butezferme give me libertyer give medeath  wop she sat down in the moonpath on the water courtesying with a flourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheelgear sniggered mockingly in its box  harvey laughed aloud why its just as if she was alive he said  shes as stiddy as a haouse an as dry as a herrin said dan enthusiastically as he was stung across the deck in a batter of spray fends em off an fends em off an dont ye come anigh me she sez look at herjest look at her sakes you should see one o them toothpicks histin up her anchor on her spike outer fifteenfathom water  whats a toothpick dan  them new haddockers an herrinboats fines a yacht forward with yacht sterns to em an spike bowsprits an a haouse that ud take our hold ive heard that burgess

the march o the times theyre chockfull o laboursavin jigs an sech all ever seed the elector o gloucester shes a daisy ef she is a toothpick  what do they cost dan  hills o dollars fifteen thousand phaps more mebbe theres goldleaf an everything you kin think of then to himself half under his breath guess id call her hattie s too    chapter v  that was the first of many talks with dan who told harvey why he would transfer his dorys name to the imaginary burgessmodelled haddocker harvey heard a good deal about the real hattie at gloucester saw a lock of her hairwhich dan finding fair words of no avail had hooked as she sat in front of him at school that winterand a photograph hattie was about fourteen years old with an awful contempt for boys and had been trampling on dans heart through the winter all this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks in the dead dark or in choking fog the whining wheel behind them the climbing deck before and without the unresting clamorous sea once of course as the boys came to know each other there was a fight which raged from bow to stern till penn came up and separated them but promised not to tell disko who thought fighting on watch rather worse than sleeping harvey was no match for dan physically but it says a great deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try to get even with his conqueror by underhand methods  that was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his elbows and wrists where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the flesh the salt water stung them unpleasantly but when they were ripe dan treated them with diskos razor and assured harvey that now he was a blooded banker the affliction of gurrysores being the mark of the caste that claimed him  since he was a boy and very busy he did not bother his head with too much thinking he was exceedingly sorry for his mother and often longed to see her and above all to tell her of his wonderful new life and how brilliantly he was acquitting himself in it otherwise he preferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his supposed death but one day as he stood on the focsle ladder guying the cook who had accused him and dan of hooking fried pies it occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by strangers in the smokingroom of a hired liner  he was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the were here had his place at the table and among the bunks and could hold his own in the long talks on stormy days when the others were always ready to listen to what they called his fairytales of his life ashore it did not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke of his own lifeit seemed very far awayno one except dan and even dans belief was sorely tried credited him so he invented a friend a boy he had heard of who drove a miniature fourpony drag in toledo ohio and ordered five suits of clothes at a time and led things called germans at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen but all the presents were solid silver salters protested that this kind of yarn was desperately wicked if not indeed positively blasphemous but he listened as greedily as the others and their criticisms at the end gave harvey entirely new notions on germans clothes cigarettes with goldleaf tips rings watches scent small dinnerparties champagne cardplaying and hotel accommodation little by little he changed his tone when speaking of his friend whom long jack had christened the crazy kid the giltedged baby the suckin vanderpoop and other pet names and with his seabooted feet cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk pajamas and specially imported neckwear to the friends discredit harvey was a very adaptable person with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about him  before long he knew where disko kept the old greencrusted quadrant that they called the hogyokeunder the bedbag in his bunk when he took the sun and with the help of the old farmers almanac found the latitude harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stovepipe now the chief engineer of the liner could have done no more and no engineer of thirty years service could have assumed one half of the ancientmariner air with which harvey first careful to spit over the side made public the schooners position for that day and then and not till then relieved disko of the quadrant there is an etiquette in all these things  the said hogyoke an eldridge chart the farming almanac blunts coast pilot and bowditchs navigator were all the weapons disko needed to guide him except the deepsea lead that was his spare eye harvey nearly slew penn with it when tom platt taught him first how to fly the blue pigeon and though his strength was not equal to continuous sounding in any sort of a sea for calm weather with a sevenpound lead on shoal water disko used him freely as dan said taint soundins dad wants its samples grease her up good harve harvey would tallow the cup at the end and carefully bring the sand shell sludge or whatever it might be to disko who fingered and smelt it and gave judgment as has been said when disko thought of cod he thought as a cod and by some longtested mixture of instinct and experience moved the were here from berth to berth always with the fish as a blindfolded chessplayer moves on the unseen board  but diskos board was the grand banka triangle two hundred and fifty miles on each side a waste of wallowing sea cloaked with dank fog vexed with gales harried with drifting ice scored by the tracks of the reckless liners and dotted with the sails of the fishingfleet  for days they worked in fogharvey at the belltill grown familiar with the thick airs he went out with tom platt his heart rather in his mouth but the fog would not lift and the fish were biting and no one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time harvey devoted himself to his lines and the gaff or gobstick as tom platt called for them and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and toms instinct manuels conch sounding thin and faint beside them but it was an unearthly experience and for the first time in a month harvey dreamed of the shifting smoking floors of water round the dory the lines that strayed away into nothing and the air above that melted on the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes a few days later he was out with manuel on what should have been fortyfathom bottom but the whole length of the roding ran out and still the anchor found nothing and harvey grew mortally afraid for that his last touch with earth was lost whalehole said manuel hauling in that is good joke on disko come and he rowed to the schooner to find tom platt and the others jeering at the skipper because for once he had led them to the edge of the barren whaledeep the blank hole of the grand bank they made another berth through the fog and that time the hair of harveys head stood up when he went out in manuels dory a whiteness moved in the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave and there was a roaring a plunging and spouting it was his first introduction to the dread summer berg of the banks and he cowered in the bottom of the boat while manuel laughed there were days though clear and soft and warm when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf over the handlines and spank the drifting sunscalds with an oar and there were days of light airs when harvey was taught how to steer the schooner from one berth to another  it thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his hand on the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed back and forth against the blue sky that was magnificent in spite of disko saying that it would break a snakes back to follow his wake but as usual pride ran before a fall they were sailing on the wind with the staysailan old one luckilyset and harvey jammed her right into it to show dan how completely he had mastered the art the foresail went over with a bang and the foregaff stabbed and ripped through the staysail which was of course prevented from going over by the mainstay they lowered the wreck in awful silence and harvey spent his leisure hours for the next few days under tom platts lee learning to use a needle and palm dan hooted with joy for as he said he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days  boylike harvey imitated all the men by turns till he had combined diskos peculiar stoop at the wheel long jacks swinging overhand when the lines were hauled manuels roundshouldered but effective stroke in a dory and tom platts generous ohio stride along the deck  tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut said long jack when harvey was looking out by the windlass one thick noon ill lay my wage an share tis moren half playactin to him an he consates himself hes a bowld mariner watch his little bit av a back now  thats the way we all begin said tom platt the boys they make believe all the time till theyve cheated emselves into bein men an so till they diepretendin an pretendin i done it on the old ohio i know stood my first watchharborwatchfeelin finern farragut dans full o the same kind o notions see em now actin to be genewine mossbacksevery hair a ropeyarn an blood stockholm tar he spoke down the cabin stairs guess youre mistook in your judgments fer once disko what in rome made ye tell us all here the kid was crazy  he wuz disko replied crazy ez a loon when he come aboard but ill say hes sobered up considble sence i cured him  he yarns good said tom platt tother night he told us abaout a kid of his own size steerin a cunnin little rig an four ponies up an down toledo ohio i think twas an givin suppers to a crowd o simlar kids curus kind o fairytale but blame interestin he knows scores of em  guess he strikes em outen his own head disko called from the cabin where he was busy with the logbook stands to reason that sort is all made up it dont take in no one but dan an he laughs at it ive heard him behind my back  yever hear what simon peter cahoun said when they whacked up a match twix his sister hitty an lorin jerauld an the boys put up that joke on him daown to georges drawled uncle salters who was dripping peaceably under the lee of the starboard dorynest  tom platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence he was a cape cod man and had not known that tale more than twenty years uncle salters went on with a rasping chuckle  simon peter cahoun he said an he was jest right abaout lorin haaf on the taown he said an tother haaf blame fool an they told me shes married a ich man simon peter cahoun he hednt no roof to his mouth an talked that way  he didnt talk any pennsylvania dutch tom platt replied youd better leave a cape man to tell that tale the cahouns was gipsies frum way back  wal i dont profess to be any elocutionist salters said im comin to the moral o things thats jest abaout what aour harve be haaf on the taown an tother haaf blame fool an theres somell believe hes a rich man yah  did ye ever think how sweet twould be to sail wid a full crew o salterses said long jack haaf in the furrer an other haaf in the muckheap as cahoun did not say an makes out hes a fisherman  a little laugh went round at salterss expense  disko held his tongue and wrought over the logbook that he kept in a hatchetfaced square hand this was the kind of thing that ran on page after soiled page  july 17 this day thick fog and few fish made berth to northward so ends this day  july 18 this day comes in with thick fog caught a few fish  july 19 this day comes in with light breeze from n e and fine weather made a berth to eastward caught plenty fish  july 20 this the sabbath comes in with fog and light winds so ends this day total fish caught this week 3478  they never worked on sundays but shaved and washed themselves if it were fine and pennsylvania sang hymns once or twice he suggested that if it was not an impertinence he thought he could preach a little uncle salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion reminding him that he was not a preacher and mustnt think of such things wed hev him rememberin johnstown next salters explained an what would happen then so they compromised on his reading aloud from a book called josephus it was an old leatherbound volume smelling of a hundred voyages very solid and very like the bible but enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges and they read it nearly from cover to cover otherwise penn was a silent little body he would not utter a word for three days on end sometimes though he played checkers listened to the songs and laughed at the stories when they tried to stir him up he would answer i dont wish to seem unneighbourly but it is because i have nothing to say my head feels quite empty ive almost forgotten my name he would turn to uncle salters with an expectant smile  why pennsylvania pratt salters would shout youll fergit me next  nonever penn would say shutting his lips firmly pennsylvania pratt of course he would repeat over and over sometimes it was uncle salters who forgot and told him he was haskins or rich or mcvitty but penn was equally contenttill next time  he was always very tender with harvey whom he pitied both as a lost child and as a lunatic and when salters saw that penn liked the boy he relaxed too salters was not an amiable person he esteemed it his business to keep the boys in order and the first time harvey in fear and trembling on a still day managed to shin up to the maintruck dan was behind him ready to help he esteemed it his duty to hang salterss big seaboots up therea sight of shame and derision to the nearest schooner with disko harvey took no liberties not even when the old man dropped direct orders and treated him like the rest of the crew to dont you want to do so and so and guess youd better and so forth there was something about the cleanshaven lips and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to young blood  disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart which he said laid over any government publication whatsoever led him pencil in hand from berth to berth over the whole string of banksle have western banquereau st pierre green and grandtalking cod meantime taught him too the principle on which the hogyoke was worked  in this harvey excelled dan for he had inherited a head for figures and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen bank sun appealed to all his keen wits for other seamatters his age handicapped him as disko said he should have begun when he was ten dan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark and at a pinch when uncle salters had a gurrysore on his palm could dress down by sense of touch he could steer in anything short of half a gale from the feel of the wind on his face humouring the were here just when she needed it these things he did as automatically as he skipped about the rigging or made his dory a part of his own will and body but he could not communicate his knowledge to harvey  still there was a good deal of general information flying about the schooner on stormy days when they lay up in the focsle or sat on the cabin lockers while spare eyebolts leads and rings rolled and rattled in the pauses of the talk disko spoke of whaling voyages in the fifties of great shewhales slain beside their young of death agonies on the black tossing seas and blood that spurted forty feet in the air of boats smashed to splinters of patent rockets that went off wrongendfirst and bombarded the trembling crews of cuttingin and boilingdown and that terrible nip of 71 when twelve hundred men were made homeless on the ice in three dayswonderful tales all true but more wonderful still were his stories of the cod and how they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the keel  long jacks tastes ran more to the supernatural he held them silent with ghastly stories of the yohoes on monomoy beach that mock and terrify lonely clamdiggers of sandwalkers and dunehaunters who were never properly buried of hidden treasure on fire island guarded by the spirits of kidds men of ships that sailed in the fog straight over truro township of that harbour in maine where no one but a stranger will lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their oldfashioned boat whistlingnot calling but whistlingfor the soul of the man who broke their rest  harvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land from mount desert south was populated chiefly by people who took their horses there in the summer and entertained in countryhouses with hardwood floors and vantine portieres he laughed at the ghosttalesnot as much as he would have done a month beforebut ended by sitting still and shuddering  tom platt dealt with his interminable trip round the horn on the old ohio in the flogging days with a navy more extinct than the dodothe navy that passed away in the great war he told them how redhot shot are dropped into a cannon a wad of wet clay between them and the cartridge how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood and how the little shipboys of the miss jim buck hove water over them and shouted to the fort to try again and he told tales of blockadelong weeks of swaying at anchor varied only by the departure and return of steamers that had used up their coal there was no change for the sailingships of gales and coldcold that kept two hundred men night and day pounding and chopping at the ice on cable blocks and rigging when the galley was as redhot as the forts shot and men drank cocoa by the bucket tom platt had no use for steam his service closed when that thing was comparatively new he admitted that it was a specious invention in time of peace but looked hopefully for the day when sails should come back again on tenthousandton frigates with hundredandninetyfoot booms  manuels talk was slow and gentleall about pretty girls in madeira washing clothes in the dry beds of streams by moonlight under waving bananas legends of saints and tales of queer dances or fights away in the cold newfoundland baitingports salters was mainly agricultural for though he read josephus and expounded it his mission in life was to prove the value of green manures and specially of clover against every form of phosphate whatsoever he grew libellous about phosphates he dragged greasy orange judd books from his bunk and intoned them wagging his finger at harvey to whom it was all greek little penn was so genuinely pained when harvey made fun of salterss lectures that the boy gave it up and suffered in polite silence that was very good for harvey  the cook naturally did not join in these conversations as a rule he spoke only when it was absolutely necessary but at times a queer gift of speech descended on him and he held forth half in gaelic half in broken english an hour at a time he was specially communicative with the boys and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day harvey would be dans master and that he would see it he told them of mailcarrying in the winter up cape breton way of the dogtrain that goes to coudray and of the ramsteamer arctic that breaks the ice between the mainland and prince edward island then he told them stories that his mother had told him of life far to the southward where water never froze and he said that when he died his soul would go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palmtrees waving above that seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never seen a palm in his life then too regularly at each meal he would ask harvey and harvey alone whether the cooking was to his taste and this always made the second half laugh yet they had a great respect for the cooks judgment and in their hearts considered harvey something of a mascot by consequence  and while harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and hard health with every gulp of the good air the were here went her ways and did her business on the bank and the silverygrey kenches of wellpressed fish mounted higher and higher in the hold no one days work was out of the common but the average days were many and close together  naturally a man of diskos reputation was closely watchedscrowged upon dan called itby his neighbours but he had a very pretty knack of giving them the slip through the curdling glidy fogbanks disko avoided company for two reasons he wished to make his own experiments in the first place and in the second he objected to the mixed gatherings of a fleet of all nations the bulk of them were mainly gloucester boats with a scattering from provincetown harwich chatham and some of the maine ports but the crews drew from goodness knows where risk breeds recklessness and when greed is added there are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet which like a mob of sheep is huddled round some unrecognised leader let the two jeraulds lead em said disko were baound to lay among em fer a spell on the eastern shoals though ef luck holds we wont hev to lay long where we are naow harve aint considered noways good graound  aint it said harvey who was drawing water he had learned just how to wiggle the bucket after an unusually long dressingdown shouldnt mind striking some poor ground for a change then  all the graound i want to seedont want to strike heris eastern point said dan say dad it looks s if we wouldnt hev to lay moren two weeks on the shoals youll meet all the compny you want then harve thats the time we begin to work no reglar meals fer no one then mugup when yere hungry an sleep when ye cant keep awake good job you wasnt picked up a month later than you was or wed never ha had you dressed in shape fer the old virgin  harvey understood from the eldridge chart that the old virgin and a nest of curiously named shoals were the turningpoint of the cruise and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there but seeing the size of the virgin it was one tiny dot he wondered how even disko with the hogyoke and the lead could find her he learned later that disko was entirely equal to that and any other business and could even help others a big fourbyfive blackboard hung in the cabin and harvey never understood the need of it till after some blinding thick days they heard the unmelodious tooting of a footpower foghorna machine whose note is as that of a consumptive elephant  they were making a short berth towing the anchor under their foot to save trouble squarerigger bellowin fer his latitude said long jack the dripping red headsails of a bark glided out of the fog and the were here rang her bell thrice using sea shorthand  the larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings  frenchman said uncle salters scornfully miquelon boat from st malo the farmer had a weatherly seaeye im most outer baccy too disko  same here said tom platt hi backez vouzbackez vouz standez awayez you buttended muchobono where you fromst malo eh  ah ha mucho bono oui oui clos pouletst malo st pierre et miquelon cried the other crowd waving woollen caps and laughing then all together bord bord  bring up the board danny beats me how them frenchmen fetch anywheres exceptin americas fairish broadly fortysix fortynines good enough fer them an i guess its abaout right too  dan chalked the figures on the board and they hung it in the mainrigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark  seems kinder unneighbourly to let em swedge off like this salters suggested feeling in his pockets  hev ye learned french then sence last trip said disko i dont want no more stoneballast hove at us long o your calm miquelon boats footy cochins sames you did off le have  harmon rush he said that was the way to rise em plain united states is good enough fer me were all dretful short on terbakker young feller dont you speak french  oh yes said harvey valiantly and he bawled hi say arretez vous attendez nous sommes venant pour tabac  ah tabac tabac they cried and laughed again  that hit em lets heave a dory over anyway said tom platt i dont exactly hold no certificates on french but i know another lingo that goes i guess come on harve an interpret  the raffle and confusion when he and harvey were hauled up the barks black side was indescribable her cabin was all stuck round with glaring coloured prints of the virginthe virgin of newfoundland they called her harvey found his french of no recognised bank brand and his conversation was limited to nods and grins but tom platt waved his arms and got along swimmingly the captain gave him a drink of unspeakable gin and the operacomique crew with their hairy throats red caps and long knives greeted him as a brother then the trade began they had tobacco plenty of itamerican that had never paid duty to france they wanted chocolate and crackers harvey rowed back to arrange with the cook and disko who owned the stores and on his return the cocoatins and crackerbags were counted out by the frenchmans wheel it looked like a piratical division of loot but tom platt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of chewing and smoking tobacco then those jovial mariners swung off into the mist and the last harvey heard was a gay chorus  par derriere chez ma tante il y a un bois joli et le rossignol y chante et le jour et la nuit que donneriez vous belle qui iamènerait ici je donnerai québec sorel et saint denis  how was it my french didnt go and your signtalk did harvey demanded when the barter had been distributed among the were heres  signtalk platt guffawed well yes twas signtalk but a heap oldern your french harve them french boats are chockfull o freemasons an thats why  are you a freemason then  looks that way dont it said the manowars man stuffing his pipe and harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon    chapter vi  the thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which some craft loafed about the broad atlantic fishingboats as dan said were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their neighbours but one expected better things of steamers that was after another interesting interview when they had been chased for three miles by a big lumbering old cattleboat all boarded over on the upper deck that smelt like a thousand cattlepens a very excited officer yelled at them through a speakingtrumpet and she lay and lollopped helplessly on the water while disko ran the were here under her lee and gave the skipper a piece of his mind where might ye beeh ye dont deserve to be anywheres you barnyard tramps go hoggin the road on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours an your eyes in your coffeecups instid o in your silly heads  at this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about diskos own eyes we havent had an observation for three days dyou suppose we can run her blind he shouted  waal i can disko retorted whats come to your lead et it cant ye smell bottom or are them cattle too rank  what dye feed em said uncle salters with intense seriousness for the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him they say they fall off dretful on a vyage dunno as its any o my business but ive a kind o notion that oilcake broke small an sprinkled  thunder said a cattleman in a red jersey as he looked over the side what asylum did they let his whiskers out of  young feller salters began standing up in the forerigging let me tell yeou fore we go any further that ive  the officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness excuse me he said but ive asked for my reckoning if the agricultural person with the hair will kindly shut his head the seagreen barnacle with the walleye may perhaps condescend to enlighten us  naow youve made a show o me salters said disko angrily he could not stand up to that particular sort of talk and snapped out the latitude and longitude without more lectures  well tbats a boatload of lunatics sure said the skipper as he rang up the engineroom and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the schooner  of all the blamed fools next to you salters him an his crowd are abaout the likeliest ive ever seen said disko as the were here slid away i was jest givin him my jedgment on lullsikin round these waters like a lost child an you must cut in with your fool farmin cant ye never keep things seprate  harvey dan and the others stood back winking one to the other and full of joy but disko and salters wrangled seriously till evening salters arguing that a cattleboat was practically a barn on blue water and disko insisting that even if this were the case decency and fisherpride demanded that he should have kept things seprate long jack stood it in silence for a timean angry skipper makes an unhappy crewand then he spoke across the table after supper  fwhats the good o bodderin fwhat theyll say said he  theyll tell that tale agin us fer yearsthats all said disko oilcake sprinkled  with salt o course said salters impenitent reading the farming reports from a weekold new york paper  its plumb mortifyin to all my feelins the skipper went on  cant see ut that way said long jack the peacemaker look at here disko is there another packet afloat this day in this weather cud ha met a tramp an over an above givin her her reckoninover an above that i saycud ha discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on the management av steers an such at sea forgit ut av coorse they will not twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued double game an twice runninall to us dan kicked harvey under the table and harvey choked in his cup  well said salters who felt that his honour had been somewhat plastered i said i didnt know as twuz any business o mine fore i spoke  an right there said tom platt experienced in discipline and etiquetteright there i take it disko you should ha asked him to stop ef the conversation wuz likely in your jedgment to be anywayswhat it shouldnt  dunno but thats so said disko who saw his way to an honourable retreat from a fit of the dignities  why o course it was so said salters you bein skipper here an id cheerful hev stopped on a hintnot from any leadin or conviction but fer the sake o bearin an example to these two blame boys of aours  didnt i tell you harve twould come araound to us fore wed done always those blame boys but i wouldnt have missed the show fer a halfshare in a halibutter dan whispered  still things should ha been kep seprate said disko and the light of new argument lit in salterss eye as he crumbled cut plug into his pipe  theres a power av vartue in keepin things seprate said long jack intent on stilling the storm thats fwhat steyning of steyning and hares fund when he sent counahan fer skipper on the marilla d kuhn instid o cap newton that was took with inflamtry rheumatism an couldnt go counahan the navigator we called him  nick counahan he never went aboard fer a night thout a pond o rum somewheres in the manifest said tom platt playing up to the lead he used to bum araound the cmission houses to boston lookin fer the lord to make him captain of a towboat on his merits sam coy up to atlantic avenoo give him his board free fer a year or more on account of his stories counahan the navigator tck tck dead these fifteen year aint he  seventeen i guess he died the year the caspar mcveagh was built but he could niver keep things seprate steyning tuk him fer the reason the thief tuk the hot stovebekaze there was nothin else that season the men was all to the banks and counahan he whacked up an iverlastin hard crowd fer crew rum ye cud ha floated the marilla insurance and all in fwhat they stowed aboard her they lef boston harbour for the great grand bank wid a roarin norwester behind em an all hands full to the bung an the hivens looked after thim for divil a watch did they set an divil a rope did they lay hand to till theyd seen the bottom av a fifteengallon cask o bugjuice that was about wan week so far as counahan remembered if i cud only tell the tale as he told ut all that whoile the wind blew like ould glory an the marillatwas summer and theyd give her a foretopmaststruck her gait and kept ut then counahan tuk the hogyoke an thrembled over it for a whoile an made out betwix that an the chart an the singin in his head that they was to the southard o sable island gettin along glorious but speakin nothin then they broached another keg an quit speculatin about anythin fer another spell the marilla she lay down whin she dropped boston light and she never lufted her leerail up to that timehustlin on one an the same slant but they saw no weed nor gulls nor schooners an prisintly they obsarved theyd been out a matter o fourteen days and they mistrusted the bank had suspinded payment so they sounded an got sixty fathom thats me sez counahan thats me ivry time ive run her slat on the bank fer you an when we get thirty fathom well turn in like little men counahan is the by sez he counahan the navigator  nex cast they got ninety sez counahan either the leadlines tuk too stretchin or else the banks sunk  they hauled ut up bein just about in that state when ut seemed right an reasonable and sat down on the deck countin the knots an gettin her snarled up hijjus the marilla shed struck her gait and she hild ut an prisintly along come a tramp an counahan spoke her  hey ye seen any fishinboats now sez he quite casual  theres lashins av them off the irish coast sez the tramp  aah go shake yerself sez counahan fwhat have i to do wid the irish coast  then fwhat are ye doin here sez the tramp  sufferin christianity sez counahan he always said that whin his pumps sucked an he was not feelin goodsufferin

consolation sez he bould ez brass dye take me fer a dialect thirtyfive mile from cape clear an fourteen days from boston light sufferin christianity tis a record an by the same token ive a mother to skibbereen think av ut the gall av um but ye see he could niver keep things seprate  the crew was mostly cork an kerry men barrin one marylander that wanted to go back but they called him a mutineer an they ran the ould marilla into skibbereen an they had an illigant time visitin around with frinds on the ould sod fer a week thin they wint back an it cost em two an thirty days to beat to the banks again twas gettin on towards fall and grub was low so counahan ran her back to boston wid no more bones to ut  and what did the firm say harvey demanded  fwhat could they the fish was on the banks an counahan was at twharf talkin av his record trip east they tuk their satisfaction out av that an ut all came av not keepin the crew and the rum seprate in the first place an confusin skibbereen wid queereau in the second counahan the navigator rest his sowl he was an imprompju citizen  once i was in the lucy holmes said manuel in his gentle voice they not want any of her feesh in gloucester eh whaat give us no price so we go across the water and think to sell to some fayal man then it blow fresh and we cannot see well eh whaat then it blow some more fresh and we go down below and drive very fastno one know where byandby we see a land and it get some hot then come two three nigger in a brick eh whaat we ask where we are and they saynow what you all think  grand canary said disko after a moment manuel shook his head smiling  blanco said tom platt  no worse than that we was below bezagos and the brick she was from liberia so we sell our feesh there not bad so eh whaat  can a schooner like this go right across to africa said harvey  go araound the horn ef theres anythin worth goin fer and the grub holds aout said disko my father he run his packet an she was a kind o pinkey abaout fifty ton i guessthe ruperthe run her over to greenlands icy mountains the year haaf our fleet was tryin after cod there an whats more he took my mother along with himto show her haow the money was earned i presooman they was all iced up an i was born at disko dont remember nothin abaout it o course we come back when the ice eased in the spring but they named me fer the place kinder mean trick to put up on a baby but were all baound to make mistakes in aour lives  sure sure said salters wagging his head all baound to make mistakes an i tell you two boys here thet after youve made a mistakeye dont make fewern a hundred a daythe next best things to own up to it like men  long jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except disko and salters and the incident was closed  then they made berth after berth to the northward the dories out almost every day running along the east edge of the grand bank in thirtyto fortyfathom water and fishing steadily  it was here harvey first met the squid who is one of the best codbaits but uncertain in his moods they were waked out of their bunks one black night by yells of squid o from salters and for an hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squidjiga piece of lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent backward like halfopened umbrella ribs the squidfor some unknown reasonlikes and wraps himself round this thing and is hauled up ere he can escape from the pins but as he leaves his home he squirts first water and next ink into his captors face and it was curious to see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot they were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended but a pile of fresh squid lay on the deck and the large cod thinks very well of a little shiny piece of squidtentacle at the tip of a clambaited hook next day they caught many fish and met the carrie pitman to whom they shouted their luck and she wanted to tradeseven cod for one fairsized squid but disko would not agree at the price and the carrie dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away in the hope of striking on to some for herself  disko said nothing till after supper when he sent dan and manuel out to buoy the were heres cable and announced his intention of turning in with the broadaxe dan naturally repeated these remarks to a dory from the carrie who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable since they were not on rocky bottom  dad sez he wouldnt trust a ferryboat within five mile o you dan howled cheerfully  why dont he git out then whos hinderin said the other  cause youve jest the same ez leebowed him an he dont take that from any boat not to speak o sech a driftin gurrybutt as you be  she aint driftin any this trip said the man angrily for the carrie pitman had an unsavoury reputation for breaking her groundtackle  then haow dyou make berths said dan its her best pint o sailin an ef shes quit driftin what in thunder are you doin with a new jibboom that shot went home  hey you portugoosy organgrinder take your monkey back to gloucester go back to school dan troop was the answer  overalls overalls yelled dan who knew that one of the carries crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before  shrimp gloucester shrimp git aout you novy  to call a gloucester man a nova scotian is not well received dan answered in kind  novy yourself ye scrabbletowners ye chatham wreckers git aout with your brick in your stock in and the forces separated but chatham had the worst of it  i knew haow twould be said disko shes drawed the wind raound already some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet shell snore till midnight an jest when were gittin our sleep shell strike adrift good job we aint crowded with craft hereaways but i aint goin to up anchor fer chatham she may hold  the wind which had hauled round rose at sundown and blew steadily there was not enough sea though to disturb even a dorys tackle but the carrie pitman was a law unto herself at the end of the boys watch they heard the crackcrackcrack of a huge muzzleloading revolver aboard her  glory glory hallelujah sung dan here she comes dad buttend first walkin in her sleep sames she done on queereau  had she been any other boat disko would have taken his chances but now he cut the cable as the carrie pitman with all the north atlantic to play in lurched down directly upon them the were here under jib and ridingsail gave her no more room than was absolutely necessarydisko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his cablebut scuttled up into the wind as the carrie passed within easy hail a silent and angry boat at the mercy of a raking broadside of bank chaff  good evenin said disko raising his headgear an haow does your garden grow  go to ohio an hire a mule said uncle salters we dont want no farmers here  will i lend you my doryanchor cried long jack  unship your rudder an stick it in the mud said tom platt  say dans voice rose shrill and high as he stood on the wheelbox saay is there a strike in the overall factory or hev they hired girls ye shackamaxons  veer out the tillerlines cried harvey and nail em to the bottom that was a saltflavoured jest he had been put up to by tom platt manuel leaned over the stern and yelled johnna morgan play the organ ahaaaa he flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of unspeakable contempt and derision while little penn covered himself with glory by piping up gee a little hssh come here haw  they rode on their chain for the rest of the night a short snappy uneasy motion as harvey found and wasted half the forenoon recovering the cable but the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of triumph and glory and they thought with grief over all the beautiful things that they might have said to the discomfited carrie    chapter vii  next day they fell in with more sails all circling slowly from the east northerly towards the west but just when they expected to make the shoals by the virgin the fog shut down and they anchored surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells there was not much fishing but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news  that night a little before dawn dan and harvey who had been sleeping most of the day tumbled out to hook fried pies there was no reason why they should not have taken them openly but they tasted better so and it made the cook angry the heat and smell below drove them on deck with their plunder and they found disko at the bell which he handed over to harvey  keep her goin said he i mistrust i hear somethin ef its anything im best where i am sos to get at things  it was a forlorn little jingle the thick air seemed to pinch it off and in the pauses harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liners siren and he knew enough of the banks to know what that meant it came to him with horrible distinctness how a boy in a cherrycoloured jerseyhe despised fancy blazers now with all a fishermans contempthow an ignorant rowdy boy had once said it would be great if a steamer ran down a fishingboat that boy had a stateroom with a hot and cold bath and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a giltedged bill of fare and that same boyno his very much older brotherwas up at four of the dim dawn in streaming crackling oilskins hammering literally for the dear life on a bell smaller than the stewards breakfastbell while somewhere close at hand a thirtyfoot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour the bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat before breakfast so harvey rang the bell  yes they slow daown one turn o their blame propeller said dan applying himself to manuels conch fer to keep inside the law an thats consolin when were all at the bottom hark to her shes a humper  aoooowhoooowhupp went the siren wingletingletink went the bell graaaouch went the conch while sea and sky were all milled up in milky fog then harvey felt that he was near a moving body and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a clifflike bow leaping it seemed directly over the schooner a jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of roman numeralsxv xvi xvii xviii and so forthon a salmoncoloured gleaming side it tilted forward and downward with a heartstilling ssssooo the ladder disappeared a line of brassrimmed portholes flashed past a jet of steam puffed in harveys helplessly uplifted hands a spout of hot water roared along the rail of the were here and the little schooner staggered and shook in a rush of screwtorn water as a liners stern vanished in the fog harvey got ready to faint or be sick or both when he heard a crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk and all small in his ear a faraway telephone voice drawling heave to youve sunk us  is it us he gasped  no boat out yonder ring were goin to look said dan running out a dory  in half a minute all except harvey penn and the cook were overside and away presently a schooners stumpforemast snapped clean across drifted past the bows then an empty green dory came by knocking on the were heres side as though she wished to be taken in then followed something face down in a blue jersey but it was not the whole of a man penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click harvey pounded despairingly at the bell for he feared they might be sunk at any minute and he jumped at dans hail as the crew came back  the jennie cushman said dan hysterically cut clean in halfgraound up an trompled on at that not a quarter of a mile away dads got the old man there aint any one else andthere was his son too oh harve harve i cant stand it ive seen he dropped his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a greyheaded man aboard  what did you pick me up for the stranger groaned disko what did you pick me up for  disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder for the mans eyes were wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew then up and spoke pennsylvania pratt who was also haskins or rich or mcvitty when uncle salters forgot and his face was changed on him from the face of a fool to the countenance of an old wise man and he said in a strong voice the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord i wasi am a minister of the gospel leave him to me  oh you be be you said the man then pray my son back to me pray back a ninethousanddollar boat an a thousand quintal of fish if youd left me alone my widow could ha gone on to the provident an worked fer her board an never knownan never known now ill hev to tell her  there aint nothin to say said disko better lie down a piece jason olley  when a man has lost his only son his summers work and his means of livelihood in thirty counted seconds it is hard to give consolation  all gloucester men wasnt they said tom platt fiddling helplessly with a dorybecket  oh that dont make no odds said jason wringing the wet from his beard ill be rowin summer boarders araound east gloucester this fall he rolled heavily to the rail singing  happy birds that sing and fly round thine altars o most high  come with me come below said penn as though he had a right to give orders their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute  i dunno who you be but ill come said jason submissively mebbe ill get back some o thesome o thenine thousand dollars penn led him into the cabin and slid the door behind  that aint penn cried uncle salters its jacob boiler anhes remembered johnstown i never seed such eyes in any livin mans head whats to do naow whatll i do naow  they could hear penns voice and jasons together then penns went on alone and salters slipped off his hat for penn was praying presently the little man came up the steps huge drops of sweat on his face and looked at the crew dan was still sobbing by the wheel  he dont know us salters groaned its all to do over again checkers and everythingan whatll he say to me  penn spoke they could hear that it was to strangers i have prayed said he our people believe in prayer i have prayed for the life of this mans son mine were drowned before my eyesshe and my eldest andthe others shall a man be more wise than his maker i prayed never for their lives but i have prayed for this mans son and he will surely be sent him  salters looked pleadingly at penn to see if he remembered  how long have i been mad penn asked suddenly his mouth was twitching  pshaw penn you werent never mad salters began only a little distracted like  i saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out i do not remember any more how long ago is that  i cant stand it i cant stand it cried dan and harvey whimpered in sympathy  abaout five year said disko in a shaking voice  then i have been a charge on some one for every day of that time who was the man  disko pointed to salters  ye haintye haint cried the seafarmer twisting his hands together yeve moren earned your keep twicetold an theres money owin you penn besides haaf o my quartershare in the boat which is yours fer value received  you are good men i can see that in your faces but  mother av mercy whispered long jack an hes been wid us all these trips hes clean bewitched  a schooners bell struck up alongside and a voice hailed through the fog o disko heard abaout the jennie cushman  they have found his son cried penn stand you still and see the salvation of the lord  got jason aboard here disko answered but his voice quavered therewarnt any one else  weve fund one though run acrost him snarled up in a mess o lumber thet might ha bin a focsle his heads cut some  who is he  the were heres heartbeats answered one another  guess its young olley the voice drawled  penn raised his hands and said something in german harvey could have sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face but the drawl went on saay you fellers guyed us considrable tother night  we dont feel like guyin any now said disko  i know it but to tell the honest truth we was kinderkinder driftin when we run agin young olley  it was the irrepressible carrie pitman and a roar of unsteady laughter went up from the deck of the were here  hednt you baouts well send the old man aboard were runnin in fer more bait an graoundtackle guess you wont want him anyway an this blame windlass work makes us shorthanded well take care of him he married my womans aunt  ill give you anything in the boat said troop  dont want nothin less mebbe an anchor thatll hold say young olleys gittin kinder baulky an excited send the old man along  penn waked him from his stupor of despair and tom platt rowed him over he went away without a word of thanks not knowing what was to come and the fog closed over all  and now said penn drawing a deep breath as though about to preach and nowthe erect body sank like a sword driven home into the scabbard the light faded from the overbright eyes the voice returned to its usual pitiful little titterand now said pennsylvania pratt do you think its too early for a little game of checkers mr salters  the very thingthe very thing i was goin to say myself cried salters promptly it beats all penn how you git on to whats in a mans mind  the little fellow blushed and meekly followed salters forward  up anchor hurry lets quit these crazy waters shouted disko and never was he more swiftly obeyed  now what in creation dye suppose is the meanin o that all said long jack when they were working through the fog once more damp dripping and bewildered  the way i sense it said disko at the wheel is this the jennie cushman business comin on an empty stummick  hewe saw one of them go by sobbed harvey  an that o course kinder hove him outer water julluk runnin a craft ashore hove him right aout i take it to rememberin johnstown an jacob boiler an suchlike reminiscences well consolin jason there held him up a piece sames shorin up a boat then bein weak them props slipped an slipped an he slided down the ways an naow hes waterborne agin thats haow i sense it  they decided that disko was entirely correct  twould ha bruk salters all up said long jack if penn had stayed jacob bollerin did ye see his face when penn asked who hed been charged on all these years how is ut salters  asleepdead asleep turned in like a child salters replied tiptoeing aft there wont be no grub till he wakes natural did ye ever see sech a gift in prayer he everlastinly hiked young olley outer the ocean thets my belief jason was turble praoud of his boy an i mistrusted all along twas a jedgment on worshippin vain idols  theres others jest as sot said disko  thats difrunt salters retorted quickly penns not all caulked an i aint only but doin my duty by him  they waited those hungry men three hours till penn reappeared with a smooth face and a blank mind he said he believed that he had been dreaming then he wanted to know why they were so silent and they could not tell him  disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days and when they could not go out turned them into the hold to stack the ships stores into smaller compass to make more room for the fish the packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the focsle stove and disko showed how there is great art in stowing cargo so as to bring a schooner to her best draft the crew were thus kept lively till they recovered their spirits and harvey was tickled with a ropes end by long jack for being as the galway man said sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat couldnt be helped he did a great deal of thinking in those dreary days and told dan what he thought and dan agreed with himeven to the extent of asking for fried pies instead of hooking them  but a week later the two nearly upset the hattie s in a wild attempt to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick the grim brute rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish and between the three of them it was a mercy they all got off alive  at last after playing blindmansbuff in the fog there came a morning when disko shouted down the focsle hurry boys were in taown    chapter viii  to the end of his days harvey will never forget that sight the sun was just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week and his low red light struck into the ridingsails of three fleets of anchored schoonersone to the north one to the westward and one to the south there must have been nearly a hundred of them of every possible make and build with far away a squarerigged frenchman all bowing and courtesying one to the other from every boat dories were dropping away like bees from a crowded hive and the clamour of voices the rattling of ropes and blocks and the splash of the oars carried for miles across the heaving water the sails turned all colours black pearlygrey and white as the sun mounted and more boats swung up through the mists to the southward  the dories gathered in clusters separated reformed and broke again all heading one way while men hailed and whistled and catcalled and sang and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard  its a town said harvey disko was right it is a town  ive seen smaller said disko theres about a thousand men here an yonders the virgin he pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea where there were no dories  the were here skirted round the northern squadron disko waving his hand to friend after friend and anchored as neatly as a racing yacht at the end of the season the bank fleet pass good seamanship in silence but a bungler is jeered all along the line  jest in time fer the caplin cried the mary chilton  salt most wet asked the king philip  hey tom platt come t supper tonight said the henry clay and so questions and answers flew back and forth men had met one another before doryfishing in the fog and there is no place for gossip like the bank fleet they all seemed to know about harveys rescue and asked if he were worth his salt yet the young bloods jested with dan who had a lively tongue of his own and inquired after their health by the townnicknames they least liked manuels countrymen jabbered at him in their own language and even the silent cook was seen riding the jibboom and shouting gaelic to a friend as black as himself after they had buoyed the cableall around the virgin is rocky bottom and carelessness means chafed groundtackle and danger from driftingafter they had buoyed the cable their dories went forth to join the mob of boats anchored about a mile away the schooners rocked and dipped at a safe distance like mother ducks watching their brood while the dories behaved like mannerless ducklings  as they drove into the confusion boat banging boat harveys ears tingled at the comments on his rowing every dialect from labrador to long island with portuguese neapolitan lingua franca french and gaelic with songs and shoutings and new oaths rattled round him and he seemed to be the butt of it all for the first time in his life he felt shyperhaps that came from living so long with only the were heresamong the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the reeling small craft a gentle breathing swell three furlongs from trough to barrel would quietly shoulder up a string of variously painted dories they hung for an instant a wonderful frieze against the skyline and their men pointed and hailed next moment the open mouths waving arms and bare chests disappeared while on another swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in a toy theatre so harvey stared watch out said dan flourishing a dipnet when i tell you dip you dip the caplinll school any time from naow on wherell we lay tom platt  pushing shoving and hauling greeting old friends here and warning old enemies there commodore tom platt led his little fleet well to leeward of the general crowd and immediately three or four men began to haul on their anchors with intent to leebow the were heres but a yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with exceeding speed its occupant pulling madly on the roding  give her slack roared twenty voices let him shake it out  whats the matter said harvey as the boat flashed away to the southward hes anchored isnt he  anchored sure enough but his graoundtackles kinder shifty said dan laughing whales fouled it    dip harve here they come  the sea round them clouded and darkened and then frizzed up in showers of tiny silver fish and over a space of five or six acres the cod began to leap like trout in may while behind the cod three or four broad greyblack backs broke the water into boils  then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the school and fouled his neighbours line and said what was in his heart and dipped furiously with his dipnet and shrieked cautions and advice to his companions while the deep fizzed like freshly opened sodawater and cod men and whales together flung in upon the luckless bait harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of dans net but in all the wild tumult he noticed and never forgot the wicked set little eyesomething like a circus elephants eyeof a whale that drove along almost level with the water and so he said winked at him three boats found their rodings fouled by these reckless midsea hunters and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the line free  then the caplin moved off and five minutes later there was no sound except the splash of the sinkers overside the flapping of the cod and the whack of the muckles as the men stunned them it was wonderful fishing harvey could see the glimmering cod below swimming slowly in droves biting as steadily as they swam bank law strictly forbids more than one hook on one line when the dories are on the virgin or the eastern shoals but so close lay the boats that even single hooks snarled and harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle hairy newfoundlander on one side and a howling portuguese on the other  worse than any tangle of fishinglines was the confusion of the doryrodings below water each man had anchored where it seemed good to him drifting and rowing round his fixed point as the fish struck on less quickly each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground but every third man found himself intimately connected with some four or five neighbours to cut anothers roding is crime unspeakable on the banks yet it was done and done without detection three or four times that day tom platt caught a maine man in the black act and knocked him over the gunwale with an oar and manuel served a fellowcountryman in the same way but harveys anchorline was cut and so was penns and they were turned into reliefboats to carry fish to the were here as the dories filled the caplin schooled once more at twilight when the mad clamour was repeated and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by the light of kerosenelamps on the edge of the pen  it was a huge pile and they went to sleep while they were dressing next day several boats fished right above the cap of the virgin and harvey with them looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock which rises to within twenty feet of the surface the cod were there in legions marching solemnly over the leathery kelp when they bit they bit all together and so when they stopped there was a slack time at noon and the dories began to search for amusement it was dan who sighted the hope of prague just coming up and as her boats joined the company they were greeted with the question whos the meanest man in the fleet  three hundred voices answered cheerily  nick braady it sounded an organ chant  who stole the lampwicks that was dans contribution  nick braady sang the boats  who biled the salt bait fer soup this was an unknown backbiter a quarter of a mile away  again the joyful chorus now brady was not especially mean but he had that reputation and the fleet made the most of it then they discovered a man from a truro boat who six years before had been convicted of using a tackle with five or six hooksa scrowger they call iton the shoals naturally he had been christened scrowger jim and though he had hidden himself on the georges ever since he found his honours waiting for him full blown they took it up in a sort of firecracker chorus jim o jim jim o jim sssscrowger jim that pleased everybody and when a poetical beverly manhe had been making it up all day and talked about it for weekssang the carrie pitmans anchor doesnt hold her for a cent the dories felt that they were indeed fortunate then they had to ask that beverly man how he was off for beans because even poets must not have things all their own way every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn was there a careless or dirty cook anywhere the dories sang about him and his food was a schooner badly found the fleet was told at full length had a man hooked tobacco from a messmate he was named in meeting the name tossed from roller to roller diskos infallible judgments long jacks marketboat that he had sold years ago dans sweetheart oh but dan was an angry boy penns bad luck with doryanchors salterss views on manure manuels little slips from virtue ashore and harveys ladylike handling of the oarall were laid before the public and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the sun the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing sentence  the dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the sea then they drew more apart to save their sides and some one called that if the swell continued the virgin would break a reckless galway man with his nephew denied this hauled up anchor and rowed over the very rock itself many voices called them to come away while others dared them to hold on as the smoothbacked rollers passed to the southward they hove the dory high and high into the mist and dropped her in ugly sucking dimpled water where she spun round her anchor within a foot or two of the hidden rock it was playing with death for mere bravado and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till long jack rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding  cant ye hear ut knockin he cried pull for your miserable lives pull  the men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted but the next swell checked a little like a man tripping on a carpet there was a deep sob and a gathering roar and the virgin flung up a couple of acres of foaming water white furious and ghastly over the shoal sea then all the boats greatly applauded long jack and the galway men held their tongue  aint it elegant said dan bobbing like a young seal at home shell break about once every haaf hour now less the swell piles up good whats her reglar time when shes at work tom platt  once ivry fifteen minutes to the tick harve youve seen the greatest thing on the banks an but for long jack youd seen some dead men too  there came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the schooners were ringing their bells a big bark nosed cautiously out of the mist and was received with shouts and cries of come along darlin from the irishry  another frenchman said harvey  haint you eyes shes a baltimore boat goin in fear an tremblin said dan well guy the very sticks out of her guess its the fust time her skipper ever met up with the fleet this way  she was a black buxom eighthundredton craft her mainsail was looped up and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was moving now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea and this tall hesitating creature with her white and gilt figurehead looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys that was very much her situation she knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the virgin had caught the roar of it and was therefore asking her way this is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories  the virgin fwhat are you talk in of this is le have on a sunday mornin go home an sober up  go home ye tarrapin go home an tell em were comin  half a dozen voices together in a most tuneful chorus as her stern went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs thayaahshestrikes  hard up hard up fer your life youre on top of her now  daown hard daown let go everything  all hands to the pumps  daown jib an pole her  here the skipper lost his temper and said things instantly fishing was suspended to answer him and he heard many curious facts about his boat and her next port of call they asked him if he were insured and whence he had stolen his anchor because they said it belonged to the carrie pitman they called his boat a mudscow and accused him of dumping garbage to frighten the fish they offered to tow him and charge it to his wife and one audacious youth slipped almost under the counter smacked it with his open palm and yelled gid up buck  the cook emptied a pan of ashes on him and he replied with codheads the barks crew fired small coal from the galley and the dories threatened to come aboard and razee her they would have warned her at once had she been in real peril but seeing her well clear of the virgin they made the most of their chances the fun was spoilt when the rock spoke again a halfmile to windward and the tormented bark set everything that would draw and went her ways but the dories felt that the honours lay with them  all that night the virgin roared hoarsely and next morning over an angry whiteheaded sea harvey saw the fleet with flickering masts waiting for a lead not a dory was hove out till ten oclock when the two jeraulds of the days eye imagining a lull which did not exist set the example in a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the cockly swells but troop kept the were heres at work dressingdown he saw no sense in dares and as the storm grew that evening they had the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any refuge in the gale the boys stood by the dorytackles with lanterns the men ready to haul one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would make them drop everything and hold on for the dear life out of the dark would come a yell of dory dory they would hook up and haul in a drenched man and a halfsunk boat till their decks were littered down with nests of dories and the bunks were full five times in their watch did harvey with dan jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the boom and cling with arms legs and teeth to rope and spar and sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks one dory was smashed to pieces and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks cutting his forehead open and about dawn when the racing seas glimmered white all along their cold edges another man blue and ghastly crawled in with a broken hand asking news of his brother seven extra mouths sat down to breakfast a swede a chatham skipper a boy from hancock maine one duxbury and three provincetown men  there was a general sorting out among the fleet next day and though no one said anything all ate with better appetites when boat after boat reported full crews aboard only a couple of portuguese and an old man from gloucester were drowned but many were cut or bruised and two schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward three days sail a man died on a frenchmanit was the same bark that had traded tobacco with the were heres she slipped away quite quietly one wet white morning moved to a patch of deep water her sails all hanging anyhow and harvey saw the funeral through diskos spyglass it was only an oblong bundle slid overside they did not seem to have any form of service but in the night at anchor harvey heard them across the starpowdered black water singing something that sounded like a hymn it went to a very slow tune  la brigantine qui va tourner roule et sincline pour mentrainer oh vierge marie pour moi priez dieu adieu patrie québec adieu  tom platt visited her because he said the dead man was his brother as a freemason it came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back the news spread like a flash for contrary to general custom the frenchman held an auction of the dead mans kithe had no friends at st malo or miquelonand everything was spread out on the top of the house from his red knitted cap to the leather belt with the sheathknife at the back dan and harvey were out on twentyfathom water in the hattie s and naturally rowed over to join the crowd it was a long pull and they stayed some little time while dan bought the knife which had a curious brass handle when they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of rain and a lop of sea it occurred to them that they might get into trouble for neglecting the lines guess twont hurt us any to be warmed up said dan shivering under his oilskins and they rowed on into the heart of a white fog which as usual dropped on them without warning  theres too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks he said heave over the anchor harve and well fish a piece till the thing lifts bend on your biggest lead three pound aint any too much in this water see how shes tightened on her rodin already  there was quite a little bubble at the bows where some irresponsible bank current held the dory full stretch on her rope but they could not see a boats length in any direction harvey turned up his collar and bunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator fog had no special terrors for him now they fished awhile in silence and found the cod struck on well then dan drew the sheathknife and tested the edge of it on the gunwale  thats a daisy said harvey how did you get it so cheap  on account o their blame cathlic superstitions said dan jabbing with the bright blade they dont fancy takin iron frum off of a dead man so to speak see them arichat frenchmen step back when i bid  but an auction aint taking anything off a dead man its business  we know it aint but theres no goin in the teeth o superstition thats one o the advantages o livin in a progressive country and dan began whistling  oh double thatcher how are you now eastern point comes inter view the girls an boys we soon shall see at anchor off cape ann  why didnt that eastport man bid then he bought his boots aint maine progressive  maine pshaw they dont know enough or they haint got money enough to paint their haouses in maine ive seen em the eastport man he told me that the knife had been usedso the french captain told himused up on the french coast last year  cut a man heaves the muckle harvey hauled in his fish rebaited and threw over  killed him course when i heard that i was keener n ever to get it  christmas i didnt know it said harvey turning round ill give you a dollar for it when iget my wages say ill give you two dollars  honest

dorymates and so on and so forth an so followin catch aholt  he held it out belt and all  but look at here dan i dont see  take it taint no use to me i wish you to hev it  the temptation was irresistible dan youre a white man said harvey ill keep it as long as i live  thats good hearin said dan with a pleasant laugh and then anxious to change the subject looks if your line was fast to somethin  fouled i guess said harve tugging before he pulled up he fastened the belt round him and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath click on the thwart concern the thing he cried she acts as though she were on strawberrybottom its all sand here aint it  dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak holibutll act that way f hes sulky thets no strawberrybottom yank her once or twice she gives sure guess wed better haul up an make certain  they pulled together making fast at each turn on the cleats and the hidden weight rose sluggishly  prize oh haul shouted dan but the shout ended in a shrill double shriek of horror for out of the sea camethe body of the dead frenchman buried two days before the hook had caught him under the right armpit and he swayed erect and horrible head and shoulders above water his arms were tied to his side andhe had no face the boys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory and there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside held on the shortened line  the tidethe tide brought him said harvey with quivering lips as he fumbled at the clasp of the belt  oh lord oh harve groaned dan be quick hes come for it let him have it take it off  i dont want it i dont want it cried harvey i cant find the bubuckle  quick harve hes on your line  harvey sat up to unfasten the belt facing the head that had no face under its streaming hair hes fast still he whispered to dan who slipped out his knife and cut the line as harvey flung the belt far overside the body shot down with a plop and dan cautiously rose to his knees whiter than the fog  he come for it he come for it ive seen a stale one hauled up on a trawl and i didnt much care but he come to us special  i wishi wish i hadnt taken the knife then hed have come on your line  dunno as thet would ha made any differ were both scared out o ten years growth oh harve did ye see his head  did i ill never forget it but look at here dan it couldnt have been meant it was only the tide  tide he come for it harve why they sunk him six mile to southard o the fleet an were two miles from where shes lyin now they told me he was weighted with a fathom an a half o chaincable  wonder what he did with the knifeup on the french coast  something bad guess hes bound to take it with him to the judgment an sowhat are you doin with the fish  heaving em overboard said harvey  what for we shant eat em  i dont care i had to look at his face while i was takin the belt off you can keep your catch if you like ive no use for mine  dan said nothing but threw his fish over again  guess its best to be on the safe side he murmured at last id give a months pay if this fog ud lift things go abaout in a fog that ye dont see in clear weatheryohoes an hollerers and such like im sorter relieved he come the way he did instid o walkin he might ha walked  doont dan were right on top of him now wish i was safe aboard bein pounded by uncle salters  theyll be lookin fer us in a little gimme the tooter dan took the tin dinnerhorn but paused before he blew  go on said harvey i dont want to stay here all night  question is haow hed take it there was a man frum down the coast told me once he was in a schooner where they darsent ever blow a horn to the dories becaze the skippernot the man he was with but a captain that had run her five years beforehed drownded a boy alongside in a drunk fit an ever after that boy hed row alongside too and shout dory dory with the rest  dory dory a muffled voice cried through the fog they cowered again and the horn dropped from dans hand  hold on cried harvey its the cook  dunno what made me think o thet fool tale either said dan its the doctor sure enough  dan danny oooh dan harve harvey oooh haarveee  were here sung both boys together they heard oars but could see nothing till the cook shining and dripping rowed into them  what iss happened said he you will be beaten at home  thets what we want thets what were sufferin for said dan anything homeys good enough fer us weve had kinder depressin company as the cook passed them a line dan told him the tale  yess he come for hiss knife was all he said at the end  never had the little rocking were here looked so deliciously homelike as when the cook born and bred in fogs rowed them back to her there was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying smell of food forward and it was heavenly to hear disko and the others all quite alive and solid leaning over the rail and promising them a firstclass pounding but the cook was a black master of strategy he did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more striking points of the tale explaining as he backed and bumped round the counter how harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck so the boys came overside as rather uncanny heroes and every one asked them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble little penn delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions but public opinion was against him and in favour of long jack who told the most excruciating ghoststories to nearly midnight under that influence no one except salters and penn said anything about idolatry when the cook put a lighted candle a cake of flour and water and a pinch of salt on a shingle and floated them out astern to keep the frenchman quiet in case he was still restless dan lit the candle because he had bought the belt and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he could see the ducking point of flame  said harvey to dan as they turned in after watch how about progress and catholic superstitions  huh i guess im as enlightened and progressive as the next man but when it comes to a dead st malo deckhand scarin a couple o pore boys stiff fer the sake of a thirtycent knife why then the cook can take hold fer all o me i mistrust furriners livin or dead  next morning all except the cook were rather ashamed of the ceremonies and went to work double tides speaking gruffly to one another  the were here was racing neck and neck for her last few loads against the parry norman and so close was the struggle that the fleet took sides and betted tobacco all hands worked at the lines or dressingdown till they fell asleep where they stoodbeginning before dawn and ending when it was too dark to see they even used the cook as pitcher and turned harvey into the hold to pass salt while dan helped to dress down luckily a parry norman man sprained his ankle falling down the focsle and the were heres gained harvey could not see how one more fish could be crammed into her but disko and tom platt stowed and stowed and planked the mass down with big stones from the ballast and there was always jest another days work disko did not tell them when all the salt was wetted he rolled to the lazarette aft the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail this was at ten in the morning the ridingsail was down and the main and topsail were up by noon and dories came alongside with letters for home envying their good fortune at last she cleared decks hoisted her flagas is the right of the first boat off the banksupanchored and began to move disko pretended that he wished to accommodate folk who had not sent in their mail and so worked her gracefully in and out among the schooners in reality that was his little triumphant procession and for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was dans accordion and tom platts fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse you must not sing till all the salt is wet    hih yih yoho   send your letters raound   all our salt is wetted an the anchors off the graound   bend oh bend your mainsl were back to yankeeland   with fifteen hunder quintal   an fifteen hunder quintal   teen hunder toppin quintal   twix old queereau an grand  the last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal and the gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolk and owners while the were here finished the musical ride through the fleet her headsails quivering like a mans hand when he raises it to say goodbye  harvey very soon discovered that the were here with her ridingsail strolling from berth to berth and the were here headed west by south under home canvas were two very different boats there was a bite and kick to the wheel even in boys weather he could feel the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy  disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails and when those were flattened like a racing yachts dan had to wait on the big topsail which was put over by hand every time she went about in spare moments they pumped for the packed fish dripped brine which does not improve a cargo but since there was no fishing harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view the lowsided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings they saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell and usually she was elbowing fidgeting and coaxing her steadfast way through grey greyblue or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger waterhill it was as if she said you wouldnt hurt me surely im only the little were here then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle the dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it and harvey being anything but dull began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wavetops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purpleblue cloudshadows the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise the folding and packing away of the morning mists wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors the salty glare and blaze of noon the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead flat square miles the chilly blackening of everything at the days end and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight when the jibboom solemnly poked at the low stars and harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook  but the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together tom platt within hail and she cuddled her leerail down to the crashing blue and kept a little homemade rainbow arching unbroken over her windlass then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts and the sheets creaked and the sails filled with roaring and when she slid into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress and came out her jib wet halfway up yearning and peering for the tall twinlights of thatchers island  they left the cold grey of the bank sea saw the lumberships making for quebec by the straits of st lawrence with the jersey saltbrigs from spain and sicily found a friendly northeaster off artimon bank that drove them within view of the east light of sable islanda sight disko did not linger overand stayed with them past western and le have to the northern fringe of georges from there they picked up the deeper water and let her go merrily  hatties pulling on the string dan confided to harvey hattie an ma next sunday youll be hirin a boy to throw water on the windows to make ye go to sleep guess youll keep with us till your folks come do you know the best of gettin ashore again  hot bath said harvey his eyebrows were all white with dried spray  thats good but a nightshirts better ive been dreamin o nightshirts ever since we bent our mainsail ye can wiggle your toes then mall hev a new one fer me all washed soft its home harve its home ye can sense it in the air were runnin into the aidge of a hot wave naow an i can smell the bayberries wonder if well get in fer supper port a trifle  the hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep smoothed out blue and oily round them when they whistled for a wind only the rain came in spiky rods bubbling and drumming and behind the rain the thunder and the lightning of midaugust they lay on the deck with bare feet and arms telling one another what they would order at their first meal ashore for now the land was in plain sight a gloucester swordfishboat drifted alongside a man in the little pulpit on the bowsprit flourishing his harpoon his bare head plastered down with the wet and alls well he sang cheerily as though he were watch on a big liner wouvermans waiting fer you disko whats the news o the fleet  disko shouted it and passed on while the wild summer storm pounded overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four different quarters at once it gave the low circle of hills round gloucester harbour ten pound island the fishsheds with the broken line of houseroofs and each spar and buoy on the water in blinding photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the were here crawled in on halfflood and the whistlingbuoy moaned and mourned behind her then the storm died out in long separated vicious dags of bluewhite flame followed by a single roar like the roar of a mortarbattery and the shaken air tingled under the stars as it got back to silence  the flag the flag said disko suddenly pointing upward  what is ut said long jack  otto haaf mast they can see us frum shore now  id clean forgot hes no folk to gloucester has he  girl he was goin to be married to this fall  mary pity her said long jack and lowered the little flag halfmast for the sake of otto swept overboard in a gale off le have three months before  disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the were here to wouvermans wharf giving his orders in whispers while she swung round moored tugs and nightwatchmen hailed her from the ends of inkyblack piers over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession harvey could feel the land close round him once more with all its thousands of people asleep and the smell of earth after rain and the familiar noise of a switchingengine coughing to herself in a freightyard and all those things made his heart beat and his throat dry up as he stood by the foresheet they heard the anchorwatch snoring on a lighthousetug nosed into a pocket of darkness where a lantern glimmered on either side somebody waked with a grunt threw them a rope and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great ironroofed sheds full of warm emptiness and lay there without a sound  then harvey sat down by the wheel and sobbed and sobbed as though his heart would break and a tall woman who had been sitting on a weighscale dropped down into the schooner and kissed dan once on the cheek for she was his mother and she had seen the were here by the lightningflashes she took no notice of harvey till he had recovered himself a little and disko had told her his story then they went to diskos house together as the dawn was breaking and until the telegraph office was open and he could wire to his folk harvey cheyne was perhaps the loneliest boy in all america but the curious thing was that disko and dan seemed to think none the worse of him for crying  wouverman was not ready for diskos prices till disko sure that the were here was at least a week ahead of any other gloucester boat had given him a few days to swallow them so all hands played about the streets and long jack stopped the rocky neck trolley on principle as he said till the conductor let him ride free but dan went about with his freckled nose in the air bungful of mystery and most haughty to his family  dan ill hev to lay inter you ef you act this way said troop pensively sence weve come ashore this time youve bin a heap too fresh  id lay into him naow ef he was mine said uncle salters sourly he and penn boarded with the troops  oho said dan shuffling with the accordion round the backyard ready to leap the fence if the enemy advanced dad youre welcome to your own jedgment but remember ive warned ye your own flesh an blood ha warned ye taint any o my fault ef youre mistook but ill be on deck to watch ye an ez fer yeou uncle salters pharaohs chief butler aint in it longside o you you watch aout an wait youll be ploughed under like your own blamed clover but medan troopill flourish like a green baytree because i warnt stuck on my own opinion  disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful carpetslippers youre gettin ez crazy as poor harve you two go araound gigglin an squinchin an kickin each other under the table till theres no peace in the haouse said he  theres goin to be a heap lessfer some folks dan replied you wait an see  he and harvey went out on the trolley to east gloucester where they tramped through the bayberrybushes to the lighthouse and lay down on the big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry harvey had shown dan a telegram and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst  harves folk said dan with an unruffled face after supper well i guess they dont amount to much of anything or wed ha heard frum em by naow his pop keeps a kind o store out west maybe hell give yous much as five dollars dad  what did i tell ye said salters dont sputter over your vittles dan    chapter ix  whatever his private sorrows may be a multimillionaire like any other workingman should keep abreast of his business harvey cheyne senior had gone east late in june to meet a woman broken down half mad who dreamed day and night of her son drowning in the grey seas he had surrounded her with doctors trained nurses massagewomen and even faithcure companions but they were useless mrs cheyne lay still and moaned or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would listen hope she had none and who could offer it all she needed was assurance that drowning did not hurt and her husband watched to guard lest she should make the experiment of his own sorrow he spoke littlehardly realised the depth of it till he caught himself asking the calendar on his writingdesk whats the use of going on  there had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that some day when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left college he would take his son to his heart and lead him into his possessions then that boy he argued as busy fathers do would instantly become his companion partner and ally and there would follow splendid years of great works carried out togetherthe old head backing the young fire now his boy was deadlost at sea as it might have been a swede sailor from one of cheynes big teaships the wife was dying or worse he himself was trodden down by platoons of women and doctors and maids and attendants worried almost beyond endurance by the shift and change of her poor restless whims hopeless with no heart to meet his many enemies  he had taken the wife to his raw new palace in san diego where she and her people occupied a wing of great price and cheyne in a verandahroom between a secretary and a typewriter who was also a telegraphist toiled along wearily from day to day there was a war of rates among four western railroads in which he was supposed to be interested a devastating strike had developed in his lumbercamps in oregon and the legislature of the state of california which has no love for its makers was preparing open war against him  ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered and have waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign but now he sat limply his soft black hat pushed forward on to his nose his big body shrunk inside his loose clothes staring at his boots or the chinese junks in the bay and assenting absently to the secretarys questions as he opened the saturday mail  cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull out he carried huge insurances could buy himself royal annuities and between one of his places in colorado and a little society that would do the wife good say in washington and the south carolina islands a man might forget plans that had come to nothing on the other hand  the click of the typewriter stopped the girl was looking at the secretary who had turned white  he passed cheyne a telegram repeated from san francisco  picked up by fishing schooner were here having fallen off boat great times on banks fishing all well waiting gloucester mass care disko troop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is mama harvey n cheyne  the father let it fall laid his head down on the rollertop of the shut desk and breathed heavily the secretary ran for mrs cheynes doctor who found cheyne pacing to and fro  whatwhat dyou think of it is it possible is there any meaning to it i cant quite make it out he cried  i can said the doctor i lose seven thousand a yearthats all he thought of the struggling new york practice he had dropped at cheynes imperious bidding and returned the telegram with a sigh  you mean youd tell her maybe a fraud  whats the motive said the doctor coolly detections too certain its the boy sure enough  enter a french maid impudently as an indispensable one who is kept on only by large wages  mrs cheyne she say you must come at once she think you are seek  the master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed suzanne and a thin high voice on the upper landing of the great whitewood square staircase cried what is it what has happened  no doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house a moment later when her husband blurted out the news  and thats all right said the doctor serenely to the typewriter about the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is that joy dont kill miss kinzey  i know it but weve a heap to do first miss kinzey was from milwaukee somewhat direct of speech and as her fancy leaned towards the secretary she divined there was work in hand he was looking earnestly at the vast rollermap of america on the wall  milsom were going right across private car straight throughboston fix the connections shouted cheyne down the staircase  i thought so  the secretary turned to the typewriter and their eyes met out of that was born a storynothing to do with this story she looked inquiringly doubtful of his resources he signed to her to move to the morse as a general brings brigades into action then he swept his hand musicianwise through his hair regarded the ceiling and set to work while miss kinzeys white fingers called up the continent of america  k h wade los angelesthe constance is at los angeles isnt she miss kinzey  yep miss kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his watch  ready send constance private car here and arrange for special to leave here sunday in time to connect with new york limited at sixteenth street chicago tuesday next  clickclickclick

appointed hour he found miss kinzey laughing over the keys then milsom laughed too for the frantic clicks from los angeles ran we want to know whywhywhy general uneasiness developed and spreading  ten minutes later chicago appealed to miss kinzey in these words if crime of century is maturing please warn friends in time we are all getting to cover here  this was capped by a message from topeka and wherein topeka was concerned even milsom could not guess dont shoot colonel well come down  cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the telegrams were laid before him they think were on the warpath tell em we dont feel like fighting just now milsom tell em what were going for i guess you and miss kinzey had better come along though it isnt likely i shall do any business on the road tell em the truthfor once  so the truth was told miss kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the secretary added the memorable quotation let us have peace and in boardrooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixtythree million dollars worth of variously manipulated railroad interests breathed more freely cheyne was flying to meet the only son so miraculously restored to him the bear was seeking his cub not the bulls hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial lives put away the weapons and wished him godspeed while half a dozen panicsmitten tinpot roads perked up their heads and spoke of the wonderful things they would have done had not cheyne buried the hatchet  it was a busy weekend among the wires for now that their anxiety was removed men and cities hastened to accommodate los angeles called to san diego and barstow that the southern california engineers might know and be ready in their lonely roundhouses barstow passed the word to the atlantic and pacific the albuquerque flung it the whole length of the atchison topeka and santa fe management even into chicago an engine combinationcar with crew and the great and gilded constance private car were to be expedited over those two thousand three hundred and fifty miles the train would take precedence of one hundred and seventyseven others meeting and passing despatches and crews of every one of those said trains must be notified sixteen locomotives sixteen engineers and sixteen firemen would be neededeach and every one the best available two and one half minutes would be allowed for changing engines three for watering and two for coaling warn the men and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly for harvey cheyne is in a hurry a hurrya hurry sang the wires forty miles an hour will be expected and division superintendents will accompany this special over their respective divisions from san diego to sixteenth street chicago let the magic carpet be laid down hurry oh hurry  it will be hot said cheyne as they rolled out of san diego in the dawn of sunday were going to hurry mama just as fast as ever we can but i really dont think theres any good of your putting on your bonnet and gloves yet youd much better lie down and take your medicine id play you a game o dominoes but its sunday  ill be good oh i will be good onlytaking off my bonnet makes me feel as if wed never get there  try to sleep a little mama and well be in chicago before you know  but its boston father tell them to hurry  the sixfoot drivers were hammering their way to san bernardino and the mohave wastes but this was no grade for speed that would come later the heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned east to the needles and the colorado river the car cracked in the utter drought and glare and they put crushed ice to mrs cheynes neck and toiled up the long long grades past ash fork towards flagstaff where the forests and quarries are under the dry remote skies the needle of the speedindicator flicked and wagged to and fro the cinders rattled on the roof and a whirl of dust sucked after the whirling wheels the crew of the combination sat on their bunks panting in their shirtsleeves and cheyne found himself among them shouting old old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows above the roar of the car he told them about his son and how the sea had given up its dead and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him asked after her back there and whether she could stand it if the engineer let her out a piece and cheyne thought she could accordingly the great firehorse was let out from flagstaff to winslow till a division superintendent protested  but mrs cheyne in the boudoir stateroom where the french maid sallowwhite with fear clung to the silver doorhandle only moaned a little and begged her husband to bid them hurry and so they dropped the dry sands and moonstruck rocks of arizona behind them and grilled on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brakehose told them they were at coolidge by the continental divide three bold and experienced mencool confident and dry when they began white quivering and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible wheelsswung her over the great lift from albuquerque to glorietta and beyond springer up and up to the raton tunnel on the state line whence they dropped rocking into la junta had sight of the arkansaw and tore down the long slope to dodge city where cheyne took comfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead  there was very little talk in the car the secretary and typewriter sat together on the stamped spanishleather cushions by the plateglass observationwindow at the rear end watching the surge and ripple of the ties crowded back behind them and it is believed making notes of the scenery cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant gorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination an unlit cigar in his teeth till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal enemy and did their best to entertain him  at night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all the luxuries and they fared sumptuously swinging on through the emptiness of abject desolation now they heard the swish of a watertank and the guttural voice of a chinaman the clinkclink of hammers that tested the krupp steel wheels and the oath of a tramp chased off the rear platform now the solid crash of coal shot into the tender and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a waiting train now they looked out into great abysses a trestle purring beneath their tread or up to rocks that barred out half the stars now scaur and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the horizons edge and now broke into hills lower and lower till at last came the true plains  at dodge city an unknown hand threw in a copy of a kansas paper containing some sort of an interview with harvey who had evidently fallen in with an enterprising reporter telegraphed on from boston the joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy and it soothed mrs cheyne for a while her one word hurry was conveyed by the crews to the engineers at nickerson topeka and marceline where the grades are easy and they brushed the continent behind them towns and villages were close together now and a man could feel here that he moved among people  i cant see the dial and my eyes ache so what are we doing  the very best we can mama theres no sense in getting in before the limited wed only have to wait  i dont care i want to feel were moving sit down and tell me the miles  cheyne sat down and read the dial for her there were some miles which stand for records to this day but the seventyfoot car never changed its long steamerlike roll moving through the heat with the hum of a giant bee yet the speed was not enough for mrs cheyne and the heat the remorseless august heat was making her giddy the clockhands would not move and when oh when would they be in chicago  it is not true that as they changed engines at fort madison cheyne passed over to the amalgamated brotherhood of locomotive engineers an endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on equal terms for evermore he paid his obligations to engineers and firemen as he believed they deserved and only his bank knows what he gave the crews who had sympathised with him it is on record that the last crew took entire charge of switching operations at sixteenth street because she was in a doze at last and heaven was to help any one who bumped her  now the highly paid specialist who conveys the lake shore and michigan southern limited from chicago to elkhart is something of an autocrat and he does not approve of being told how to back up to a car none the less he handled the constance as if she might have been a load of dynamite and when the crew rebuked him they did it in whispers and dumb show  pshaw said the atchison topeka and santa fe men discussing life later we werent runnin for a record harvey cheynes wife she were sick back an we didnt want to jounce her come to think of it our runnin time from san diego to chicago was 5754 you can tell that to them eastern waytrains when were tryin for a record well let you know  to the western man though this would not please either city chicago and boston are cheek by jowl and some railroads encourage the delusion the limited whirled the constance into buffalo and the arms of the new york central and hudson river illustrious magnates with white whiskers and gold charms on their watchchains boarded her here to talk a little business to cheyne who slid her gracefully into albany where the boston and albany completed the run from tidewater to tidewatertotal time eightyseven hours and thirtyfive minutes or three days fifteen hours and one half harvey was waiting for them  after violent emotion most people and all boys demand food they feasted the returned prodigal behind drawn curtains cut off in their great happiness while the trains roared in and out around them harvey ate drank and enlarged on his adventures all in one breath and when he had a hand free his mother fondled it his voice was thickened with living in the open salt air his palms were rough and hard his wrists dotted with the marks of gurrysores and a fine full flavour of codfish hung round rubber boots and blue jersey  the father well used to judging men looked at him keenly he did not know what enduring harm the boy might have taken indeed he caught himself thinking that he knew very little whatever of his son but he distinctly remembered an unsatisfied doughfaced youth who took delight in calling down the old man and reducing his mother to tearssuch a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel piazzas where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or revile the bellboys but this well setup fisheryouth did not wriggle looked at him with eyes steady clear and unflinching and spoke in a tone distinctly even startlingly respectful there was that in his voice too which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent and that the new harvey had come to stay  some ones been coercing him thought cheyne now constance would never have allowed that dont see as europe could have done it any better  but why didnt you tell this man troop who you were the mother repeated when harvey had expanded his story at least twice  disko troop dear the best man that ever walked a deck i dont care who the next is  why didnt you tell him to put you ashore you know papa would have made it up to him ten times over  i know it but he thought i was crazy im afraid i called him a thief because i couldnt find the bills in my pocket  a sailor found them by the flagstaff thatthat night sobbed mrs cheyne  that explains it then i dont blame troop any i just said i wouldnt workon a banker tooand of course he hit me on the nose and oh i bled like a stuck hog  my poor darling they must have abused you horribly  dunno quite well after that i saw a light  cheyne slapped his leg and chuckled this was going to be a boy after his own hungry heart he had never seen precisely that twinkle in harveys eye before  and the old man gave me ten and a half a month hes paid me half now and i took hold with dan and pitched right in i cant do a mans work yet but i can handle a dory most as well as dan and i dont get rattled in a fogmuch and i can take my trick in light windsthats steering dearand i can most bait up a trawl and i know my ropes of course and i can pitch fish till the cows come home and im great on old josephus and ill show you how i can clear coffee with a piece of fishskin andi think ill have another cup please say youve no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month  i began with eight and a half my son said cheyne  that so you never told me sir  you never asked harve ill tell you about it some day if you care to listen try a stuffed olive  troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how the next man gets his vittles its great to have a trimmedup meal again we were well fed though best mug on the banks disko fed us firstclass hes a great man and danthats his sondans my partner and theres uncle salters and his manures an he reads josephus hes sure im crazy yet and theres poor little penn and he is crazy you mustnt talk to him about johnstown becauseand oh you must know tom platt and long jack and manuel manuel saved my life im sorry hes a portugee he cant talk much but hes an everlasting musician he found me struck adrift and drifting and hauled me in  i wonder your nervous system isnt completely wrecked said mrs cheyne  what for mama i worked like a horse and i ate like a hog and i slept like a dead man  that was too much for mrs cheyne who began to think of her visions of a corpse rocking on the salty seas she went to her stateroom and harvey curled up beside his father explaining his indebtedness  you can depend upon me to do everything i can for the crowd harve they seem to be good men on your showing  best in the fleet sir ask at gloucester said harvey but disko believes still hes cured me of being crazy dans the only one ive let on to about you and our private cars and all the rest of it and im not quite sure dan believes i want to paralyse em tomorrow say cant they run the constance over to gloucester mama dont look fit to be moved anyway and were bound to finish cleaning out by tomorrow wouverman takes our fish you see were first off the banks this season and its four twentyfive a quintal we held out till he paid it they want it quick  you mean youll have to work tomorrow then  i told troop i would im on the scales ive brought the tallies with me he looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that made his father choke there isnt but threenotwo ninetyfour or five quintal more by my reckoning  hire a substitute suggested cheyne to see what harvey would say  cant sir im tallyman for the schooner troop says ive a better head for figures than dan troops a mighty just man  well suppose i dont move the constance tonight howll you fix it  harvey looked at the clock which marked twenty past eleven  then ill sleep here till three and catch the four oclock freight they let us men from the fleet ride free as a rule  thats a notion but i think we can get the constance around about as soon as your mens freight better go to bed now  harvey spread himself on the sofa kicked off his boots and was asleep before his father could shade the electrics cheyne sat watching the young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead and among many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might perhaps have been neglectful as a father  one never knows when ones taking ones biggest risks he said it might have been worse than drowning but i dont think it hasi dont think it has if it hasnt i havent enough to pay troop thats all and i dont think it has  morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows the constance was sidetracked among freightcars at gloucester and harvey had gone to his business  then hell fall overboard again and be drowned the mother said bitterly  well go and look ready to throw him a rope in case youve never seen him working for his bread said the father  what nonsense as if any one expected  well the man that hired him did hes about right too  they went down between the stores full of fishermens oilskins to wouvermans wharf where the were here rode high her bank flag still flying all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light disko stood by the main hatch superintending manuel penn and uncle salters at the tackle dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as long jack and tom platt filled them and harvey with a notebook represented the skippers interests before the clerk of the scales on the saltsprinkled wharfedge  ready cried the voices below haul cried disko hi said manuel here said dan swinging the basket then they heard harveys voice clear and fresh checking the weights  the last of the fish had been whipped out and harvey leaped from the stringpiece six feet to a ratline as the shortest way to hand disko the tally shouting two ninetyseven and an empty hold  whats total harve said disko  eight sixtyfive three thousand six hundred and seventysix dollars and a quarter wish id share as well as wage  well i wont go so far as to say you hevnt deserved it harve dont you want to slip up to wouvermans office and take him our tallies  whos that boy said cheyne to dan well used to all manner of questions from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders  well hes a kind o supercargo was the answer we picked him up struck adrift on the banks fell overboard from a liner he sez he was a passenger hes by way o bein a fisherman now  is he worth his keep  yeep dad this man wants to know ef harves worth his keep say would you like to go aboard well fix a ladder for her  i should very much indeed twont hurt you mama and youll be able to see for yourself  the woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the ladder and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft  be you anyways interested in harve said disko  well yees  hes a good boy an ketches right hold jest as hes bid youve heard haow we found him he was sufferin from nervous prostration i guess r else his head had hit somethin when we hauled him aboard hes all over that naow yes this is the cabin taint anyways in order but youre quite welcome to look around those are his figures on the stovepipe where we keep the reckonin mostly  did he sleep here said mrs cheyne sitting on a yellow locker and surveying the disorderly bunks  no he berthed forward madam an only fer him an my boy hookin fried pies an muggin up when they ought to ha been asleep i dunno as ive any special fault to find with him  there werent nothin wrong with harve said uncle salters descending the steps he hung my boots on the maintruck and he aint over an above respectful to such as knows moren he do especially about farmin but he were mostly misled by dan  dan in the meantime profiting by dark hints from harvey early that morning was executing a wardance on deck tom tom he whispered down the hatch his folks has come an dad haint caught on yet an theyre powwowin in the cabin shes a daisy an hes all harve claimed he was by the looks of him  howly smoke said long jack climbing out covered with salt and fishskin dye belave his tale av the kid an the little fourhorse rig was thrue  i knew it all along said dan come an see dad mistook in his judgments  they came delightedly just in time to hear cheyne say im glad he has a good character becausehes my son  diskos jaw felllong jack always vowed that he heard the click of itand he stared alternately at the man and the woman  i got his telegram in san diego four days ago and we came over  in a private car said dan he said ye might  in a private car of course  dan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks  there was a tale he tould us av drivin four little ponies in a rig av his own said long jack was that thrue now  very likely said cheyne was it mama  he had a little drag when we were in toledo i think said the mother  long jack whistled oh disko said he and that was all  i wuzi am mistook in my jedgmentsworsen the men o marblehead said disko as though the words were being windlassed out of him i dont mind ownin to you mister cheyne as i mistrusted the boy to be crazy he talked kinder odd about money  so he told me  did he tell ye anything else cause i pounded him once this with a somewhat anxious glance at mrs cheyne  oh yes cheyne replied i should say it probably did him more good than anything else in the world  i jedged twuz necessary er i wouldnt ha done it i dont want you to think we abuse our boys any on this packet  i dont think you do mr troop  mrs cheyne had been looking at the facesdiskos ivoryyellow hairless iron countenance uncle salterss with its rim of agricultural hair penns bewildered simplicity manuels quiet smile long jacks grin of delight and tom platts scar rough by her standards they certainly were but she had a mothers wits in her eyes and she rose with outstretched hands  oh tell me which is who said she half sobbing i want to thank you and bless youall of you  faith that pays me a hunder time said long jack  disko introduced them all in due form the captain of an oldtime chinaman could have done no better and mrs cheyne babbled incoherently she nearly threw herself into manuels arms when she understood that he had first found harvey  but how shall i leave him dreeft said poor manuel what do you yourself if you find him so eh whaat we are in one good boy and i am ever so pleased he come to be your son  and he told me dan was his partner she cried dan was already sufficiently pink but he turned a rich crimson when mrs cheyne kissed him on both cheeks before the assembly then they led her forward to show her the focsle at which she wept again and must needs go down to see harveys identical bunk and there she found the nigger cook cleaning up the stove and he nodded as though she were some one he had expected to meet for years they tried two at a time to explain the boats daily life to her and she sat by the pawlpost her gloved hands on the greasy table laughing with trembling lips and crying with dancing eyes  and whos ever to use the were here after this said long jack to tom platt i feel it as if shed made a cathedral av ut all  cathedral sneered tom platt oh ef it had bin even the fish cmmission boat instid o this ballyhoo o blazes ef we only hed some decency an order an sideboys when she goes over shell have to climb that ladder like a hen an wewe ought to be mannin the yards  then harvey was not mad said penn slowly to cheyne  no indeedthank god the big millionaire replied stooping down tenderly  it must be terrible to be mad except to lose your child i do not know anything more terrible but your child has come back let us thank god for that  hello said harvey looking down upon them benignly from the wharf  i wuz mistook harve i wuz mistook said disko swiftly holding up a hand i wuz mistook in my jedgments ye neednt rub it in any more  guess ill take care o that said dan under his breath  youll be goin off naow wont ye  well not without the balance of my wages less you want to have the were here attached  thets so id clean forgot and he counted out the remaining dollars you done all you contracted to do harve and you done it baouts well as ef youd been brought up here disko brought himself up he did not quite see where the sentence was going to end  outside of a private car suggested dan wickedly  come on and ill show her to you said harvey  cheyne stayed to talk to disko but the others made a procession to the depot with mrs cheyne at the head the french maid shrieked at the invasion and harvey laid the glories of the constance before them without a word they took them in in equal silencestamped leather silver doorhandles and rails cut velvet plateglass nickel bronze hammered iron and the rare woods of the continent inlaid  i told you said harvey i told you this was his crowning revenge and a most ample one  mrs cheyne decreed a meal and that nothing might be lacking to the tale long jack told afterwards in his boardinghouse she waited on them herself men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling gales have curiously neat and finished tablemanners but mrs cheyne who did not know this was surprised she longed to have manuel for a butler so silently and easily did he comport himself among the frail glassware and dainty silver tom platt remembered great days on the ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers and long jack being irish supplied the small talk till all were at their ease  in the were heres cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind their cigars cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom he could not offer money equally well he knew that no money could pay for what disko had done he kept his own counsel and waited for an opening  i hevnt done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep make him work a piece an learn him how to handle the hogyoke said disko he has twice my boys head for figgers  by the way cheyne answered casually what dyou calculate to make of your boy  disko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin dans jest plain boy an he dont allow me to do any of his thinkin hell hev this able little packet when im laid by he aint noways anxious to quit the business i know that  mmm ever been west mr troop  bins fer ez noo york once in a boat ive no use for railroads no more hez dan salt waters good enough fer the troops ive been most

piece with me well go to my house an talk this to my woman ive bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments it dont seem to me this was like to be real  they went over to troops eighteenhundreddollar bluetrimmed white house with a retired dory full of nasturtiums in the front yard and a shuttered parlor which was a museum of oversea plunder there sat a large woman silent and grave with the dim eyes of those who look long to sea for the return of their beloved cheyne addressed himself to her and she gave consent wearily  we lose one hundred a year from gloucester only mr cheyne she saidone hundred boys an men and ive come sos to hate the sea as if twuz alive an listenin god never made it fer humans to anchor on these packets o yours they go straight out i take it and straight home again  as straight as the winds let em and i give a bonus for record passages tea dont improve by being at sea  when he wuz little he used to play at keeping store an i had hopes he might follow that up but soons he could paddle a dory i knew that were goin to be denied me  theyre squareriggers mother ironbuilt an well found remember what phils sister reads you when she gits his letters  ive never known as phil told lies but hes too venturesome like most of em that use the sea ef dan sees fit mr cheyne he can gofer all o me  she jest despises the ocean disko explained an ii dunno haow to act polite i guess er id thank you better  my fathermy own eldest brothertwo nephewsan my second sisters man she said dropping her head on her hand would you care fer any one that took all those  cheyne was relieved when dan turned up and accepted with more delight than he was able to put into words indeed the offer meant a plain and sure road to all desirable things but dan thought most of commanding watch on broad decks and looking into faraway harbours  mrs cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable manuel in the matter of harveys rescue he seemed to have no desire for money pressed hard he said that he would take five dollars because he wanted to buy something for a girl otherwisehow shall i take money when i make so easy my eats and smokes you will giva some if i like or no eh whaat then you shall giva me money but not that way you shall giva all you can think he introduced her to a snuffy portuguese priest with a list of semidestitute widows as long as his cassock as a strict unitarian mrs cheyne could not sympathise with the creed but she ended by respecting the brown voluble little man  manuel faithful son of the church appropriated all the blessings showered on her for her charity that letta me out said he i have now ver good absolutions for six months and he strolled forth to get a handkerchief for the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all the others  salters went west for a season with penn and left no address behind he had a dread that these millionary people with wasteful private cars might take undue interest in his companion it was better to visit inland relatives till the coast was clear never you be adopted by rich folk penn he said in the cars or ill take n break this checkerboard over your head ef you forgit your name aginwhich is prattyou remember you belong with salters troop an set down right where you are till i come fer you dont go taggin araound after them whose eyes bung out with fatness accordin to scripcher    chapter x  but it was otherwise with the were heres silent cook for he came up his kit in a handkerchief and boarded the constance pay was no particular object and he did not in the least care where he slept his business as revealed to him in dreams was to follow harvey for the rest of his days they tried argument and at last persuasion but there is a difference between one cape breton and two alabama negroes and the matter was referred to cheyne by the cook and porter the millionaire only laughed he presumed harvey might need a bodyservant some day or other and was sure that one volunteer was worth five hirelings let the man stay therefore even though he called himself macdonald and swore in gaelic the car could go back to boston where if he were still of the same mind they would take him west  with the constance which in his heart of hearts he loathed departed the last remnant of cheynes millionairedom and he gave himself up to an energetic idleness this gloucester was a new town in a new land and he purposed to take it in as of old he had taken in all the cities from snohomish to san diego of that world whence he hailed they made money along the crooked street which was half wharf and half ships store as a leading professional he wished to learn how the noble game was played men said that four out of every five fishballs served at new englands sunday breakfast came from gloucester and overwhelmed him with figures in proofstatistics of boats gear wharffrontage capital invested salting packing factories insurance wages repairs and profits he talked with the owners of the large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men and whose crews were almost all swedes or portuguese then he conferred with disko one of the few who owned their craft and compared notes in his vast head he coiled himself away on chaincables in marine junkshops asking questions with cheerful unslaked western curiosity till all the waterfront wanted to know what in thunder that man was after anyhow he prowled into the mutual insurance rooms and demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the blackboard day by day and that brought down upon him secretaries of every fishermans widow and orphan aid society within the city limits they begged shamelessly each man anxious to beat the other institutions record and cheyne tugged at his beard and handed them all over to mrs cheyne  she was resting in a boardinghouse near eastern pointa strange establishment managed apparently by the boarders where the tablecloths were redandwhitecheckered and the population who seemed to have known one another intimately for years rose up at midnight to make welsh rarebits if it felt hungry on the second morning of her stay mrs cheyne put away her diamond solitaires before she came down to breakfast  theyre most delightful people she confided to her husband so friendly and simple too though they are all boston nearly  that isnt simpleness mama he said looking across the boulders behind the appletrees where the hammocks were slung its the other thing that wethat i havent got  it cant be said mrs cheyne quietly there isnt a woman here owns a dress that cost a hundred dollars why we  i know it dear we haveof course we have i guess its only the style they wear east are you having a good time  i dont see very much of harvey hes always with you but i aint near as nervous as i was  i havent had such a good time since willie died i never rightly understood that i had a son before this harves got to be a great boy anything i can fetch you dear cushion under your head well well go down to the wharf again and look around  harvey was his fathers shadow in those days and the two strolled along side by side cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his hand on the boys square shoulder it was then that harvey noticed and admired what had never struck him beforehis fathers curious power of getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street  how dyou make em tell you everything without opening your head demanded the son as they came out of a riggers loft  ive dealt with quite a few men in my time harve and one sizes em up somehow i guess i know something about myself too then after a pause as they sat down on a wharfedge men can most always tell when a man has handled things for himself and then they treat him as one of themselves  same as they treat me down at wouvermans wharf im one of the crowd now disko has told every one ive earned my pay harvey spread out his hands and rubbed the palms together theyre all soft again he said dolefully  keep em that way for the next few years while youre getting your education you can harden em up after  yees i suppose so was the reply in no delighted voice  it rests with you harve you can take cover behind your mama of course and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your highstrungness and all that kind of poppycock   have i ever done that said harvey uneasily  his father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand you know as well as i do that i cant make anything of you if you dont act straight by me i can handle you alone if youll stay alone but i dont pretend to manage both you and mama lifes too short anyway  dont make me out much of a fellow does it  i guess it was my fault a good deal but if you want the truth you havent been much of anything up to date now have you  umm disko thinks    say what dyou reckon its cost you to raise me from the startfirst last and all over  cheyne smiled ive never kept track but i should estimate in dollars and cents nearer fifty than forty thousand maybe sixty the young generation comes high it has to have things and it tires of em andthe old man foots the bill  harvey whistled but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his upbringing had cost so much and all thats sunk capital isnt it  invested harve invested i hope  making it only thirty thousand the thirty ive earned is about ten cents on the hundred thats a mighty poor catch harvey wagged his head solemnly  cheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water  disko has got a heap more than that out of dan since he was ten and dans at school half the year too  oh thats what youre after is it  no im not after anything im not stuck on myself any just nowthats all     i ought to be kicked  i cant do it old man or i would i presume if id been made that way  then id have remembered it to the last day i livedand never forgiven you said harvey his chin on his doubled fists  exactly thats about what id do you see  i see the faults with me and no one else all the samey somethings got to be done about it  cheyne drew a cigar from his vestpocket bit off the end and fell to smoking father and son were very much alike for the beard hid cheynes mouth and harvey had his fathers slightly aquiline nose closeset black eyes and narrow high cheekbones with a touch of brown paint he would have made up very picturesquely as a red indian of the storybooks  now you can go on from here said cheyne slowly costing me between six or eight thousand a year till youre a voter well well call you a man then you can go right on from that living on me to the tune of forty or fifty thousand besides what your mother will give you with a valet and a yacht or a fancyranch where you can pretend to raise trotting stock and play cards with your own crowd  like lorry tuck harvey put in  yep or the two de vitré boys or old man mcquades son californias full of em and heres an eastern sample while were talking  a shiny black steamyacht with mahogany deckhouse nickelplated binnacles and pinkandwhitestriped awnings puffed up the harbour flying the burgee of some new york club two young men in what they conceived to be sea costumes were playing cards by the saloon skylight and a couple of women with red and blue parasols looked on and laughed noisily  shouldnt care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze no beam said harvey critically as the yacht slowed to pick up her mooringbuoy  theyre having what stands them for a good time i can give you that and twice as much as that harve howd you like it  caesar thats no way to get a dinghy overside said harvey still intent on the yacht if i couldnt slip a tackle better than that id stay ashore    what if i dont  stay ashoreor what  yacht and ranch and live on the old man andget behind mama when theres trouble said harvey with a twinkle in his eye  why in that case you come right in with me my son  ten dollars a month another twinkle  not a cent more until youre worth it and you wont begin to touch that for a few years  id sooner begin sweeping out the officeisnt that how the big bugs startand touch something now than  i know it we all feel that way but i guess we can hire any sweeping we need i made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon  thirty million dollars worth o mistake wasnt it id risk it for that  i lost some and i gained some ill tell you  cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water and spoke away from harvey who presently began to be aware that his father was telling the story of his life he talked in a low even voice without gesture and without expression and it was a history for which a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many dollarsthe story of forty years that was at the same time the story of the new west whose story is yet to be written  it began with a kinless boy turned loose in texas and went on fantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life the scenes shifting from state after western state from cities that sprang up in a month and in a season utterly withered away to wild ventures in wilder camps that are now laborious paved municipalities it covered the building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth it told of steamers townships forests and mines and the men of every nation under heaven manning creating hewing and digging these it touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that could not see or missed by the merest accident of time and travel and through the mad shift of things sometimes on horseback more often afoot now rich now poor in and out and back and forth deckhand trainhand contractor boardinghouse keeper journalist engineer drummer realestate agent politician deadbeat rumseller mineowner speculator cattleman or tramp moved harvey cheyne alert and quiet seeking his own ends and so he said the glory and advancement of his country  he told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the ragged edge of despair the faith that comes of knowing men and things he enlarged as though he were talking to himself on his very great courage and resource at all times the thing was so evident in the mans mind that he never even changed his tone he described how he had bested his enemies or forgiven them exactly as they had bested or forgiven him in those careless days how he had entreated cajoled and bullied towns companies and syndicates all for their enduring good crawled round through or under mountains and ravines dragging a string and hoopiron railroad after him and in the end how he had sat still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his character to shreds  the tale held harvey almost breathless his head a little cocked to one side his eyes fixed on his fathers face as the twilight deepened and the red cigarend lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows it seemed to him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the darka mile between each glare of the opened firedoor but this locomotive could talk and the words shook and stirred the boy to the core of his soul at last cheyne pitched away the cigarbutt and the two sat in the dark over the lapping water  ive never told that to any one before said the father  harvey gasped its just the greatest thing that ever was said he  thats what i got now im coming to what i didnt get it wont sound much of anything to you but i dont wish you to be as old as i am before you find out i can handle men of course and im no fool along my own lines butbut i cant compete with the man who has been taught ive picked up as i went along and i guess it sticks out all over me  ive never seen it said the son indignantly  you will though harve you willjust as soon as youre through college dont i know it dont i know the look on mens faces when they think me aa mucker as they call it out here i can break them to little piecesyesbut i cant get back at em to hurt em where they live i dont say theyre way way up but i feel im way way way off somehow now youve got your chance youve got to soak up all the learning thats around and youll live with a crowd that are doing the same thing theyll be doing it for a few thousand dollars a year at most but remember youll be doing it for millions youll learn law enough to look after your own property when im out o the light and youll have to be solid with the best men in the market they are useful later and above all youll have to stow away the plain common sitdownwithyourchinonyourelbows booklearning nothing pays like that harve and its bound to pay more and more each year in our countryin business and in politics youll see  theres no sugar my end of the deal said harvey four years at college wish id chosen the valet and the yacht  never mind my son cheyne insisted youre investing your capital where itll bring in the best returns and i guess you wont find our property shrunk any when youre ready to take hold think it over and let me know in the morning hurry well be late for supper  as this was a business talk there was no need for harvey to tell his mother about it and cheyne naturally took the same point of view but mrs cheyne saw and feared and was a little jealous her boy who rode roughshod over her was gone and in his stead reigned a keenfaced youth abnormally silent who addressed most of his conversation to his father she understood it was business and therefore a matter beyond her premises if she had any doubts they were resolved when cheyne went to boston and brought back a new diamond marquisering  what have you two men been doing now she said with a weak little smile as she turned it in the light  talkingjust talking mama theres nothing mean about harvey  there was not the boy had made a treaty on his own account railroads he explained gravely interested him as little as lumber real estate or mining what his soul yearned after was control of his fathers newly purchased sailingships if that could be promised him within what he conceived to be a reasonable time he for his part guaranteed diligence and sobriety at college for four or five years in vacation he was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the linehe had asked not more than two thousand questions about itfrom his fathers most private papers in the safe to the tug in san francisco harbour  its a deal said cheyne at the last youll alter your mind twenty times before you leave college o course but if you take hold of it in proper shape and if you dont tie it up before youre twentythree ill make the thing over to you hows that harve  nope never pays to split up a going concern theres too much competition in the world anyway and disko says bloodkin hev to stick together his crowd never go back on him thats one reason he says why they make such big fares say the were here goes off to the georges on monday they dont stay long ashore do they  well we ought to be going too i guess ive left my business hung up at loose ends between two oceans and its time to connect again i just hate to do it though havent had a holiday like this for twenty years  we cant go without seeing disko off said harvey and mondays memorial day lets stay over that anyway  what is this memorial business they were talking about it at the boardinghouse said cheyne weakly he too was not anxious to spoil the golden days  well as far as i can make out this business is a sort of songanddance act whacked up for the summer boarders disko dont think much of it he says because they take up a collection for the widows and orphans diskos independent havent you noticed that  wellyes a little in spots is it a town show then  the summer convention is they read out the names of the fellows drowned or gone astray since last time and they make speeches and recite and all then disko says the secretaries of the aid societies go into the back yard and fight over the catch the real show he says is in the spring the ministers all take a hand then and there arent any summer boarders around  i see said cheyne with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of one born into and bred up to city pride well stay over for memorial day and get off in the afternoon  guess ill go down to diskos and make him bring his crowd up before they sail ill have to stand with them of course  oh thats it is it said cheyne im only a poor summer boarder and  youre  a bankerfullblooded banker harvey called back as he boarded a trolley and cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future  disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for charity but harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost so far as he was concerned if the were heres absented themselves then disko made conditions he had heardit was astonishing how all the world knew all the worlds business along the waterfronthe had heard that a philadelphia actresswoman was going to take part in the exercises and he mistrusted that she would deliver skipper iresons ride personally he had as little use for actresses as for summer boarders but justice was justice and though he himself here dan giggled had once slipped up on a matter of judgment this thing must not be so harvey came back to east gloucester and spent half a day explaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she contemplated and she admitted that it was justice even as disko had said  cheyne knew by old experience what would happen but anything of the nature of a public palaver was meat and drink to the mans soul he saw the trolleys hurrying west in the hot hazy morning full of women in light summer dresses and whitefaced strawhatted men fresh from boston desks the stack of bicycles outside the postoffice the comeandgo of busy officials greeting one another the slow flick and swash of bunting in the heavy air and the important man with a hose sluicing the brick sidewalk  mother he said suddenly dont you rememberafter seattle was burned outand they got her going again  mrs cheyne nodded and looked critically down the crooked street like her husband she understood these gatherings all the west over and compared them one against another the fishermen began to mingle with the crowd about the townhall doorsbluejowled portuguese their women bareheaded or shawled for the most part cleareyed nova scotians and men of the maritime provinces french italians swedes and danes with outside crews of coasting schooners and everywhere women in black who saluted one another with a gloomy pride for this was their day of great days and there were ministers of many creedspastors of great giltedged congregations at the seaside for a rest with shepherds of the regular workfrom the priests of the church on the hill to bushbearded exsailor lutherans hailfellow with the men of a score of boats there were owners of lines of schooners large contributors to the societies and small men their few craft pawned to the mastheads with bankers and marineinsurance agents captains of tugs and waterboats riggers fitters lumpers salters boatbuilders and coopers and all the mixed population of the waterfront  they drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the summer boarders and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired till he shone all over with pure civic pride cheyne had met him for five minutes a few days before and between the two there was entire understanding  well mr cheyne and what dyou think of our cityyes madam you can sit anywhere you pleaseyou have this kind of thing out west i presume  yes but we arent as old as you  thats so of course you ought to have been at the exercises when we celebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday i tell you mr cheyne the old city did herself credit  so i heard it pays too whats the matter with the town that it dont have a firstclass hotel though  right over there to the left pedro heaps o room for you and your crowdwhy thats what i tell em all the time mr cheyne theres big money in it but i presume that dont affect you any what we want is  a heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder and the flushed skipper of a portland coalandice coaster spun him half round what in thunder do you fellows mean by clappin the law on the town when all decent men are at sea this way heh towns drys a bone an smells a sight worse sence i quit might ha left us one saloon for soft drinks anyway  dont seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning carsen ill go into the politics of it later sit down by the door and think over your arguments till i come back  what goods arguments to me in miquelon champagnes eighteen dollars a case and the skipper lurched into his seat as an organprelude silenced him  our new organ said the official proudly to cheyne cost us four thousand dollars too well have to get back to highlicence next year to pay for it i wasnt going to let the ministers have all the religion at their convention those are some of our orphans standing up to sing my wife taught em see you again later mr cheyne im wanted on the platform  high clear and true childrens voices bore down the last noise of those settling into their places  o all ye works of the lord bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  the women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated cadences filled the air mrs cheyne with some others began to breathe short she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the world and instinctively searched for harvey he had found the were heres at the back of the audience and was standing as by right between dan and disko uncle salters returned the night before with penn from pamlico sound received him suspiciously  haint your folk gone yet he grunted what are you doin here young feller  o ye seas and floods bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  haint he good right said dan hes bin there same as the rest of us  not in them clothes salters snarled  shut your head salters said disko your biles gone back on you stay right where ye are harve  then up and spoke the orator of the occasion another pillar of the municipality bidding the world welcome to gloucester and incidentally pointing out wherein gloucester excelled the rest of the world then he turned to the seawealth of the city and spoke of the price that must be paid for the yearly harvest they would hear later the names of their lost deadone hundred and seventeen of them the widows stared a little and looked at one another here gloucester could not boast any overwhelming mills or factories her sons worked for such wage as the sea gave and they all knew that neither georges nor the banks were cowpastures the utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help the widows and the orphans and after a few general remarks he took this opportunity of thanking in the name of the city those who had so publicspiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the occasion  i jest despise the beggin pieces in it growled disko it dont give folk a fair notion of us  ef folk wont be forehanded an put by when theyve the chance returned salters it stands in the nature o things they hev to be shamed you take warnin by that young feller riches endureth but for a season ef you scatter them araound on lugsuries  but to lose everythingeverything said penn what can you do then once ithe watery blue eyes stared up and down as looking for something to steady themonce i readin a book i thinkof a boat where every one was run downexcept some oneand he said to me  shucks said salters cutting in you read a little less an take more intrust in your vittles and youll come nearer earnin your keep penn  harvey jammed among the fishermen felt a creepy crawly tingling thrill that began in the back of his neck and ended at his boots he was cold too though it was a stifling day  that the actress from philadelphia said disko troop scowling at the platform youve fixed it about old man ireson haint ye harve ye know why naow  it was not iresons ride that the woman delivered but some sort of poem about a fishingport called brixham and a fleet of trawlers beating in against storm by night while the women made a guiding fire at the head of the quay with everything they could lay hands on    they took the grandams blanket   who shivered and bade them go   they took the babys cradle   who could not say them no  whew said dan peering over long jacks shoulder thats great must ha bin expensive though  groundhog case said the galway man badly lighted port danny    and knew not all the while   if they were lighting a bonfire   or only a funeral pile  the wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings and when she told how the drenched crews were flung ashore living and dead and they carried the bodies to the glare of the fires asking child is this your father or wife is this your man you could hear hard breathing all over the benches    and when the boats of brixham   go out to face the gales   think of the love that travels   like light upon their sails   there was very little applause when she finished the women were looking for their handkerchiefs and many of the men stared at the ceiling with shiny eyes  hm said salters that ud cost ye a dollar to hear at any theatermaybe two some folk i presoom can afford it seems downright waste to me    naow how in jerusalem did cap bart edwardes strike adrift here  no keepin him under said an eastport man behind hes a poet an hes baound to say his piece comes from daown aour way too  he did not say that captain b edwardes had striven for five consecutive years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own composition on gloucester memorial day an amused and exhausted committee had at last given him his desire the simplicity and utter happiness of the old man as he stood up in his very best sunday clothes won the audience ere he opened his mouth they sat unmurmuring through sevenandthirty hatchetmade verses describing at fullest length the loss of the schooner joan hasken off the georges in the gale of 1867 and when he came to an end they shouted with one kindly throat  a farsighted boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and an interview with the author so that earth had nothing more to offer captain bart edwardes exwhaler shipwright masterfisherman and poet in the seventythird year of his age  naow i call that sensible said an eastport man ive bin over that graound with his writin jest as he read it in my two hands and i can testify that hes got it all in  if dan here couldnt do bettern that with one hand before breakfast he ought to be switched said salters upholding the honour of massachusetts on general principles not but what im free to own hes considerable litteryfer maine still  guess uncle salterss goin to die this trip fust compliment hes ever paid me dan sniggered whats wrong with you harve you act all quiet and you look greenish feelin sick  dont know whats the matter with me harvey replied seems if my insides were too big for my outsides im all crowded up and shivery  dispepsy pshawtoo bad well wait for the readin an then well quit an catch the tide  the widowsthey were nearly all of that seasons makingbraced themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood for they knew what was coming the summerboarder girls in pink and blue shirtwaists stopped tittering over captain edwardess wonderful poem and looked back to see why all was silent the fishermen pressed forward as that town official who had talked with cheyne bobbed up on the platform and began to read the years list of losses dividing them into months last septembers casualties were mostly single men and strangers but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall  september 9thschooner florrie anderson lost with all aboard off the georges reuben pitman master 50 single main street city emil olsen 19 single 329 hammond street city denmark oscar stanberg single 25 sweden carl stanberg single 28 main street city pedro supposed madeira single keenes

cheyne who had been listening with wideopened eyes threw up her head and choked dans mother a few seats to the right saw and heard and quickly moved to her side the reading went on by the time they reached the january and february wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast and the widows drew breath between their teeth  february 14thschooner harry randolph dismasted on the way home from newfoundland asa musie married 32 main street city lost overboard  february 23dschooner gilbert hope went astray in dory robert beavon 29 married native of pubnico nova scotia   but his wife was in the hall they heard a low cry as though a little animal had been hit it was stifled at once and a girl staggered out of the hail she had been hoping against hope for months because some who have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by deepsea sailingships now she had her certainty and harvey could see the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her its fifty cents to the depotthe driver began but the policeman held up his handbut im goin there anyway jump right in look at here alf you dont pull me next time my lamps aint lit see  the sidedoor closed on the patch of

come she shouldnt ha come said long jack with a cluck of pity dont scrowge harve grunted dan harvey heard that much but the rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels disko leaned forward and spoke to his wife where she sat with one arm round mrs cheyne and the other holding down the snatching catching ringed hands  lean your head daownright daown she whispered itll go off in a minute  i caant i dodont oh let me mrs cheyne did not at all know what she said  you must mrs troop repeated your boys jest fainted dead away they do that some when theyre gettin their growth wish to tend to him we can git aout this side quite quiet you come right along with me psha my dear were both women i guess we must tend to aour menfolk come  the were heres promptly went through the crowd as a bodyguard and it was a very white and shaken harvey that they propped up on a bench in an anteroom  favours his ma was mrs troops only comment as the mother bent over her boy  how dyou suppose he could ever stand it she cried indignantly to cheyne who had said nothing at all it was horriblehorrible we shouldnt have come its wrong and wicked itit isnt right whywhy couldnt they put these things in the papers where they belong are you better darling  that made harvey very properly ashamed oh im all right i guess he said struggling to his feet with a broken giggle must ha been something i ate for breakfast  coffee perhaps said cheyne whose face was all in hard lines as though it had been cut out of bronze we wont go back again  guess twould be baouts well to git daown to the wharf said disko its close in along with them dagoes an the fresh air will fresh mrs cheyne up  harvey announced that he never felt better in his life but it was not till he saw the were here fresh from the lumpers hands at wouvermans wharf that he lost his alloverish feelings in a queer mixture of pride and sorrowfulness other peoplesummer boarders and suchlikeplayed about in catboats or looked at the sea from pierheads but he understood things from the insidemore things than he could begin to think about none the less he could have sat down and howled because the little schooner was going off mrs cheyne simply cried and cried every step of the way and said most extraordinary things to mrs troop who babied her till dan who had not been babied since he was six whistled aloud  and so the old crowdharvey felt like the most ancient of marinersdropped into the old schooner among the battered dories while harvey slipped the sternfast from the pierhead and they slid her along the wharfside with their hands every one wanted to say so much that no one said anything in particular harvey bade dan take care of uncle salterss seaboots and penns doryanchor and long jack entreated harvey to remember his lessons in seamanship but the jokes fell flat in the presence of the two women and it is hard to be funny with green harbourwater widening between good friends  up jib and foresl shouted disko getting to the wheel as the wind took her see you later harve dunno but i come near thinkin a heap o you an your folks  then she glided beyond earshot and they sat down to watch her up the harbour and still mrs cheyne wept  psha my dear said mrs troop were both women i guess likes not itll ease your heart to hev your cry aout god he knows it never done me a mite o good but then he knows ive had something to cry fer  now it was a few years later and upon the other edge of america that a young man came through the clammy seafog up a windy street which is flanked with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone to him as he was standing by a hammered iron gate entered on horsebackand the horse would have been cheap at a thousand dollarsanother young man and this is what

of the fog to take the horses bridle he allowed no one but himself to attend to any of harveys wants  thick as the banks aint it doctor said dan propitiatingly  but the coalblack celt with the secondsight did not see fit to reply till he had tapped dan on the shoulder and for the twentieth time croaked the old old prophecy in his ear  masterman manmaster said he you remember dan troop what
